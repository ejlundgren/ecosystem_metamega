AB  - With the rapid expansion of increased energy consumption, the issue of air pollution comes to be increasingly critical. It is essential to achieve accurate PM2.5 concentration prediction for people's health and lives. Therefore, a multi-factor PM2.5 concentration optimization prediction model based on circulatory system based optimization (CSBO), variational mode decomposition (VMD), gated recurrent unit optimized by quantile regression (QRGRU), mountain gazelle optimizer (MGO) and least square support vector machine (LSSVM), named CSBO-VMD-QRGRUMGO-LSSVM, is proposed. Firstly, RFECV is utilized to discover the optimal feature subset with the strongest relationship with PM2.5 concentration. Secondly, variational mode decomposition optimized by circulatory system based optimization, named CSBO-VMD, is proposed. CSBO-VMD is utilized to decompose PM2.5 concentration adaptively into a restricted number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, gated recurrent unit optimized by quantile regression, named QRGRU, and least squares support vector machine optimized by mountain gazelle optimizer, named MGO-LSSVM, are proposed. The decomposed components IMFs and optimal feature subsets are predicted by QRGRU and MGO-LSSVM to generate the integrated prediction results of QRGRU and MGO-LSSVM, respectively. Finally, the prediction results of QRGRU and MGOLSSVM are assigned weights by the inverse root mean square error blending to obtain the final prediction results. Considering the geographical location, population density and pollution risk, PM2.5 concentration in Beijing, Shenyang, Xi'an and Urumqi are predicted to demonstrate the efficiency and universality of the proposed model. As demonstrated by the results, the proposed model has the greatest prediction precision and effectiveness.

AB  - The authors report isotopic data from ravens from Pavlovian (29,000-25,000 yr bp) archaeological sites that indicate ravens were consuming the same range of foods as commensal humans at the sites, which the authors refer to as 'incipient synanthropism'.
   The earlier Gravettian of Southern Moravia-the Pavlovian-is notable for the many raven bones (Corvus corax) documented in its faunal assemblages. On the basis of the rich zooarchaeological and settlement data from the Pavlovian, previous work suggested that common ravens were attracted by human domestic activities and subsequently captured by Pavlovian people, presumably for feathers and perhaps food. Here, we report independent & delta;N-15, & delta;C-13 and & delta;S-34 stable isotope data obtained from 12 adult ravens from the Pavlovian key sites of Predmosti I, Pavlov I and Dolni Vestonice I to test this idea. We show that Pavlovian ravens regularly fed on larger herbivores and especially mammoths, aligning in feeding preferences with contemporaneous Gravettian foragers. We argue that opportunistic-generalist ravens were encouraged by human settlement and carcass provisioning. Our data may thus provide surprisingly early evidence for incipient synanthropism among Palaeolithic ravens. We suggest that anthropogenic manipulation of carrion supply dynamics furnished unique contexts for the emergence of human-oriented animal behaviours, in turn promoting novel human foraging opportunities-dynamics which are therefore important for understanding early hunter-gatherer ecosystem impacts.

AB  - While hormones such as testosterone are known to drive reproduction and sexually selected traits in many species, research demonstrating a relationship between testosterone and annual or overall reproductive success is sparse. We sought to directly measure how circulating testosterone relates to sexually selected characteristics and reproductive success in a freely breeding population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginanus). We captured individuals during September-March annually from 2007 to 2017 and investigated the association between testosterone and antler size, body size, and annual reproductive success for individuals. We also assessed lifetime patterns from individuals captured multiple years. We found a positive relationship between testosterone and body size, and between testosterone and antler size. However, we found a significant interaction between testosterone and age for both body size and antler size response variables, indicating that as age increases, the aforementioned positive relationships with testosterone diminish. Thus, for deer >= 6.5 years of age, testosterone is negatively related to body and antler size. In contrast, annual reproductive success, measured by number of offspring sired and recruited into the breeding population, was positively associated with antler size and body size, but not testosterone, age, or an interaction between testosterone and age. Instead, while an individual's average lifetime testosterone had no relationship with overall reproductive success, greater variation in lifetime testosterone was positively related to overall reproductive success. Thus, while we found no significant association between testosterone and annual reproductive success directly, testosterone may be indirectly related to reproductive success through its positive association with antler and body size. Furthermore, understanding how testosterone may fluctuate throughout an individual's lifetime may offer new perspectives in understanding variation in individual reproductive success.

AB  - Sperm cryopreservation maintains the diversities of porcine genetic resources and improves utilization efficiency of boar semen in artificial insemination practices. Freezability of boar semen presents remarkable differences among individuals. However, metabolic markers for boar semen freezability in both sperm and seminal plasma largely remain unknown. The present study thus aims to determine differences in metabolites of sperm and seminal plasma between poor (PF) and good (GF) freezability semen from a Chinese native pig and screen potential markers for semen freezability. A total of 72,048 metabolites in sperm and 66,551 metabolites in seminal plasma were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. The proportion of lipid molecules among all metab-olites in both sperm and seminal plasma was the maximum regardless of negative or positive mode. Furthermore, we identified 21 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) in sperm and 185 DEMs in seminal plasma between PF and GF group. Additionally, clustering analysis showed that DEMs in sperm and seminal plasma exhibited significant changes between PF and GF group. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that DEMs in sperm were mainly enriched in metabolic pathways of amino acids and caffeine. DEMs in seminal plasma were associated with AMPK and cAMP signaling pathways. Taken together, these results demonstrate that sperm and seminal plasma of native pigs present differential metabolome between PF and GF semen. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim was to determine, for the first time, concentrations of 7 neonicotinoids (NEOs) and 5 metabolites in Sus scrofa from hunting areas in north-eastern Poland and assess the risk to consumers eating boar meat. 42 wild boar muscle samples were collected over a one-year period. The concentrations of 12 NEOs were determined by a fully validated LC-ESI-MS/MS protocol based on ultrasonic, freezing and cleanup EMRelipid sample preparation. NEOs were present in over 83% of samples, 17% had no residue, and one pesticide was present in 36% of samples. Most often found were: clothianidin (35%), acetamiprid and imidacloprid (33%), thiacloprid (31%), thiamethoxam 9%), and the average concentrations were (ng g(-1)): thiacloprid 6.2 > imidacloprid 5.7 > acetamiprid 4.6 > clothianidin 2.2 > thiacloprid 1.6 > thiamethoxam 1.0. Multi-residue samples were found, one with 7 and one with 5 NEOs. Two NEOs were present in 24%; 3 in 39% and 4 in 10% of samples. In the metabolic degradation of acetamiprid, imidacloprid and thiacloprid, it was observed that metabolites account for no more than 8.5% of the measured parent substance. Acetamiprid-n-desmethyl was noted most often (21%). Due to the detection of NEOs in a large proportion of samples, chronic and acute risk assessment were performed. The estimated chronic and acute risk for consumers from NEOs neonicotinoids through the consumption of wild boar was very low and amounted to respectively 0.02% of ADI and 0.86% of ARfD.

AB  - Despite the known deleterious effects lead exposure can have on humans, lead remains the most common type of ammunition used to harvest big game and upland game birds. We sampled wild turkey Meleagris gallopavo breast muscle shot with standard lead and copper-plated lead pellets to quantify lead residue concentrations within the wound channel, and we sampled multiple adjacent locations to measure the extent lead contamination spreads through tissue of harvested turkeys. We found that samples taken from the wound channel contained more lead (mean = 3.76 mu g/g dry weight) than both samples taken adjacent to the wound channel (mean = 0.20 mu g/g dry weight) and samples taken from >5 cm away (mean = 0.15 mu g/g dry weight). Additionally, we found that birds harvested with standard lead ammunition did not differ in lead concentrations from those shot with copper-plated lead, suggesting that copper plating does not aid in reducing lead exposure. Our findings suggest that wild turkeys harvested with either lead or copper-plated lead shot have the potential to expose consumers, especially children due to their lower tolerance, to low levels of lead that could exceed daily consumption limits set by the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control. However, elevated lead levels were confined to the wound channel, and thus proper preparation of game to remove tissue surrounding wound channels may eliminate or substantially reduce lead exposure from harvested game birds.

AB  - To assess feeding ecology and diet preferences of common warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus (Gmelin, 1788), the study was conducted in Gassi Controlled Area (GCHA) and in Haro Aba Diko Controlled Hunting Area (HADCHA) from May 2017 to June 2018. Diet composition of common warthog was determined using feeding quadrat and microhistological methods. From the leaf cuticle fragments observed of feces, 41 and 45 plant species were recognized as annual dietary components of common warthog in GCHA and HADCHA, respectively. Uncertainty of epidermal fragments and fine digestion, led certain forage species consumed by warthogs to be unidentified. In Gassi Controlled Hunting Area, Cynodon nlemfuensis (75.5%), Cynodon dactylon (69%), and Cyperus fischerianus (47%) had the higher relative frequency occurrence (RFO) in the feces of the animal during the wet season. In Haro Aba Diko Controlled Hunting Area, C. nlemfuensis (76.5%), C. dactylon (73.5%) and H. rufa (57.5%) were the top three forage species with higher RFO in the feces of the warthog during the dry season. During the wet season in GCHA, C. fischerianus, D. abyssinica, C. dactylon, C. nlemfuensis, Hyparrhenia rufa, A. abyssinicus, Sesbania sesban and Diplolophium africanum were identified as the staple forage species of common warthogs. In HADCHA, C. fischerianus, D. abyssinica, C. dactylon, C. nlemfuensis, H. rufa, H. hirta, S. poiretiana, A. abyssinicus, and S. sesban were identified as the staple forage species of warthogs during the wet season. In GCHAC. dactylon, C. nlemfuensis and A. abyssinicus were the top three species which showed high acceptability during the wet and dry seasons. Hyparrhenia hirta, was high acceptability during the wet season which was less acceptability during the dry season but the difference was not significant. In HADCHA C. fischerianus, D. abyssinica, C. dactylon, and C. nlemfuensis, showed high acceptability during both seasons. Therefore, common warthogs foraged on wide range of food resources of graminoids, forbs, and shrubs in the study areas. Certain staple forage species were frequently preferred, because of their compatibility with the physiology of warthogs.

AB  - Laboratory studies show that increased physiological burden during development results in cognitive impairment. In the wild, animals experience a wide range of developmental conditions, and it is critical to understand how variation in such conditions affects cognitive abilities later in life, especially in species that strongly depend on such abilities for survival. We tested whether variation in developmental condition is associated with differences in spatial cognitive abilities in wild food-caching mountain chickadees. Using tail feathers grown during development in juvenile birds, we measured feather corticosterone (Cort(f)) levels and growth rates and tested these birds during their first winter on two spatial learning tasks. In only 1 of the 3 years, higher feather Cort(f) was negatively associated with memory acquisition. No significant associations between feather Cort(f) and any other measurement of spatial cognition were detected in the other 2 years of the study or between feather growth rate and any measurement of cognition during the entire study. Our results suggest that in the wild, naturally existing variation in developmental condition has only a limited effect on spatial cognitive abilities, at least in a food-caching species. This suggests that there may be compensatory mechanisms to buffer specialized cognitive abilities against developmental perturbations.

AB  - . Over several decades, air temperature and sea surface temperature (SST) have increased in the northeastern Pacific, as has the frequency of large-scale warm anomalies in SST. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of these warm anomalies on the production of northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris; NES) pups from the colony of the San Benito Archipelago, located in the central-western region of the Baja California Peninsula. Pup and adult female counts from the 2002 to 2019 breeding seasons were compiled to determine the trend in the abundance of the colony and its current state. In addition, birth rate variations during the study period were assessed. Likewise, the presence of warm anomaly events in the SST in the potential foraging area of adult females (PFA) was analyzed. The San Benito colony decreased at an average annual rate of 3.6% from 2002 to 2019, with an estimated abundance of 4,723 individuals (95% CI: 3,821-5,615) in 2019. However, the birth rate remained constant (mean 0.68 & PLUSMN; 0.08), even though several warm anomaly events associated with El Nino and The Blob phenomena were detected in the PFA. Our results suggest that large-scale warm anomalies in the SST do not severely impact NES pup production, thus the decline of the San Benito colony since the late 1900s could be due to other environmental factors, such as the increase in air temperature associated with climate change.

AB  - Simple Summary The stomach is one of the primary sites for the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Quantifying related gene expression patterns using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is conducive to further understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying nutrition metabolism in the yak stomach. The authenticity of RT-qPCR data is affected by the selection of reference genes. Unfortunately, no studies have demonstrated suitable reference genes for the normalization of RT-qPCR data in the yak stomach. In this study, 15 candidate reference genes (CRGs) were identified according to transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) results and the previous literature. Five algorithms were used to evaluate the stability of the CRGs across the entire developmental stage in the yak stomach. RPS15, MRPL39, and RPS23 were found to be the most stable genes in the yak stomach from birth to adulthood. This study indicates the appropriate reference genes for gene expression analysis via RT-qPCR in the yak stomach. Efficient nutritional assimilation and energy metabolism in the stomachs of yaks contribute to their adaption to harsh environments. Accurate gene expression profile analysis will help further reveal the molecular mechanism of nutrient and energy metabolism in the yak stomach. RT-qPCR is regarded as an accurate and dependable method for analyzing gene expression. The selection of reference genes is essential to obtain meaningful RT-qPCR results, especially in longitudinal gene expression studies of tissues and organs. Our objective was to select and validate optimal reference genes from across the transcriptome as internal controls for longitudinal gene expression studies in the yak stomach. In this study, 15 candidate reference genes (CRGs) were determined according to transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) results and the previous literature. The expression levels of these 15 CRGs were quantified using RT-qPCR in the yak stomach, including the rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum at five stages: 0 days, 20 days, 60 days, 15 months and three years old (adult). Subsequently, the expression stabilities of these 15 CRGs were evaluated via four algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and the comparative C-T method. Furthermore, RefFinder was employed to obtain a comprehensive ranking of the stability of CRGs. The analysis results indicate that RPS15, MRPL39 and RPS23 are the most stable genes in the yak stomach throughout the growth cycle. In addition, to verify the reliability of the selected CRGs, the relative expression levels of HMGCS2 were quantified via RT-qPCR using the three most stable or the three least stable CRGs. Overall, we recommend combining RPS15, MRPL39 and RPS23 as reference genes for the normalization of RT-qPCR data in the yak stomach throughout the growth cycle.

AB  - Biological invasions are considered a significant challenge both from an ecological and economical perspective. Compared to the native range, environmental conditions in the invasive range often favor more competitive genotypes. Little attention, however, has so far been paid to the possibility that these invasive and competitive genotypes might also be back-introduced into a species' native range, where they could trigger a problematic increase in abundance or expansion. The frequency with which this occurs in the species ' native range might be an underestimated aspect in nature conservation. We transplanted native and invasive individuals of the biennial model species Jacobaea vulgaris into field sites of naturally occurring populations within the species' native range. The aim was to test whether back-introduced invasive origins show decreased performance, e.g., because of the reunion with specialized herbivores or plant-soil-feedbacks or whether they have the potential to trigger problematic population dynamics in the species' native range. We ran an additional greenhouse experiment to specifically address soil-borne effects in the species' native habitats. We found that invasive individuals generally outperformed the native transplants if compared in the field sites. By contrast, there were no origin-dependent differences in the greenhouse experiment. Our findings clearly indicate that testing for origin effects exclusively under controlled conditions might underestimate the potential of invasive genotypes to trigger invasion processes in habitats of the species' native range. Although differences in performance mediated by soil-borne effects were not associated with plant origin, field site susceptibility to J. vulgaris colonization varied largely. Identifying the exact factors driving these differences, offers another focal point to minimize the risk of a detrimental increase in the abundance or expansion of this highly invasive species in its home range.

AB  - Palaeoecological studies on South American mastodons using stable isotopes from isolated teeth indicate variable diets, but represent only a short portion of the total lifetime of the studied individuals. Here is presented an analysis of the carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope ratios on three molariforms (m1, m2 and m3) from the jaw of a sub-adult mastodon found in southern Brazil, aimed at understanding its long-term feeding habits. The individual died at about similar to 26-30 years of age, and the isotopic signal recorded in each tooth spans up to similar to 3-5 years based on estimates of tooth development from enamel thickness, but apparently there were significant temporal gaps (>5 years) between the mineralisation of each tooth. The 6180 did not vary significantly between the teeth, but the more positive delta 13C in the m1 indicates a diet with higher proportion (>30%) of C4 plants, whereas the m2 and m3 indicate considerably less (<20%) C4 plants ingested. This diet shift could have been the result of ontogenetic development, migration, or some disturbance in plant communities driven by environmental stresses. The results indicate that mastodons were able to change their diets at shorter timescales than can be addressed from the analysis of isolated teeth.

AB  - Parasites can have large impacts on host populations, but the extent to which parasite dynamics impact or respond to multi-species community structure remains uncertain. Empirical and theoretical studies within the host-microbiome feedback framework (often called plant-soil feedback) has provided strong evidence of the importance of soil pathogens to plant community structure and function. We adapt this framework to herd animals by extending the mathematics of host-microbiome feedback theory to accommodate increased likelihood of exposure to microbiomes from conspecific hosts rather than heterospecific hosts. We then integrate this framework with a model of interguild frequency dependence. Coupling this model with empirical observations, we estimate the host-specific fitness of gastro-intestinal nematodes living on ungulate species of Western USA. We find evidence that host-specific differences in nematode fitness could generate negative feedback on host fitness and contribute to coexistence of ungulates. Moreover, we find that this is more likely to be the case for pairs of ungulate species with high habitat overlap. If nematodes can indeed drive such negative feedbacks, then negative impacts of nematodes on their ungulate hosts should decline, i.e., be diluted, with increasing host diversity. While more work is necessary to confirm the underlying assumptions driving these conclusions, our work highlights the possibility that parasites play under appreciated roles in structuring animal communities.

AB  - ContextMalignant ovine theileriosis is a tick-borne disease of sheep and goats, caused by protozoan Theileria lestoquardi. The disease has serious economic implications for small ruminant production around the world.MethodsAn outbreak of malignant ovine theileriosis in a sheep flock was investigated from Hisar district of Haryana, India, in March 2022. The etiological agent was identified using polymerase chain reaction assay with genus specific primers targeting 18S rRNA gene and subsequently confirmed by sequencing.ResultsThe morbidity, mortality and case fatality rate reported in the outbreak were 22.2, 18.8 and 85%, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis clustered the present study T. lestoquardi isolate in the same clade with T. lestoquardi from Iraq, Iran and Pakistan with maximum nucleotide identity of 99.37% with strains from Iraq. The tick vector Hyalomma anatolicum recovered from dead animals was implicated in the disease's transmission.ConclusionsMalignant ovine theileriosis resulted in high case fatality rate. This study presents the first molecularly confirmed outbreak of malignant ovine theileriosis outbreak in the North Indian region, with characteristic post-mortem findings.

AB  - Stress experienced during ontogeny can have profound effects on the adult phenotype. However, stress can also be experienced intergenerationally, where an offspring's phenotype can be moulded by stress experienced by the parents. Although early-life and intergenerational stress can alter anatomy, physiology, and behaviour, nothing is known about how these stress contexts interact to affect the neural phenotype. Here, we examined how early-life and intergenerational stress affect the brain in eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus). Some lizard populations co-occur with predatory fire ants, and stress from fire ant attacks exerts intergenerational physiological and behavioural changes in lizards. However, it is unclear if intergenerational stress, or the interaction between intergenerational and early-life stress, modulates the brain. To test this, we captured gravid females from fire ant invaded and uninvaded populations, and subjected offspring to three early-life stress treatments: (1) fire ant attack, (2) corticosterone, or (3) a control. Corticosterone and fire ant attack decreased some aspects of the neural phenotype while population of origin and the interaction of early-life stress and population had no effects on the brain. These results suggest that early-life stressors may better predict adult brain variation than intergenerational stress in this species.

AB  - Plants use extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) as indirect defence mechanisms against herbivores. These structures contain nectar that is offered to ants in exchange for their protection. EFNs display pronounced functional variation, but it is unknown how this variation comes together in phenotypes. Here, we characterized the main functional traits of EFNs and investigated the associations among them. This work was conducted at a study site in the Caatinga that hosts 14 species of woody plants. We characterized the following functional traits: EFN type, position, arrangement, size, and reducing-sugar level. We observed a marked degree of trait variation (similar to 30%) that was manifested in species-specific trait combinations, giving rise to an 'ecological spectrum'. At one end were Fabaceae species with large, vascularized EFNs that occur individually on the leaf petiole and/or rachis and that produce high levels of reducing sugars. At the other end were Euphorbiaceae species with small, nonvascularized EFNs that are generally grouped on the leaf blade and that produce low levels of reducing sugars. Despite its limited geographical and phylogenetic scale, this study represents an important first step in describing an ecological spectrum that can inform our understanding of the ecological interactions and evolutionary history of this functionally relevant group of plants.

AB  - Herbivorous insects are the main consumers in forest ecosystems, and the complexity of trophic interactions varies with resource availability, heterogeneity among feeding guilds and the presence of natural enemies. In this study, we examined tri-trophic interactions in Nothofagus pumilio (Fagales: Nothofagaceae) Poepp. & Endl. Krasser forests in southern South America. Specifically, we focused on the effect of nitrogen addition and a drought event on levels of insect herbivory by different feeding guilds and the rate of parasitism on leaf miners throughout the growing season (middle and late). Nitrogen (N) addition increased the foliar nitrogen content but had no effect on total damage by arboreal insects. However, the different feeding guilds responded differently to nitrogen addition, and these responses varied between average or dry year and within the growing season. Particularly, miner activity responded positively to nitrogen addition, increasing their incidence towards the late season of the average year. The positive effect of nitrogen addition on miner activity did not cascade up to the trophic level of parasitoids, which varied with the climatic context and the growing season. These results suggest that tri-trophic interactions were mainly controlled by the climatic context, since consumers and their natural enemy responses were more dependent on the climatic context and growing seasons than on plant quality. Overall, we highlight the role of fluctuating abiotic resources and the heterogeneity within each trophic level in structuring tri-trophic interactions in forest ecosystems.

AB  - The Mekong River is one of the most biodiverse, productive rivers in the world, supporting more than 1000 fish species and the livelihoods of tens of millions of people. The spatial dynamics and population status of many Mekong fish species, especially megafishes, are poorly understood. Therefore, this information is rarely incorporated into environmental risk assessments for large infrastructure projects, such as mainstream hydropower developments, which have been accelerating rapidly in the Mekong Basin. In this study, we present initial findings from the ongoing, collaborative, transnational acoustic telemetry monitoring of nearly 300 tagged fishes representing 27 species, which yield important insights into the potential impacts that proposed hydropower dams would have on populations of ecologically and economically important fish species. Included in these data are more than ten months of hydrophone records tracking the location of a 300 kg giant freshwater stingray, Urogymnus polylepis (Bleeker, 1852), currently the world's largest known freshwater fish, used to detect its migration behavior and distribution patterns. The telemetry data, combined with fisher surveys used to gather local ecological knowledge, provide evidence that the proposed dams would fragment the existing populations of this iconic species as well as those of other fish species that support river food web balance and local food systems. Furthermore, the existence of giant freshwater stringray populations and other unique megafauna reinforces the universal natural heritage value of the stretch of the Mekong River between the Lao People's Democratic Republic/Cambodia border and the city of Kratie. This stretch of river is located between two proposed megadams, the 900 MW Stung Treng Dam and the 2300 MW Sambor Dam. However, the Cambodian Ministry of Environment has also proposed this area for designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (Biosphere Reserve). The documentation of the movement of migratory fishes through this reach of the river using acoustic telemetry, the surprising discovery of the world's largest freshwater fish, the potential threat posed by dam construction, and the management ramifications of UNESCO World Heritage Site designation underscore the importance of scientific research and community involvement in landscape-scale development decisions. The decisions made today will affect the fate of this global biodiversity hotspot, the world's most productive inland fisheries, and the livelihoods of millions of people throughout the Lower Mekong Basin.

AB  - Seasonality can cause changes in many environmental factors which potentially affects gene expression. Here, we used a bat species (Rhinolophus sinicus) from eastern China as a model to explore the molecular mechanisms of seasonal effects, in particular during phenological shifts in the spring and autumn. Based on the analysis of 45 RNA-seq samples, we found strong seasonal effects on gene expression, with a large number of genes identified as either specific or biased to each season. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis also identified multiple modules significantly associated with each season. These seasonal genes were further enriched into different functional categories. Consistent with effects of phenological shifts on bats, we found that genes related to promoting food intake were highly expressed in both autumn and spring. In addition, immunity genes were also highly expressed in both seasons although this seasonal immune response had tissue specificity in different seasons. In female bats, genes related to the delay of ovulation (e.g., NPPC, natriuretic peptide precursor type C) were highly expressed in October, while genes associated with the promotion of reproduction (e.g., DIO2, iodothyronine deiodinase 2) were biasedly expressed in April. Lastly, we found multiple known core clock genes in both October-biased and April-biased expressed genes, which may be involved in regulating the start and end of hibernation, respectively. Overall, together with studies in other land and aquatic animals, our work supports that seasonal gene expression variations may be a general evolutionary response to environmental changes in wild animals.

AB  - Amphistomes, commonly referred to as 'stomach' or 'rumen' flukes because of the localization of these flukes in the stomach of ruminants, are digenetic trematodes distinguished by the absence of an oral sucker and the position of the ventral sucker or acetabulum at the posterior end of the body. The body is characterized by a leaf-like fleshy structure, pink or red with a large posterior sucker. Amphistomes are an important group of parasites since they cause 'amphistomiasis' (variously known as paramphistomosis/amphistomosis), a serious disease of great economic importance in ruminants worldwide. These parasites have a broad spectrum of definitive hosts together with a wide geographical distribution. Though they form a continuous evolutional lineage from fishes to mammals, amphistomes mainly inhabit the rumen and reticulum of ruminant mammals, while some species occur in the large intestine or parenteric sites of ruminants, pigs, equines and man.

AB  - If sexual selection is such a powerful force in nature, why are the sexes strikingly similar in some of the bovid species where the competition for mates is believed to be most intense? This study finds that although sexual dimorphism in coloration and pelage appendages generally characterizes species where the potential for males to monopolize females is high, such dimorphism is less common in species where the sexes tend to form mixed-sex groups outside the breeding season. We propose that a predation cost from divergent appearance of the sexes may be higher in taxa that form mixed-sex groups.
   Among mammals, bovids provide some of the most striking examples of sexual dimorphism in colouration and pelage appendages, such as beards and manes. This dimorphism is usually assumed to have evolved through sexual selection on males in the context of intra- or intersexual communication. However, the sexes coloration and pelage appendages look similar between the two sexes in several bovid species thought to be characterized by large opportunities for sexual selection, hinting at fitness costs of dimorphic traits due to other selection pressures. This study applies the comparative method with phylogenetic control to identify the factors promoting and constraining the evolution of dimorphism in coloration and pelage appendages across bovids. We found that trait dimorphism correlated positively with large breeding group size, an indicator of the intensity of sexual selection, and negatively with male territoriality, which is also likely to affect the operation of sexual selection. The relative rarity of color and pelage dimorphism in species with territorial mating systems may be explained by weaker sexual selection due to difficulty in monopolizing females and/or sexual selection targeting other traits, such as territorial quality as an extended phenotype. We also found that dimorphism in color and pelage was reduced in species spending more time in mixed-sex groups outside the breeding season, possibly due to increased predation costs from non-uniformity. This suggests that benefits from integration into mixed-sex groups select against the extravagant male morphologies otherwise promoted by sexual selection.

AB  - The Hedendoa of Sudan produce goat-hair blankets, called shamlas, for nuptial ceremonies employing an extremely rare and labour-intensive half-weaving technique that is completely unrelated to the narrow braided sewn strips used to produce palm leaf mats that cover their tents. I hypothesize that this technique exemplifies technological transfer resultant from casual encounters and incomplete observations of the weaving techniques of the Bedouin pastoral nomads of the region.

AB  - One of the fundamental aims of ecological, epidemiological and evolutionary studies of host-parasite interactions is to unravel which factors affect parasite virulence. Theory predicts that virulence and transmission are correlated by a trade-off, as too much virulence is expected to hamper transmission owing to excessive host damage. Coinfections may affect each of these traits and/or their correlation. Here, we used inbred lines of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae to test how coinfection with T. evansi impacted virulence-transmission relationships at different conspecific densities. The presence of T. evansi on a shared host did not change the relationship between virulence (leaf damage) and the number of transmitting stages (i.e. adult daughters). The relationship between these traits was hump-shaped across densities, both in single and coinfections, which corresponds to a trade-off. Moreover, transmission to adjacent hosts increased in coinfection, but only at low T. urticae densities. Finally, we tested whether virulence and the number of daughters were correlated with measures of transmission to adjacent hosts, in single and coinfections at different conspecific densities. Traits were mostly independent, meaning that interspecific competitors may increase transmission without affecting virulence. Thus, coinfections may impact epidemiology and parasite trait evolution, but not necessarily the virulence-transmission trade-off.This article is part of the theme issue 'Diversity-dependence of dispersal: interspecific interactions determine spatial dynamics'.

AB  - Organic farms have been shown to harbour larger and more diverse invertebrate populations and associated ecosystem services compared to other conventional farming methods. However, data on the impacts of rewilding on invertebrates remain scarce. Dung beetles contribute significantly to ecosystem function and are considered reliable indicators of ecological integrity. They have undergone serious population declines, largely due to changing agricultural practices. Dung beetles were sampled simultaneously at each of four sites for a total of 120 trapping days at each site. Two of the sites had been rewilded using large, free-roaming herbivores, and two were nearby organic farms. The rewilding sites yielded greater species richness and abundance compared to organic farms. The abundance of dung beetles was more than 20 times greater at the rewilded sites compared to organic sites. One paracoprid (dung-burying) species, Onthophagus similis, was particularly abundant, comprising 95% of all individuals at the rewilded sites. Nonetheless, captures at the rewilding sites remained significantly higher even after this species was omitted from the analysis. Practical implication: While additional research is necessary to ascertain whether our findings signify an atypical occurrence, the evidence from this case study suggests that rewilding with large herbivores may provide an effective strategy to combat dung beetle declines, restore ecological function and enhance ecosystem services.

AB  - Natural enemies shape the fate of species at both ecological and evolutionary time scales. While the effects of predators, parasitoids, and viruses on insects are well documented, much less is known about the ecological and evolutionary role of entomopathogenic fungi. In particular, it is unclear to which extent may the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of these pathogens create selective pressures on ecological traits of herbivorous insects. In the present study, we reared three lepidopteran species in semi-natural conditions in a European hemiboreal forest habitat. We studied the probability of the insects to die from fungal infection as a function of insect species, food plant, study site, (manipulated) condition of the larvae, and the phenological phase. The prevalence of entomopathogenic fungi remained low to moderate with the value consistently below 10% across the subsets of the data while as many as 23 fungal species, primarily belonging to the families Cordycipitaceae, Aspergillaceae, and Nectriaceae, were recorded. There were no major differences among the insect species in prevalence of the infections or in the structure of associated fungal assemblages. The family Cordycipitaceae, comprising mainly obligatory entomopathogens, dominated among the pathogens of pupae but not among the pathogens of larvae. Overall, there was evidence for a relatively weak impact of the studied ecological factors on the probability to be infected by a fungal pathogen; there were no effects of food plant, study site, or phenology which would be consistent over the study species and developmental stages of the insects. Nevertheless, when the prevalence of particular fungal taxa was studied, Akanthomyces muscarius was found infecting insects fed with leaves of only one of the food plant, Betula spp. Feeding on a particular plant taxon can thus have specific fitness costs. This demonstrates that fungus-mediated effects on insect life history traits are possible and deserve attention.

AB  - Across herbivorous insect clades, species richness and host-use diversity tend to positively covary. This could be because host-use divergence drives speciation, or because it raises the ecological limits on species richness. To evaluate these hypotheses, we performed phylogenetic path model analyses of the species diversity of Nearctic aphids. Here, we show that variation in the species richness of aphid clades is caused mainly by host-use divergence, whereas variation in speciation rates is caused more by divergence in non-host-related niche variables. Aphid speciation is affected by both the evolution of host and non-host-related niche components, but the former is largely caused by the latter. Thus, our analyses suggest that host-use divergence can both raise the ecological limits on species richness and drive speciation, although in the latter case, host-use divergence tends to be a step along the causal path leading from non-host-related niche evolution to speciation.
   Using phylogenetic path modelling, geographic isolation is revealed to be the main driver of Nearctic aphid speciation, with subsequent host-use divergence raising the limits on clade species richness.

AB  - The coevolution of insects and chemical plant defences has been described as an arms race, but it is unclear whether physical plant defences can produce similar outcomes. Here, we report a previously unknown interaction from the mutualism between ants and Macaranga trees. Although Macaranga trees are well protected against herbivory by aggressive ants, caterpillars of the genus Arhopala (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) can feed on the leaves by appeasing the ants with nectar-like secretions. One ant-plant species, M. trachyphylla, bears hooked trichomes on its green surfaces. When placed on M. trachyphylla stems or petioles, Arhopala caterpillars associated with other Macaranga species (A. major, A. dajagaka and A. zylda) were quickly arrested by the sharp trichomes that pierced their cuticle, resulting in death by rapid blood loss and removal by ants. In striking contrast, A. amphimuta caterpillars, which occur naturally on M. trachyphylla, could easily walk over the hooked trichomes without any injury. As hooked trichomes are a novel trait within Macaranga, this interaction provides an example of de novo evolution of a physical plant defence, which in turn has been overcome by a specialist herbivore. Our study suggests that physical plant defences can lead to evolutionary arms races similar to those for chemical defences.

AB  - Mining soil is considered a serious source of metal contamination worldwide due to its translocation and accumulation in various plant parts, causing severe impacts on plant growth. Results indicated that biochar and manure improved barley root morphology compared to contaminated soil. Moreover, Pb and Cu were highly translocated to shoots. Regarding treatments, manure 10% and 20% increased the Pb accumulation in roots, while animal manure 20% and biochar 2.5% increased its accumulation in shoots. Using manure of 10%, 20%, and biochar 2.5% promoted the accumulation of Zn in roots (bioaccumulation factor: BAFroot >= 1). According to the Dickson quality index and tolerance index, barley plants showed a high tolerance for metals in soil. Biochar and manure were effective in reducing the negative effects of metals such as Cd and Pb on barley plants. Moreover, helps to increase the accumulation of Zn and Cu in barley roots and shoots. Our findings provide insight into the potential of biochar and manure to enhance crop production under metal stress, leading to the assurance of food supply and sustainable agriculture under stressful conditions. However, future research is highly needed, focusing on a field scale and testing metals' long-term effects on crop productivity and grain accumulation in contaminated soil.

AB  - Marine turtles are a group of imperiled marine megafauna particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors. Most long-term studies of marine turtles are based on nesting surveys which focus on numbers of eggs, hatchlings, and nesting females. However, we know less about long-term abundance trends of immature and adult turtles in the marine environment. To address this data gap, we examined records from 35,000 underwater visual census (UVC) dives (1993-2019) and short-term in-water turtle survey data (2009-2014) at Cocos Island, Costa Rica. During UVCs, trained divemasters from UnderSea Hunter recorded observations of two species of marine turtles-green Chelonia mydas and hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata. Our short-term in-water surveys revealed that most turtles at Cocos are greens, but both immature and mature greens occur at Cocos. We analyzed long-term UVC data using a hierarchical modeling approach and we modeled a 26% decrease in the relative abundance of turtles observed on dives each year. Our model also revealed potential interactions between tiger sharks and turtles, finding that for each additional tiger shark present during a dive, the predicted relative abundance of turtles decreased by 43%. Lastly, our model suggested the influence of environmental variation on marine turtle relative abundance; a 1 degrees C increase in sea surface temperature (SST) decreased the predicted relative abundance of turtles by 7%. Our results suggest that marine turtles are sensitive to long-term environmental and oceanographic changes, and potentially avoid certain areas to reduce exposure to tiger sharks. Given our study area is already protected, there needs to be more focus on protecting adult turtles during their movements across the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Our work also highlights the importance of long-term underwater surveys to monitor adult turtles.
   Analysis of 22 years of marine turtle in-water surveys revealed significant declines in relative abundance, despite protection within the survey area. This work provides important insights into long-term population trends of Endangered green and hawksbill turtles in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, and uses a series of mixed models to examine environmental and ecological factors which may relate to the observed decline of marine turtles. image

AB  - Parasitoids represent the third trophic level in plant-insect food webs. They develop in or on herbivorous insects at the second trophic level, which in turn feed on plants that constitute the first trophic level. This food web system might be affected by agricultural landscape and practices.We studied the phenology and population density of Aphis fabae (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and determined the impact of parasitoids in organic fields of beans and beet plants.Twenty leaves per field were collected weekly. For each leaf, the total number of aphids, apterous and alate morphs, the number of mummies, and mortality of aphids were recorded.Our results showed that the phenology of A. fabae varied throughout the season with maximal numbers observed at the beginning of summer. In addition, the production of alate morphs and the proportion of parasitism were positively correlated to an increase in aphid densities.Six parasitoid species were recorded attacking A. fabae in the field, with Lysiphlebus fabarum and Binodoxys angelicae (Hymenoptera: Aphidiinae) being the most abundant parasitoids.Field characteristics and availability of host plants in the surroundings affected A. fabae density. Lysiphlebus fabarum and B. angelicae appeared to be good biocontrol candidates against A. fabae.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a recognised threat to global health. Obtaining data on the prevalence of AMR in environmental bacteria is key to understanding drivers and routes of transmission. Here, 325 Shiga toxin negative deer faecal samples-gathered from across the Scottish mainland-were screened for the presence of AMR Escherichia coli and investigated for potential risk factors associated with AMR occurrence. E. coli with resistance to antimicrobials of clinical health concern, including carbapenems and 3rd generation cephalospo-rins, were targeted. Ninety-nine percent of samples yielded E. coli, and the prevalence of resistant E. coli at the level of faecal samples was 21.8% (n = 71) for tetracycline, 6.5% (n = 21) for cefpodoxime, 0.3% for cipro-floxacin (n = 1), with no recorded resistance to meropenem. Potential risk factors for tetracycline and cefpo-doxime resistance were investigated. The presence of broadleaved woodlands was significantly associated with both AMR phenotypes, which may relate to land use within or around such woodlands. Associated risk factors varied across resistance phenotype and deer species, with proximity or density of horses an indicator of significantly decreased and increased risk, respectively, or tetracycline and cefpodoxime resistance in E. coli from roe deer, but not from red deer. Distance from wastewater treatment plants was a significant risk factor for tetracycline resistance in E. coli from red deer but not from roe deer. Data indicated that AMR E. coli can occur in wild deer populations that are not directly exposed to the selective pressure exerted by antimicrobial treatment. Overall, resistance to critically important antimicrobials was found to be low in the studied population, sug-gesting no immediate cause for concern regarding human health. Utilising existing culling frameworks, wild deer in Scotland could function well as a sentinel species for the surveillance of AMR in the Scottish environment.

AB  - Seedling establishment is crucial for elevational advance of tree species above the treeline ecotone, but the characteristics and availability of safe sites for tree regeneration in alpine ecosystems are not well understood. To better understand the potential of treeline ecotones to show infilling or upward shifts, we assessed microsite preferences of the conifers Larix decidua, Pinus uncinata, and Pinus cembra in upper treeline ecotones with different bedrock chemistry in the French Alps. At each of two sites on calcareous and two on siliceous bedrock, we compared microsites of 50 tree individuals to 50 randomly-selected reference microsites, considering substrate, ground cover, topography, and shelter proximity. In addition, we related these characteristics with the health of the individuals. We found that the three species were established in similar microsites, usually with some shelter. The occupied microsites reflected the available microsites in the area, but certain extreme microsite types remained unoccupied. Most individuals had a krummholz form or were bent, while only a small proportion presented signs of recent mechanical damage, desiccation, snow mold or herbivory, independent of microsite characteristics. Our study shows that the availability of safe sites unlikely limits the establishment of these conifers in the studied sites, suggesting that, instead, seed availability may be a major limitation for tree establishment in these alpine-treeline ecotones. Even in safe sites, the harsh alpine conditions limit the development of tree-species individuals into tree stature, but the strong recent length growth observed suggests favorable conditions for eventual tree expansion in and above current treeline ecotones.

AB  - Some organisms appear to thrive in contaminated environments, while others are more sensitive, though the causes of this variation are unclear. The toxin coevolution hypothesis posits that an evolutionary history with natural toxins preadapts species to deal with novel toxins, while the range-size-tolerance hypothesis posits that a larger geographic range selects for broader tolerance to stressors. Butterflies are a prime system to investigate these hypotheses because they are diverse, feed on a range of larval host plants that vary in defensive compounds, and many are found in polluted environments. We ask how these hypotheses explain varying tolerance to heavy metal pollution, measured here as loads of four heavy metals along an urban gradient of metal exposure. We compared 26 butterfly species that vary in their evolutionary history with mutagenic plant defensive chemicals as well as their geographic range size. We built a dataset of plant mutagenicity synthesizing 40 years of standardized mutagenicity screening in plants, including 502 plant species of 103 families within 37 orders. We used this dataset, coupled with butterfly host records, to estimate evolutionary history with mutagens. We found that butterfly species with larger ranges tolerated significantly greater concentrations of lead, arsenic, and cadmium in their tissues. Additionally, species with a history of feeding on relatively more mutagenic host plant families tolerated greater maximum lead concentrations in their thoracic tissue. This research provides additional support for the growing observation that small-ranged species are more vulnerable to environmental change, in this case, metal pollution. In addition, an evolutionary history with mutagenic host plants may provide some additional resilience, although less than geographic range size. In addition, our dataset on comparative plant mutagenicity will facilitate future research on plant-herbivore coevolution, in fields such as chemical, community, and urban ecology.

AB  - Movement ecologists have witnessed a rapid increase in the amount of animal position data collected over the past few decades, as well as a concomitant increase in the availability of ecologically relevant remotely sensed data. Many researchers, however, lack the computing resources necessary to incorporate the vast spatiotemporal aspects of datasets available, especially in countries with less economic resources, limiting the scope of ecological inquiry. We developed an R coding workflow that bridges the gap between R and the multi-petabyte catalogue of remotely sensed data available in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to efficiently extract raster pixel values that best match the spatiotemporal aspects (i.e., spatial location and time) of each animal's GPS position. We tested our approach using movement data freely available on Movebank (movebank.org). In a first case study, we extracted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index information from the MOD13Q1 data product for 12,344 GPS animal locations by matching the closest MODIS image in the time series to each GPS fix. Data extractions were completed in approximately 3 min. In a second case study, we extracted hourly air temperature from the ERA5-Land dataset for 33,074 GPS fixes from 12 different wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) in approximately 34 min. We then investigated the relationship between step length (i.e., the net distance between sequential GPS locations) and temperature and found that animals move less as temperature increases. These case studies illustrate the potential to explore novel questions in animal movement research using high-temporal-resolution, remotely sensed data products. The workflow we present is efficient and customizable, with data extractions occurring over relatively short time periods. While computing times to extract remotely sensed data from GEE will vary depending on internet speed, the approach described has the potential to facilitate access to computationally demanding processes for a greater variety of researchers and may lead to increased use of remotely sensed data in the field of movement ecology. We present a step-by-step tutorial on how to use the code and adapt it to other data products that are available in GEE.</p>

AB  - Polyphagous insect herbivores feed on multiple host-plant species and face a highly variable chemical landscape. Comparative studies of polyphagous herbivore metabolism across a range of plants is an ideal approach for exploring how intra- and interspecific chemical variation shapes species interactions. We used polyphagous caterpillars of Lymantria mathura (Erebidae, Lepidoptera) to explore mechanisms that may contribute to its ability to feed on various hosts. We focused on intraspecific variation in polyphenol metabolism, the fates of individual polyphenols, and the role of previous feeding experience on polyphenol metabolism and leaf consumption. We collected the caterpillars from Acer amoenum (Sapindaceae), Carpinus cordata (Betulaceae), and Quercus crispula (Fagaceae). We first fed the larvae with the leaves of their original host and characterized the polyphenol profiles in leaves and frass. We then transferred a subset of larvae to a different host species and quantified how host shifting affected their leaf consumption and polyphenol metabolism. There was high intraspecific variation in frass composition, even among caterpillars fed with one host. While polyphenols had various fates when ingested by the caterpillars, most of them were passively excreted. When we transferred the caterpillars to a new host, their previous experience influenced how they metabolized polyphenols. The one-host larvae metabolized a larger quantity of ingested polyphenols than two-host caterpillars. Some of these metabolites could have been sequestered, others were probably activated in the gut. One-host caterpillars retained more of the ingested leaf biomass than transferred caterpillars. The pronounced intraspecific variation in polyphenol metabolism, an ability to excrete ingested metabolites and potential dietary habituation are factors that may contribute to the ability of L. mathura to feed across multiple hosts. Further comparative studies can help identify if these mechanisms are related to differential host-choice and response to host-plant traits in specialist and generalist insect herbivores.

AB  - Comparative phylogeography provides crucial insights into evolutionary processes shaping biodiversity patterns by analysing spatial genetic variations across multiple species. However, conventional capture-based methods are often labour-intensive, particularly for multi-species analyses. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has significant advantages in comparative phylogeography, including simplified field surveys requiring only water collection and the potential to simultaneously analyse multiple species from a single sample. To further expand the eDNA application and demonstrate its utility in comparative phylogeographic studies, this study employed eDNA analysis to simultaneously analyse the phylogeographic patterns in a species-rich freshwater goby group (Rhinogobius) in the Japanese Archipelago. DNA amplification was performed on eDNA samples collected from 573 sites across the archipelago using newly designed group-specific primers targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome b region of Rhinogobius. High-throughput sequencing detected haplotypes of all nine known species (or species groups) occurring in this region, followed by phylogenetic and network analyses. The eDNA analysis successfully revealed the genetic population structures across multiple species. A landlocked species, R. flumineus, exhibited fine-scale population differentiation shaped by geomorphological barriers, while amphidromous species showed broader genetic patterns likely influenced by ocean currents and their ecological traits. The phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns reconstructed by the eDNA analysis were almost completely concordant with previously identified patterns of limited groups based on conventional methods, demonstrating the reliability of eDNA-based comparative phylogeography. This study highlights the potential of eDNA to complement and partially replace conventional methods, facilitating large-scale comparative phylogeographic research to gain new insights into spatial patterns and evolutionary processes of biodiversity.

AB  - Fossil camelids (Artiodactyla, Camelidae) record for Mexican Late Pleistocene is constituted by Camelops hesternus, Hemiauchenia macrocephala, Hemiauchenia gracilis, and Palaeolama mirifica. It analysed dental microwear and carbon and oxygen stable isotopes in teeth enamel of C. hesternus, H. macrocephala and H. gracilis from two fossil sites (LC-PT, and LP-SA) in west-central Mexico, gaining knowledge about camelids palaeoecology (diet and habitat). Microwear and delta C-13 values indicate that C. hesternus from both sites had a browser diet with a preference for C-3-C-4 plants, while H. macrocephala from LC-PT was browser with a predilection for C-3 plants, and H. gracilis from LC-PT had a mixed feeder diet with a preference for C-3 plants. The delta O-18 and the aridity index show that camelids in central Mexico were evaporation-sensitive taxa. The results suggest that LC-PT had a heterogeneous environment composed of open areas and closed zones, temperatures between 13.95 degrees C and 19.9 degrees C and extreme seasonal changes. The environment in LP-SA was dominated by open areas, with small closed vegetation patches, a temperature of 16.29 degrees C, and less seasonal variation. The aridity index indicates relatively drier conditions at LP-SA than at LC-PT. Camelid dietary ecology provides an initial reconstruction of a regional paleoenvironment, with diverse ecosystems present.

AB  - We present here the result of phylogenetic analysis for Vietnamese Hipposideros gentilis specimens using 7 nuclear genes and one mitochondrial gene. The complex distribution of divergent mitochondrial DNA lineages contradicts, at least in part, nuclear and morphological data. The most likely explanation for this discordance is the historical hybridization between ancestral populations of H. gentilis and H. rotalis/H. khaokhouayensis. Our data supports the species status of H. gentilis, while only partially corroborating its previously proposed subspecies delimitation. We suggest the lowland forest populations from south Vietnam may correspond to their own subspecies. At the same time, the close phylogenetic relationship and morphological similarity of mountain forms from south and central Vietnam to the north Vietnamese populations make doubtful the subspecies status of H. gentilis sinensis.

AB  - Simple Summary Intensive and semi-intensive sheep farming are the two farming systems usually employed in Greece. Several studies have been conducted on the effect of the farming system on sheep milk fatty acid composition. This study simultaneously examines milk basic composition, physicochemical characteristics, fatty acid composition, and nutritional value according to the production system. Bulk tank milk from farms using the intensive and semi-intensive production systems was analyzed. The results show that grazing can improve the fatty acid composition of milk. Thus, pasture-based feeding strategies could improve the fatty acid composition and the nutritional properties of sheep dairy products. Dairy sheep farming is a vital sector of the agricultural economy in Greece. Information on the effect of the farming system on sheep milk characteristics is critical for producing dairy products with improved nutritional value according to the current guidelines for healthy food consumption. This study aimed to investigate the basic composition, physicochemical characteristics, fatty acid composition, and nutritional indices of milk produced in intensive and semi-intensive sheep farms. Bulk tank milk samples from 20 intensive and 20 semi-intensive sheep farms were examined. Sheep in the intensive farms were kept indoors and were fed with roughage, silage, and concentrates. Sheep in the semi-intensive farms were kept indoors during the night and were moved to the pastures during the day. Sheep were fed with roughage, silage, and concentrates in combination with grazing. Milk composition and somatic cell count were determined with automatic analyzers. The physicochemical characteristics were determined with standard laboratory methods. The fatty acid composition was analyzed by gas chromatography. The farming system did not affect milk chemical composition and physicochemical characteristics. However, milk fatty acid composition and nutritional value were significantly improved in milk from farms using the semi-intensive production system, and this favorable effect was attributed to the inclusion of pasture in sheep diet.

AB  - This study was conducted in West Azerbaijan province, Iran (37 degrees 27'18.022" N, 45 degrees 0'0" E) to investigate the genotyping and phylogenetic characterization of Mannheimia haemolytica in cattle and buffaloes from November 2022 to January 2024. Mannheimia haemolytica is a bacterium known to cause pasteurellosis pneumonia, a respiratory disease in ruminants, such as cattle and sheep. This is one of the main causes of economic losses in the feedlot industry. In addition to the deaths, treatment costs are also significant. The lung and nasal swab samples were collected from 378 cattle and buffaloes. The M. haemolytica was detected in 32 (8.46%) of the samples, with a notably higher isolation rate from lung tissue (56.25%; n = 18) compared to the nasal swabs (43.75%; n = 14). Interestingly, the study also revealed a seasonal pattern, with the highest isolation rates observed during January, February, and March. Multi-locus sequence typing demonstrated that all isolates belonged to sequence type 1 (ST1) within clonal complex 28. This finding is consistent with the global prevalence of ST1 in bovine isolates, indicating widespread distribution. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a strong correlation between ST1 and STs 30 and 54, highlighting the prevalence of ST1 in M. haemolytica among ruminants in West Azerbaijan, Iran. Further research is needed to investigate its potential for causing disease and its transmission pattern.

AB  - We present evidence for the first documentation of consumption of a water oak (Quercus nigra) acorn by an eastern screech owl (Megascops asio). A screech owl diet typically consists of small mammals, small birds, and arthropods. In our study, we had a 1-m x 1-m sand pad under observation from a game camera that was set on a 1-min time-lapse delay. On this sand pad, we placed five water oak acorns. In a series of six images over six minutes, we observed an eastern screech owl land near the sand pad, walk to an acorn, and appear to consume the acorn. Although there could be other plausible explanations and events that transpired between 1-min image intervals, we believe this acorn was consumed by the eastern screech owl. The importance of this addition of food type to the diet of a raptor is largely unexplored and undocumented.

AB  - Simple Summary Biosecurity breaches have been shown to play a major role in the introduction and spread of African swine fever (ASF) in domestic pig populations. The aim of the study was to describe the biosecurity levels and management practices of ASF outbreak and uninfected herds and to identify potential risk factors for ASF introduction. The biosecurity score of ASF outbreak herds was significantly lower compared to uninfected herds. This may reflect general improvement in the application of biosecurity measures over time in Estonian pig farms as the data on uninfected herds were collected later, at a time when intensified official controls may have had their effect. Larger herds were more at risk of being 'outbreak herds' compared to smaller herds. The biosecurity parameters significantly associated with 'outbreak herd' status in statistical analysis were mostly related to indirect contacts with the outside farm environment. The biosecurity barriers applied in Estonian pig farms have not been sufficient to avoid the introduction of ASF and need critical evaluation and improvement. Reduction of all contacts between the farm and the external environment should be emphasized in a situation where ASF is circulating in wild boar populations close to pig farms. Risk factors related to external biosecurity have been considered to play a major role in the introduction and spread of African swine fever (ASF) in domestic pig populations. The aim of the study was to describe the biosecurity levels and management practices of ASF outbreak and uninfected herds and to identify potential risk factors for ASF introduction. Data collected from the outbreak herds during outbreak investigations and from the randomly selected uninfected herds were analyzed. The biosecurity score in ASF outbreak herds was significantly lower compared to uninfected herds. However, this may reflect general improvement in the application of biosecurity measures in pig farms over time as the data on uninfected herds were collected later, at a time when intensified official controls may have had their effect. Larger herds were more at risk of being outbreak herds compared to smaller herds. The biosecurity parameters significantly associated with the outbreak herd status in multiple correspondence analysis were mostly related to indirect contacts with the outside farm environment. The biosecurity barriers applied in Estonian pig farms have not been sufficient to avoid ASF introduction and need critical evaluation and improvement. Reduction of all contacts between the farm and the external environment should be emphasized in a situation where ASF is circulating in wild boar populations close to pig farms.

AB  - Microbial necromass is a crucial source of stable organic matter in composting, yet its role in the humification process remains poorly understood. This study aims to explore the contribution of microbial necromass carbon (MNC) to humic acid (HA) formation during the composting of sewage sludge (SS), kitchen waste (KW), and pig manure (PM), and to examine the involvement of fungal communities in microbial necromass humification. The results show that fungal necromass carbon (FNC) consistently contributes more to MNC than bacterial necromass carbon (BNC), with FNC accounting for over 60% of MNC across all treatments. KW exhibited the highest accumulation of FNC (4.09-98.92 g/kg), and its MNC contribution to total organic carbon was 23.63%, significantly higher than sewage sludge (5.57%) and pig manure (7.47%). The carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio was found to be a critical factor influencing microbial growth, necromass accumulation, and HA formation, with a lower C/N ratio promoting faster microbial turnover and enhancing MNC contribution to HA. The analysis also revealed that Ascomycota dominated the maturation phase, with a significant role in driving humification, especially in KW. Structural equation modeling confirmed that FNC and BNC are directly influenced by the C/N ratio, which in turn affects HA formation This study enhances our understanding of microbial necromass dynamics and its contribution to humic substance formation, providing valuable insights for improving compost quality and optimizing composting strategies for enhanced carbon sequestration.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) plants have a strong ability to accumulate selenium (Se). However, the question of how tea plants affect Se availability has received little attention. In this study, five tea cultivars, including Soubei (SB), AolU (AL), Longjing43 (LJ), Zhaori (ZR) and FenglU (FL), were chosen for the study. Quantitative Microbial Ecology Chip and high-throughput sequencing were used to explore the effects of five tea cultivars on soil functions, microbial community structures and Se availability. The results showed that the total soil Se content in the FL garden was lower compared to LJ and SB gardens, whereas available Se was highest in the FL garden. Based on the Bray-Curtis distances, tea cultivar was the main factor affecting bacterial and fungal community structures. The abundance of functional genes concerning carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur cycling processes varied among tea gardens. The higher soil NH4+ and NO3- contents, and higher abundance of functional genes like nifH, amoA1 and narG, whereas lower total nitrogen in the FL garden than in the AL and LJ tea gardens demonstrated that the FL tea plants induced microbes to accelerate soil nitrogen cycling processes. Dominant microbes that positively related with functional genes like nifH, narG, and amoA1 were also positively related with the available Se content. In conclusion, tea cultivars could regulate soil functions through affecting microbial community structures and then affecting the soil Se availability. The soil nitrogen cycle processes are suggested to be closely related with Se transformation in tea gardens.

AB  - Hind limbs undergo dramatic changes in loading conditions during the transition from quadrupedal to bipedal locomotion. For example, the most early diverging bipedal jerboas (Rodentia: Dipodidae) are some of the smallest mammals in the world, with body masses that range between 2-4 g. The larger jerboa species exhibit developmental and evolutionary fusion of the central three metatarsals into a single cannon bone. We hypothesize that small body size and metatarsal fusion are mechanisms to maintain the safety factor of the hind limb bones despite the higher ground reaction forces associated with bipedal locomotion. Using finite-element analysis to model collisions between the substrate and the metatarsals, we found that body size reduction was insufficient to reduce bone stress on unfused metatarsals, based on the scaled dynamics of larger jerboas, and that fused bones developed lower stresses than unfused bones when all metatarsals are scaled to the same size and loading conditions. Based on these results, we conclude that fusion reinforces larger jerboa metatarsals against high ground reaction forces. Because smaller jerboas with unfused metatarsals develop higher peak stresses in response to loading conditions scaled from larger jerboas, we hypothesize that smaller jerboas use alternative dynamics of bipedal locomotion to reduce the impact of collisions between the foot and substrate.

AB  - The kidney is essential for maintaining fluid, electrolyte, and metabolite homeostasis, and for regulating blood pressure. The pig serves as a valuable biomedical model for human renal physiology, offering insights across different physiological states. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing was used to profile 138 469 cells from 12 pig kidney samples collected during the embryonic (E), fattening (F), and pregnancy (P) periods, identifying 29 cell types. Proximal tubule (PT) cells exhibited elevated expression of metabolism-related transcription factors (TFs), including GPD1, ACAA1, and AGMAT, with validation across multiple individuals, periods, and species. Fluorescence homologous double-labeling of paraffin sections further confirmed the expression of ACAA1 and AGMAT in PT cells. Comparative analysis of pig and human kidneys revealed a high degree of similarity among corresponding cell types. Analysis of cell-type heterogeneity highlighted the diversity of thick ascending limb (TAL) cells, identifying a TAL subpopulation related to immune function. Additionally, the functional heterogeneity of kidney-resident macrophages (KRM) was explored across different anatomical sites. In the renal medulla, KRM were implicated in phagocytosis and leukocyte activation, whereas in the renal pelvis, they functioned as ligands, recruiting neutrophils with bactericidal activity to the renal pelvis to combat urinary tract infections.

AB  - The availability of atomic resolution experimental maps of electrostatic potential from 3D electron diffraction (3D ED) extends the possibility of investigating the electrostatic potential beyond the determination of non-H-atom positions. However, accurate tools to calculate this potential for macromolecules, without the use of expensive quantum calculations, are lacking. The University at Buffalo Data Bank (UBDB) gathers atom types that can be used to calculate accurate electrostatic potential maps via structure-factor calculations. Here, the transferable aspherical atom model (TAAM) is applied with UBDB to investigate theoretically obtained electrostatic potential maps of lysozyme and proteinase K, and compare them with experimental maps from 3D ED. UBDB better reproduces the molecular electrostatic potential of molecules within their entire volume compared with the neutral spherical models used in the popular independent atom model (IAM). Additionally, the theoretical electron-density maps of the studied proteins are shown and compared with the electrostatic potential maps. The atomic displacement parameters (B factors) may affect the electrostatic potential maps in a different way than in the case of electron-density maps. The computational method presented in this study could potentially facilitate the interpretation of the less resolved regions of cryo-electron microscopy density maps and pave the way for distinguishing between different ions/water molecules in the active sites of macromolecules in high-resolution structures, which is of interest for drug-design purposes.

AB  - This research seeks to deepen the current economic and structural aspects of the livestock farms in the rural territory "Casacastra" (Cilento area), to identify critical issues and development opportunities with the intention to enhance and protect the territory under study also through strengthening forms of local economy. Information about the consistency and the typology of livestock farms present in the study area, and the trend in the last twelve years, were acquired thought the consultation of the national livestock register of the Italian Ministry of Health. Subsequently, a questionnaire was submitted to a sample of farmers to better know the characteristics of the breeders and of the husbandries. The results showed that in the study area, there are 4% of the cattle and sheep herds of the Campania Region, and 7% of those with goats. The most representative farm size is the class with less than 20 animals per breeding type, and between 2010 and 2022, there has been a reduction in the number of all types of analyzed husbandries. The most represented productive orientation is that for meat, while the specialization in the production of milk in sheep and goat breeding is completely absent. The interviews revealed that the breeders are almost all over 40 years of age, with middle and high school qualifications and consolidated experience. The workforce involved in the farms is mainly the family one and often breeders are people engaged in other non-agricultural activities. Despite the permanence in some cases of archaic husbandry methods, the breeders play a key role in the study area for the protection of the territory, and the conservation and enhancement of local animal and plant genetic resources are at risk of extinction. Moreover, the survival of this rural context is linked to the development of new forms of local economy, such as the definition of an experiential rural tourist offer, in which the presence of institutions plays a fundamental role.

AB  - Ongoing climate change may impact alpine plant populations via both direct effects of increased temperature and climate-driven changes in interactions between plants and other organisms, such as insect herbivores. Rates of herbivory in high-elevation environments are predicted to increase with warmer temperatures, which may also lead to changes in morphological and physiological traits that influence plant resistance. Yet, we currently know little about how temperature-mediated changes in traits will impact alpine plant vulnerability to herbivores, as well as the extent to which populations from high-elevation environments might need to rapidly adapt to increasing herbivore pressure with rising temperatures.We assessed the effect of experimental warming on the relative vulnerability of populations of the alpine plant Arabis alpina from different elevations to a specialist herbivore. Herbivore performance was measured on plants from nine populations grown in climate chambers at two temperatures, representing low (warm) and high (cold) elevations. We also measured changes in putative drivers of performance: plant phenological, chemical and defence traits. Assuming populations would be adapted to local climates and levels of herbivory, we predicted that low-elevation populations would be more resistant to herbivores under warmer temperatures than high-elevation populations.We found reduced performance of a specialist herbivore on A. alpina grown under warm rather than cold conditions, though this effect varied with elevation. Larvae grew faster on high-elevation populations than low-elevation populations when grown under warm temperatures, whereas similar growth rates were observed for plants grown under colder temperatures, consistent with plant adaptation to the lower existing herbivore pressure in cold, high-elevation environments. Regression analyses suggested that polar metabolite variation explained more variance in larval performance than changes in defensive glucosinolates or morphological traits.Our results suggest that although physiological responses to warming may increase the resistance of cold-adapted plants to herbivory, populations from different elevations may differ in their interactions with herbivores under climate warming. Without genetic adaptation, existing physiological responses of high-elevation populations to warmer temperatures may leave these populations vulnerable to the increases in herbivore pressure predicted under climate change.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Brassicaceous plants are attacked by a wealth of specialist herbivores that include the Diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), control of which requires novel biocontrol strategies. DBM is a cosmopolitan pest causing damage that varies yearly in Finland depending on the timing and extent of their migration. Intercropping with companion plants can hamper host location by herbivores or attract their natural enemies. We tested two sustainable companion plant-based protection strategies on field-grown broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica), which comprised 1) aromatic and repellent-releasing Rhododendron tomentosum (RT) (bottom-up strategy), and 2) nectar-producing buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum (FE) (top-down strategy) combined with an early-season floating row cover (mechanical control) (MC + FE). In addition, a control (no companion plant or cover) and mechanical control (MC) without FE were included. DBM adults on yellow sticky traps and larvae on plants were counted, and feeding damage on leaves was quantified. Volatile organic compounds emitted by broccoli plants in control and RT plots, and emitted by boundary RT plants in RT plots, were identified and quantified. There was a mass outbreak of DBM in early summer with a population peak in mid-July when the second adult generation emerged. DBM adult densities were significantly lower in RT and MC + FE than in control plots. Broccoli in RT plots had a lower larval density and lower damage intensity than in control plots in the early-season. Larval densities and damage intensities were the highest in the latter half of July. Control plots had the highest number of larvae followed by RT, MC, and MC + FE plots. Damage intensities in control plots were significantly higher than in all other treatments throughout the season. Damage intensity was lower in MC and MC + FE plots than in RT plots at the end-of-July. R. tomentosum emitted two characteristic sesquiterpene alcohols, palustrol and ledol, but no evidence of adsorption and re-release of these compounds from Brassica plants grown in RT plots was found. We conclude that incorporating RT as a boundary plant and using a mechanical row cover reduces DBM damage on broccoli, but further multi-year trials under varying degrees of pest pressure are needed.

AB  - Overabundant populations of feral equids are negatively affecting rangelands in the western United States. To better manage these populations, robust estimates of abundance and demographic rates and cost-effective methods of reducing abundance are necessary. From August 2015 to April 2017, we estimated the abundance of feral burros (Equus asinus) at the Fort Irwin National Training Center (NTC; California, USA) using a double-observer-sightability aerial survey method; captured, radio-collared, and inoculated female burros with porcine zona pellucida (PZP), an immunocontraceptive control agent; estimated female demographic rates; and used matrix population models to simulate how changes in demographic and PZP delivery rates would influence burro abundance. We estimated there were 690 (95% CI = 618-752) feral burros within the surveyed area, but these are part of a much larger population that is not geographically isolated from those in the survey area. Sighting probabilities ranged from 0.19-0.98 and were most strongly influenced by distance from observer and group size. We estimated age-specific demographic rates at the NTC and compiled mean rates across burro populations in arid environments from the literature. Mean fecundity varied from 0.17 to 0.58 foals/adult female with younger females having lower fecundity. Mean survival was 0.90 for foals, 0.98 for yearlings, and 0.96 for adults. The PZP vaccine treatment strategies that suppressed fertility for up to 10 years predicted that burro abundance would be reduced by 67-88% after 15 years (compared with no treatment), but none of these strategies resulted in population extirpation. Population growth rates shifted from increasing to decreasing at adult survival rates below 0.84 and the population was predicted to become extirpated when adult survival declined to <0.60. In the absence of other methods to reduce burro numbers, our findings indicate that current formulations of PZP immunocontraception, which require multiple doses, would be inadequate for controlling population growth rates at the NTC. Our fieldwork also highlighted the difficulty of administering PZP vaccination to large, free-ranging animals. Development of longer-term fertility reduction agents or more efficient vaccine delivery techniques would likely improve the efficacy of fertility control for overabundant ungulate populations. Lack of geographic closure (physical barriers to migration) further complicated efforts to reduce burro numbers. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Early Pleistocene (MN 17; Villanian, Argedavian: Milcovian) deer remains are known in Oltenia region (SW Romania) mainly from the lower faunal horizon Tetoiu 1 (T-1), including the vertebrate localities Valea Rosc & abreve;i, La Pietris and Valea Gr & abreve;uceanului, all in V & acirc;lcea County. As such fossils are relatively rare in Romania, some cheekteeth and a distal extremity of a metatarsal are reported herein, documenting the presence of deer in the locality D & abreve;nciulesti (eastern side of Gorj County). Like the previously mentioned ones, this locality also belongs to the Tetoiu Formation, in the Carpathian Foredeep. The sample fossils are scarce, but they reflect the presence of a deer close in size to Eucladoceros and another smaller form, possibly close to ?Metacervocerus. The marking is important to underline the potentiality of the area, where Early Pleistocene vertebrates can occur at any time due to erosion or various digging works. Such fossils remain relatively rare in our country so far. Consequently, systematic monitoring of the area in question is strongly recommended.

AB  - Aims: Coxiella burnetii is a highly infectious organism that is easily spread through aerosols causing Q fever in humans. Ticks can harbour and transmit C. burnetii to animals, contributing to disease maintenance. Our aim was to examine the presence of C. burnetii in ticks in Uganda. Methods and Results: In this study, ticks were collected from five Ugandan districts and tested by real-time PCR for C. burnetii (Coxiella outer membrane protein 1 gene). A total of 859 tick pools (9602 individual ticks) were tested, and pool positivity for C. burnetii was 5.5% (n = 47). Pooled prevalence differed by district; the highest was Luwero (7.3%), then Gulu (6.6%), and Kasese had the lowest (1.3%). However, district variation was not statistically significant (Fisher's exact = 0.07). Ticks collected from dogs and cats had the highest positivity rates [23/47, (48.9%)] followed by livestock (cattle, goats, sheep, and pigs) [18/47, (38.3%)] and vegetation [6/47, (12.8%)]. Haemaphysalis elliptica had the highest infection rates, followed by Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, Amblyomma variegatum and Rhipicephalus decoloratus had similar prevalence. Conclusions: Although ticks are not the primary transmitters of C. burnetii to humans, pathogen detection in ticks can be an indirect indicator of risk among animal hosts. Vulnerable populations, including occupations with close animal contact such as farming, butchery, and veterinary practice, have an increased risk of C. burnetii exposure. Veterinarians and clinicians should be aware that C. burnetii may cause human and animal illness in these regions.

AB  - Brazilian peppertree, Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi (Sapindales: Anacardiaceae), is an invasive tree in the Southeastern United States, Texas, California, and Hawaii. The Brazilian peppertree thrips, Pseudophilothrips ichini Hood (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae), is a recently approved biological control agent for use within the US. The thrips have since been released in the field and are expected to reduce Brazilian peppertree performance. Pseudophilothrips ichini is likely to impact young trees but the impacts may vary based on thrips population size and tree age. To better understand the factors contributing to agent impact on young trees and P. ichini population growth, we measured the effect of P. ichini density (0, 4, 10, and 20 thrips) and tree age (3-, 4-, and 6-month-old plants), on tree performance and P. ichini productivity in the laboratory. Brazilian peppertree height and the number of growing tips were reduced across all age groups. However, the negative impact was more pronounced on the youngest trees, which had a reduction in the relative change in height of 171% and a 100% reduction in the number of growing tips. Pseudophilothrips ichini production was positively correlated with tree height (r = 0.44) and biomass (r = 0.56), but thrips relative production was similar across tree age. Results indicate that P. ichini have a great capacity for population increase regardless of starting density. Field studies are needed to corroborate these findings and identify barriers to agent success. This work aims to refine expectations of the impacts to Brazilian peppertree caused by P. ichini.

AB  - Pyrolysis of agricultural waste into biochar for soil remediation is a useful solid waste management strategy. However, it is still unclear how different agricultural feedstocks affect the properties of biochars and their effectiveness in remediation of PBDE-contaminated soil. In this study, we systematically investigated dynamic alterations of soil properties, microbial communities, and PBDE dissipation and bioavailability induced by the application of biochars from manure (MBC) and straw (SBC) to PBDE-contaminated soil. The results showed that soil properties, microbial community structure, and diversity changed differently with the incorporation of the two biochars. MBC had a larger surface area (17.4 m2/g) and a higher nutrient content (45.1% ash content), making it more suitable for use as a soil additive to improve soil quality and nutrient conditions, as well as to stimulate microbial growth. SBC showed higher adsorption capacity for 2,2 ',4,4 '-Tetrabromodiphenyl Ether (BDE-47) (26.73 +/- 0.65 mg/g), thus lowering the bioavailability and ecological risk of BDE-47 in soil. BDE-47 was stepwise debrominated into lower brominated PBDE by PBDE-degrading bacteria. MBC accelerated the debromination of BDE-47 (10.1%) by promoting PBDE-degrading microorganisms, while this was inhibited by SBC (3.5%) due to strong adsorption of BDE-47. In addition, we found that both types of biochar favored Nitrospirae bacteria and promoted N cycling. Overall, biochars from manure and straw can positively shape soil microbial communities differently by altering soil properties, soil fertility and nutrient availability, and the fate and the effects of contaminants, which ultimately led to a difference in the potential of biochars for their use in soil remediation.

AB  - Electric fences are widely used in human-elephant conflict mitigation. However, elephants constantly challenge and overcome fences, which is a growing concern. We studied how elephants crossed the perimeter electric fence around the Udawalawe National Park (UWNP), Sri Lanka. Using camera traps, we monitored 18 fence posts and an open gate in the fence over 605 days from 2016 to 2019. Photographs of 3097 fence crossings were analysed to obtain demographic data for fence crossing elephants, crossing methods, and the daily and seasonal timing of fence crossing. We identified 77 adult males and 12 adult females that crossed the fence, which represent about 17% of the adult elephants in UWNP. Most of the crossings were through the open gate at night. Elephants used a variety of crossing methods, comprised of crossing at the open gate, at previously toppled posts, by crashing through wires and stepping over wires, as well as by using the trunk or forefeet to topple posts. Fence voltage was not a determinant of fence crossing. The frequency and timing of fence crossings varied between locations with later exits and less time spent outside, at crossing points bordering human dominated areas. Our results emphasis on the importance of taking into account the problem solving abilities of elephants in fence design and location, such as energising fence posts and constructing exclosure fences at the boundaries of crop fields and settlements, in employing electric fences to mitigate human-elephant conflict.

AB  - Food webs provide context to understand how ecological communities will respond to environmental change, but revealing their structure typically relies upon time-intensive sampling and analysis of species' diets. As a result, all food web models require some unavoidable simplifications because of limited data availability, whether temporally, spatially, or taxonomically. Large databases of published trophic interactions have made this process somewhat easier, but knowledge gaps persist. We combine the use of databases with extensive field surveys, including gut-content analysis, to generate a food web for Lake George, NY. Including aquatic plants, phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish, our analysis identified 279 genera in the lake involved in 1910 interactions. After removing genera with no identified interactions or improbable interactions and grouping some genera into higher categories, the food web included 49 nodes with 484 interactions among them. The network structure of the inferred Lake George food web exhibits several common patterns such as relatively few trophic levels and the prevalence of tritrophic chains. Our results suggest that constructing food webs from databases provides a useful first step to determine topology. However, in situ sampling allowed us to account for additional interactions, as only 50 of the 106 directly observed interactions between fish and their prey were also found in published databases. Finally, we highlight the need to focus on developing a better understanding of herbivory in lakes, as species interactions among the diverse plankton and macroinvertebrate populations are not well known.

AB  - Fruit and seed predators determine plant populations dynamics and community structure of tropical forests. Its impact can have drastic consequences on the development of plants and their ability to reproduce. Among the main causes of damage to fruits, and seeds, Coleoptera of the Curculionidae and Bruchidae families and other groups of beetles stand out. The research was carried out in the Metropolitan Natural Park (PNM), considered as the "lung of the City of Panama" which has deciduous trees that reach up to 36 m in height and an average annual temperature of 28 degrees C. The work consisted of collecting samples of fruits and seeds of all plant species encountered in the fruiting condition in the park from August 2015 to July 2016. Additionally, flower buds of Anacardium excelsum L. attacked by two species of Anthonomus Germar, 1817 were also included in the analyses. A total of 797 beetles were collected from 3091 samples (seeds, fruits, flower buds) reared at environmental conditions. The Curculionidae and Bruchidae families presented the highest abundance of individuals and species richness. One species of Hypothenemus Westwood, 1836 (Scolytinae), was the most abundant within the Curculionidae family and in the Bruchidae family one species of Acanthoscelides Schilsky, 1905. Tree species such as Oenocarpus mapora H. Karst. 1857 and Guazuma ulmifolia Lam presented higher predation of their fruits or seeds. On average only 5% of dissected seeds were predated across 32 host plant species. In total, 31 genera of beetles were reared from flower buds, seeds, and fruits of 17 plant species. Host-specificity was moderated, with 47% of flower bud, fruit and seed predator genera associated with just one plant species. Sixty one percent of the coleopterans were collected in the dry season (December to March).

AB  - Mercury in wood is an important pool of this heavy metal in forest ecosystems because of its relatively high proportion in the biomass compared to other pools. This paper describes the successful application of a modified methodology for stem disk sampling based on wood particles from stem disks from Donawitz (Styria, Austria; pig iron production), from Brixlegg (Tyrol; former copper and silver mining, copper ore processing and copper recycling), and from Gmunden (Upper Austria; cement production). The maximum mercury concentration in the stem disks from Donawitz (Hinterberg: 20.5 ppb, St. Peter: 9.3 ppb) was recorded in the early 1970s. Several maxima were obtained from the stem disks from Brixlegg: the first was in 1813 (149.9 ppb), potentially even earlier, a second (37.6 ppb) in the late nineteenth century until the late 1920s, and a third local maximum in the 1970s (9.1 ppb), followed by a tendency to decline until the present. A stem disk from Gmunden in Upper Austria showed values of mercury concentrations indicating no increases compared to literature about background sites (& LE; 3.2 ppb). This method revealed trends in mercury concentrations in tree rings originating from several different mercury emission sources in Austria coinciding with information about industrial history (where available) together with a justifiable effort. We therefore recommend it for further investigations on mercury concentrations in tree rings and their changes over time.

AB  - To clarify the effects of stumping on the C, N, and P allocation strategy of Hippophae rhamnoides L. artificial forests at the decaying stage in feldspathic sandstone areas, we tested stumping heights of 0, 10, 15, and 20 cm from the ground (denoted H1, H2, H3, and H4, respectively) with non-stumped trees as a control (CK). The N (LN, RN), P (LP, RP), and N:P (LN:LP, RN:RP) in the leaves and absorptive roots and the C, N, C:N, C:P, and N:P in rhizosphere soils after different treatments all manifested in the order H3 > H2 > H1 > H4 > CK. Among them, the LN and RN of H3 presented the largest amplitudes of increase (31% and 263%, respectively) compared with those of CK. There were very significant allometric relationships between LC and RC (-0.57, trade-off relationship), between LN and RN, and between LP and RP (0.32, 2.01; synergistic relationship) in stumped H. rhamnoides, and the accumulation rates of LC and LN were slower than those of RC and RN. After the stumping, certain correlations were present between the characteristics, except that neither LC nor RC significantly differed across the different treatments. The growth of H. rhamnoides after the different treatments was mainly regulated by P. The stumped H. rhamnoides grew at a faster rate, and the optimal stumping height was 15 cm. These findings are valuable for revegetation and for the prevention and control of soil erosion in feldspathic sandstone areas.

AB  - This study was carried out to examine the effects of Urtica dioica extract on goat cryopreserved semen quality. The ejaculates of Markhoz goats (n = 12) were collected by an electro-ejaculator. The semen was diluted and supplemented with different concentration of aqueous or hydroalcoholic Urtica dioica extract of aerial or root parts as follows: aerial-aqueous (AA15 & mu;g/ml, AA215 & mu;g/ml and AA345 & mu;g/ml); aerial-ethanolic (AE15 & mu;g/ml, AE215 & mu;g/ml and AE345 & mu;g/ml); root aqueous (RA15 & mu;g/ml, RA215 & mu;g/ml and RA345 & mu;g/ml); root-ethanolic (RE15 & mu;g/ml, RE215 & mu;g/ml and RE345 & mu;g/ml) and control (CCC0mg/ml) without additives. After thawing, sperm samples were subjected to viability, acrosome integrity, plasma membrane integrity, motility, sperm chromatin dispersion (SCD) and concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) assays. Addition of AA15 & mu;g/ml to the extender significantly (P < 0.05) improved progressive motility, viability, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, and DNA integrity of the semen samples. Sperm viability and plasma membrane integrity in aqueous extract (both aerial & root parts)-supplemented extenders were relatively higher, as compared to the control. Moreover, a significant decrease in MDA concentration was detected in semen supplemented with Urtica dioica extract treatments. In conclusion, the results indicate that 5 & mu;g/ml of aqueous extract of Urtica dioica aerial part improved sperm quality and could be recommended as an additive to the extender for cryopreservation. This study shows a novel approach in goat semen cryopreservation due to the remarkable influence of Urtica dioica on post-thawed sperm parameters.

AB  - Continuous movement monitoring is a powerful tool for evaluating reintroduction techniques and assessing how well reintroduced animals are adjusting to the wild. However, to date, continuous monitoring has only occurred for large-bodied species capable of carrying heavy tracking devices. In this study we used an automated VHF radio telemetry array to investigate the exploratory behavior and movement patterns of critically endangered ?Alal? (Corvus hawaiiensis), reintroduced to the Island of Hawai?i in 2017. The 11 juvenile ?Alal? we tracked exhibited high site fidelity and initial survival. Over time the birds showed decreased time spent at the supplemental feeders, and transitioned to more focused use of the landscape, suggesting increased foraging on wild food items. Birds with seemingly less spatial neophobia at release also made larger post-release exploratory movements. This study provides the first evidence that 1) supplemental feeding can support site fidelity for reintroduced ?Alal? without restricting a transition to independent foraging, and 2) that pre-release personality metrics may be useful predictors for predicting post-release movements of ?Alal?. Our work is the first to demonstrate the utility and power of automated telemetry for monitoring the reintroduction of small species.

AB  - African savanna elephants use pre-ingestive olfactory cues when making dietary choices, and previous research has observed that elephant diet choice is negatively correlated with vegetation species that contain high concentrations of monoterpenes. However, the frequency and concentration of monoterpenes can vary dramatically across plant species. Thus, we aimed to explore the effects that the odours of individual monoterpenes have on elephant diet choice and how these effects vary with concentration. To do this, we conducted three odour-based choice experiments focusing on eight common monoterpenes found in the woody plants in Southern African savannas. In the first experiment, we tested whether elephant diet choice for a frequently consumed plant (Euclea crispa) was influenced by the addition of the odour of an individual monoterpene at a set concentration. In the second experiment, we explored the relative deterrence of each monoterpene. Lastly, we tested how elephant diet choice varied as a function of the addition of individual monoterpene odours at 5%, 10%, and 20% concentrations. We found that the elephants avoided most individual monoterpenes at high concentrations, with the exception being alpha-pinene. Furthermore, we found that the odours of some individual monoterpenes were, in fact, more deterrent than others. In the third experiment, we found that the elephants avoided beta-pinene, limonene, ocimene, gamma-terpinene, and terpinolene across all concentrations, but only avoided sabinene and linalool at high concentrations. Ultimately, our results show that the odour of individual monoterpenes may deter elephant consumption, but that this deterrent effect depends on both the monoterpene and its concentration.

AB  - In Niokolo Koba National Park (NKNP), in the South East of Senegal, we studied the current spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) population size, density and distribution and assessed human-large carnivores' conflicts. We implemented 26 calling stations operations, installed 87 camera traps and obtained data from tourists, local guides and rangers. In addition, a questionnaire survey was carried out in 31 villages around the park. Our results showed an estimated density from 1.77 to 3.53 spotted hyenas/100 km(2) depending on used response rates (50-100%) with a minimum population size between 144 and 288 individuals. According to the query survey, the spotted hyena is responsible for the majority of livestock predation around the park (87% of all attacks on livestock), followed by African wild dog (6%), lion (4%) and leopard (3%). A total of 63.1% of all attacks were on cattle, while sheep and goats represent the remaining 36.9%. Spotted hyena and lion mainly predated on livestock at night (93.5% and 71.4% of all attacks, respectively) in contrast to predation by African wild dog and leopard, for which the majority of the attacks occurred during the day (63.9% and 62.5%, respectively). Furthermore, there was more livestock killed during the wet season (58% of all attacks) than during the dry season (42% of all attacks). The distribution of conflicts across five sectors surrounding the park illustrate that the West sector is most impacted (49% of all attacks; districts of Linkering and Medina Gounass) followed by the North West (32%; districts of Dialocoto and Missira). Insights into the severity and dynamics of human-wildlife conflict will contribute towards finding effective mitigation measures, minimising loss of livestock and reducing conflicts.

AB  - Understanding the influence of population attributes on genetic diversity is important to advancement of biological conservation. Because bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations vary in size and management history, the species provides a unique opportunity to observe the response of average pairwise kinship, inversely related to genetic diversity, to a spectrum of natural and management influences. We estimated average pairwise kinship of bighorn sheep herds and compared estimates with population origin (native/indigenous/extant or reintroduced), historical minimum count, connectivity, and augmentation history, to determine which predictors were the most important. We evaluated 488 bighorn sheep from 19 wild populations with past minimum counts of 16-562 animals, including native and reintroduced populations that received 0-165 animals in augmentations. Using the Illumina High Density Ovine array, we generated a dataset of 7728 single nucleotide polymorphisms and calculated average pairwise kinship for each population. Multiple linear regression analysis determined that connectivity between populations via dispersal, greater number of animals received in augmentations, and greater minimum count were correlated with lower average pairwise kinship at the population level, and whether the population was extant or reintroduced was less important. Thus, our results indicated that genetic isolation of populations can result in increased levels of inbreeding. By determining that natural and human-assisted gene flow were likely the most important influences of average pairwise kinship at the population level, this study can serve as a benchmark for future management of bighorn sheep populations and aid in identifying populations of genetic concern to define priorities for conservation of wild populations.

AB  - In the face of global concerns about endangered ecosystems, it is vital to identify individual animals. Along these lines, in this work, a Vision Transformer (ViT) based model for sika deer individual recognition using facial data was designed. To get the satisfactory results, both low-level aspects like texture and color must also be considered, in addition to the high-level semantic information. Consequently, it was difficult to get good results by only applying advanced retrieval features. The standard ViT or ViT with ResNet (Residual neural network) as the backbone network may not be the best solution, as the direct patch flattening method of feature embedded in the conventional ViT is not applicable for performing deer face recognition. Therefore, DenseNet (Densely connected convolutional networks) block as Module 1 was used for extracting low-level features. DenseNet layers enable feature reuse through dense connections, and any layer can communicate directly. Thus maximum exchange of information flow between layers in the network is enabled. In Module 2, the mask approach was also used to eliminate extraneous information from the images and reduce interference from complicated backgrounds on the identification accuracy. In addition, the pixel multiplication of the feature map output from the two modules enabled the fusion of the local features with global features, enriching hence the expressiveness of the feature map. Finally, the ViT structure was run through pre-trained. The experimental results showed that the proposed model can reach an accuracy of 97.68% for identifying sika deer individuals and exhibited excellent generalization capabilities. A valid database for the individual identification of sika deer is provided by our work, significantly contributing to the conservation and promotion of the ecosystem.

AB  - BackgroundThe invasive annual grass cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) increases fuel continuity, alters patterns of fire spread, and changes plant communities in sagebrush shrublands of the Great Basin (USA) and adjacent sagebrush steppe, but no studies have contrasted its flammability to native perennial grasses. Understanding cheatgrass flammability is crucial for predicting fire behavior, informing management decisions, and assessing fire risk in invaded areas. This study aimed to determine the flammability of cheatgrass compared to two native perennial grasses (Columbia needlegrass [Achnatherum nelsonii] and bluebunch wheatgrass [Pseudoroegneria spicata]) across a range of fuel moistures.ResultsAll three grass species had decreased flammability with increasing fuel moisture. Columbia needlegrass averaged 11% lower mass consumption than cheatgrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass had longer flaming duration and higher maximum temperatures than cheatgrass and Columbia needlegrass. The addition of cheatgrass to each perennial grass increased combined mass consumption, flaming duration, and flame heights. For these three attributes, the impact differed by the amount of cheatgrass in the mixture. Maximum and mean temperatures during perennial grass combustion were similar with and without cheatgrass addition. Some attributes of Columbia needlegrass flammability when burned with cheatgrass were higher than expected based on the flammability of each species, suggesting that Columbia needlegrass may be susceptible to pre-heating from combustion of cheatgrass. Conversely, the flammability of bluebunch wheatgrass and cheatgrass together had both positive and negative interactive effects, suggesting the impact on joint flammability from cheatgrass differs by perennial grass species.ConclusionsThis study provides experimental evidence supporting previous qualitative observations of cheatgrass flammability. Cheatgrass increased perennial grass sustainability and consumption, suggesting that cheatgrass poses a significant fire threat to native grasses regardless of moisture content. The study provides species-specific insights into flammability, which could be used to inform efforts to prevent or mitigate cheatgrass-induced wildfires.
   AntededentesEl pasto anual invasor conocido como bromo velloso o cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), incrementa la continuidad de los combustibles vegetales, altera el patr & oacute;n de propagaci & oacute;n del fuego, y cambia las comunidades arbustivas de artemisia de la Gran Cuenca (Great Basin de los EEUU) y otros arbustales de estepas adyacentes. Sin embargo, ning & uacute;n estudio ha contrastado su inflamabilidad en relaci & oacute;n con otros pastos perennes nativos. El entender la inflamabilidad del bromo velloso es crucial para predecir el comportamiento del fuego informar sobre decisiones de manejo, y determinar el riesgo de incendio en & aacute;reas invadidas. Este estudio se bas & oacute; en determinar la inflamabilidad del bromo velloso comparada con la de dos gram & iacute;neas nativas, el pasto aguja de la Columbia (Achnatherum nelsonii) y el agroapiro azul (Pseudoroegneria spicata) a trav & eacute;s de un rango de distintos contenidos de humedad de esas especies.ResultadosLas tres especies de pastos decrecieron su inflamabilidad a medida que se incrementaba su contenido de humedad. El pasto aguja de la Columbia promedi & oacute; un 11% menos de consumo de su biomasa que el bromo velloso, mientras que el agropiro azul tuvo una mayor duraci & oacute;n de llama que el pasto aguja de la Columbia o el bromo velloso. La adici & oacute;n del bromo velloso a cada pasto perenne nativo increment & oacute; el consumo de biomasa, y la duraci & oacute;n y longitud de su llama. Para esos tres atributos, el impacto difiri & oacute; en relaci & oacute;n a la cantidad de bromo velloso en la mezcla. Las temperaturas m & aacute;ximas y medias durante la combusti & oacute;n de los pastos perennes fueron similares con o sin la adici & oacute;n del bromo velloso. Algunos atributos de la inflamabilidad del pasto aguja de Columbia, cuando se quemaba junto con el bromo velloso, fueron mayores a los esperados basados en la inflamabilidad de cada especie, lo que sugiere que el pasto aguja de Columbia puede ser susceptible al precalentamiento debido a la combusti & oacute;n del bromo velloso. Contrariamente, la inflamabilidad del agropiro azul junto con el bromo velloso tiene efectos interactivos tanto negativos como positivos, sugiriendo que el impacto de la inflamabilidad conjunta del bromo velloso difiere con la especie de pasto nativo de que se trate.ConclusionesEste estudio provee de evidencia experimental que avala observaciones previas cualitativas sobre la inflamabilidad del bromo velloso. Esta especie incrementa la sostenibilidad y el consumo por el fuego, sugiriendo que el bromo velloso presenta una amenaza significativa para los pastos nativos independientemente de su contenido de humedad. Asimismo, este estudio provee de informaci & oacute;n especie-espec & iacute;fica sobre inflamabilidad, lo que puede ser usado para informar sobre esfuerzos que deben hacerse para prevenir o mitigar los incendios inducidos por el bromo velloso.

AB  - Knowledge about the spectral response of camelina under different regimes of nitrogen (N) fertilization is very scarce. Therefore, 2-year open-field trials were carried out in the 2021 and 2022 growing seasons with the aim of evaluating the spectral response of spring camelina to four different N fertilization regimes by using remote (UAV) and proximal (leaf-clip Dualex) sensing techniques. The tested treatments were: (i) control: no N application (T0); (ii) top dressing: 60 kg N ha(-1) before stem elongation (T1); basal dressing: 60 kg N ha(-1) at sowing (T2); basal + top dressing combination: 60 kg N ha(-1) at sowing + 60 kg N ha(-1) before stem elongation (T3). Camelina seed yield and N use efficiency were strongly affected by fertilization regimes, with the best results obtained at T2. A reduction in plant development and seed yield was detected in 2022, probably due to the rise in air temperatures. A significant effect of both growing season and N fertilization was observed on the photosynthetic pigments content with the T1 highest values in 2022. The highest seed oil content was achieved at T1, while the protein content increased with increasing N, with the best values at T3. Positive and significant correlations were observed among several vegetation indices obtained through UAV flights (NDVI, MRS705, FGCC) and seed yield, as well as between FGCC and leaf N concentration. Overall, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing remote sensing techniques from UAVs for predicting seed yield in camelina.

AB  - Culicoides oxystoma Kieffer (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) transmits many pathogens, including seven viruses, four protozoa and one nematode. This species has a wide distribution range across northern Afro-tropical, Palearctic, Australian, Indo-Malayan realms with a broad host spectrum, including cattle, buffaloes, sheep, pigs, dogs, horses and even humans. The heterogeneous nature of Culicoides' blood-feeding patterns is well documented, but the influence of various host blood meal sources on gut bacterial composition remains scant. Adult midges were collected during April (2023) by operating UV light traps in cattle, buffalo sheds and poultry farm in Purulia (India). Besides C. oxystoma, eleven Culicoides species were collected across the sheds and farm, seven of which are vectors. Culicoides liui Wirth and Hubert and C. thurmanae Wirth and Hubert are reported from India for the first time. In all the sheds, engorged females of C. oxystoma were ubiquitous. Identification of culturable gut bacteria and the host blood meal of C. oxystoma were done through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method. Blood meal analysis confirmed the following hosts: cattle, buffaloes and humans. Identification of blood meal of engorged C. oxystoma caught from poultry farm showed positive results for humans but not for birds. Among bacteria, Bacillus cereus was abundant in all of the engorged females. Bacillus paramycoides and Enterococcus faecium were identified from females feeding on cattle and buffaloes' blood, while Alcaligenes faecalis was found in the gut contents of females that fed on cattle and human blood. The gut bacteria Alcaligenes faecalis exhibited alpha haemolytic activity. In contrast, Bacillus sp., B. cereus, B. flexus, B. licheniformis, B. thuringiensis, B. paramycoides, E. faecium, Paenibacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. exhibited beta haemolysis. This is the first report on the composition of gut bacteria, with particular emphasis on the haemolytic bacteria of C. oxystoma with different host blood meals. The pathogenic bacteria B. cereus, B. licheniformis and A. faecalis within the females could potentially impact pathogen acquisition and increase the probability of their zoonotic transmissibility.

AB  - The encroachment of woody plants into grassland and the conversion of grasslands to woodlands is a worldwide phenomenon and has been regarded as a major global problem for decades. The rate of woody plant encroachment (WPE) varies across biomes and can be influenced by land use activities and climate conditions. As a result, the current study assessed the spatial distribution of woody plants and land use and land cover (LULC) change within the Letaba River catchment in the Limpopo province of South Africa's subtropical region. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite data sets were used to map and quantify WPE and other LULC changes in the Letaba River catchment over a 30-year period (1989-2019). Random forest classifier was used to determine of the rate of change of WPE and LULC within the study area. The results indicated that the Letaba River catchment has undergone a significant change with an increase in woody plant species. The woody plant cover had increased from 36,014 ha in the year 1989 to approximately 561,493 ha by 2019. Meanwhile, grassland has declined by 486,322 ha (33.7%) from 1989 to 2019. The overall classification accuracy (OA) ranged between 91.7% and 95.5%. The study findings will provide critical insights and baseline information about the state of WPE in semi-arid environments, as well as provide catchment managers with the information they need to take the necessary actions to manage the rapid increase in woody plants. However, fire and herbivory are important factors that influences the WPE, and this might have also played an important role in the findings. The study suggests that WPE is an ongoing process and management strategies are required to mitigate and maintain the intensity of woody plants.
   L'envahissement des prairies par les plantes ligneuses et la conversion des prairies en for & ecirc;ts constituent un ph & eacute;nom & egrave;ne mondial et est consid & eacute;r & eacute; comme un probl & egrave;me mondial majeur depuis des d & eacute;cennies. Le taux d'empi & egrave;tement des plantes ligneuses (WPE) varie selon les biomes et peut & ecirc;tre influenc & eacute; par les activit & eacute;s d'utilisation des terres et les conditions climatiques. Par cons & eacute;quent, la pr & eacute;sente & eacute;tude a & eacute;valu & eacute; la distribution spatiale des plantes ligneuses et les changements dans l'utilisation et l'occupation des sols (LULC) dans le bassin versant de la rivi & egrave;re Letaba, dans la province de Limpopo, qui se situe dans la r & eacute;gion subtropicale de l'Afrique du Sud. Les donn & eacute;es des satellites Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) et Operational Land Imager (OLI) ont & eacute;t & eacute; utilis & eacute;es pour repr & eacute;senter et quantifier les changements du WPE et d'autres LULC dans le bassin versant de la rivi & egrave;re Letaba sur une p & eacute;riode de 30 ans (1989-2019). Un classificateur de for & ecirc;ts d'arbres d & eacute;cisionnels a & eacute;t & eacute; utilis & eacute; pour d & eacute;terminer le taux de changement du WPE et de la LULC dans la zone d'& eacute;tude. Les r & eacute;sultats indiquent que le bassin versant de la rivi & egrave;re Letaba a subi un changement consid & eacute;rable avec une augmentation des esp & egrave;ces de plantes ligneuses. La couverture des plantes ligneuses est pass & eacute;e de 36 014 ha en 1989 & agrave; environ 561 493 ha en 2019. Quant aux prairies, elles ont diminu & eacute; de 486 322 ha (33,7 %) entre 1989 et 2019. La pr & eacute;cision globale de la classification (OA) & eacute;tait comprise entre 91,7 % et 95,5 %. Les r & eacute;sultats de l'& eacute;tude fourniront des informations cruciales et des donn & eacute;es de base sur l'& eacute;tat du WPE dans les environnements semi-arides, ainsi que les informations dont les responsables des bassins versants ont besoin pour prendre les mesures n & eacute;cessaires & agrave; la gestion de la croissance rapide des plantes ligneuses. Cependant, les incendies et les herbivores sont des facteurs importants qui influencent le WPE, ce qui pourrait & eacute;galement avoir jou & eacute; un r & ocirc;le important dans les r & eacute;sultats. L'& eacute;tude suppose que le WPE est un processus continu et que des strat & eacute;gies de gestion sont n & eacute;cessaires pour att & eacute;nuer et maintenir l'intensit & eacute; des plantes ligneuses.

AB  - Cross-kingdom interactions with plants were frequently related to microbial pathogens and herbivores. Yet, mutualistic interactions that involve multiple partners can confer cross-kingdom functional benefits, which have been understudied. Ant gardens (AGs) are recognized as one of the most sophisticated of all symbioses between ants and flowering plants, forming good models to study cross-kingdom interactions. The aim of this study was to examine whether ant-plant interactions can influence the community composition of root-associated fungi. We assessed whether two AG ant species, Camponotus femoratus and Neoponera goeldii, confer different physico-chemical properties to their nests, and affect root fungal community composition and fungal functional guilds in the bromeliad Aechmea mertensii. The diversity and community composition of root-associated fungi depended on ant species identity. The two ants had a contrasting influence on the structure and chemistry of the nest, and on the floristic diversity of the AGs. Multiple drivers may therefore determine the root-associated fungal communities. As the outcome of the ant-bromeliad interaction depends on the ant species, and because the plants are also involved in interactions with root-associated symbionts, this study provided evidence that ecologically relevant symbioses can be mediated by cross-kingdom interactions.

AB  - The adverse effects of climate change on sheep farming have become more noticeable in recent decades. Extensive efforts have been made to untangle the complex relationship between heat tolerance, animal health, and productivity, also to identify a resilient and economically suitable breed for selection that can be resilient to future climate change conditions. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we observed the seasonal variations in the expression of several important genes related to heat stress and immunity (HSP70, IL10, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR8) in three of the most widely kept sheep breeds in Hungary: The indigenous Tsigai, Hungarian Merino, and White Dorper. We found that the seasonal stressor affected the relative gene expression of all genes in this study. Notably, The Hungarian indigenous Tsigai was the most robust breed adapted to the Hungarian continental (hot summer, cold winter) environment, with excellent thermotolerance and immunity. Furthermore, despite suffering from heat stress in the summer, Hungarian Merino maintained their robust immune system well throughout the year.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigated the pastoralists' indigenous knowledge on livestock production, trends and their perceptions of rangeland degradation and its indicators in Omaandi, Epukunoyana and Oshitutuma in central northern Namibia. A total of 30 households that own livestock and two elder groups were selected from each communal area. A questionnaire was used to gather household information, and an open-ended discussion was conducted to interview elders. Data were analysed using SPSS statistical software programme (SPSS version 22 2015), where the Friedman's Chi-square test (Steel and Torrie, 1980) was used. The majority of interviewed households in Omaandi (63%), Oshitutuma (53%) and Epukunoyana (50%) were female headed families and the remaining were male headed. The mean population of goats and cattle were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in Omaandi and Epukunoyana than in Oshitutuma village. Household respondents in all villages indicated that all livestock species were primarily kept for wealth status and meat provision for consumption. Respondents in all villages indicated that lack of grazing lands and feed followed by water scarcity and recurring droughts were the primary and secondary constraints of livestock production. Elder respondents regarded overgrazing and climate change as the primary cause of rangeland degradation. Hence, the study concludes that communal rangelands are degraded and degradation resulted in gradual livestock population declining trends over the past years in communal areas, due to feed shortage.

AB  - Research has shown that pigs from different regions exhibit varying responses to cold stimuli. Typically, cold stimuli induce browning of white adipose tissue mediated by adrenaline, promoting non-shivering thermogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying differential response of pig breeds to norepinephrine are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences and molecular mechanisms of the effects of norepinephrine (NE) treatment on adipocytes of Min pigs (a cold-resistant pig breed) and Duroc-Landrace-Yorkshire (DLY) pigs. Real time-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence were performed following NE treatment on cell cultures of adipocytes originating from Min pigs (n = 3) and DLY pigs (n = 3) to assess the expressions of adipogenesis markers, beige fat markers, and mitochondrial biogenesis markers. The results showed that NE did not affect browning of adipocytes in DLY pigs, whereas promoted browning of adipocytes in Min pigs. Further, the expression of ADRB1 (Adrenoceptor Beta 1, ADRB1) was higher in subcutaneous adipose tissue and adipocytes of Min pigs than those of DLY pigs. Overexpression of ADRB1 in DLY pig adipocytes enhanced sensitivity to NE, exhibiting decreased adipogenesis markers, upregulated beige fat markers, and increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Conversely, adipocytes treated with ADRB1 antagonist in Min pigs resulted in decreased cellular sensitivity to NE. Further studies revealed differential CpG island methylation in ADRB1 promoter region, with lower methylation levels in Min pigs compared to DLY pigs. In conclusion, differential methylation of the ADRB1 promoter region leads to different ADRB1 expression, resulting in varying responsiveness to NE in adipocytes of two pig breeds. Our results provide new insights for further analysis of the differential cold responsiveness in pig breeds from different regions.

AB  - Crop coefficient (K-c) is one of the most significant parameters for crop water demand prediction and irrigation scheduling. However, there is a lack of knowledge about water vapor and K-c in tea plantation ecosystems. This study explored and determined the actual evapotranspiration (ETc) and K-c of two cultivars of tea (Camellia sinensis), clone variety Baiye1 (BY1) and Longjing43 (LJ43), based on lysimeter data. An estimation was made for both for ETc and adjusted ETc, and the corresponding K-c and adjusted K-c. The results showed that the adjusted ETc and K-c values revealed a minor fluctuation when compared to the ETc and K-c values during the experimental period, which indicated that the adjusted ETc and K-c values were more precise and practical to field conditions. The average adjusted K-c values were 0.71 (range of 0.43-1.02) for BY1 and 0.84 (range of 0.48-1.22) for LJ43. Additionally, heavy pruning can decrease ETc and K-c values, possibly due to the lower level of LAI after pruning. Moreover, it is clearly manifested that BY1 consistently had lower ETc and K-c values than those of LJ43 because of plant growth status differences between BY1 and LJ43. Overall, our study proposed a reliable reference of K-c in tea plantation, and illuminated the effects of pruning and plant growth differences on K-c, which could provide a strong basis for precise irrigation in tea plantations in a subtropical climate.

AB  - Deciphering the gastrointestinal microbial response to oral SS DNA vaccines with different doses is helpful for identifying the mechanism for effective utilization of the vaccine for improving animal production. Here, we conduct a comparative study with different doses of vaccine (control: empty plasmid; low dose: 1 x 107 CFU vaccine; high dose: 1 x 1012 CFU vaccine) using goat as a case to investigate the potential of somatostatin vaccination from the entire gastrointestinal microbiota perspective. Our results show that body weight gain and slaughter rate are greater in the L_SS group than in the C_SS group. Compared with the C_SS group, the GH concentration is reduced, while the SS concentration is elevated in the cecum of L_SS goats. Moreover, the SCFAs concentration is elevated in the L_SS goats, the acetate molar proportion is lower in the rumen, the proportion of the acetate is decreased, and propionate is increased in the cecum of L_SS goats. Our data indicate that the low-dose somatostatin vaccine possesses a more efficient improvement in the productivity of goats, emphasizing that the dosage should be considered to reach its optimal effect on the host. Moreover, we find that different doses of the SS vaccination select distinct microbial communities in the gastrointestinal tract. Beta diversity analysis shows a significant interaction. Microorganisms capable of converting nutrients, including Ruminococcacease, Butyrivibrio, Akkermansia, and Lachnospiraceae are enriched, altering the gastrointestinal fermentation response to SS DNA vaccination of ruminants. Moreover, the correlation analysis results revealing these biomarkers have a close association with the phenotypes of productivity. These results imply that somatostatin immunoneutralization might directly alter the gastrointestinal tract commensal bacterial structure, improving gastrointestinal homeostasis, and, thus, modifying the fermentability and effected hormone level to improve the productivity of goats. Our study extends the understanding of the somatostatin vaccine regulation of ruminants' growth through the entire gastrointestinal microbial perspective.

AB  - Remote camera use by hunters offers the potential to collect citizen-derived data on multiple species using hunter surveys, but the effectiveness of this approach is untested. We examine whether observations from remote cameras that hunters use at their black bear (Ursus americanus) bait sites and reported via hunter surveys are an effective method to monitor species. We compared data collected from pseudo-bear bait sites established for this study to hunter established bear bait site observations from the same study area. We also quantified observations reported on hunter surveys as a landscape index alternative to white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) hunter indices, gray wolf (Canis lupus) surveys, and mustelid (Mustelidae) trapper indices. We did not detect a difference in hunter-reported camera observations versus our observations for four of the six species recorded at pseudo-bear bait sites. Hunters were over nine times more likely to report photographing wolves and nearly one third as likely to report photographing mustelids. We observed a relationship between trapper survey-derived mustelid indices and the camera-derived index, but not for deer or wolves. Foremost, these results emphasize the need to further evaluate the utility of remote camera data derived from hunters. The widespread use of remote cameras by hunters, the low-cost of hunter surveys, and the potential to collect accurate community composition and occurrence/presence indices, points to the value of adding questions to hunter surveys regarding multiple species of interest.

AB  - The properties of biochar determine its ability to alleviate soil acidity and improve plant growth; however, its key properties remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to screen the key characteristics of biochar that strongly influence soil acidity and plant growth to obtain a better estimation of biochar characteristics that is suitable for acid soil amelioration. Pak choi was selected as the experimental plant in this pot trial. Soil acidity and pak choi biomass were used to estimate the effect of biochar derived from different organic wastes on acid soil amelioration. Pearson's correlation combined with a random forest model analysis was applied to investigate the relationship between the characteristics of biochar and soil acidity or plant growth. The results showed that the presence of biochar altered the soil pH by - 0.2 to 1.7 unit and pak choi biomass yield by - 6% to 314%. The Ca, Mg, and P contents (importance = 34.6%), basic surface functional groups, and BET surface area significantly affected the soil acidity. The properties of biochar, including the Fe content, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), electrical conductivity (EC), and micropores, played pivotal roles in promoting pak choi growth, and the importance of the above properties reached to 53.9% according to random forest model analysis. In addition, all biochars used in this study improved soil fertility by 48.26-113.04%, and the comprehensive benefits of pak choi improved by 34.14-180.11%, especially for sheep dung biochar and bone powder biochar. Biochars with rich pores, abundant Ca, Mg, P, and Fe, high DOC and EC, and basic surface functional groups are favorable for acid soil improvement and pak choi growth. Applying biochar to acid soils may be a promising way to improve the comprehensive benefits of soil fertility and vegetable production.

AB  - Simple Summary This commentary advocates a note of caution with regard to using the manipulation of feed to address and solve cattle's negative impacts on the climate and environment. It identifies some of the potential consequences-intentional and unintentional-of this type of 'solutionism' and proposes a wider discussion about reducing livestock numbers and thinking with planetary boundaries to promote sustainable animal production systems. The argument is illustrated through findings from an interdisciplinary research project on cattle production in Denmark. The increased attention drawn to the negative environmental impact of the cattle industry has fostered a host of market- and research-driven initiatives among relevant actors. While the identification of some of the most problematic environmental impacts of cattle is seemingly more or less unanimous, solutions are complex and might even point in opposite directions. Whereas one set of solutions seeks to further optimize sustainability pr. unit produced, e.g., by exploring and altering the relations between elements kinetically moving one another inside the cow's rumen, this opinion points to different paths. While acknowledging the importance of possible technological interventions to optimize what occurs inside the rumen, we suggest that broader visions of the potential negative outcomes of further optimization are also needed. Accordingly, we raise two concerns regarding a focus on solving emissions through feedstuff development. First, we are concerned about whether the development of feed additives overshadows discussions about downscaling and, second, whether a narrow focus on reducing enteric gasses brackets other relations between cattle and landscapes. Our hesitations are rooted in a Danish context, where the agricultural sector-mainly a large-scale technologically driven livestock production-contributes significantly to the total emission of CO2 equivalents.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an infectious prion disease that infects members of the Cervidae family (i.e., deer) resulting in widespread ecological, economic, and recreational ramifications. We introduce a spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) that integrates individual deer movement and behavior with population and disease dynamics to forecast CWD in populations of free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We use a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Dead (S-E-I-D) epidemiological framework to explore spatiotemporal dynamics of CWD within an agriculturally dominated area in Michigan, USA. The IBM results closely mimicked documented short- and long-term dynamics of white-tailed deer populations and CWD in the Midwestern, USA. We applied pattern-oriented modeling using annual apparent CWD prevalence rates reported by Midwestern state wildlife agencies to validate the disease model. The introduction of a single infected deer to the modeled landscape (93 km2) led to an outbreak of CWD in 100 out of 350 model simulations (29 %); prevalence never exceeded 1.47 % for repetitions where the outbreak ended. For the 100 simulations where disease persisted, the deer population declined by 87 % by year 50 following initial introduction of CWD. Mean (+/- SD) prevalence after 5, 10, 25, and 50 years was 1.1 % (+/- 1.0 %), 3.4 % (+/- 3.3 %), 46.5 % (+/- 18.8 %), and 51.8 % (+/- 18.1 %), respectively, which highly correlated (r = 0.99) with annual CWD prevalence reported in Wisconsin white-tailed deer populations for years 1-21 post initial detection. Combined with a global sensitivity analysis, the IBM indicated that prevalence of CWD at year 20 was most sensitive to harvest rate of yearling and adult female deer and least sensitive to prion shedding rate, prion half-life, and deer group numbers, indicating that deer population parameters were more influential than disease parameters on CWD dynamics. Our IBM serves as a tool to explore and better understand indirect and direct transmission of CWD within free-ranging cervid populations. Users of this model can adjust parameter values to explore how interactions among individual deer and between deer and their environment affect CWD dynamics. This IBM also serves as a framework for applying and assessing spatially and temporally explicit management scenarios.

AB  - The news media can influence how the public learns about environmental issues, including endangered marine species such as sea turtles, which may prompt further information-seeking. However, what people learn through the media can be problematic for conservation efforts if it is misaligned with scientific priorities. Here, we seek to better understand how members of the public learn about sea turtles through the news, assess public perceptions and knowledge about these animals, and evaluate how these variables are associated with information-seeking behavior on their conservation. We surveyed a representative sample of 1162 adults living in the coastal United States and collected information on ocean news consumption, sea turtle interest, risk perceptions of sea turtle population status and individual threat types, self-reported knowledge, and information-seeking behavior. News consumption was associated with interest, risk perceptions of population status, and self-reported knowledge about sea turtles. Although news consumption was not associated with risk perception about individual hazards, individuals generally viewed pollution as a top hazard facing sea turtle populations, which may misalign with scientific understanding. Greater interest, risk perceptions of population status and overall threat, and knowledge was associated with more information-seeking behavior, with knowledge moderating the relationship between risk perceptions of population status and information-seeking behavior. These findings improve understanding of how the public learns about sea turtles through the news media, suggests coupling messaging about sea turtles with their risks may provide more effective conservation messaging, and highlights how educators and conservation stakeholders can use the news as a communication tool.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are an invasive and destructive species throughout many regions of the world. A sodium nitrite (SN) toxic bait is currently used in Australia and being developed for use in the US and other countries to combat the increasing populations of wild pigs. In the US, efforts to modify the Australian SN-toxic bait and baiting strategy have focused on reducing issues with non-target animals accessing the SN-toxic bait spilled outside of bait stations by wild pigs. We tested and compared modifications for efficacy (with wild pigs) and hazards (with non-targets) in north-central Texas, US during summer (July 2021) and winter (March 2023) seasons.
   RESULTS: During both seasons we found that visitation to the bait sites declined 94-99% after deploying the SN-toxic bait, and we found a total of 106 dead wild pigs, indicating considerable lethality for the local population. Prior to deploying the SN-toxic bait, Global Positioning System (GPS)-collared wild pigs were more likely to cease visiting bait sites during summer when foraging resources were abundant. Farrowing decreased visitation to bait sites during the winter. We observed no dead non-targets during summer; winter results showed an average of 5.2 dead migrating birds per bait site (primarily Dark-eye juncos [Junco hyemalis]) from consuming SN-toxic bait spilled by wild pigs. The presence and winter-foraging behaviors of migrating birds appeared to increase hazards for those species.
   CONCLUSION: The current formulation of SN-toxic bait was effective at removing wild pigs during both seasons, however it is clear that different baiting strategies may be required in winter when migrating birds are present. Baiting wild pigs prior to farrowing during the winter, and during drier summers, may further improve efficacy of the bait. Reducing hazards to non-targets could be achieved by refining the SN-toxic bait or modifying bait stations to decrease the potential for spillage, decreasing environmental persistence if spilled, or decreasing attractiveness to migrating birds.

AB  - The juveniles of predatory sea stars can remain in their recruitment-nursery habitat for some time before their ontogenetic shift to the adult habitat and diet. These small juveniles are vulnerable to a range of factors with their sensitivity amplified by climate change-driven ocean warming. We investigate the thermal tolerance of the waiting stage herbivorous juveniles of the keystone coral predator, the crown-of-thorns sea star (COTS, Acanthaster sp.), in context with the degree heating weeks (DHW) model that predicts coral bleaching and mass mortality. In temperature treatments ranging from +1 to 3 degrees C in prolonged heatwave acclimation conditions, the juveniles exhibited similar to 100% survival in DHW scenarios that trigger coral bleaching (4 DHW), resulting in mass mortality of corals (8 DHW) and extreme conditions well beyond those that kill corals (12 DHW). This indicates that herbivorous juvenile COTS are far more resistant to heatwave conditions than the coral prey of the adults. The juveniles exhibited higher activity (righting) and metabolic rate after weeks in increased temperature. In separate acute temperature experiments, the upper thermal limit of the juveniles was 34-36 degrees C. In a warming world, juvenile COTS residing in their coral rubble nursery habitat will benefit from an increase in the extent of this habitat due to coral mortality. The juveniles have potential for long-term persistence as herbivores as they wait for live coral to recover before becoming coral predators, thereby serving as a proximate source of COTS outbreaks on reefs already in a tenuous state due to climate change.

AB  - We report a new record of Rhinoclemmys punctularia (Daudin, 1801), extending the geographic dis-tribution of this species by 450 km towards the south to the Araguaia River in the state of Para, Brazil. The new record comes from an ecotonal area of the Cerrado and Amazon biomes, which indicates a possible adaptability of this species in fragmented environments and in agricultural areas. These new findings help enable future investi-gations better understand the distribution of R. punctularia in the southern Amazon Basin and in ecotones.

AB  - Recent theories suggest that reduced serotonin transporter (5-HTT) function, which increases serotonin (5-HT) levels at the synapse, enhances neural plasticity and affects sensitivity to environmental cues. This may promote learning about emotionally relevant events. However, the boundaries that define such emotional learning remain to be established. This was investigated using 5-HTT knockout (5-HTTKO) mice which provide a model of long-term elevated 5-HT transmission and are associated with increased anxiety. Compared to wild-type controls, 5-HTTKO mice were faster to discriminate between an auditory cue that predicted footshock (CS+) and a cue predicting no footshock (CS-). Notably, this enhanced discrimination performance was driven not by faster learning that the CS+ predicted footshock, but rather by faster learning that the CS- cue signals the absence of footshock and thus provides temporary relief from fear/anxiety. Similarly, 5-HTTKO mice were also faster to reduce their fear of the CS+ cue during subsequent extinction. These findings are consistent with facilitated inhibitory learning that predicts the absence of potential threats in 5-HTTKO mice. However, 5-HTTKO mice also exhibited increased generalisation of fear learning about ambiguous aversive cues in a novel context, different from the training context. Thus, 5-HTTKO mice can exhibit both more and less fear compared to wild-type controls. Taken together, our results support the idea that loss of 5-HTT function, and corresponding increases in synaptic 5-HT availability, may facilitate learning by priming of aversive memories. This both facilitates inhibitory learning for fear memories but also enhances generalisation of fear.

AB  - To gain insight into whale shark (Rhincodon typus) movement patterns in the Western Indian Ocean, we deployed eight pop-up satellite tags at an aggregation site in the Arta Bay region of the Gulf of Tadjoura, Djibouti in the winter months of 2012, 2016, and 2017. Tags revealed movements ranging from local-scale around the Djibouti aggregation site, regional movements along the coastline of Somaliland, movements north into the Red Sea, and a large-scale (>1,000 km) movement to the east coast of Somalia, outside of the Gulf of Aden. Vertical movement data revealed high occupation of the top ten meters of the water column, diel vertical movement patterns, and deep diving behavior. Long-distance movements recorded both here and in previous studies suggest that connectivity between the whale sharks tagged at the Djibouti aggregation and other documented aggregations in the region are likely within annual timeframes. In addition, wide-ranging movements through multiple nations, as well as the high use of surface waters recorded, likely exposes whale sharks in this region to several anthropogenic threats, including targeted and bycatch fisheries and ship-strikes. Area-based management approaches focusing on seasonal hotspots offer a way forward in the conservation of whale sharks in the Western Indian Ocean.

AB  - Simple Summary Greenhouse gas emissions from ruminants contribute to global warming. "ManleCO(2)" is an empirical model that simulates different management aspects in dairy sheep and goat farming, linking milk production to farming and environmental health. The carbon footprint of 1 L of fat- and protein-corrected milk varied from 2.01 to 5.62 kg CO(2)e. Simulation scenarios showed a higher reduction in GHG emissions associated with animal feeding strategies and a lower reduction associated with farming management strategies. ManleCO(2) may provide useful information for planning and developing different strategies that might support the reduction of GHG emissions at the dairy sheep and goat farm level. The first goal of this work was the description of a model addressed to quantify the carbon footprint in Spanish autochthonous dairy sheep farms (Manchega group), foreign dairy sheep farms (foreigners group: Lacaune and Assaf breeds), and Spanish autochthonous dairy goat farms (Florida group). The second objective was to analyze the GHG emission mitigation potential of 17 different livestock farming practices that were implemented by 36 different livestock farms, in terms of CO(2)e per hectare (ha), CO(2)e per livestock unit (LU), and CO(2)e per liter of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). The study showed the following results: 1.655 kg CO(2)e per ha, 6.397 kg CO(2)e per LU, and 3.78 kg CO(2)e per liter of FPCM in the Manchega group; 12.634 kg CO(2)e per ha, 7.810 CO(2)e kg per LU, and 2.77 kg CO(2)e per liter of FPCM in the Foreigners group and 1.198 kg CO(2)e per ha, 6.507 kg CO(2)e per LU, and 3.06 kg CO(2)e per liter of FPCM in Florida group. In summary, purchasing off-farm animal feed would increase emissions by up to 3.86%. Conversely, forage management, livestock inventory, electrical supply, and animal genetic improvement would reduce emissions by up to 6.29%, 4.3%, 3.52%, and 0.8%, respectively; finally, an average rise of 2 degrees C in room temperature would increase emissions by up to 0.62%.

AB  - In order to investigate the effect of compound antibiotics on anaerobic digestion of chicken manure, the inhibitory effect of three different combinations of oxytetracycline (OTC), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), and enrofloxacin (ENR) on anaerobic digestion of chicken manure was studied by the sequencing batch method. Under the condition of adding three different combinations of antibiotics, the experiment was run for 50 days. The concentrations of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), VFAs, and methane production in the reactor were measured, and the microbial diversity affecting the stability of the system was analyzed. The results showed that OTC and SMZ inhibited methane production, while SMZ and ENR promoted methane production, and the cumulative methane production was R4>R3>R1>R2. After the 25th day, the SCOD concentration in the R2 and R4 groups decreased, which was due to the existence of SMZ and ENR promoting the degradation of SCOD. TAN concentrations in the four groups were kept between 1,190 and 2,100 mg/L. The results of 16S rRNA sequencing showed that the mixed antibiotics had different effects on the bacterial community, which was mainly composed of Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, unidentified bacteria, Cloacimonadota, Proteobacteria, and Spirochaetota. Bacteroidota was superior in the whole reaction process under the influence of OTC and SMZ because it stimulated the microbial flora and made its activity higher. The study provides relevant data for the proper management of livestock manure.

AB  - Simple Summary Boar spermatozoa can be exposed to many harmful factors. The low antioxidant capacity of spermatozoa makes them susceptible to reactive oxygen species. The protection of spermatozoa from these harmful effects lies in the seminal plasma, which is enriched by antioxidant enzymes. This study aimed to measure the antioxidant status of boar seminal plasma, and to determine spermatozoa DNA status, and the total number of motile spermatozoa after the concurrent joint application in the boars' diet of two commercial products with antioxidative potential. The study was conducted on a commercial pig farm located in Serbia. Thirty Duroc or Landrace breed boars were randomly selected for this study. The experimental group was fed a compound feed with added organic selenium and Oxynat 3D. The antioxidant status parameters of boar seminal plasma were evaluated using a biochemical analyzer and commercial Randox kits. The sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) using flow cytometry (FC) provided information about spermatozoa's DNA status. Additionally, the total number of motile spermatozoa and spermatozoa kinematic parameters were measured using the computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system. The aim of this study was to improve the parameters of semen by combining two preparations that have a potential antioxidant effect, but also to establish the level of various antioxidant enzymes in native sperm. There was no statistically significant difference in total antioxidant capacity and glutathione peroxidase activity in the seminal plasma obtained from the experimental and control groups of boars. Regarding the superoxide dismutase activity, the research results showed a difference in the control group compared to the experimental one. Moreover, spermatozoa DNA fragmentation and the total number of motile spermatozoa showed statistically significant lower and higher values, respectively, in experimental compared to the control groups. The combination of these two preparations shows significantly enhanced vital parameters of semen. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first in which the ejaculate parameters were examined after the application of a combination of these two antioxidant supplements.

AB  - The intestinal barrier is a critical defense against external pathogens and plays a central role in immune regulation and nutrient absorption. Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in high-altitude environments can exacerbate the damage to the intestinal barrier in Baimei ternary pigs. Anthocyanin extract of Lycium ruthenicum Murray (AEL), has garnered widespread attention due to its rich anthocyanin flavonoid content, which exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These properties help alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby enhancing gut function in animals. Based on this, the study employed Bamei ternary pigs and supplemented their basic diet with varying concentrations of AEL to investigate its impact on gut barrier function. The results demonstrated that AEL inhibited key factors of the intestinal Toll-like receptor pathway, including Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 6 (TRAF6), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), affecting gene transcription and protein expression levels. This led to a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), an increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 production, and improved antioxidant capacity by enhancing total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, while decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Additionally, AEL improved intestinal morphology and facilitated the transcription and expression of tight junction proteins, including zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), claudin-1 (CLDN-1), and occludin (OCLN). AEL also elevated the transcription levels of mucin 1 (MUC1) and mucin 2 (MUC2), as well as the secretion levels of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) and secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA), while increased the number of intestinal goblet cells. Furthermore, dietary supplementation with AEL altered the structure of the intestinal microbiota, enhancing the abundance of beneficial bacterial genera such as Verrucomicrobiaceae, Rikenellaceae, Butyricicoccaceae, UCG-005,Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group,norank_f_Ruminococcaceae,Eubacterium_oxidoreducens_group, thereby promoting the production of intestinal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). In conclusion, AEL inhibits the Toll-like receptor pathway, reduces the production of inflammatory factors, enhances antioxidant levels, improves intestinal morphology and microbiota structure,, thereby reinforcing intestinal barrier function.

AB  - The density of insect herbivores is regulated by top-down factors (e.g., natural enemies), bottom-up effects (e.g., plant defenses against herbivory), or a combination of both. As such, understanding the relative importance of these factors can have important implications for the establishment of effective management options for invasive species. Here, we compared the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up factors on the abundance of hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae. HWA is invasive in eastern North America, but its native range includes the Pacific Northwest of North America where it has co-evolved with western hemlock, Tsuga heterophylla. Eastern hemlock, Tsuga canadensis, can also be found planted in city and park settings in the Pacific Northwest and the presence of both host species allowed us to directly compare the importance of predators (top-down) and host plant resistance (bottom-up) on HWA abundance by placing mesh exclusion bags on branches of both species and monitoring HWA abundance over two years. We found no evidence for bottom-up control of HWA on western hemlock (a native host). HWA established more readily on that species than on eastern hemlock on which it is a major pest in eastern North America. We found strong evidence for top-down control in that both summer and winter-active predators significantly reduced HWA densities on the branches of both tree species where predators were allowed access. These findings support the validity of the biological control program for HWA, the goal of which is to reduce outbreak populations of HWA in eastern North America.

AB  - Pterodroma leucoptera caledonica is a subspecies of Gould's Petrel endemic to New Caledonia. Its distribution, abundance and breeding biology are poorly known. Extensive surveys of New Caledonia between 1994 and 2014 located only two breeding colonies, and a further likely, but still unconfirmed; the total estimated size of the population could be of the order of 5000-7000 breeding pairs. Nesting burrows were situated either near streams or on slopes near ridges. The breeding phenology of caledonica was similar to that of the Australian leucoptera, but with a breeding calendar that lagged that of leucoptera by 2-4 weeks depending on year and breeding parameter. Breeding success was low, with evidence of a high level of predation of eggs, chicks and adults by rats, pigs and cats. Pigs also destroyed nesting burrows. Permanent bait stations installed to control rats at one colony appeared successful, but the control of pigs and cats is much more problematic. If, as expected, the level of predation observed at one colony extends across all breeding colonies, population decline is inevitable and extinction likely in the long term. With no populations of P. l. caledonica on predator-free offshore islands, translocation to such sites may be evaluated to safeguard this subspecies. In the meantime, we recommend that the global status of Gould's Petrel Pterodroma leucoptera be upgraded from Vulnerable to Endangered.

AB  - Infrared thermography (IRT) is an essential non-invasive method for analyzing surface temperature variations in animals, offering valuable insights into livestock stress responses. Despite their resilience, goats can face significant challenges under extreme conditions like heat-stress and water deprivation. This experiment aimed to delineate the dynamic variations in whole-body and scrotal surface temperatures in goats subjected to the combined impact of both conditions using IRT. Eight healthy Aardi bucks were exposed to three 72-h treatments: euhydration, dehydration, and rehydration. Continuous meteorological monitoring provided ambienttemperature, relative-humidity, and temperature-humidity index (THI) values. Surface temperatures were measured twice daily at 08:00 and 15:00, and thermal gradients between ambient and body or scrotal surface temperatures were computed. Based on the obtained mean THI values, the bucks experienced heat-stress throughout the experiment. Additionally, results revealed noticeable variations in both surface temperatures across treatments and time points, indicated by measures of central tendency, variability, shape descriptors, and frequency distribution of temperature. Morning measurements indicated lower temperatures and gradients under euhydration, while water deprivation led to higher temperatures and compromised thermal regulation. Conversely, afternoon data showed higher variability in temperature responses, highlighting the compounded effect of diurnal heat-stress and water deprivation. Although water-restoration mitigated some effects of deprivation, it did not fully restore thermal homeostasis to euhydrated levels. Thermal gradients further emphasized the goats' dynamic thermoregulatory mechanisms, which were compromised under water deprivation, particularly in the scrotal region, but were partially restored upon restoration. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of IRT in assessing thermal responses in goats and underscore the importance of adequate hydration for maintaining thermal balance under heat-stress. The herein performed profiling provides valuable insights with implications for overall health, reproductive efficiency, productivity, and welfare in heat-stressed and water-deprived goats, which might offer a framework for future research on livestock adaptation to such challenging environmental conditions.

AB  - Animal manure can be used as a source of nutrients in cropping systems throughout the world. However, in subtropical climates, the impacts of animal manure application over multiple years on crop productivity and on the total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks in the soil profile are not well understood. In this study, we aimed to evaluate how animal manure application carried out over more than 17 years can impact corn productivity and TOC and TN stocks in different soil layers. This long-term study was conducted from 2004 to 2021 under no-till conditions in southern Brazil. The treatments included pig slurry (PS), cattle slurry (CS), pig deep litter (PDL), mineral fertilizer (NPK) and a control (no fertilizer application). To determine soil TOC and TN stocks, soil samples were collected from the 0.00-0.10, 0.10-0.20, 0.20-0.30, 0.30-0.40 and 0.40-0.50 m layers in December 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020. Corn productivity was evaluated for the 2008/09, 2012/13, 2016/17, and 2020/21 crops. The highest yields and TOC and TN stocks were observed in soils with pig deep litter and cattle slurry application. In the sandy soil under a no-till system after 26 animal manure applications over 17 years, the highest TOC and TN stocks were observed in the 0.00-0.10 m layer. On average, the TOC stocks obtained for the 0.00-0.10 m layer were 11.21, 14.88, 15.82, 22.59 and 15.16 Mg ha-1 for the control, PS, CS, PDL and NPK treatments, respectively. The soil TN stocks in the 0.00-0.10 m layer were 1.06, 1.40, 1.65, 2.03 and 1.43 Mg ha-1 for the control, PS, CS, PDL and NPK treatments, respectively. The application of pig deep litter to the soil over 17 years resulted in a notable increase in TOC and TN levels, playing a crucial role in increasing the productivity of maize crops.

AB  - Coprophilous fungal spores are an emerging and potential proxies for indicating the long-term pastoral history. However, the indication of coprophilous fungal spores for dung and grazing intensity remains uncertain. In this study, in Horqin Sandy Land, 27 livestock dung samples and 33 surface soil samples were collected, and the indication of coprophilous fungal spores was discussed for the first time. The results showed that a total of 38 fungal spore types were recognized in the modern samples from the Horqin Sandy Land, including seven coprophilous fungal spore types. The coprophilous fungi assemblages vary in different dung types and may enable the diagnosis of specific livestock taxa. Coprophilous fungal spores, especially Sporormiella and Podospora are the most reliable dung indicators and can indicate the presence of herbivores. Moreover, some fungal spores, including Helminthosporium, Apiosordaria, HdV-104, and Glomus A were also potential indicators of grazing activities in the Horqin Sandy Land. On this basis, the concentration of coprophilous fungal spores may have the potential to be a quantitative indicator of grazing intensity. This study clarifies the indication of coprophilous fungal spores on dung and grazing intensity in the Horqin Sandy Land and provides a theoretical reference for further research on pastoral history in the region.

AB  - Oxalis pes-caprae is one of the most widespread invasive plants in the Mediterranean areas, especially in central and southern Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia. It is an herbaceous species of South African origin, very common in uncultivated areas, in meadows, and at the edges of roads but also in vegetable gardens and fields, where it can become a weed. Its negative impact on the economic sector is significant due to the presence of large quantities of oxalates, which are toxic and dangerous for grazing livestock; the ingestion of high amounts of oxalates causes the accumulation of oxalate crystals, which can lead to kidney failure and anuria. This work represents a descriptive, field-based case report of epidemiological relevance, describing two cases of acute and chronic poisoning by Oxalis pes-caprae found in two different sheep farms in southern Sardinia. In February 2024, the sudden death of about 40 animals was reported in a sheep farm. On another farm, seven animals died (between March and July 2024), while others showed poisoning symptoms such as weight loss, submandibular edema, and a barrel-shaped abdomen. This manuscript aims to highlight the damage caused by poor attention in pasture management and the importance of seasonal risk management; it is necessary to pay attention to the herbaceous species present in pastures, especially in our region, where climatic temperatures no longer respect seasonality and herbaceous species that normally grow in spring are easily found also in the winter months.

AB  - Increasing risk of pathogen spillover coupled with overall declines in wildlife population abundance in the Anthropocene make infectious disease a relevant concern for species conservation worldwide. While emerging molecular tools could improve our diagnostic capabilities and give insight into mechanisms underlying wildlife disease risk, they have rarely been applied in practice. Here, employing a previously reported gene transcription panel of common immune markers to track physiological changes, we present a detailed analysis over the course of both acute and chronic infection in one wildlife species where disease plays a critical role in conservation, bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Differential gene transcription patterns distinguished between infection statuses over the course of acute infection and differential correlation (DC) analyses identified clear changes in gene co-transcription patterns over the early stages of infection, with transcription of four genes-TGFb, AHR, IL1b and MX1-continuing to increase even as transcription of other immune-associated genes waned. In a separate analysis, we considered the capacity of the same gene transcription panel to aid in differentiating between chronically infected animals and animals in other disease states outside of acute disease events (an immediate priority for wildlife management in this system). We found that this transcription panel was capable of accurately identifying chronically infected animals in the test dataset, though additional data will be required to determine how far this ability extends. Taken together, our results showcase the successful proof of concept and breadth of potential utilities that gene transcription might provide to wildlife disease management, from direct insight into mechanisms associated with differential disease response to improved diagnostic capacity in the field.

AB  - Carrion production is one of the most crucial yet neglected and understudied processes in food webs and ecosystems. In this study, we performed a large-scale estimation of the maximum potential production and spatial distribution of ungulate carrion biomass from five major sources in peninsular Spain, both anthropogenic (livestock, big game hunting, roadkills) and natural (predation, natural mortality). Using standardized ungulate carrion biomass (kg/year/100km(2)) estimates, we evaluated the relationship between ungulate carrion production and two ecosystem-level factors: global human modification (GHM) and primary productivity (NDVI). We found that anthropogenic carrion sources supplied about 60 times more ungulate carrion biomass than natural sources (mean = 90,172 vs. 1533 kg/year/100km(2), respectively). Within anthropogenic carrion sources, livestock was by far the major carrion provider (91.1% of the annual production), followed by big game hunting (7.86%) and roadkills (0.05%). Within natural carrion sources, predation of ungulates provided more carrion (0.81%) than natural mortality (0.13%). Likewise, we found that the spatial distribution of carrion differed among carrion sources, with anthropogenic carrion being more aggregated in space than natural carrion. Our models showed that GHM was positively related to carrion production from livestock and roadkills, and that wild ungulate carrion supplied by natural sources and big game hunting was more frequently generated in more productive areas (higher NDVI). These findings indicate a disconnection between the main ungulate carrion source (livestock) and primary productivity. Ongoing socio-economic changes in developed countries (for example increase of intensive livestock husbandry and rewilding processes) could lead to additional alteration of carrion production processes, with potential negative impacts at the community and ecosystem levels. Overall, we highlight that carrion biomass quantification should be considered a crucial tool in evaluating ecosystem health and delineating efficient ecosystem management guidelines in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Heat stress is major welfare concern during transport of pigs in tropical climates, which can also lead to direct production costs. This study evaluated the dynamics of heat zones through the load and their relationship with heat stress of weaner pigs during road transport in a tropical climate. Both environmental (e.g. temperature and relative humidity) and physiological (e.g. respiratory frequency and lactate) measures were recorded from four vehicle journeys (70 km distance, 216 weaner pigs within each trailer load) within Ceara, northeastern Brazil. Geostatistics and fluid dynamics simulation techniques were applied to understand the dynamics of heat zones and ventilation patterns the truckload. Statistics based on canonical discriminant analysis and ANOVA were performed to verify the relationship between heat zones and heat stress in pigs. The results showed that, during transport, the generation of heat zones occurred with different magnitudes along the load (P < 0.05), which was harmonized by the ventilation dynamics. There was a heat core with high energy content, in the front region of the lower deck (LD) of the trailer. In this zone, weaners pigs had higher rectal temperature (+1.8 degrees C temperature difference), respiratory frequency (LD = 94 +/- 1.3 breaths/min; UD = 86 +/- 1.3 breaths/min), and blood cortisol concentration (LD = 32.9 +/- 0.8 ng/mL; UD = 30.18 +/- 0.6 ng/mL) (all P < 0.05). Weaners pigs transported in the upper deck (UD) compartments had the highest skin temperature (LD = 38.13 +/- 0.3 degrees C; UD = 38.9 +/- 0.22 degrees C) and the highest mean values of blood lactate (LD = 65.5 +/- 1.11 m/M; UD = 71.60 +/- 1.19 m/M) and Creatine kinase (LD = 3891.23 +/- 69U/L; UD = 4107.43 +/- 62U/L) (P < 0.05). Weaners transported in compartments of the LD of trailer were more susceptible to heat stress, while weaners in the UD compartments were more susceptible to physical stress and muscle exhaustion. These results provide additional evidence of heat zones within trailer compartments and highlight the requirement for the planning of pig transport operations in tropical climates to mitigate risks of heat stress.

AB  - Simple Summary Tick infestation and vector-mediated transmission of pathogens thereof challenge the production and health of extensively reared farm animals, causing substantial economic losses and poor welfare. Adverse effects of tick infestation have been documented in cows and sheep. However, relevant studies in goats are scarce. To address this dearth of knowledge, we investigated the association between hard tick infestation, milk production and udder health traits of extensively reared dairy goats in Greece. Tick infestation was significantly associated with impaired udder health, but not with milk yield and quality. Evidence-based tick mitigation strategies in goats are necessary to enhance animal health status and reduce the risk of public health issues deriving from tick-borne pathogen infections. Extensively reared ruminants are seasonally exposed to ticks. Tick-related production losses and health issues have been well documented in cows and sheep but not in goats where relevant literature is scarce. The objective here was to investigate the association of hard tick infestation with milk production and udder health of dairy goats reared extensively. A cross-sectional study was carried out during May and June, in two dairy goat farms. The farms were located in Central and Northern Greece and were representative of typical extensive production systems. A total of 304 goats (n = 152 from each farm) were randomly selected. Each goat was examined for presence of hard ticks. Daily milk yield and quality characteristics were recorded. Udder health status was determined by milk somatic cell count (SCC) and total viable count (TVC). Tick infestation prevalence was 28.6%; it was associated with a significant (p < 0.001) increase in SCC and TVC (84.0% and 78.6%, respectively). The latter meant that infested goats were 3.7 times more prone to udder health problems (p < 0.001). There were not any significant effects (p > 0.05) on milk production. Overall, results suggest that control of tick infestation in extensively reared dairy goat herds is important for enhancing health and welfare status.

AB  - Plant chemodiversity, the diversity of plant-specialized metabolites, is an important dimension of biodiversity. However, there are so far few mathematical models to test verbal hypotheses on how chemodiversity evolved. Here, we develop such a model to test predictions of five hypotheses: the 'fluctuating selection hypothesis', the 'dominance reversal hypothesis', the interaction diversity hypothesis, the synergy hypothesis, and the screening hypothesis. We build a population genetic model of a plant population attacked by herbivore species whose occurrence fluctuates over time. We study the model using mathematical analysis and individual-based simulations. As predicted by the 'dominance reversal hypothesis', chemodiversity can be maintained if alleles conferring a defense metabolite are dominant with respect to the benefits, but recessive with respect to costs. However, even smaller changes in dominance can maintain polymorphism. Moreover, our results underpin and elaborate predictions of the synergy and interaction diversity hypotheses, and, to the extent that our model can address it, the screening hypotheses. By contrast, we found only partial support for the 'fluctuating selection hypothesis'. In summary, we have developed a flexible model and tested various verbal models for the evolution of chemodiversity. Next, more mechanistic models are needed that explicitly consider the organization of metabolic pathways.

AB  - Mitigating the predicted impacts of climate change requires rapid expansion of renewable energy production, including Utility-Scale Solar Energy (USSE) on an unprecedented scale. In the US, a significant share of planned USSE targets working lands-particularly farms and ranches-yet the decision factors informing private landowners' decisions to host USSE on their lands are little understood. Our research addresses this gap through a qualitative case study of working lands in California's San Joaquin Valley and San Francisco Bay Area, based on 60 interviews with farmers and ranchers, solar developers, and community and government organizations. Applying land system science and agricultural decision-making theory, we find that landowner decisions to host USSE are based on profit-maximization, water availability, visual and ecological landscape values, and agricultural land preservation ethic. Solar interest varies across landowner types, with farmers typically maximizing operational income while maintaining agricultural production, and ranchers often prioritizing lifestyle-related landscape benefits. The current feasibility of integrating solar with agriculture appears to be low beyond sheep grazing, with benefits and drawbacks discussed in detail. Optimal areas for future USSE development include farmlands with declining water availability, lands without permanent crops or high amenity value, and regions with energy-intensive agricultural operations. Study findings can inform state land use planning and community engagement by solar developers.

AB  - The survival advantage of group living remains poorly understood. Here, this was investigated by using several physiological and neurobehavioral traits in Indian house crows (Corvus splendens) in the face of a temporally disrupted day-night environment. Crows were housed singly or with two other conspecifics and subjected to daily 12-h light and 12-h periods of complete (0 lx) or dimly lighted (similar to 6 lx) dark nights. Nocturnal melatonin and sleep levels were measured as indices of the direct and circadian effects, while mood (feeding, preening, and self-mutilation) and cognition (innovative problem-solving task) performances were considered reflecting the higher-order brain function effects. Under 6-lx dim light at night (dLAN) condition, group housing alleviated the depressive-like responses and enhanced cognitive performance but had no effect on the midnight melatonin levels and nocturnal sleep consolidation. Concurrently, there were increased nr4a2 and decreased tnfr1 gene expressions in hippocampus, increased dcx and darpp-32 gene expressions in the nidopallium caudolaterale, and th expression in midbrain. We interpret that an increased conspecific interaction improved mood and cognitive performance without affecting the melatonin secretion and sleep in communally roosting house crows. Perhaps, living with conspecifics is part of an overall evolutionary strategy to enhance the survival in a highly social species like the Indian house crow.

AB  - Thirty lactating buffaloes (650 +/- 50 kg average body weight, in the first to the fifth seasons of lactation, 127 +/- 4 Days in milking and average of 12.32 +/- 1.13 kg daily milk yield) were divided into three similar groups to evaluate the effect Lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product (LAFP) commercially named (Culbac (R)) on nutrients digestibility, milk yield and composition, blood biochemistry and immune system response of the animals. Culbac (R) was added at 0, 10 and 20g/h/d in G1 (control), G2 and G3, respectively. Digestion coefficients of the most nutrients and nutritive value did not significantly (P<0.05) differ between G2 and G1. However, G3 recorded lower values. WBCs, RBCs, Ht, Hb, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils and neutrophils were not affected by treatment. Culbac (R) significantly (P<0.05) decreased blood concentration of ALT, AST, cholesterol, triglyceride and urea compared with control. While, lymphocyte transformation and phagocytic index were increased by (18 and 23%) and (20 and 62 %), respectively for G2 and G3 compared with G1. Average daily milk yield was increased by 2.23 kg/d and 0.9 kg/d in G2 and G3, respectively compared with G1. It could be concluded that addition of 10 g LAFP/h/d seems to be profitable whereas, it increased milk yield, improved feed efficiency and enhanced immune system response without significant effect on digestibility and milk composition. While, overdose of LAFP might have a negative effect on digestibility.

AB  - Simple Summary Subacute rumen acidosis (SARA) is a significant clinical issue in high-yield livestock, including dairy sheep, and it is characterized by rumen pH dropping below 5.8 for at least four hours daily. This condition leads to economic losses due to reduced milk production and lower milk fat content. High-concentrate, low-fiber diets increase the risk of SARA by disrupting rumen fermentation. Diagnosing SARA is challenging, with rumen fluid pH measurement being the gold standard. This study investigated the prevalence of SARA and its impact in forty-two Greek dairy sheep flocks, as well as the potential of computerized rumen colorimetry as a diagnostic tool post mortem. Over nine months, rumen pH and milk composition were monitored, and rumen wall samples were analyzed for color and histological changes. The results showed increased epithelium thickness and discoloration in SARA-affected sheep. This study highlights the prevalence of SARA in the modern intensive dairy sheep industry, underscores the need for balanced feeding strategies, and suggests computerized rumen colorimetry as a promising tool for SARA detection and management in dairy sheep farms.Abstract Subacute rumen acidosis (SARA) is a current issue in intensive livestock farming, and it is particularly associated with feeding high-concentrate diets. This study investigated the prevalence and impact of SARA in forty-two Greek dairy sheep flocks by recording rumen pH, milk composition, and milk yield over a period of nine months. Moreover, it explored the use of computerized rumen colorimetry as a management and diagnostic tool for SARA in dairy sheep. In culled ewes, computerized rumen mucosal colorimetry was applied, and rumen wall samples taken for histological examination. SARA cases were identified in 19 farms (45%, n = 42). Farms with SARA cases had lower milk fat levels, while milk yield and milk protein levels did not differ based on the SARA status of the farms. In culled ewes, rumen color was significantly associated with the flock's SARA status, and affected ewes showed increased thickness in non-keratinized and total epithelial layers. It was concluded that computerized rumen mucosal colorimetry in aged, culled ewes shows promise as an indicator, post mortem, of SARA present in dairy sheep flocks whose impact can be minimized by making significant changes in dietary management.

AB  - Truffles (Tuber spp.) are well-known as edible ectomycorrhizal mushrooms, and some species are one of the most expensive foods in the world. During the fruiting process, truffles produce hypogeous ascocarps; a trained pig or dog is needed to locate the ascocarps under the ground. Truffles in northern Thailand have been recorded in association with Betula alnoides and Carpinus poilanei. In this study, we investigated the soil mycobiota diversity of soil samples from both of these truffle host plants in native forests using environmental DNA metabarcoding to target the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of the rDNA gene for the purposes of investigation of truffle diversity and locating truffles during the non-fruiting phase. In this study, a total of 38 soil samples were collected from different locations. Of these, truffles had been found at three of these locations. Subsequently, a total of 1341 putative taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained. The overall fungal community was dominated by phylum-level sequences assigned to Ascomycota (57.63%), Basidiomycota (37.26%), Blastocladiomycota (0.007%), Chytridiomycota (0.21%), Glomeromycota (0.01%), Kickxellomycota (0.01%), Mortierellomycota (2.08%), Mucoromycota (0.24%), Rozellomycota (0.01%), Zoopagomycota (0.003%), and unidentified (2.54%). The results revealed that six OTUs were determined to be representative and belonged to the genus Tuber. OTU162, OTU187, OTU447, and OTU530 belonged to T. thailandicum, T. lannaense, T. bomiense, and T. magnatum, whereas OTU105 and OTU720 were acknowledged as unrecognized Tuber species. From 38 locations, OTUs of truffles were found in 33 locations (including three previously known truffle locations). Thus, 30 collection sites were considered new locations for T. thailandicum, T. bomiense, and other unrecognized Tuber species. Interestingly, at 16 new locations, mature ascocarps of truffles that were undergoing the fruiting phase were located underground. All 16 truffle samples were identified as T. thailandicum based on morphological characteristics and molecular phylogenetic analysis. However, ascocarps of other truffle species were not found at the new OTUs representative locations. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to lead researchers to a better understanding of the occurrence of truffles using soil mycobiota diversity investigation. The outcomes of this study will be particularly beneficial with respect to the search and hunt for truffles without the need for trained animals. In addition, the findings of this study will be useful for the management and conservation of truffle habitats in northern Thailand.

AB  - Simple Summary Historically, sheep breeding has played a key role in Kazakhstan. At present, due to the population's increasing meat consumption, there is a high interest in the distribution of sheep breeds of different productivity levels. In our study, we describe the genetic structure and results of population analysis of a new breed called Baisary, which belongs to the meat-fat breeds and has favorable phenotypic traits. We reveal that this breed is genetically differentiated from its ancestors and other breeds, and shortly, it could be registered as a separate breed. This study helps with understanding the gene pool and genetic diversity of sheep breeds in Kazakhstan and should increase farmers' interest in Baisary sheep. Lamb meat has become increasingly popular in several nations during the last few decades, especially in Kazakhstan. Due to the rising demand for lamb meat, our sheep breeders developed a new fat-tailed sheep and named the breed Baisary. Animals of the Baisary breed are characterized by a large physique, strong constitution, stretched body, deep and wide chest, medium or large-sized fat tail, long legs (height at the withers of adult rams 85-100 cm, sheep 75-90 cm), long lanceolate ears and strong hooves. Lambs of the Baisary breed surpass their peers of the original parent breeds by 15-20% in live weight at the weaning period. To characterize the genetic structure of Baisary sheep and compare it with the ancestral breeds, we genotyped 247 individuals from five sheep breeds with Ovine SNP50K. The estimated private allelic richness ranged from 0.0030 to 0.0047, with the minimum and maximum provided by the Gissar (Giss1) and Kazakh meat-wool breeds, respectively. The highest and lowest F-IS values, meanwhile, were observed in the Afghan fat-tailed population and Baisary sheep, respectively. The calculated inbreeding coefficient showed that Edilbay and Baisary sheep have excess heterozygosity. According to principal components analysis, Baisary are close to Gissar populations, the Afghan fat-tailed breed and Edilbay sheep. These results were consistent with the Admixture and phylogenetic analysis. Overall, our results indicated that Baisary sheep differ genetically from their progenitors.

AB  - The Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) faces population declines in the western part of its range, and its ecological requirements are poorly understood in the eastern part of its range. The Romanian Carpathians harbor an intact large carnivore community, in which lynx co-occur with bears (Ursus arctos), wolves (Canis lupus), and humans (Homo sapiens), with which they potentially compete for ungulate prey. We provide a science-based estimate of lynx density and habitat use, combining non-invasive monitoring techniques (camera trapping) with spatially explicit capture-recapture models (SECR) in the Southern Carpathians of Romania. We sampled 59 and 76 trap stations during two monitoring sessions (winter and autumn), identified at least 30 individuals, from which we reconstructed encounter histories for 23 individuals. SECR modeling resulted in similar density estimates between winter and autumn (1.6 +/- 0.39 SE and 1.7 +/- 0.38 SE lynx/100 km(2), respectively), but the cumulative number of lynx detected reached the asymptote faster during autumn, suggesting that monitoring prior to the mating season is preferable. Density varied within and across sessions with topography (slope), percent forest cover, and landscape heterogeneity (i.e., agricultural mosaic). Density hotspots shifted between low-altitude agricultural mosaic during winter and more rugged, mid-altitude forest stands during autumn. Estimated densities of lynx in the Romanian Carpathians are higher than those reported in the Alps or Slovak Carpathians, highlighting the importance of this population as a source both for natural recolonization and recent reintroduction programs. When used in an SECR framework, camera trapping is an efficient method for assessing spatial and temporal variation in lynx population density in the remote Romanian Carpathians. We recommend this methodology for improving lynx population estimates and to monitor lynx population trends nationwide.

AB  - Microplastics are recognized as a newly emerging threat to marine organisms as they can be ingested and accumulated through multiple trophic levels. However, microplastic contamination and its potential risk assessment in coral reef fishes have been less addressed, particularly in remote ocean regions. In this study, microplastics in 167 samples of coral reef fish (a total of eighteen species) from the Xisha areas of the South China Sea were studied. There were fifteen species of coral reef fish contaminated by microplastics with an average occurrence rate of 29.3 %. The shape of microplastics in the fishes was mostly fibrous with small sizes (400-900 & mu;m) and light colors (transparent and blue). The dominant types of microplastic polymers are polyamide and polyethylene terephthalate, accounting for 77 % and 11 % of microplastics in the fish body. There were generally more microplastics in the herbivorous fishes than the carnivorous ones. The highest microplastic abundance and occurrence was found in parrotfish due to its direct feeding on the microplastics-contaminated corals. In addition, there were much more microplastics in the gastrointestinal tracts than in the gills of the Xisha fishes. Microplastic abundance was found negatively correlated with the trophic level of the Xisha fishes supporting a stronger microplastic impact at lower levels of marine animals. Finally, a risk assessment using the polymer hazard index (PHI) revealed that microplastic contamination in the Xisha fishes was lower than those in the eutrophic coast. Our study provides new evidence for the widespread presence of microplastic contamination in the fishes of the remote Xisha coral reefs.

AB  - Termites, particularly those of the genus Heterotermes, are significant pests impacting urban and agricultural environments worldwide. Despite their impact, the distribution of Heterotermes has been largely overlooked. Our study aims to predict the potential distribution of 15 Heterotermes species by integrating bioclimatic, land-use, connectivity, soil and elevation variables into species distribution models (SDMs). These models project habitat suitability under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) for short-term (2021-2040), mid-term (2041-2060) and long-term (2061-2080) scenarios. Our results underscore the critical influence of temperature, connectivity and soil moisture on termite distribution, revealing potential expansions into new regions due to climate change. Most parts of the Neotropics and Australia could become suitable for at least one species. Our study also examines the efficacy of incorporating phylogenetic data into SDMs, demonstrating its enhanced reliability for predicting distributions of co-occurring species, though its effectiveness diminishes for geographically isolated ones. Future projections indicate significant range shifts due to increased urbanization, agriculture expansion and climate change. Neotropical species are likely to face habitat reductions, especially in South American forests, while several Australian and major structural pest species may expand their range. Currently, densely populated cities in the Neotropics, the south-western US, Australia and South Asia could be within the range of one to five Heterotermes species. In agricultural areas, Australia and the Neotropics-both heavily reliant on agriculture-are highly vulnerable, and this vulnerability is expected to worsen as more land is converted to agricultural use.

AB  - Fecal bacteria in bathing seawater pose a substantial public health risk and require rigorous monitoring. The unexpected beach closures during the COVID-19 lockdowns have afforded unique opportunities to evaluate the impact of human activities on bathing water quality (BWQ). This study examined the temporal changes in fecal coliforms (FC) and streptococci (FS) within bathing seawater across a popular coastal region in Morocco during two lockdown periods (2020 L and 2021 L), comparing these data with observations from pre-lockdown years (2018, 2019) and post-lockdown periods (2020, 2021, 2022). Our findings illuminate the influential role the hiatus periods played in enhancing bathing water quality, attaining an "excellent" status with marked reductions in fecal coliform and streptococci levels. Consequently, the FC/FS analysis exposed a clear preponderance of humans as the primary sources of fecal contamination, a trend that aligns with the burgeoning coastal tourism and the escalating numbers of beach visitors. Additionally, the presence of domestic animals like camels and horses used for tourist rides, coupled with an increase in wild animals such as dogs during the lockdown periods, compounded the potential sources of fecal bacteria in the study area. Furthermore, occasional sewage discharge from tourist accommodations and wastewater treatment plants may also contribute to fecal contamination. To effectively mitigate these concerns and bolster public health, a commitment to relentless surveillance efforts, leveraging novel and innovative tools, is essential. These findings underline the crucial interplay between human activities and the health of our coastal ecosystems, emphasizing the need for sustainable practices for a safer and healthier future.

AB  - In order to immobilize heavy metals in livestock and poultry manure and promote the safe utilization of pig manure resources, this experiment utilized three types of dried pig manure mixed with soil as raw materials. A combination of biochar and bentonite was established, including treatments with the addition of pig manure (CZ), 2.5% bentonite (F1), 7.5% bentonite (F2), 2.5% biochar (F3), 7.5% biochar (F4), 2.5% biochar + 2.5% bentonite (F5), 2.5% biochar + 7.5% bentonite (F6), 7.5% biochar + 2.5% bentonite (F7), 7.5% biochar + 7.5% bentonite (F8), and with zero addition (CK). After the passivation treatments had been applied, a soybean pot experiment was established to measure various physiological indicators at different soybean development stages. The results revealed that the passivated Cu was predominantly in the reduced and residual states. The passivation rates for F8 in LPS, F7 in MPS, and F8 in HPS were 34.10%, 29.90%, and 39.50%, respectively. Among the three concentrations of a pig manure-soil mixture, the impact of low copper concentration on soybean growth was relatively minimal, whereas medium and high copper concentrations significantly impaired soybean health, resulting in varying degrees of interveinal chlorosis and leaf yellowing from the tip to the base of young leaves, thereby affecting photosynthesis. The combined application of biochar and bentonite enhanced copper passivation and facilitated soybean growth and development.

AB  - Background Brachiaria humidicola (Bh) has the ability to produce biological nitrification inhibitors (NIs) and release NIs from the root to the soil. Aims To compare the effects of growing Bh with Brachiaria ruziziensis (Br, which is not able to produce NIs) on soil nitrogen (N) dynamics, N gases and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and nitrifiers and denitrifiers following sheep urine application, a laboratory incubation was conducted in a He/O-2 continuous flow denitrification system (DENIS). This incubation was conducted in the absence of light. Hence the measured effects of Bh and Br on N cycling were the residual effect of biological NIs released into the soil prior to the incubation and released via root death. Methods The treatments were: (1) Bh with water application (Bh + W); (2) Bh with sheep urine (Bh + U); (3) Br with water application (Br + W); (4) Br with sheep urine (Br + U). Results Results showed that soil NO3- concentration increased significantly in the soil with sheep urine application after the incubation. Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions increased immediately after the sheep urine application and peaked twice during the incubation. Cumulative emissions for the first peak were significantly lower from the Bh + U treatment (0.054 kg N ha(-1)) compared with the Br + U treatment (0.111 kg N ha(-1)), but no significant differences were observed in the total cumulative N2O and NO emissions between the Bh + U and Br + U treatment at the end of the incubation. Sheep urine addition did not affect the AOA, nirS and nosZ gene copies, but significantly increased the AOB gene copies after the incubation. Conclusions We conclude that the residual effect of Bh to mitigate N2O emissions in a highly nitrifying soil is short-lived.

AB  - Birth timing is a key life-history characteristic that influences fitness and population performance. For migratory animals, however, appropriately timing birth on one seasonal range may be constrained by events occurring during other parts of the migratory cycle. We investigated how the use of capital and income resources may facilitate flexibility in reproductive phenology of migratory mule deer in western Wyoming, USA, over a 5-yr period (2015-2019). Specifically, we examined how seasonal interactions affected three interrelated life-history characteristics: fetal development, birth mass, and birth timing. Females in good nutritional condition at the onset of winter and those that migrated short distances had more developed fetuses (measured as fetal eye diameter in March). Variation in parturition date was explained largely by fetal development; however, there were up to 16 d of plasticity in expected birth date. Plasticity in expected birth date was shaped by income resources in the form of exposure to spring green-up. Although individuals that experienced greater exposure to spring green-up were able to advance expected birth date, being born early or late with respect to fetal development had no effect on birth mass of offspring. Furthermore, we investigated the trade-offs migrating mule deer face by evaluating support for existing theory that predicts that births should be matched to local peaks in resource availability at the birth site. In contrast to this prediction, only long-distance migrants that paced migration with the flush of spring green-up, giving birth shortly after ending migration, were able to match birth with spring green-up. Shorter-distance migrants completed migration sooner and gave birth earlier, seemingly trading off more time for offspring to grow and develop over greater access to resources. Thus, movement tactic had profound downstream effects on birth timing. These findings highlight a need to reconsider classical theory on optimal birth timing, which has focused solely on conditions at the birth site.

AB  - Elephant ranges in Asia overlap with human-use areas, leading to frequent and often negative two-way interactions, a fraction of which result in human fatalities. Minimizing such negative interactions rests on gaining a mechanistic understanding of their patterns and underlying processes. In Chhattisgarh (India), a rewilding population of 250-300 elephants that have recently expanded their range from neighbouring states through dispersal has been causing annual losses of >60 human lives. Using logistic regression models, we examined the influences of eight plausible predictors of the occurrence of elephant-related human fatality incidents. We found that 70% of incidents occurred in areas with high-intensity habitat use by elephants; the other 30% were in areas of intermediate and sporadic elephant habitat use. The probability of human fatalities was high along the roads connecting settlements and in areas with frequent house break-ins by elephants, and this probability was also affected by the spatial geometry of forest patches. Immediate practical options to minimize fatal interactions include community-based early-warning systems and the use of portable barriers around settlements. Judicious landscape-level land-use planning aimed at maintaining the resilience of remnant intact elephant habitats will be critical to preventing the dispersal of elephants into suboptimal habitats, which can create complex conflict situations.

AB  - We describe here the morphological abnormalities found in six free-living specimens of Narcine vermiculata, N. sp., N. entemedor, and Pseudobatus leucorhynchus. Specimens were captured off the coast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec in November and December 2017 using bottom trawl nets and off the Ventanilla Lagoon from August 2023 to March 2024 using gillnets. We found abnormal disc width, pelvic fins, eyes, and spiracles in Narcine vermiculata; abnormal disc development in Narcine sp.; abnormal disc development, anophthalmia, and a spot on the liver in N. entemedor; and clasper absence, abnormal development of the disc and pelvic fins, and malformation of the vertebral column in Pseudobatos leucorhynchus. Based on the total batoid captures obtained during from 52 bottom trawls, we estimate that the probability of finding disc abnormalities (pectoral fins not fused or other types of abnormal development) was 1.0%, whereas anophthalmia occurred in 0.3% of specimens, and 0.2% of males did not have a clasper. The causes of these deformations need to be further investigated, in order to take appropriate actions to preserve the health of ecosystems and human beings.

AB  - 1. Accurate quantification of infection parameters is necessary to ensure effective surveillance, investigation and mitigation of infectious diseases. However, hosts and pathogens are often imperfectly observed and key epidemiological parameters, such as infection prevalence, can be biased if this observational uncertainty is not properly accounted for.
   2. Here, we evaluated the combined effects of imperfect pathogen detection and host pseudoreplication on the estimation of infection prevalence of the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in the southern Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii). This pathogen causes amphibian chytridiomycosis, a panzootic disease responsible for the greatest documented loss of biodiversity due to an infectious disease. From November 2018 to March 2019, we made 1085 captures of 641 R. darwinii individuals in two areas of Southern Chile. Captured frogs were individually identified to eliminate host pseudoreplication, skin-swabbed twice in sequence, and each swab was analysed in duplicate using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay to detect Bd. To provide a robust estimate of period prevalence, we used a Bayesian multiscale occupancy model that considers pathogen imperfect detection arising from both sampling and diagnostic testing processes. Finally, using a deterministic matrix population model, we illustrated how the method chosen to estimate prevalence influenced our conclusions regarding the impact of Bd infection on host population trajectories.
   3. Our results showed that Bd prevalence could be underestimated by 55% if false negatives and host pseudoreplication were not accounted for. Host pseudoreplication had a greater impact on prevalence underestimation than pathogen imperfect detection in our study. This underestimation in prevalence changed our interpretation of the impacts of Bd infections on our model species, from a nearly stable population using the naive period prevalence to a declining one using our robust estimate.
   4. Synthesis and applications. These results highlight the importance of using robust inferences to inform disease risk assessments and to efficiently allocate limited resources during mitigation strategies of infectious diseases. The methods used here can be applied to a wide range of host-pathogen systems, and will be of interest to both researchers and practitioners aiming to investigate and mitigate the impacts of infectious diseases on free-ranging populations.

AB  - Organophosphate pesticides have potent endocrine disrupting effects, hence banned in many countries. However, many organophosphates like chlorpyrifos, malathion et cetera continue to be used in some countries (Wo & lstrok;ejko et al., 2022; Wo & lstrok;ejko et al., 2022)including India. Fodder mediated ingestion of these substances may be harmful for livestock fertility. We have investigated the effect of the widely used organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and its metabolite, 3,5,6-trichloropyridinol (TCPy) on the expression of genes essential for spermatogenesis in goat testicular tissue. The testicular Sertoli cells (Sc) regulate germ cell division and differentiation under the influence of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone (T). Impaired FSH and T mediated signalling in Sc can compromise spermatogenesis leading to sub-fertility/infertility. As Sc express receptors (R) for FSH and T, they are highly susceptible to the endocrine disrupting effects of pesticides affecting fertility by dysregulating the functioning of Sc. Our results indicated that exposure to different concentrations of CPF and TCPy can compromise Sc function by downregulating the expression of FSHR and AR which was associated with a concomitant decline in the expression of genes essential for germ cell division and differentiation, like KITLG, INHBB, CLDN11 and GJA1. CPF also induced a significant reduction in the activity of acetylcholinesterase in the testes and increased the total testicular antioxidant capacity. Our results suggested that CPF and its metabolite TCPy may induce reproductive toxicity by dysregulating the expression of Sc specific genes essential for spermatogenesis.

AB  - This study explored the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of riverine and swamp buffaloes in India, utilizing complete mitochondrial genome sequences. Through comprehensive sampling across varied agro-climatic zones, including 91 riverine buffaloes from 12 breeds and 6 non-descript populations, along with 16 swamp buffaloes of the Luit breed, this study employed next-generation sequencing techniques to map the mitogenomic landscape of these subspecies. Sequence alignments were performed with the buffalo mitochondrial reference genome to identify mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations and distinct maternal haplogroups among Indian buffaloes. The results uncovered the existence of 212 variable sites in riverine buffaloes, yielding 67 haplotypes with high haplotype diversity (0.991), and in swamp buffaloes, 194 variable sites resulting in 12 haplotypes, displaying haplotype diversity of 0.950. Phylogenetic analyses elucidated the genetic relationships between Indian buffaloes and the recognized global haplogroups, categorizing Indian swamp buffaloes predominantly into the SA haplogroup. Intriguingly, the haplogroup SB2b was observed for the first time in swamp buffaloes. Conversely, riverine buffaloes conformed to established sub-haplogroups RB1, RB2, and RB3, underscoring the notion of Northwestern India as a pivotal domestication site for riverine buffaloes. The study supports the hypothesis of independent domestication events for riverine and swamp buffaloes, highlighting the critical role of genetic analysis in unraveling the complex evolutionary pathways of domestic animals. This investigation contributes to the global understanding of buffalo mitogenome diversity, offering insights into this important livestock species' domestication and dispersal patterns.

AB  - ContextMany terrestrial mammals have undergone substantial distribution changes in recent decades; yet collecting broad-scale occurrence data for carnivores is difficult due to their low densities and cryptic behaviors. Carnivore observations from community (i.e., citizen) science programs can be a potentially valuable approach for understanding changes in carnivore distributions over long time periods. ObjectivesWe used 18 years of bobcat (Lynx rufus) observations collected by archery deer hunters (i.e., participants) across Illinois, USA, to estimate spatiotemporal patterns in occurrence and determine how landscape features influenced patterns of recolonization. MethodsWe developed Bayesian spatial and non-spatial multi-scale dynamic occupancy models to estimate county-level occupancy, persistence, and colonization and participant-level occupancy. We modeled county-level parameters as a function of multiple a priori landscape covariates and compared model predictive performance using cross-validation. ResultsOur non-spatial occupancy model had greater predictive support than our spatial occupancy model. Mean annual statewide county-level occupancy increased from approximately 0.43-0.83 while mean annual participant-level occupancy increased from approximately 0.07-0.28. Bobcats were primarily restricted to southern Illinois during the early 2000s but by 2018 occurred throughout western and southern Illinois. Landscape covariates had relatively weak effects on model parameters. ConclusionsOur study illustrates how community science observations analyzed with hierarchical occupancy models can be used to model spatiotemporal changes in species distributions. Bobcats have recolonized much of Illinois, but this colonization was not strongly mediated by county-level landscape features at the scales we measured.

AB  - Some basic choices are discussed based on two recently proposed short lists of Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) related indices to assess food webs and ecosystems. The discussion is on the use of either internal carbon flow matrices or extended carbon flow matrices, weighted or unweighted indices and the use of ENA or not ENA related indices. The preference here is the use of weighted indices based on double hand-balanced extended carbon flow matrices. The indices that best seem to be able to serve policy makers and meet most of the requirements of different European Directives (WFD, MSFD) are Relative Overhead (0/DC) indicating the systems' resilience, Relative Ascendency (A/DC) indicating the efficiency of the systems' carbon flow organisation, the Detritivory/Herbivory (D/H) indicating the importance of the detritus flow compared to primary production products, the Connectance Index (CI) indicating the number of connections among all the species (or compartments), The Finn Cycling Index (FCI) expressed as the cycled portion of the Total System Throughflow (TSTc) divided by the Total System Throughput (TSTp) indicating the carbon turnover within the system and the Mean/ Average Trophic Level (written as MTL or ATL). In comparison with the medical world, the (0/DC) and the FCI can be considered as the thermometer and the stethoscope of the ecosystem, while the CI represents an internal system structure scan comparable to a MRI scan. The D/H ratio and the MTL can be considered as the Diet Quality and the Body Mass indices. These "medical" check-ups (indicators) indicate whether a system operates well and whether it can be considered as being "healthy".

AB  - Many parts of Europe face increasing challenges managing wildfires. Although wildfire is an integral part of certain ecosystems, fires in many places are becoming larger and more intense, driven largely by climate change, land abandonment, and changes in fuel management with important socioeconomic, environmental, and ecosystem services consequences for Europe. In order to envision a comprehensive fire risk mitigation strategy for Europe, a spatial assessment of opportunities to manage fuels at the landscape-scale is needed. Our study explored the suitability of three land management strategies (LMS)-herbivory, mechanical fuel removal, and prescribed burn-which can create more heterogenous fuelscapes, thereby reducing an element of fire risk. We created suitability maps for each of the LMS using adoption factors identified in a systematic literature review (n = 123). We compared these maps with areas of historical fire occurrence as a proxy for fire risk to prioritize key areas for intervention. We found that over a quarter of Europe was suitable for multiple LMS within areas of greater fire risk, creating opportunities for concurrent and synergistic use of the strategies. Options were more limited in areas of southern Europe, where prescribed burn was found to be uniquely viable amongst the LMS evaluated. Opportunities were also restricted in some areas of high fire risk in northern Europe, where herbivory was found to be the only suitable LMS. Our findings take a wide-view of fuel management to target landscapescale decision making focused on reducing fire risk. However, many other factors must be taken into account to successfully manage fuels at local scales, including the socio-cultural appropriateness of the LMS, the viability of incentive schemes, and possible trade-offs with other management goals, such as carbon storage and biodiversity.

AB  - Conservation plans that explicitly account for the social landscape where people and wildlife co-occur can yield more effective and equitable conservation practices and outcomes. Yet, social data remain underutilized, often because social data are treated as aspatial or are analyzed with approaches that do not quantify uncertainty or address bias in self-reported data. We conducted a survey (questionnaires) of 177 households in a multiuse landscape in the Kenya-Tanzania borderlands. In a mixed-methods approach, we used Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify and map local attitudes toward African elephant (Loxodonta africana) conservation while accounting for response bias and then combined inference from attitude models with thematic analysis of open-ended responses and cointerpretation of results with local communities to gain deeper understanding of what explains attitudes of people living with wildlife. Model estimates showed that believing elephants have sociocultural value increased the probability of respondents holding positive attitudes toward elephant conservation in general (mean increase = 0.31 [95% credible interval, CrI, 0.02-0.67]), but experiencing negative impacts from any wildlife species lowered the probability of respondents holding a positive attitude toward local elephant conservation (mean decrease = -0.20 [95% CrI -0.42 to 0.03]). Qualitative data revealed that safety and well-being concerns related to the perceived threats that elephants pose to human lives and livelihoods, and limited incentives to support conservation on community and private lands lowered positive local attitude probabilities and contributed to negative perceptions of human-elephant coexistence. Our spatially explicit modeling approach revealed fine-scale variation in drivers of conservation attitudes that can inform targeted conservation planning. Our results suggest that approaches focused on sustaining existing sociocultural values and relationships with wildlife, investing in well-being, and implementing species-agnostic approaches to wildlife impact mitigation could improve conservation outcomes in shared landscapes.

AB  - The population parameters of three Carangidae species from the marine waters of Ghana were examined between July 2018 and June 2019. Length and weight measurement of 1020 samples were collected from some selected coastal communities along the Greater Accra region of Ghana and analyzed using TropFish R. The asymptotic length (L-infinity) for C. crysos, C. hippos, and T. trecae was 37.6 cm, 35.3 cm and 26.1 cm respectively. The growth rate (K) was 0.41, 0.44, and 0.75 yr(-1) for C. crysos, C. hippos, and T trecae respectively. The exploitation rate (E) estimate revealed overexploitation for C. crysos, and T. trecae (E>0.5) while C. hippos was underexploited (E<0.5). The findings of YPR analysis proved that the Ghanaian stock of these fish species is in a steady-state with the current exploitation rate lower than the exploitation rate at maximum sustainable yield (E-msy).

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of two spineless cactus (Nopalea cochenillifera) levels (250 g/kg or 550 g/kg) as an exclusive source of water on the performance, serum biochemistry, blood count, ingestive behaviour, carcass characteristics and non-carcass components of confined goats. Forty Anglo-Nubian castrated male goats were used, housed in individual pens and distributed in a 2 x 2 + 1 factorial design of spineless cactus factor (250 g/kg or 550 g/kg of spineless cactus in the dry matter of the diet) and water factor (with or without access to drinking water) and control diet (without spineless cactus and with access to drinking water). The restriction on drinking water did not influence (P > 0.05) the average daily gain, carcass weight or serum biochemistry of the goats. The inclusion of spineless cactus increased (P < 0.05) the average daily gain, body weight at slaughter and carcass weight of the goats and reduced (P < 0.05) animal drinking water intake. Goats fed 250 g/kg of spineless cactus in their diet chewed more (P < 0.05), drank more water (P < 0.05) and had greater gastrointestinal tract contents (P < 0.05) than goats fed 550 g/kg of spineless cactus in the diet. Spineless cactus from 250 g/kg can be used as an exclusive source of water in the diets of confined goats.

AB  - Environmental pollution results in serious health hazards to animals, reflected in biogenic and risk element concentrations in animal tissues. The objective of this study was to examinate concentration of selected elements in testes, and epididymal spermatozoa motility of wild boars. Wild boars were hunted in region Zuhracka - Levice, Slovak Republic. Testes were removed postmortem, spermatozoa were collected from cauda epididymis and assessed by CASA system. Elements concentrations were measured by ICP and by CV-AAS. Spermatozoa motility was 44.29% and progressive motility 18.47%. Concentration of elements in testes was in following order: K > Na > Mg > Ca > Fe > Zn > Al > Cu > Se > Mn > As > Cr > Pb > Mo > Sr > Ni > Ba > Cd > Li > Hg. The most notable correlations indicate association between Se and total spermatozoa motility, as well as with progressive motility, furthermore between As and velocity curved line and beat cross frequency. A high positive significant correlation was found between mercury and beat cross frequency. The data may serve as a fine control indicator to detect potentially toxic elements accumulated from polluted environment that can affect reproduction of wild animals.

AB  - Background Conservation and management of migratory animals has gained attention in recent years, but the majority of research has focused on stereotypical 'migrant' and 'resident' behaviors, often failing to incorporate any atypical behaviors or characterize migratory behaviors beyond distance and timing of the migration. With migration threatened by anthropogenic development and climate change, it is crucial that we understand the full range of migratory behaviors. Our objective was to demonstrate and characterize the variation in migration strategies, including typical and atypical migratory behaviors for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in Utah, USA. Methods Because calculation of common metrics such as distance, timing, and use of stopovers during migration did not adequately describe the variation we observed in migratory behavior for this species-particularly when animals visited multiple (> 3) ranges for extended lengths of time-we developed additional methods and categories to describe observed variation in migratory behavior. We first categorized trajectories based on the number of discrete, separate ranges and range shifts between them. Then, we further characterized the variation in migration strategies by examining the timing, duration, and distance traveled within each of the categories. We also examined if and how frequently individual deer switched among categories from year to year. Results We classified 1218 movement trajectories from 722 adult female mule deer, and found that 54.4% were dual-range migrants, who made one round-trip to one distinct range. Multi-range migrants (23.6%) made one round-trip during which they stayed at multiple discrete ranges. Commuters (1.0%) traveled to the same range multiple times, and poly migrants (1.5%) made multiple round-trips to different ranges. Gradual movers (2.5%) did not show a discrete range shift but moved gradually between ranges, whereas residents (12.6%) never left their home ranges, and dispersers (4.4%) left but never returned. Of the deer that we monitored for multiple years, 51.2% switched among categories. Conclusion We conclude that the substantial number of atypical migratory strategies, as well as the number of deer that switched categories, underlines the importance of studying these less-stereotyped behaviors that may be exhibited by large proportions of populations. Acknowledging and investigating the full complexity and diversity in migratory strategies might uncover unknowns with respect to underlying factors and drivers of migration, and can help shape effective conservation strategies.

AB  - Coprophagy is a behavior where animals consume feces, and has been observed across a wide range of species, including birds and mammals. The phenomenon is particularly prevalent in juveniles, but the reasons for this remain unclear. One hypothesis is that coprophagy enables offspring to acquire beneficial gut microbes that aid development. However, despite the potential importance of this behavior, studies investigating the effects in juveniles are rare. Here we experimentally test this idea by examining how ingestion of adult feces by ostrich chicks affects their gut microbiota development, growth, feeding behavior, pathogen abundance, and mortality. We conducted extensive longitudinal experiments for 8 weeks, repeated over 2 years. It involved 240 chicks, of which 128 were provided daily access to fresh fecal material from adults and 112 were simultaneously given a control treatment. Repeated measures, behavioral observations, and DNA metabarcoding of the microbial gut community, both prior to and over the course of the experiment, allowed us to evaluate multiple aspects of the behavior. The results show that coprophagy causes (a) marked shifts to the juvenile gut microbiota, including a major increase in diversity and rapid maturation of the microbial composition, (b) higher growth rates (fecal-supplemented chicks became 9.4% heavier at 8 weeks old), (c) changes to overall feeding behavior but no differences in feed intake, (d) lower abundance of a common gut pathogen (Clostridium colinum), and (e) lower mortality associated with gut disease. Together, our results suggest that the behavior of coprophagy in juveniles is highly beneficial and may have evolved to accelerate the development of gut microbiota.

AB  - Plants are often exposed to multiple herbivores and densities of these attackers (or corresponding damage intensities) often fluctuate greatly in the field. Plant-mediated interactions vary among herbivore species and with changing feeding intensity, but little is known about how herbivore identity and density interact to determine plant responses and herbivore fitness. Here, we investigated this question using Triadica sebifera (tallow) and two common and abundant specialist insect herbivores, Bikasha collaris (flea beetle) and Heterapoderopsis bicallosicollis (weevil). By manipulating densities of leaf-feeding adults of these two herbivore species, we tested how variations in the intensity of leaf damage caused by flea beetle or weevil adults affected the performance of root-feeding flea beetle larvae and evaluated the potential of induced tallow root traits to predict flea beetle larval performance. We found that weevil adults consistently decreased the survival of flea beetle larvae with increasing leaf damage intensities. In contrast, conspecific flea beetle adults increased their larval survival at low damage then decreased larval survival at high damage, resulting in a unimodal pattern. Chemical analyses showed that increasing leaf damage from weevil adults linearly decreased root carbohydrates and increased root tannin, whereas flea beetle adults had opposite effects as weevil adults at low damage and similar effects as them at high damage. Furthermore, across all feeding treatments, flea beetle larval survival correlated positively with concentrations of carbohydrates and negatively with concentration of tannin, suggesting that root primary and secondary metabolism might underlie the observed effects on flea beetle larvae. Our study demonstrates that herbivore identity and density interact to determine systemic plant responses and plant-mediated effects on herbivores. In particular, effects are species-specific at low densities, but converge at high densities. These findings emphasize the importance of considering herbivore identity and density simultaneously when investigating factors driving plant-mediated interactions between herbivores, which advances our understanding of the structure and composition of herbivore communities and terrestrial food webs.

AB  - In this study, two different approaches based on taxonomic assemblages and on copepod functional groups were used to investigate the mesozooplankton assemblage structure and its relationship with environmental variables in the main estuaries of the Gulf of Cadiz (Guadalquivir, Guadiana and Tinto-Odiel) during the dry-warm season. In general, the mesozooplankton assemblages were dominated by copepods, especially the calanoid Acartia tonsa, which reached its highest abundance in the inner zones while the adjacent coastal zones were characterized by a mixture of copepods and cladocerans, especially Penilia avirostris. Regarding the trait-based approach, three copepod functional groups were identified, principally sorted by their feeding strategy. Group 1 (composed of omnivorous copepods displaying a mixed feeding strategy and broadcast-spawners) was found mainly in the inner areas, while Groups 2 (omnivorous cyclopoids, sac-spawners that feed via active ambush) and 3 (herbivores-omnivores employing a filter feeding strategy and mostly broadcast-spawners) were predominant in the adjacent coastal zones. The relative abundance of copepod functional groups suggested that Group 1 could be considered the most important contributor to secondary production in the estuarine systems of the Gulf of Cadiz. In relation to environmental factors, salinity was the most influential variable on mesozooplankton assemblages in both approaches. Our results suggest that the studied estuaries, although taxonomically different, have mesozooplankton assemblages that perform similar ecological functions. Both methods provide valuable and complementary information about mesozooplankton assemblage dynamics in the main estuaries of the Gulf of Cadiz.

AB  - Recent observations and a review of historical collections and literature have revealed that the diversity of scarab beetles in the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) of South China is substantially higher than previously reported. In this latest account, nine identified species are reported from this area in the Rutelinae subfamily, within the genera Adoretus, Anomala, Mimela, Pseudosinghala and Popillia. The subfamily Dynastinae appears to be locally represented by two species within the complex oriental genus Xylotrupes and the more widespread genus Alissonotum, respectively. With the exception of A. rubripes rubripes, P. mutans and X. siamensis, which are observed regularly and in reasonable numbers, all the other species are recorded very infrequently and often as single individuals. Thus, while the biodiversity potential of the region is relatively high, most species appear to be under threat of local extinction. This can be attributed mainly to the rapid habitat degradation, use of pesticides and extreme light pollution that are currently occurring in this SAR.

AB  - Wildlife monitoring can be time-consuming and expensive, but the fast-developing technologies of uncrewed aerial vehicles, sensors, and machine learning pave the way for automated monitoring. In this study, we trained YOLOv5 neural networks to detect points of interest, hare (Lepus europaeus), and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in thermal aerial footage and proposed a method to manually assess the parameter mean average precision (mAP) compared to the number of actual false positive and false negative detections in a subsample. This showed that a mAP close to 1 for a trained model does not necessarily mean perfect detection and provided a method to gain insights into the parameters affecting the trained models' precision. Furthermore, we provided a basic, conceptual algorithm for implementing real-time object detection in uncrewed aircraft systems equipped with thermal sensors, high zoom capabilities, and a laser rangefinder. Real-time object detection is becoming an invaluable complementary tool for the monitoring of cryptic and nocturnal animals with the use of thermal sensors.

AB  - Developmental pathways encompass transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements that interact as transcription factor-regulatory element (TF-RE) units. Independent origins of similar phenotypes likely involve changes in different parts of these units, a hypothesis promisingly tested addressing the evolution of the rib-associated lumbar (RAL) morphotype that characterizes emblematic animals such as snakes and elephants. Previous investigation in these lineages identified a polymorphism in the Homology region 1 [H1] enhancer of the Myogenic factor-5 [Myf5], which interacts with HOX10 proteins to modulate rib development. Here we address the evolution of TF-RE units focusing on independent origins of RAL morphotypes. We compiled an extensive database for H1-Myf5 and HOX10 sequences with two goals: (i) evaluate if the enhancer polymorphism is present in amphibians exhibiting the RAL morphotype and (ii) test a hypothesis of enhanced evolutionary flexibility mediated by TF-RE units, according to which independent origins of the RAL morphotype might involve changes in either component of the interaction unit. We identified the H1-Myf5 polymorphism in lineages that diverged around 340 Ma, including Lissamphibia. Independent origins of the RAL morphotype in Tetrapoda involved sequence variation in either component of the TF-RE unit, confirming that different changes may similarly affect the phenotypic outcome of a given developmental pathway.

AB  - Increasing areas of gradation, making it difficult or impossible to perform restorations and forestations, and as causing tree crown damage, result in the need to intensify monitoring of beetle populations. In order to support control activities, the study assessed the species structure, morphological traits and genetic variation in Melolontha spp. from five pine stands with different composition and proportion of admixed tree species. The study applied ISSR and COI methods and identified minor variabilities between the analyzed populations, which may be the effect of high gene flow and absence of complete geographic isolation. Our research indicated high population dynamics and the degree of its migration, as evidenced by the gene flow rate. Given the rapid spreading potential, current methods of countering pest expansion are rather ineffective. The species, morphological and genetic structures were found to be associated with the area of beetles' occurrence, which may depend on the proportion and composition of admixed tree species, which beetles use for supplementary and reference feeding. This species showed higher values of the genetic variation parameter in areas dominated by M. hippocastani compared to M. melolontha. However, the opposite situation was observed in the area with M. melolontha dominance.

AB  - Organic fertilizers are essential for enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) levels and promoting sustainable agriculture. The mechanisms of carbon sequestration in upland red soils using various organic materials are not well understood. Here, the impact of various organic fertilization strategies on SOC fractions, functional groups, iron oxides, and soil aggregates was investigated to clarify the protective mechanisms underlying SOC preservation. Six fertilization regimes were examined: no fertilization (CK), mineral fertilizer (CF), 60% mineral fertilizer (RF), RF + straw (RFS), RF + pig manure (RFP), and RF + vermicompost (RFV). The results demonstrated that SOC contents significantly increased by 62.5% in RFP and 63.1% in RFV compared to the CF treatment, with particulate organic carbon (POC) being the primary contributor. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that RFP and RFV treatments induced the formation of denser flock-like aggregates and increased aromatic C content, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated that RFV treatment exhibited the highest abundance of functional groups among all treatments. SOC and POC were highly positively correlated with soil chemical properties, soil aggregates, poorly crystalline iron oxides, and aromatic rings. Structural equation models indicated that pig manure and vermicompost directly promoted POC accumulation, while straw provided physical protection for POC by enhancing aggregate formation. Furthermore, pig manure indirectly facilitated the development of POC and mineral-associated organic carbon via soil biochemical properties and iron oxides, respectively. Overall, the application of organic fertilizers enhanced the physical protection, mineral immobilization, and recalcitrance (alkyl C, aromatic C) of organic carbon, facilitating C sequestration and stability. This study highlights the importance of organic management in upland red soils for increasing SOC storage and maintaining global C balance.

AB  - Priority effects shape the assembly of free-living communities and host-associated communities. However, the current literature does not fully incorporate two features of host-symbiont interactions, correlated host responses to multiple symbionts and ontogenetic changes in host responses to symbionts, leading to an incomplete picture of the role of priority effects in host-associated communities. We factorially manipulated the inoculation timing of two plant symbionts (mutualistic rhizobia bacteria and parasitic root-knot nematodes) and tested how host age at arrival, arrival order, and arrival synchrony affected symbiont colonization success in the model legume Medicago truncatula. We found that host age, arrival order, and arrival synchrony significantly affected colonization of one or both symbionts. Host age at arrival only affected nematodes but not rhizobia: younger plants were more heavily infected than older plants. By contrast, arrival order only affected rhizobia but not nematodes: plants formed more rhizobia nodules when rhizobia arrived before nematodes. Finally, synchronous arrival decreased colonization both symbionts, an effect that depended on host age. Our results demonstrate that priority effects compromise the host's ability to control colonization by two major symbionts and suggest that the role of correlated host responses and host ontogeny in the assembly of host-associated communities deserve further attention.

AB  - Water scarcity is amongst the major challenges threatening smallholder sheep production in subsistence-oriented communal farms in dryland areas. Local contextual factors are a prerequisite for effective policy development and optimisation of water resources management for smallholder sheep production. Two-hundred and fifty-two structured questionnaires were administered to investigate the contextual factors that influence smallholder farmers' perceived impact of water scarcity on sheep production in the dry ecozones of the Cape provinces in South Africa and identify their local response strategies. Logit regression findings showed that a unit increase in private commercially-oriented arid farms, males, education level, flock size, adapted breeds and income from livestock increased farmers' probability to perceive impact of water scarcity on sheep production. Regardless of ecozone and farm types, sheep farmers switched between water sources, provided supplementary feed and shade, used adapted breeds and alternative markets to manage the impact of water scarcity. Interventions to build resilience to water scarcity in the surveyed areas should target sheep farmers with low adaptive capacity, particularly less educated women relying on livestock income and farming with non-adapted breeds on subsistence-oriented communal farms in the semiarid ecozone.

AB  - Phytoplasmas (Mollicutes, Acholeplasmataceae), vector-borne obligate bacterial plant parasites, infect nearly 1,000 plant species and unknown numbers of insects, mainly leafhoppers (Hemiptera, Deltocephalinae), which play a key role in transmission and epidemiology. Although the plant-phytoplasma-insect association has been evolving for >300 million years, nearly all known phytoplasmas have been discovered as a result of the damage inflicted by phytoplasma diseases on crops. Few efforts have been made to study phytoplasmas occurring in noneconomically important plants in natural habitats. In this study, a subsample of leafhopper specimens preserved in a large museum biorepository was analyzed to unveil potential new associations. PCR screening for phytoplasmas performed on 227 phloem-feeding leafhoppers collected worldwide from natural habitats revealed the presence of 6 different previously unknown phytoplasma strains. This indicates that museum collections of herbivorous insects represent a rich and largely untapped resource for discovery of new plant pathogens, that natural areas worldwide harbor a diverse but largely undiscovered diversity of phytoplasmas and potential insect vectors, and that independent epidemiological cycles occur in such habitats, posing a potential threat of disease spillover into agricultural systems. Larger-scale future investigations will contribute to a better understanding of phytoplasma genetic diversity, insect host range, and insect-borne phytoplasma transmission and provide an early warning for the emergence of new phytoplasma diseases across global agroecosystems.

AB  - Feeding efficiency of mammalian herbivores is associated with skull traits known to differ between feeding guilds. As climate is known to affect the architecture and functional traits of plants, skull morphology may change as plant traits change along climate gradients. We tested whether skull traits of more than 70% of the extant bovid and cervid species are related to aridity, and whether these relationships differ across feeding guilds (browser, grazer, mixed feeder). We used muzzle width to represent food ingestion and masseteric fossa length to represent oral processing. For the models without phylogeny, both muzzle width and masseteric fossa length increased towards wetter climates for grazers, but not for mixed feeders or browsers. These patterns suggest that grazer diets may change more dramatically across aridity gradients than the other two groups, possibly linked to changes in both the architecture and toughness of grasses. In models accounting for phylogeny, no changes in either trait across aridity gradient were found, which appeared to be due to subfamily differentiation along the aridity gradient. Our results suggest that deeper insights into the evolution of herbivore skulls may be achieved by using quantified diet data to directly test plant trait effects on skull morphology.

AB  - BackgroundThe cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene is one of the most studied mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes to determine sheep's genetic profile. This study aimed to determine the genetic diversity and relationships of several Indonesian local sheep populations on Java Island, Indonesia, based on the mtDNA Cyt b gene sequences. Blood samples were collected from forty-one individual sheep in seven populations of Indonesia local sheep breeds on Java Island (Priangan = 6, Garut = 6, Batur = 7, Wonosobo = 5, Javanese Thin-Tailed/JTT = 7, Javanese Fat-Tailed/JFT = 5, and Sapudi = 5). DNA extraction was performed on blood samples, and the mtDNA Cyt b gene was amplified using specific primers (Alek-CBF: 5'-CAACCCCACCACTTACAA-3' and Alek-CBR: 5'-CCTTGAGTCTTAGGGAGGTT-3'). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were then sequenced, and data were analyzed using the MEGA version 7.0, DNA SP version 6.0, and NTSYS-pc version 2.11 software.ResultsA total of 1140 bp complete mtDNA Cyt b gene sequences in this study obtained 1134 monomorphic sites (I), six polymorphic sites (V), one segregation site (S), and five parsimony informative sites (P) with a nucleotide diversity (Pi), the average number of nucleotide differences (K), and sequence conservation (SC) were 0.00119, 1.35610, and 0.9947, respectively. There were six haplotypes consisting of two unique haplotypes and four shared haplotypes with a haplotype diversity (Hd) of 0.5415. The genetic distance within and between populations ranged from 0.0000 to 0.0016 and 0.0000 to 0.0020, respectively. Wonosobo, JFT, and Sapudi sheep have the closest relationship, and then these three breeds were close to JTT sheep, followed by Batur, Priangan, and Garut sheep. Two haplogroups have been found based on the Ovine haplogroup clustering. All Wonosobo, JTT, JFT, Sapudi sheep, and most Batur sheep were clustered into haplogroup B. In contrast, Garut sheep were mostly clustered into haplogroup A, while Priangan sheep were clustered into both haplogroups with the same percentage.ConclusionSeven Indonesian local sheep breeds on Java Island have a close relationship clustered into two haplogroups, namely haplogroups A and B. Most Indonesian local sheep breeds on Java Island in this study were clustered into haplogroup B, except for Garut and Priangan sheep.

AB  - Through killing and instilling fear in their prey, large terrestrial carnivores shape the structure and function of ecosystems globally. Most large carnivore species have experienced severe range and population declines due to human activities, and many are now threatened with extinction. Consequently, the impacts of these predators on food webs have been diminished or lost completely from many ecosystems. Kill rates provide a fundamental metric for understanding large carnivore ecology and assessing and comparing predation within and across ecological communities. Our systematic review of large terrestrial mammalian carnivore kill rates reveals significant positive geographic (North America, Europe, and Africa) and taxonomic (grey wolf Canis lupus, puma Puma concolor, lion Panthera leo, and Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx) bias, with most studies apparently motivated by human-carnivore conflict over access to ungulate prey and wildlife management objectives. Our current understanding of the behaviour and functional roles of many large carnivore species and populations thus remains limited. By synthesising and comparing kill rates, we show that solitary carnivores (e.g. brown bears Ursus arctos and most felids) exhibit higher per capita kill rates than social carnivores. However, ungulate predation by bears is typically limited to predation of neonates during a short period. Lower per capita kill rates by social carnivores suggests group living significantly reduces energetic demands, or, alternatively, that group-living carnivores defend and consume a greater proportion of large prey carcasses, or may acquire more food through other means (e.g. scavenging, kleptoparasitism) than solitary hunters. Kill and consumption rates for Canidae - measured as kilograms of prey per kilogram of carnivore per day - are positively correlated with body mass, consistent with increasing energy costs associated with a cursorial hunting strategy. By contrast, ambush predators such as felids show an opposite trend, and thus the potential energetic advantage of an ambush hunting strategy for carnivores as body mass increases. Additionally, ungulate kill rates remain relatively constant across solitary felid body sizes, indicative of energetic constraints and optimal foraging. Kill rate estimates also reveal potential insights into trophic structuring within carnivore guilds, with subordinate carnivores often killing more than their larger counterparts, which may be indicative of having to cope with food losses to scavengers and dominant competitors. Subordinate carnivores may thus serve an important role in provisioning food to other trophic levels within their respective ecosystems. Importantly, kill rates also clarify misconceptions around the predatory behaviour of carnivores (e.g. spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta and wolverines Gulo gulo are often considered scavengers rather than the capable hunters that they are) and thus the potential impacts of various carnivore species on their ecological communities. Despite the importance of kill rates in understanding predator-prey interactions, their utility is not widely recognised, and insufficient research limits our ability to fully appreciate and predict the consequences of modified predation regimes, justify current management actions affecting carnivores, or inform effective conservation measures.
   Together with other important research on predator-prey interactions, robust kill rate studies that address the research deficiencies we highlight will provide a deeper understanding of the foraging behaviours and potential ecosystem impacts of many of the world's carnivores, thus aiding effective conservation and management actions.

AB  - Valley bottom process reset, or the excavation of high surfaces and fill of incised channels combined with large wood addition, is a new method for creating multi-channel river-wetland corridors (also referred to as Stage 0 valley bottoms). Valley bottom process reset seeks to increase lateral flow and sediment connectivity, retain water and sediment, and kickstart geomorphic processes that may sustain aquatic and riparian habitat. This study uses this anthropogenic intervention to examine relationships among wood-induced hydraulic roughness, valley bottom topography, and geomorphic processes such as overbank flow and sediment transport, avulsion, sediment retention, and pool scour. Here, I present a 6-year case study of a two-phase valley bottom process reset along Deer Creek, Oregon. Kickstarting the floodplain reshaping processes required a substantial increase in roughness and hydrologic connectivity. The first phase of construction enhanced hydrologic but not sediment connectivity, failing to kickstart avulsion and floodplain reworking even during a likely 2-to 5-year recurrence interval flood. A second, more intensive phase of construction substantially reduced the threshold discharge necessary for overbank flow and floodplain reworking, as evidenced by the occurrence of these processes after only a <2-year recurrence interval flood. During this flood, a spatially distributed wood lattice rearranged into discrete jams that scoured pools, retained sediment, and drove geomorphically effective overbank flows. While valley bottom regrading likely contributed to these geomorphic effects, the spatial correlation between newly incised floodplain channels and areas of wood aggregation indicates wood's important role in driving floodplain reworking. I derive from these findings a conceptual model that details how wood drove floodplain reworking via two mechanisms: In-channel wood jams backwatered and constricted flow into the floodplain, and small wood jams formed in the floodplain forest further constricted flow through nascent channels to facilitate channel incision.

AB  - Macrozoobenthos and submerged macrophytes interact closely. However, studies in China have focused on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, where shallow lakes are concentrated, rather than on temperate lakes. To clarify the responses of taxonomic and functional groups of macrozoobenthos in temperate lakes to changes in submerged macrophyte biomass (B-Mac) on a large scale, 19 temperate lakes within Baiyangdian Lake were investigated in this study. The B-Mac differed greatly across the 19 lakes, and Potamogeton crispus was the dominant species. According to the B-Mac, the 19 lakes were divided into 4 groups. One-way analysis of variance and Pearson correlation analysis showed that the water environmental parameters were different among the 4 groups, and the B-Mac was significant correlated with all the physical and chemical parameters of water bodies (except for water depth). Forty-one taxa of macrozoobenthos were identified in the 19 lakes, with oligochaetes, Hirudinea, gastropods, crustaceans, chironomid larvae, and aquatic insects (excluding chironomid larvae) represented by 9, 1, 4, 2, 19, and 6 species, respectively. Chironomid larvae and oligochaetes dominated by density, and gastropods and chironomid larvae dominated by biomass. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the B-Mac was the most important factor affecting the macrozoobenthos community structure in group 1 to group 4. Macrozoobenthos with low pollution tolerance values were mainly found in areas with high B-Mac, while species with high pollution tolerance values were mainly distributed in areas with low B-Mac and high nutrient contents. Different taxonomic and functional groups of macrozoobenthos responded differently to changes in B-Mac. As B-Mac increased, density and biomass of oligochaetes and chironomid larvae tended to decrease, while those of gastropods and aquatic insects tended to first decrease and then increase. Collectors had more species than any other functional group in group 1 to group 4. As B-Mac increased, density and biomass of collectors gradually decreased, while density of predators, shredders, and scrapers tended to first decrease and then increase.

AB  - Freshwater diaptomid copepods in Cambodia are poorly studied, and only seven taxa were known previously. From February to October 2007, 255 samples were collected from 237 freshwater sites in nine provinces representing four regions (northwest, Cardamom and Elephant Mountains, Mekong Lowlands, and east) of Cambodia. Diversity, seasonal occurrence, geographical distribution of each species, and a checklist of diaptomid copepods are documented. In this case, 24 species were recorded, including two undescribed species belonging to the genera Phyllodiaptomus and Tropodiaptomus. In this case, 14 species are recorded for the first time in Cambodia, and Mongolodiaptomus formosanus has been recorded for the first time in Southeast Asia. One species appears to be endemic to Cambodia and nine to the lower Mekong River Basin. Mongolodiaptomus malaindosinensis was the most common, frequently recorded throughout the four regions (40.5% of the sampled sites), followed by Vietodiaptomus blachei (39.2%), Eodiaptomus phuvongi (38.8%), Mongolodiaptomus formosanus (31.2%), and Eodiaptomus draconisignivomi (27.4%). Very rare species such as Eodiaptomus sanoamuangae, Tropodiaptomus vicinus, Mongolodiaptomus calcarus, and Tropodiaptomus sp. were only recorded at 0.4% to 0.8% of the sampled sites. The species diversity of Cambodia is most similar to that of Thailand, where 22 species (91.6%) occur both in Cambodia and Thailand, and 12 (50%) of the species have been recorded in both Cambodia and Vietnam.

AB  - Milk yield and its composition show individual variation due to the effects of the environment. Previous studies suggest that meteorological variables exert negative effects on milk yield and composition, especially during summer. This study aimed to examine the effects of meteorological variables on bulk milk composition in the Sardinian sheep production system. In this work, a total of 218,170 records belonging to 4562 dairy sheep farms were merged with the meteorological data provided by 60 meteorological stations located on Sardinia Island (Italy). Milk composition in the late spring and summer recorded during a 5-year period was used to evaluate the impact of climate exposure on bulk milk traits. The milk quality was analyzed using a linear mixed model that included the fixed effects of the year of sampling, the flock size, the temperature humidity index (THI) and the random effect of the flock. The variability of milk composition explained by flock and management ranged from 30 to 64%. The flock size exerted a significant effect on milk composition: large flocks characterized by advanced management and feeding techniques resulted in higher milk quality (e.g., higher protein and fat, lower lactose) compared to traditionally managed small flocks. The impact of THI on milk composition was statistically significant across different milk quality traits (p < 0.001); the effect of thermal stress varied according to the month of lactation. For instance, milk fat content in May increased by +0.4% for THI > 76. In June, no relevant differences were observed, whereas a decrease in fat percentage was observed in July as THI values increased (up to -0.5% for THI > 76). While somatic cell counts remained relatively stable across different conditions, total bacterial count showed greater seasonal variability, peaking during warmer periods. In addition, using factor analysis, we developed a multivariate meteorological index (MMI), which explained 51% of the variance of the original meteorological data. MMI was highly correlated with THI (r = 0.75). The same linear mixed model applied for modeling THI was used to assess the effect of MMI on milk traits. Fat, protein fractions and lactose showed significant variation across MMI classes (p-value < 0.001) in the same direction as those based on THI. Overall, our findings underscore the impact of both flock size and environmental conditions on milk quality, with heat stress and traditional versus modern management practices leading to measurable differences in milk traits.

AB  - Carrion is an ubiquitous resource that drives the dynamics of scavenger populations and shapes the structure and composition of their communities. Corvids (Family: Corvidae) are among the most common scavengers globally, facilitating carcass discovery by other species and contributing to carcass biomass removal. Here, we examine how environmental factors influence corvid scavenging dynamics in an arid region of Central Australia. Specifically, we investigate how habitat, season and a major flood event affect corvid discovery and visitation time, and group size around carcass sites. To do so, we used data collected from camera traps monitoring 80 experimentally positioned red kangaroo (Osphranter rufus) carcasses stratified across closed and open habitats, spring and winter seasons, and before and after a flood event. Corvids took longer to discover carcasses in closed compared to open habitats, but habitat did not affect how long corvids spent visiting carcasses, or corvid group size. Corvids discovered carcasses faster in winter compared to spring and in post-flood compared with the pre-flood periods, and season and flood interacted to influence both corvid visitation time and group size. Our results reflect a complex interplay between temperature, the extreme boom and bust cyclicity of the study region and changing corvid activity and abundance in the local study area. We identify environmental factors as key determinants of corvid scavenging dynamics and provide the first detailed description of scavenging by corvids in the arid zone of Australia.

AB  - Simple Summary Hibiscus rosa-sinensis is a medicinal plant recognized for its pharmacological chemical compounds for humans and animals. Hibiscus rosa-sinensis hyperproducer forage technology yields 10-20 t DM/ha/year (t of dry matter/ha/year), depending on the agronomic conditions. Chemical composition of hibiscus forage meal is similar to alfalfa, moringa, tithonia, and cassava forages due to its content of protein, minerals, fiber compound, and metabolizable energy. The fresh forage of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis could be offered in a ratio of 60% plus 40% of grass forage in sheep. Moreover, goats show favorable productive results when fed ad libitum with hibiscus forage. Likewise, inclusion levels of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis forage were recommended for rabbits, pigs, and organic chickens. Hibiscus forage could be considered as a viable alternative feed for ruminant and non-ruminant animals, although more research is needed in other animal species and productive categories. This review summarized for the first time the nutritional benefits of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis in animal feed. the agronomic characteristics for the hyperproduction of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis were reported, as well as the chemical composition of the forage meal (leaves + petioles + stems), with emphasis on crude protein, amino acids, minerals, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, lignin detergent acid, secondary metabolites, and metabolizable energy for ruminants and non-ruminants. Additionally, their medicinal properties such as antimicrobial, antifungal, antiparasitic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiarrheal, and antipyretic properties were detailed. Its use as a source of protein in ruminant feeding is attractive and can be combined with grasses. In rabbits, fresh forage in high concentrations in the diets reduces the feed palatability, which causes a decrease in animal response, although it depends on the forage quality. In addition, limits for Hibiscus rosa-sinensis forage were recommended in diets or feeding systems for poultry, pigs, rabbits, goats, and sheep.

AB  - A trial of special fertilizer reduction and combined application of organic fertilizer on tea production, nutrients and economic benefits was carried out in the tea garden at Shihe Port, Xinyang, Henan Province, China. The experiment has six treatments of customary fertilization (CK), 100% special fertilizer for tea (T1), nitrogen reduction 20% (T2), 40% (T3), 60% (T4) and 100% (T5), and special fertilizers at the same time. Among the special fertilizer treatments for tea plants, the germination density, 100-bud weight, fresh tea yield, N, P, and K content of new shoots and economic benefits were the highest in T1 treatment, Results showed that the yield range of the five treatments was 460 similar to 632.4kg hm2. Compared with CK, the yield increase rates were 6.11, 1.99, -4.21, -13.76 and -22.82%, respectively. The growth rates of barber bud density and 100-bud weight were -20.00 similar to 25.83 and 8.40 similar to 8.40%, respectively. The content of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the new shoots varied by 0.623 similar to 1.070, 0.047 similar to 0.183 and 1.380 similar to 2.237%, respectively. Therefore, the special fertilizer for tea plants can reduce the nitrogen by 20% to save costs and increase efficiency.

AB  - Rapid population growth requires more intense production of food industry, with two major consequences: significant amount of food processing residues and more sewage sludge originating from biological wastewater treatment plant. Sludge is a big concern for the disposal for wastewater treatment plant. The European Union makes an effort regarding the reduction of organic fractions disposed at a landfill. Composting is a cost-effective and ecological-friendly alternative for managing biodegradable organic fractions. Experiments of co-composting of sewage sludge, green waste and food waste, at carbon/nitrogen ratios 8.75, 18.00 and 24.90, were performed during three months by monitoring temperature, pH, moisture, carbon and nitrogen proportion, carbon/nitrogen ratio, and germination index. The results showed that cocomposting of sewage sludge, green waste, and food waste is effective and results in the production of quality compost.

AB  - BACKGROUNDPostmortem muscle moisture loss leads to a decrease in carcass weight and can adversely impact overall meat quality. Therefore, it is critical to investigate water holding capacity (WHC) to enhance meat quality. Current research has primarily focused on examining the correlation between signaling molecules and meat quality in relation to the glycolysis effect on muscle WHC. But there exists a significant knowledge gap regarding the mechanism of WHC in Jersey cattle-yak meat.RESULTSJersey cattle-yak meat pH decreased and then increased during postmortem aging. Lactate content, cooking loss, pressing loss, drip loss and centrifuging loss of Jersey cattle-yak meat increased and then decreased during postmortem aging. The glycogen content of Jersey cattle-yak meat was significantly higher than that of yak meat at 6-120 h, being 8.40% higher than that of yak meat at 120 h. The activity of key glycolytic enzymes hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in Jersey cattle-yak meat was lower than that in yak meat. Correlation analysis showed that Jersey cattle-yak meat WHC was positively correlated with the activity of HK, PK, PFK and LDH.CONCLUSIONSThe WHC of Jersey cattle-yak meat was higher than that of Gannan yak meat, and it was significantly positively correlated with the activity of key enzymes of the glycolytic signaling pathway. Therefore, the glycolysis rate can be reduced by inhibiting enzyme activity to improve Jersey cattle-yak meat WHC and meat quality. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The wild boar Sus scrofa is widely distributed, extending from Europe into Minor, Central, and South-eastern Asia. Despite that, the biology of this species is well known, little is known about the significance of its tail position and movement. In this connection, we studied the link between tail position and movement and the corresponding behaviour as well as whether they are affected by environmental factors. The fieldwork was carried out in the spring-summer period of 2017-2018 by camera traps on the territory of two Bulgarian state hunting grounds. The total number of trap nights was 1558 and the registered videos of wild boars were 220. In the videos, 112 females, 42 males, 141 juveniles (1-2 years old) and 198 offspring were identified. Five tail positions were defined: hanging, wagging, horizontal, raised, and arched. By applying the Generalized Linear Model, it was found that Behaviour, Sex and Habitat significantly influence the tail position. The observed behaviours were divided into two main categories - active and passive. The hanging and wagging tail prevailed over the other tail positions with the tail usually hung during foraging and digging. The wagging prevailed in exploratory and amicable behaviour, and the tails were dominantly raised in cases of agonistic behaviour. During the passive behaviours, the hanging tail also prevailed. Given that wild boar is an important species for both biodiversity and hunting practices in many countries, the research done allows us to conclude that systematic camera trapping is a powerful tool for studying its behaviour, which could contribute to the management of the species.

AB  - Land snails represent a large diversity of species in the forest floor. Some species prefer to stay in the leaf litter, while others like to climb up vegetation. They are considered generalist herbivores/decomposers. Although the exact trophic position of most species is often difficult to determine, a low rate of trophic niche partitioning within an assemblage is assumed. We compared isotopic niche sizes and overlaps between and within four local land snail assemblages using stable isotope Bayesian ellipses. We found significant differences in trophic niche size (expressed by corrected standard ellipse area) as a function of body size and lifestyle. We hypothesised that the larger niche size of smaller and/or arboreal snail species is due to their limited mobility and the presence of spatially structured food resources. In contrast, a broad and similar mixture of leaf litter sources results in a homogeneous diet for individuals of larger, highly mobile, epigean species, i.e., smaller niche size. We documented multiple overlaps of isotopic niches between species within an assemblage, although arboreal species exhibited slightly different niche positions, indicating specific diets. When comparing all pairwise combinations, we found that isotopic niches of species using different lifestyle did not overlap, in contrast to species using similar lifestyle. In addition, the trophic niches of opportunists with respect to lifestyle were intermediate between those of species from the outermost categories. Our results fit the general concept of variable and overlapping trophic niches in co-occurring snail species. However, we were able to demonstrate differences in species that rarely occupy the same microhabitat.

AB  - Water availability is an important factor that influences plant-insect interactions. While the influence of water limitation on plant resistance traits has received much attention, how water availability affects plant tolerance to herbivory is rarely tested. Here we show that lower water availability reduced tolerance capacity of tomato plants as measured by above ground regrowth and flower development after herbivory. In contrast to a reduced ability to tolerate herbivory, lower water availability increased the constitutive and induced levels of two defensive proteins, trypsin protease inhibitor and polyphenol oxidase, indicative of an increased investment on resistance under water limitation. The increase in defense proteins was paralleled with lower performance of a specialist caterpillar, Manduca sexta, and lower consumption of plant tissues. Although the performance of generalist, Helicoverpa zea, was unaffected by water availability, we observed a high mortality of H. zea that suggests strong resistance of tomato against H. zea. The findings revealed an unexpected case where water limitation decreases tolerance but increases resistance of a plant, suggesting a potential tradeoff between these strategies. This plasticity may benefit herbaceous plants by balancing growth and defense under variable water availability.

AB  - Cooperative interactions may frequently be reinforced by "partner fidelity feedback, " in which high- or low-quality partners drive positive feedbacks with high or low benefits for the host, respectively. Benefits of plant-animal mutualisms for plants have been quantified almost universally in terms of growth or reproduction, but these are only two of many sinks to which a host-plant allocates its resources. By investigating how partners to host-plants impact two fundamental plant resources, carbon and water, we can better characterize plant-partner fidelity and understand how plant-partner mutualisms may be modulated by resource dynamics. In Laikipia, Kenya, four ant species compete for Acacia drepanolobium host-plants. These ants differ in multiple traits, from nectar consumption to host-plant protection. Using a 5-year ant removal experiment, we compared carbon fixation, leaf water status, and stem non-structural carbohydrate concentrations for adult ant-plants with and without ant partners. Removal treatments showed that the ants differentially mediate tree carbon and/or water resources. All three ant species known to be aggressive against herbivores were linked to benefits for host-plant resources, but only the two species that defend but do not prune the host, Crematogaster mimosae and Tetraponera penzigi, increased tree carbon fixation. Of these two species, only the nectivore C. mimosae increased tree simple sugars. Crematogaster nigriceps, which defends the tree but also castrates flowers and prunes meristems, was linked only to lower tree water stress approximated by pre-dawn leaf water potential. In contrast to those defensive ants, Crematogaster sjostedti, a poor defender that displaces other ants, was linked to lower tree carbon fixation. Comparing the effects of the four ant species across control trees suggests that differential ant occupancy drives substantial differences in carbon and water supply among host trees. Our results highlight that ant partners can positively or negatively impact carbon and/or water relations for their host-plant, and we discuss the likelihood that carbon- and water-related partner fidelity feedback loops occur across ant-plant mutualisms.

AB  - Seed dispersal by frugivores is essential in plant life cycles, with birds and mammals the principal and well studied dispersal agents. However, there is an increasing recognition that terrestrial tortoises could also be considered important seed dispersers in many ecosystems. The red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonaria) is one of the largest terrestrial tortoises in South America and is thought to disperse large seeds. However, little is known about their role as seed dispersers, and their potential use as restorers of defaunated areas. Here, we assessed the maximum width of seeds this species could ingest, the mean gut retention time (GRT), and the post consumption germination capacity for tropical fruit species. Forty different fruit species were offered to eight captive individuals, obtaining a maximum seed width swallowed of 23 mm. We used four native plant species to measure the GRT within four tortoises, and we found a mean retention time of 18.92 & PLUSMN; 4.81 days. We also found that sex is an important indicator of GRT, with females presenting longer retention periods. This novel finding may be due to the higher metabolic defecating and dispersing rates of males. Although germination proportions varied between the four plant species used in the experiment, overall defecated seeds germinated faster than control seeds. We conclude that red-footed tortoises are potentially important seed dispersers due to their ability to swallow a large quantity and size of seeds while accelerating seed germination rates. This species should be considered a viable ecological substitute for large frugivores in rewilding projects, as C. carbonaria performs similar functions to large dispersers that have been extirpated due to defaunation processes.

AB  - A first hand study regarding the anomuran crabs in the intertidal zone of Kadmat and Amini islands of Lakshadweep was carried out during November 2021 to June 2022 by monthly sampling from a total of six sampling stations selected covering the total coastal stretch of Kadmat and Amini islands. The study recorded a total nine species, contributed by eight species of hermit crabs belonging to three genera and two families of superfamily Paguroidea and single species of mole crab of superfamily Hippoidea. The hermit crabs are Coenobita perlatus, Coenobita clypeatus, Calcinus laevimanus, Calcinus latens, Calcinus elegans, Dardanus megistos, Dardanus guttatus and Dardanus deformis. The single species of mole crab is Hippa adactyla. The spatial and temporal variations with respect to abundance and distribution were assessed. The peak average abundance of anomurans was recorded in April and lowest values in December. The northern part of Kadmat Island had the highest total abundance of the anomurans and the east side had the lowest. The most dominant species was Hippa adactyla with maximum records in April. Among hermit crabs the dominant species was C. perlatus, while the least abundant species among anomuran was D. megistos. The distribution and abundance of species differed according to habitat variability. These crabs are used by the local inhabitants of Lakshadweep as bait for fishing, rarely as food and often as a quick remedy for treating cough in children. An interesting traditional use of hermit crab as laxative agent to prevent theft of 'Neera'. Nowadays unscientific coastal protection structures and other anthropogenic interventions becoming a serious threat to these anomuran crabs.

AB  - Yaks (Bos grunniens) are the only bovine species that adapt well to the harsh high-altitude environment in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. However, the reproductive adaptation to the climate of the high elevation remains to be elucidated. Cell composition and molecular characteristics are the foundation of normal ovary function which determines reproductive performance. So, delineating ovarian characteristics at a cellular molecular level is conducive to elucidating the mechanism underlying the reproductive adaption of yaks. Here, the single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to depict an atlas containing different cell types with specific molecular signatures in the yak ovary. The cell types were identified on the basis of their specifically expressed genes and biological functions. As a result, a cellular atlas of yak ovary was established successfully containing theca cells, stromal cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, and proliferating cells. A cell-to-cell communication network between the distinct cell types was constructed. The theca cells were clustered into five subtypes based on their biological functions. Further, CYP11A1 was confirmed as a marker gene for the theca cells by immunofluorescence staining. Our work reveals an ovarian atlas at the cellular molecular level and contributes to providing insights into reproductive adaption in yaks.

AB  - Creating synthetic lines is the standard mating mode for commercial pig production. Traditional mating performance was evaluated through a strictly designed cross -combination test at the 'breed level' to maximize the benefits of production. The Duroc-LandraceYorkshire (DLY) three-way crossbred production system became the most widely used breeding scheme for pigs. Here, we proposed an `individual level' genomic mating procedure that can be applied to commercial pig production with efficient algorithms for estimating marker effects and for allocating the appropriate boar-sow pairs, which can be freely accessed to public in our developed HIBLUP software at https://www.hiblup.com/tutorials#genomic- mating. A total of 875 Duroc boars, 350 Landrace-Yorkshire sows and 3573 DLY pigs were used to carry out the genomic mating to assess the production benefits theoretically. The results showed that genomic mating significantly improved the performances of progeny across different traits compared with random mating, such as the feed conversion rate, days from 30 to 120 kg and eye muscle area could be improved by -0.12, -4.64 d and 2.65 cm(2), respectively, which were consistent with the real experimental validations. Overall, our findings indicated that genomic mating is an effective strategy to improve the performances of progeny by maximizing their total genetic merit with consideration of both additive and dominant effects. Also, a herd of boars from a richer genetic source will increase the effectiveness of genomic mating further.

AB  - Cougars (Puma concolor) have been recolonizing portions of their historic range over the last few decades and are currently a rare, transient species in the western Great Lakes Region. Anticipatory attitude surveys can identify potential management challenges, stakeholder groups, and conservation and educational priorities for recolonizing cougars. We implemented an anticipatory attitude survey to better understand attitudes towards transient cougars in northern Wisconsin, USA. We distributed the survey in fall and early winter of 2014-15 (n = 423) and 2015-16 (n = 594). We compared attitudes towards transient cougars to attitudes towards other established large carnivores and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We also explored factors that may affect human attitudes towards cougars, such as hunter identity, livestock ownership, risk perception, and the loss of a domestic animal to wildlife. Despite the rare, transient status of cougars in Wisconsin, many respondents (mean of 29%) reported to have observed a cougar or sign of one in the wild in Wisconsin. Cougars had a mean favorability score similar to coyotes (Canis latrans) and wolves (Canis lupus) and less than bobcats (Lynx rufus), bear (Ursus americanus), and white-tailed deer. Comparatively, respondents' risk perception for all categories of risk (i.e., fear for personal safety, the safety of children, and the safety of domestic animals) was higher for cougars than for wolves. Hunter identity and loss of livestock to wildlife were determined by multinomial logistic regression as the most important parameters affecting respondents' favorability towards cougars (omega(i) = 0.71). Using the 2015-2016 survey data, we found that as cougar risk perception increased, favorability towards cougars decreased similarly for both hunters and non-hunters. Hunters were less likely to be favorable towards cougars, more likely to be neutral, and equally likely to be unfavorable towards cougars compared to nonhunters. We identify potential management challenges, stakeholder groups (e.g., hunters and those who have experienced loss of livestock to wildlife), and conservation and educational priorities for recolonizing cougars.

AB  - Helminth infection was analysed at necropsy and coprology in a total of 54 roe deer from the province of Grosseto (central Italy) between 2018 - 2020. Age and sex data were recorded for each deer for a total of 31 adults (23 females, 8 males) and 23 juveniles (11 females, 12 males).The results on the small intestine (51 samples) highlighted that nematodes belonging to the species Trichostrongylus colubriformis were the most prevalent parasite (41.2 %), followed by the cestode Moniezia expansa (7.8 %). The large intestine results (52 samples) showed Trichuris spp. (53.8 %), Oesophagostomum venulosum (50 %) and Chabertia ovina (26.9 %). In the abomasum, only Ostertagia ostertagi (17.9 %) was found. Of the 34 samples analysed by bronchopulmonary, only the lung of an adult female was positive for Dictyocaulus spp. In two livers out of 33 samples analysed, nematodes of the species Setaria tundra were found on the surface. Copropositivity was observed in 45 of the 52 faecal samples analysed. The results of the present study indicate that the roe deer is host to several species of parasites, which are also common in other cervids and domestic ruminants. Statistical testing highlighted a significant difference between mean intensities in males and females.

AB  - Agroecosystem diversification is often implemented to diminish herbivory and reduce yield losses. However, increasing plant richness does not always reduce herbivory levels, so there is a need for better understanding which polyculture characteristics are effective in deterring herbivores. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that functional and phylogenetic distances between intercropped species reduce herbivory pressure and enhance natural enemy response. Diminishing herbivory would be brought about by the complementarity and synergy of traits that deter herbivores and benefit herbivore natural enemies, and as a result of a decrease in the availability of host plants for specialized herbivores. Using a meta-analytical approach, we observed lower herbivore abundance and herbivory damage in focal plants when they grew in polycultures. In addition, polycultures showed increased levels of herbivore parasitism and greater abundance of predators and parasitoids, although the effect of the latter two was negligible. Interestingly, the functional distance between crops affected herbivore abundance and herbivory damage in opposite ways, but had no effect on herbivore natural enemy response. Contrary to our expectations, neither herbivory pressure nor natural enemy response appeared to be influenced by phylogenetic distance between intercropped species. Overall, our study provides valuable insights for agroecosystem design aimed at reducing yield loss by strategically intercropping functionally similar species.

AB  - The pygmy seahorse, Hippocampus bargibanti Whitley, 1970 (Osterichthys: Syngnathidae), is an obligate symbiont of gorgonians. The seahorses mimic their host's colors and shapes and are highly dependent on them. Their hosts are limited to five species of the genus Muricella (Octocorallia: Anthogorgiidae). Symbiosis with other Octocorallia genera has not been reported. However, the host gorgonians are difficult to identify due to limited availability of key taxonomic characteristics. In this study, we describe a pygmy seahorse living symbiotically with a gorgonian in the Kochi Prefecture, Shikoku, Japan. The gorgonian was dissected, morphologically characterized, and identified as a new host species from the genus Anthogorgia (Anthogorgiidae) rather than Muricella, based on differences in sclerite morphology. This is the first study to identify this genus as a host of H. bargibanti. Accurate understanding of host selectivity would be useful in the study of H. bargibanti conservation and ecology.

AB  - The influence of different supplement types on the performance and nutrient dynamics of goats stocked in woodlands is not known. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplement type on the performance and the concentration of fecal nutrients of nursing does and the performance of kids raised in woodlands. One group of goats (SG, 9 does; 18 kids) was allowed supplemental grazing in adjacent silvopasture plots for 3-4 h daily and another group (SF, 8 does; 15 kids) was supplemented with corn (0.5% of metabolic weight) and ad libitum hay. Vegetation samples were collected and analyzed for productivity and quality (crude protein, CP; acid detergent fiber, ADF; neutral detergent fiber, NDF). The quality of the hay (N, ADF, NDF) and fecal samples (N, P, Ca) was analyzed. The animals' live weight, FAMACHA score, and body condition score were collected. The browsing height for does consuming woodland vegetation was measured. Data were analyzed using the GLM procedure, Mixed procedure, and MEANS procedure in SAS 9.4. SG does showed better FAMACHA scores vs. SF does (p < 0.05). Fecal N and ADF were greater (p < 0.0001) in SG does vs. SF does. The findings showed a better performance and greater concentration of fecal nutrients in SG does vs. SF does, suggesting grazing quality pastures is a better option than using feedstuffs to supplement nursing does in woodland.

AB  - Crops are exposed to myriad abiotic and biotic stressors with negative consequences. Two stressors that are expected to increase under climate change are drought and infestation with herbivorous insects, including important aphid species. Expanding our understanding of the impact drought has on the plant-aphid relationship will become increasingly important under future climate scenarios. Here we use a previously characterized plant-aphid system comprising a susceptible variety of barley, a wild relative of barley with partial aphid resistance, and the bird cherry-oat aphid to examine the drought-plant-aphid relationship. We show that drought has a negative effect on plant physiology and aphid fitness, and provide evidence to suggest that plant resistance influences aphid responses to drought stress. Furthermore, we show that the expression of thionin genes, plant defensive compounds that contribute to aphid resistance, increase in susceptible plants exposed to drought stress but remain at constant levels in the partially resistant plant, suggesting that they play an important role in determining the success of aphid populations. This study highlights the role of plant defensive processes in mediating the interactions between the environment, plants, and herbivorous insects.
   Our study shows that plant defence mechanisms impact responses of a herbivorous insect pest to drought stress, and highlights the importance of studying plant responses to insects under different environmental conditions.

AB  - This research aimed to explore the effects of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor (L-NAME) on mitochondria apoptosis in postmortem Gannan yak (Bos grunniens) longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle and to explore its effect on meat quality further. The Gannan yak meat samples were treated with the control group (0.9% NaCl) and L-NAME (20, 60, and 100 mM) for 24 h and then stored for 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days at 4 degrees C. NOS activity and NO content were investigated, and the parameters of mitochondrial apoptosis of the postmortem Gannan yak meat were determined. Meanwhile, the meat quality such as the centrifugation loss, meat color, and myofibril fragmentation index (MFI) was evaluated. The results indicated that after treatment with L-NAME, NOS activity and NO content decreased, causing mitochondrial membrane damage, Bax protein, and Cyt-c levels increased, and resulted in increased activities of caspase-9 and -3, promoting the occurrence of mitochondrial apoptosis. Furthermore, it increased the tenderness and water retention of Gannan yak meat. The results indicated that NOS inhibitor played a regulatory role in postmortem Gannan yak meat quality by regulating mitochondria apoptosis during postmortem aging. Practical applications The meat's tenderness is often considered the most important factor affecting consumers' willingness to repurchase. The relationship of caspases and MFI suggested that L-NAME played a regulatory role in postmortem Gannan yak meat quality by regulating mitochondria apoptosis during postmortem aging. This study provides valuable information for the development of the Gannan yak economy in Tibetan areas.

AB  - The accumulation of biowastes is one of the main concerns of modern society. One of the most environmentally friendly solutions to convert biowaste into a product is composting. Biowastes may contain unknown substances that are persistent in the final compost, thus contributing to soil contamination and salinization. The effectiveness of the composting process depends on the microbial communities involved, which is the number of investigations' targets. The present work studied the bacterial diversity of mesophilic and thermophilic phases of composting developed in two different sites. The study was conducted through next-generation Illumina HiSeq sequencing and phylogenetic communities, revealing the dynamics and changes in specific mesophilic and thermophilic habitats of composting piles. The results showed a higher number of bacterial species in the mesophilic phase than in the thermophilic one, proved by the Shannon and Chao indices. In addition, the diversity of bacterial species expressed by the operational taxonomic units was much higher at the site of Harmanli than at the Yasno pole. Higher abundance was found of the genera Sphingobacterium, Sphingomonas, Paracoccus, Pseudomonas, and Halomonas in both studied sites. In the compost of Harmanli genera Streptomyces, Truepera, and Flavobacterium were found to be much more abundant compared to the compost of the Yasno pole. Finally, we conclude that the two plots show relatively significant differences in the diversity of bacteria during biowaste composting. Substantial differences were also observed between the mesophilic and thermophilic phases, with the first showing a significantly higher degree of species richness.

AB  - Soil amendments have been extensively used to remediate heavy metal contaminated soils by immobilizing or altering edaphic properties to reduce the bioavailability of heavy metals. However, the potential influences of long-term soil amendments applications on microbial communities and polluted soil health are still in its infancy despite that have been applied for decades. We used amplicon sequencing and q-PCR array to characterize the root-associated microbial community compositions and rhizosphere functional genes in a five-year field experiment with consecutive application of four amendments (lime, biochar, pig manure, and a commercial Mg-Ca-Si conditioner). Compared with the control, soil amendments reduced the available Cd (CaCl2 extractable Cd) in soils and strongly affected bacterial community compositions in four root-associated niches. Five rare keystone bacterial species were found belonging to the family Gallionellaceae (1), Haliangiaceae (1), Anaerolineaceae (2), and Xanthobacteraceae (1), which significantly correlated with soil pH and the functional genes nifH and phoD. Random forest analysis showed that rhizosphere soil pH and microbial functions, and root-associated keystone bacterial community compositions mainly influenced the Cd concentrations in rice grains. Altogether, our field data revealed five-year consecutive application of soil amendments regulated root-associated microbial community assembly and enhanced microbial functions, thereby improved rhizosphere health of Cd-contaminated soils.

AB  - Moxidectin (MXD) is an antiparasitic drug used extensively in veterinary clinics. In this study, to develop a new formulation of MXD, a thermosensitive gel of MXD (MXD-TG) was prepared based on poloxamer 407/188. Furthermore, the gelation temperature, the stability, in vitro release kinetics and in vivo pharmacokinetics of MXD-TG were evaluated. The results showed that the gelation temperature was approximately 27 degrees C. MXD-TG was physically stable and can be released continuously for more than 96 h in vitro. The Korsmeyer-Peppas model provided the best fit to the release kinetics, and the release mechanism followed a diffusive erosion style. MXD-TG was released persistently for over 70 days in sheep. Part of pharmacokinetic parameters had a difference in female and male sheep (p < 0.05). It was concluded that MXD-TG had a good stability, and its release followed the characteristics of a diffusive erosion style in vitro and a sustained release pattern in vivo.

AB  - Understanding maternal behaviour is essential for good animal husbandry; yet, little scientific information currently exists regarding nursing behaviour of alpacas (Vicugna pacos). Moreover, allonursing (the nursing of non-filial offspring) has only been documented in captive non-domesticated guanacos. This study aimed to (1) describe the nursing behaviour of alpacas within traditional husbandry systems in their place of origin, and in foreign conditions, and to (2) investigate the occurrence of allonursing in alpacas. A total of 1899 nursing bouts were observed in the Andes and Central Europe. Additionally, 102 Andean farmers were asked if they observed allonursing in their herds. Nursing behaviour was similar at both locations, with most of the nursing bouts initiated by crias and terminated by dams. However, several significant differences between localities were noted, such as the less frequent sniffing of crias by Andean dams. Crias' age and sex did not affect the percentage of nursing bouts initiated or terminated by the dams. Rare cases of allonursing were recorded in Central Europe (n = 5), and 18.6% of surveyed Andean farmers reported allonursing in their herds. This study provides insight into alpaca nursing and allonursing behaviour, which may contribute towards their management both in their place of origin and farther.

AB  - The rumen microbes of large mammalian herbivores (LMHs) play a critical role in resisting the chemical defenses of plants, such as tannins, but whether fecal microbes in LMHs function in this adaptive process remains unclear. Despite ample studies over the past decade have focused mainly on bacteria, the role of fungi in the response to tannins requires more attention. Additionally, most previous studies have been restricted to captive herbivores, and we still do not know much about those in the wild. To understand the role of fecal bacteria and fungi in plant-herbivore interactions, we first tested the response and variation in the response of fecal bacteria and fungi to different concentrations of tannin-rich food using 16S/ITS rRNA data in feeding experiments with sika deer (Cervus nippon). For wild sika deer in Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park, we observed seasonal differences in the tannin content of their diets, which was significantly higher in spring than in autumn. Interestingly, the pattern of the fecal bacteria in wild sika deer response to tannin-rich diets was similar to that observed in the feeding experiments but showed variation in fungi. Feeding with tannin-rich diets altered the fecal microbial composition and increased the relative abundance of tannin-degrading microbes. We hypothesize that fecal bacteria and fungi may play important roles in helping LMHs adapt to tannin-rich diets. We need to further explore the function of microbes to provide important insights into the role of fecal microbes in plant chemical defenses and herbivore co-evolution.

AB  - There is a close relationship between belowground microorganisms and aboveground plant growth, and soil microbiomes contribute to plant growth, health and production. However, the influence of application microbial agents on soil microbial community structure and production of tea (Camellia sinensis) plantations remains un-clear. To test this, under a microbial consortiuma (TCM) and water treatments, a conjoint analysis transcriptome and metabolome profiling was carried out in tea shoots harvested, focused on the carbon/nitrogen metabolism, plant immune response, and a analysis of the structure of the rhizosphere microbial community was carried out in rhizosphere soil harvested. Compared to the water treatment, the tea shoot dry weight, nutrients content (nitrogen and phosphorus) increased (p < 0.001), and promoted the nitrogen metabolism and weaked the carbon metabolism in some extent (p < 0.01), TCM inoculation also triggered direct or indirect defense effects in tea shoots by upregulating key genes in the jasmonic acid, ethylene, and salicylic acid pathways. The abundance of carbon/nitrogen cycles and predatory myxobacterial species were significantly enriched and were positively correlated with C. sinensis productivity and nutrition in the rhizosphere soil. The TCM consortium application positively affected carbon/nitrogen allocation, defense-growth synergy of C. sinensis by altering indigenous rhizobacterial communities (p < 0.01) and enhanced nutrient use efficiency. The TCM is a safe tea inoculant that could be used to enhance the quality and yield, showing a potential use as biofertilizers in C. sinensis cultivation.

AB  - Stoplight parrotfish, Sparisoma viride, are hermaphroditic fish that exhibit a complex social structure in which terminal phase (TP) males control a territory of initial phase (IP) individuals (mostly female, rarely male) called a harem. These fish are prolific herbivores that maintain the health of coral reefs by consuming or removing algae that competes with coral for space. In this study, we estimate the influence of food availability, structural complexity, and conspecific density on territory size in S. viride TP males on reef sites in the middle Florida Keys. Divers estimated the territory sizes of both TP and IP individuals by following fish and dropping markers. Divers also estimated the substrate composition, conspecific density, and physical complexity around these territories. TP territories were roughly circular and only overlapped with IP individuals on the outer edges of the TP territory, resulting in TP territories being significantly larger. While TP territory size was positively influenced by the body size of the TP male and negatively influenced by the number of IP individuals, the average ratio of IP:TP individuals was 2.99:1 (+/- 0.31 SE, range 1-12) for each TP territory regardless of body size. These results suggest that TP males adjust their territory sizes to maintain an apparent optima for the number of females within harems and that the density of conspecifics can potentially influence the timing of sexual transitions in these fish. These results also suggest that S. viride have a polygynous mating structure that is driven by female defense rather than resource defense.

AB  - The buried soil above the Goodwood-Slindon Raised Beach running along the foot of the South Downs (Sussex) is one of the most extensive Lower Palaeolithic land surfaces known. It extends for 16 km but exposures are limited to Boxgrove, the focus of archaeological excavations since the 1980s, and Valdoe, 4.8 km to the west. The palaeosol yielded vertebrates suggesting attribution to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 13 and land snails important in the reconstruction of local environments. Important differences exist between the molluscan assemblages from Valdoe and Boxgrove. An extinct land snail Retinella (Lyrodiscus) elephantium, previously known in Britain only from MIS 11, occurred at Valdoe at unusually high frequencies in assemblages poor in woodland species, prompting a reappraisal of its stratigraphical and ecological significance. Conversely, Spermodea lamellata, a woodland species present at Boxgrove, was absent at Valdoe. This lateral variability results both from the original heterogeneity of the environment, and from differential preservation resulting from decalcification and erosion. Calcitic slug plates are over-represented (>50% of the molluscan fauna) in decalcified sediments where shells composed of aragonite are rare. These considerations, and comparisons with modern and fossil assemblages, have led to more nuanced reconstructions of the landscape occupied by early humans in southern England similar to 500 ka ago.

AB  - communities inhabiting the grass stand were studied during periods of relatively high (2006-2008) and almost nonexistent (2015-2017) emissions from Middle Ural Copper Smelter (MUCS) (main pollutants: SO2 and heavy metals; the total volume of emissions dropped between the periods by 75 times to 3000 t/yr). In 2015 and 2016, strong weather fluctuations were noted; potentially, such fluctuations could negate the recovery processes that had just begun. Still, in the moderately contaminated area, recovery signs were registered both in the grass stand (an increase in the phytomass of forbs by 1.5 times and its share in the total phytomass from 56 to 76%, as well as an increase in the similarity of the species structure with uncon-taminated areas) and in invertebrate communities (the abundance of sucking herbivores decreased by 1.3 times; the abundance of cicadae, by 1.6 times; and the similarity between the background and buffer zones in trophic and taxonomic structures of communities increased). No recovery signs were detected in the severely contaminated area. The results confirm the hypotheses stating that in severely contaminated areas, the disturbed state of meadow communities is stable; while in moderately contaminated areas, meadow com-munities recover relatively quickly.

AB  - Plant-animal interactions fall within a mutualism-antagonism continuum, exerting a wide range of effects on plant reproductive success. These effects become even more complex and diverse when several disparate animal species interact with the same plant species. Despite the increasing number of studies about the influence of herbivory on plant performance, the outcomes mediated by pollination and the combined impact of multiple herbivores on pollination-specialized plants are underexplored. In this study, we chose the Mediterranean dwarf palm Chamaerops humilis (Arecaceae) to illustrate the isolated and joint effect of two contrasting introduced herbivores, the palm borer Paysandisia archon (Lepidoptera, Castniidae) and feral goats, on pollinator abundance and plant reproductive success. To this aim, we monitored moth herbivory and goat herbivory in four palm populations in Mallorca (Balearic Islands) during 2019 and 2020. The effect of herbivory varied widely depending on both the herbivore and the pollinator species. Moth herbivory had a positive effect on pollinator abundance and fruit initiation, whereas goat herbivory had a negative effect on inflorescence production, pollinator abundance and fruit initiation. In addition, both herbivores exerted unexpected nonadditive effects on palm reproduction. Palms attacked by both herbivore species produced many more inflorescences (up to 18-fold) but had a lower fruit initiation success (close to zero) than unattacked palms or those attacked by a single herbivore species. Interestingly, only one of the two main pollinator species (the nitidulid beetle Meligethinus pallidulus) was impacted by herbivory. Our study highlights the need to investigate the possible nonadditive effects of all coexisting herbivores on plant performance, especially when establishing conservation plans and pest control strategies.

AB  - Bycatch is a global problem for marine megafauna. Peru is a major fishing nation known in particular for its industrial purse-seine fishery for the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens). However, Peru also has an artisanal purse-seine fishery for this same resource and other species such as Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis), Pacific chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) and Chilean jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi) used for human consumption. While there is limited documentation of bycatch of megafauna by the industrial purse-seine fishery, there is no similar information for the artisanal purse-seine fishery. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the marine megafauna (small-cetaceans, seabirds, sea turtles, and elasmobranchs) bycatch interactions of the Peruvian artisanal purseseine fishery for consumption for the year 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) through interviews with artisanal fishers in 5 landing ports (San Jose, Santa Rosa, Callao, Pucusana, and San Andres). We found that these fisheries had bycatch with all taxa groups, with dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), guanay cormorants (Leucocarbo bougainvilliorum) and eagle rays (Myliobatis spp.) having the highest quantity and most frequently reported bycatch. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) indicated an association between the bycatch of 1-3 common dolphins (Delphinus spp.) per set from the northern ports (San Jose and Santa Rosa) and vessels of 20-36 MT. Likewise, a relationship was found between smooth hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna zygaena) and vessel storage capacity, with a similar result reported for the bycatch of humpback smoothhounds (Mustelus whitneyi). In addition, a relationship of eagle ray (Myliobatis spp.) bycatch with a landing port was identified, and several respondents mentioned catching more than 1 MT per set. Fifty-three percent of fishers considered bycatch to be a problem, mainly because it wastes their time during fishing operations. This preliminary study is the first research that demonstrates bycatch in artisanal purse-seine in Peru and can serve as a baseline for future research. We also highlight the need to quantify bycatch rates of marine megafauna using additional methodologies, such as monitoring with onboard observers.

AB  - In ecosystems, the rates of resource consumption by animals drive the flows of matter and energy. Consumption rates are known to vary according to consumer energy requirements, resource nutrient content and mechanical properties. The aim of our study is to determine how mechanical constraints, compared to energetic and nutritional constraints, explain the variation in leaf litter consumption rates by macrodetritivores. In particular, we focus on the impact of litter toughness. To this end, we propose a non-linear model describing leaf litter consumption rates of detritivore as a function of litter toughness. We also investigate a possible match between bite force and litter toughness, since consumer-resource co-occurrence is thought to be driven by the match between invertebrate mandibular traits and resource toughness. Our study was designed as follows: leaf litter from oak and hornbeam was exposed to field physical and microbial decomposition in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems for selected time periods before it was offered to eight macrodetritivore taxa (three forest stream taxa and five forest soil taxa) in no-choice laboratory feeding experiments. Our findings show that, compared to energetic and nutritional constraints, mechanical traits have a greater impact on litter consumption rate by detritivores. After subtracting the contribution of the detritivore body mass, we report that litter consumption rates depend primarily on litter toughness. A sigmoid function is best suited to characterize the relationship between mass-independent consumption rate and litter toughness. We note that the parameters of our sigmoid model are taxon-specific, suggesting biomechanical thresholds and biological differences among taxa. Interestingly, we found no correlation with detritivore bite force, suggesting that food processing by detritivores does not only depend on mandibles strength.

AB  - The dissemination of specimen data in scientific collections is a crucial step in making them available to the scientific community. However, even today, especially in some countries, little or nothing is known about the contents of the naturalistic collections of some museums. This is regrettable, especially in cases where the collections include historic specimens and endangered species. The Museum of Comparative Anatomy "Giovanni Battista Grassi", situated in Rome, Italy, houses historical anatomical and didactic collections, with specimens gathered from 1600s and almost worldwide. The collection holds 444 specimens of medium and large-sized terrestrial mammals, comprising 25 fossils, 40 skins, 186 skulls, 70 skeletons and 123 anatomical pieces, representing 63% of recent mammal orders, mainly from localities of Africa and Europe. A list of this material, indexed by the orders and families, is provided, as well as comments on the conservation status of the species. Remarkable data are summarised, including new data on a hippopotamus specimen from an extinct population and the record of three rhinoceros species from 1600s. Besides comparative anatomical studies, the Museum of Comparative Anatomy of Sapienza University emerges as a source of important material for biodiversity genomics.

AB  - Although the nighttime ecology of organisms remains understudied, nocturnal surveys play an integral part in assessing fish assemblages and the selective forces shaping them. Eleuthera (Bahamas) contains an unusual population of lined seahorses (Hippocampus erectus) in an anchialine lake, possessing morphological characteristics distinct from those found in the ocean. Population surveys for seahorses and their potential predators were conducted at midnight and midday during wet and dry seasons, with belt transects perpendicular to the shoreline that increased in depth away from shore. Nocturnal surveys uncovered seahorse densities 259% higher than daytime transects on average. Sex ratios were consistently male-biased, and the frequency of animals from different reproductive categories varied significantly by time of day, with gravid males observed around the clock but females and nongravid males observed more often at night. Spatial and seasonal recruitment was detected for the first time in this species, with an increase in juveniles detected in the shallow ends of transects during dry season surveys. Juvenile recruitment is poorly understood across syngnathid fishes, so the detection of early recruits at night has broad implications for this fish family. Seahorses from all reproductive categories were perched significantly higher in the water column during the night regardless of their depth or season. Predator densities followed a similar pattern with higher densities observed at night, indicating that elevated nocturnal perch height may be a response to predator presence. However, the selective agents driving these nocturnal behaviors have yet to be identified. Considering H. erectus is listed on the IUCN Red List as "Vulnerable, " the increase in nocturnal population size and the detection of juveniles has crucial implications for understanding their ecology, recruitment, and conservation.

AB  - Morelet's crocodile populations have limited distribution along the coast of Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala, and have been greatly affected by human activities. Morelet's crocodile is a species with high ecological and economic value. From an ecological perspective, it is an apex predator in the ecosystems in which it lives. Because of their vulnerable status is essential to have updated information on its populations over time to know their current conservation status. We analyze with a population model the vital rates of importance for the management and conservation of this species. Population growth with the Nocturnal Visual Detection model showed growth (lambda = 1.027) over a 100 years, as in modeling Marking and Recapture of Specimens model (lambda = 1.026). The largest reproductive value (v) was observed in the Adult stage (0.458). The sensitivity matrix indicated that the most sensitivity was offspring production by Adults (5.59). The data presented here show that the main factors impacting adult survival and the transition from Subadult to Adult stages alter population growth. Using the results of this model to quantitatively compare the conservation strategy can prove extremely useful to discern the parameters that must be taken into consideration and their potential effect on the population.

AB  - Male and female dioecious tropical trees are subjected to distinct demands that may influence their ecology. An example is Myrianthus holstii Engl. that produces persistent fruit eaten by elephants and other large mammals that frequently damage the trees. Myrianthus holstii populations were assessed with 24 2-km transects, spanning an elevation range of 1435-2495 m in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda. Of 1089 stems >= 5 cm diameter 449 were female, 383 were male and the rest were non-fertile. We also noted one apparently monoecious individual. Males produced flowers at smaller sizes than did females (minimum recorded diameters 5.5 cm and 6.8 cm, respectively). Both sexes had similar distributions, favouring moderately closed forest and mid-slope locations. Female trees were more frequently damaged and typically slightly shorter than males at large diameters. Seedling densities were positively associated with the presence of larger female trees. Our results are consistent with a life history where both sexes have similar requirements, but fruiting females experience a greater frequency of severe damage.

AB  - An understanding of public preference for species is critical for conservation efforts because successful conservation action often requires human intervention. In this study, we introduce a novel research approach using toy models to assess wildlife preference and perceived masculinity/femininity among children and adults in multi-generation households across a spectrum of socio-demographic and household-level characteristics. The golden retriever, gray wolf, monarch butterfly, and lion were the most preferred species for both children and adults. The lion, bull shark, wild boar, gray wolf, and black bear were ranked by parents as the most masculine and the monarch butterfly and flamingo most feminine. We observed differences in preference based on gender, race, ownership of pets, and household participation in hunting or bird watching. These findings suggest significant preference overlap between children and adults and the possibility of intergenerational transfer of gendered preferences for wildlife species.

AB  - Heat stress disturbs cellular homeostasis and alters the fitness of individual organisms. However, it is unclear whether thermal perturbations exacerbate the toxic effects of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) on trophic endpoints in freshwater ecosystems. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to investigate the impact of warming and PFASs on the widespread submerged macrophytes (Hydrilla verticillata) at a molecular level. Quantitative and air flow-assisted ionization mass spectrometry imaging results showed that warming significantly increased the accumulation of PFOS (3.53 L/kg) in the submerged leaf tissues. Accumulation of PFASs altered H. verticillata intracellular scavenging enzymes, an effect that may be exacerbated by 4 degrees C warming. Warming and PFASs influenced photosynthesis, biological rhythms, and ecological stoichiometry, causing a decrease in metabolites linked to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid metabolism, which compromised nitrogen use efficiency (9.9%-30.4% reduction in nitrogen content, 0.8%-22.8% increase in C:N ratios). Additionally, metabolites are linked to the antioxidant system or cell wall components, with linoleic acid decreasing by 17.1%-82.8% and carbohydrate-related compounds dropping by 52.2%-89.0%. Our modeling analyses revealed that H. verticillata enriched with PFASs could pose secondary risks when consumed by herbivorous fish (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) under warming, potentially affecting food chain dynamics.

AB  - The impact of the rapidly changing Arctic on zooplankton community structure and seasonal behaviour is not yet understood. Here we examine 6 months of under-ice zooplankton observations from the N-ICE2015 expedition (January to June 2015) in the Nansen Basin and on the Yermak Plateau north of Svalbard. Stratified sampling in the water column was done with MultiNet during the entire expedition, and sampling in the upper 5 m below sea ice was performed during April-May by divers using a hand-held net. Hydrographic conditions were dominated by northward-flowing warm and saline Atlantic Water at intermediate depth, and southward-flowing cold Polar Surface Water in the upper 100 m. The mesozooplankton was dominated by copepods. Most numerous were the small ubiquitous Oithona similis in the upper 200 m, with Microcalanus spp. and Triconia borealis further down the water column. Calanus finmarchicus dominated among the Calanus species while Metridia longa was also numerous. The most abundant deep-water copepods were Paraeuchaeta spp. and Spinocalanus spp. Arrow worms (Chaetognatha) and comb jellies (Ctenophora) were the most numerous non-copepods. The mesozooplankton community was more dependent on surrounding water mass characteristics, such as salinity and depth, than geographical location. Algal food availability, which was closely linked to seasonality, explained the community changes seen in surface waters in May and June due to seasonal ascent and recruitment. Seasonal changes from winter to spring mostly involved an increase in the herbivorous C. finmarchicus and its nauplii in the upper 200 m of the water column coinciding with the peak of the phytoplankton bloom in late May. The Yermak Plateau and adjacent Nansen Basin were characterised by oceanic North Atlantic and Arctic species, many of which are deep water specialists. Despite the late onset of the spring bloom due to consolidated sea ice, both North Atlantic and Arctic species successfully reproduced in the study area. This explains the species-rich mesozooplankton community in this region as opposed to the less productive central Arctic Ocean. Future prospects of less sea ice and earlier onset of the bloom will likely be positive for the overall secondary production by both Arctic and boreal zooplankton in this region.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cryopreservation is an important technique for the long-term storage of semen for artificial insemination (AI). Buffalo spermatozoa are sensitive to cryopreservation procedures because of the presence of a high amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of different concentrations of BHT on the quality of Murrah buffalo bull semen for low-dose cryopreservation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Semen was collected from four high fertile Murrah buffalo bulls (6 ejaculates each) using an artificial vagina. A total of 24 ejaculates were collected from each bull twice a week using an artificial vagina. Every sample was split into four parts: Control without additives; and three treatments with BHT at 0.5 mM, 1 mM or 2 mM. Semen was cryopreserved at low-dose sperm cryopreservation of 20, 15, 10 and 5 million sperm per aliquot after supplementation of BHT. Semen samples were evaluated for fresh, pre-freeze and post-thaw stages. RESULTS: There was a significant increase (p<0.05) in sperm quality parameters, such as progressive motility (%), viability (%), HOST response (%), acrosome integrity (%) and post-thaw motility, with the addition of 0.5-1 mM BHT. CONCLUSION: The addition of BHT in Murrah buffalo semen improves the low dose cryopreservation quality in a dose-dependent manner.

AB  - Estuaries provide a variety of habitat types for fishes, where abundant food resources and protection from predators have been identified as important drivers of the high abundance of species that use these areas as nursery grounds. However, scientific consensus regarding the role of some habitats as nurseries remains limited. Here, we analyzed the trophic ecology of four juvenile fish species (Atherinella brasiliensis, Anchoa hepsetus, Rhinosardinia bahiensis, and Diapterus rhombeus) that occupy three habitats in a tropical estuary (mangrove fringes, seagrass beds, and mudflats), using samples collected during rainy and dry seasons. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether variations in the diet composition of juvenile fishes were mediated by changes in zooplankton prey availability in these estuarine habitats during the seasonal cycle (rainy/dry). The fish and zooplankton prey were caught at the same time. The analysis suggested that changes in the abundance of zooplankton prey items in estuarine habitats and seasons may have significant effects on fish diet. However, complex habitat structure did not drive predator-prey relationships. Mudflats are the main foraging sites for juvenile fishes in this tropical estuary, while fringe mangrove showed a weak influence on the abundance and diet of juvenile filter-feeders (R. bahiensis and A. hepsetus). The juvenile fish species were dependent on multiple habitats, and no species used only one habitat type exclusively. Understanding the dynamics of prey resources in different estuarine habitats is critical for their conservation, especially in those habitats that are uncommonly considered, such as mudflats.

AB  - Novel crop rotation is an important factor influencing the composition of soil microorganisms. However, the effect of introducing oilseed and cover crops (CCs) into monoculture durum rotations on soil microbial communities is not clear in the Northern Great Plains. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of 2-year durum (Triticum durum D.) rotations with Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata A.) or camelina (Camelina sativa L.) or a 10-species forage/CC mix planted to replace fallow rotations with wheat on soil microorganisms. This study was designed as a randomized complete block with three replications in a no-tillage system. The results showed that total bacterial proportion was significantly higher in durum following fallow and camelina compared to durum following CC and carinata. Total fungal proportion was significantly higher in durum following CC compared to durum following oilseed crops and fallow. The fungal-to-bacterial ratio was significantly higher in durum following CC compared to durum following camelina and fallow. The crop species, soil pH and highly variable rainfall influenced the microbial community dynamics. The abundance of specific microbial groups due to crop-related changes might play a key role in the yield of subsequent crops and soil biological health. This study provides valuable insights into the use of CC mix and oilseeds as an alternative crop for fallow in a wheat-fallow system under dryland farming conditions. Future work is required to elucidate the biological mechanisms and functions of the soil microbial communities in the preceding and subsequent crop relative to soil health and crop productivity.

AB  - The woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) was a cold-adapted herbivore, widely distributed from western Europe to north-east Siberia during the Late Pleistocene. Previous studies have associated the extinction of the species similar to 14,000 calendar years before present to climatic and vegetational changes, suggesting the later survival of populations in north-east Siberia may have related to the later persistence of open vegetation in the region. Here, we analyzed carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotopes and mitochondrial DNA sequences to elucidate the evolutionary ecology of the species. Our dataset comprised 286 woolly rhinoceros isotopic records, including 192 unpublished records, from across the species range, dating from >58,600 to 12,135 C-14 years before present (equivalent to 14,040 calendar years ago). Crucially, we present the first 71 isotopic records available to date of the 15,000 years preceding woolly rhinoceros extinction. The data revealed ecological flexibility and geographic variation in woolly rhinoceros stable isotope compositions across time. In north-east Siberia, we detected stability in delta N-15 through time, which could reflect long-term environmental stability, and may have enabled the later survival of the species in the region. To further investigate the paleoecology of woolly rhinoceroses, we compared their isotopic compositions with other contemporary herbivores. Our findings suggested isotopic similarities between woolly rhinoceros and both musk ox (Ovibos moschatus) and saiga (Saiga tatarica), albeit at varying points in time, and possible niche partitioning between woolly rhinoceros and both horse (Equus spp.) and woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius). To provide phylogeographic context to the isotopic data, we compiled and analyzed the 61 published mitochondrial control region sequences. The genetic data showed a lack of geographic structuring; we found three haplogroups with overlapping distributions, all of which showed a signal of expansion during the Last Glacial Maximum. Furthermore, our genetic findings support the notion that environmental stability in Siberia influenced the paleoecology of woolly rhinoceroses in the region. Our study highlights the utility of combining stable isotopic records with ancient DNA to advance our knowledge of the evolutionary ecology of past populations and extinct species.

AB  - Simple Summary Disease prevention and appropriate wildlife management are among the major challenges in wildlife conservation. In the present study, we made a first assessment of the variability of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes in roe deer in Slovenia and evaluated local population adaptation by comparing MHC variability with neutral microsatellites. We discovered three new MHC DRB exon 2 alleles in addition to seven previously described in the literature. Moreover, we found evidence of historical positive selection, as selection analysis indicated that approx. 10% of the encoded amino acids were subjected to episodic positive selection. This study provides the basis for further research on immunogenetic variation in roe deer and highlights opportunities to incorporate genetic data into science-based population management. Disease control and containment in free-ranging populations is one of the greatest challenges in wildlife management. Despite the importance of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes for immune response, an assessment of the diversity and occurrence of these genes is still rare in European roe deer, the most abundant and widespread large mammal in Europe. Therefore, we examined immunogenetic variation in roe deer in Slovenia to identify species adaptation by comparing the genetic diversity of the MHC genes with the data on neutral microsatellites. We found ten MHC DRB alleles, three of which are novel. Evidence for historical positive selection on the MHC was found using the maximum likelihood codon method. Patterns of MHC allelic distribution were not congruent with neutral population genetic findings. The lack of population genetic differentiation in MHC genes compared to existing structure in neutral markers suggests that MHC polymorphism was influenced primarily by balancing selection and, to a lesser extent, by neutral processes such as genetic drift, with no clear evidence of local adaptation. Selection analyses indicated that approx. 10% of amino acids encoded under episodic positive selection. This study represents one of the first steps towards establishing an immunogenetic map of roe deer populations across Europe, aiming to better support science-based management of this important game species.

AB  - Herbivorous insects tolerate chemical and metabolic variation in their host plant diet by modulating physiological traits. Insect immune response is one such trait that plays a crucial role in maintaining fitness but can be heavily influenced by variation in host plant quality. An important question is how the use of different host plants affects the ability of herbivorous insects to resist viral pathogens. Furthermore, the transcriptional changes associated with this interaction of diet and viral pathogens remain understudied. The Melissa blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa) has colonised the exotic legume Medicago sativa as a larval host within the past 200 years. We used this system to study the interplay between the effects of host plant variation and viral infection on physiological responses and global gene expression. We measured immune strength in response to infection by the Junonia coenia densovirus (JcDV) in two ways: (1) direct measurement of phenoloxidase activity and melanisation, and (2) transcriptional sequencing of individuals exposed to different viral and host plant treatments. Our results demonstrate that viral infection caused total phenoloxidase (total PO) to increase and viral infection and host plant interactively affected total PO such that for infected larvae, total PO was significantly higher for larvae consuming the native host plant. Additionally, L. melissa larvae differentially expressed several hundred genes in response to host plant treatment, but with minimal changes in gene expression in response to viral infection. Not only immune genes, but several detoxification, transporter, and oxidase genes were differentially expressed in response to host plant treatments. These results demonstrate that in herbivorous insects, consumption of a novel host plant can alter both physiological and transcriptional responses relevant to viral infection, emphasising the importance of considering immune and detoxification mechanisms into models of evolution of host range in herbivorous insects.

AB  - Species interactions are expected to change in myriad ways as the frequency and magnitude of extreme temperature events increase with anthropogenic climate change.The relationships between endosymbionts, parasites and their hosts are particularly sensitive to thermal stress, which can have cascading effects on other trophic levels.We investigate the interactive effects of heat stress and parasitism on a terrestrial tritrophic system consisting of two host plants (one common, high-quality plant and one novel, low-quality plant), a caterpillar herbivore and a specialist parasitoid wasp.We used a fully factorial experiment to determine the bottom-up effects of the novel host plant on both the caterpillars' life history traits and the wasps' survival, and the top-down effects of parasitism and heat shock on caterpillar developmental outcomes and herbivory levels.Host plant identity interacted with thermal stress to affect wasp success, with wasps performing better on the low-quality host plant under constant temperatures but worse under heat-shock conditions.Surprisingly, caterpillars consumed less leaf material from the low-quality host plant to reach the same final mass across developmental outcomes.In parasitized caterpillars, heat shock reduced parasitoid survival and increased both caterpillar final mass and development time on both host plants.These findings highlight the importance of studying community-level responses to climate change from a holistic and integrative perspective and provide insight into potential substantial interactions between thermal stress and diet quality in plant-insect systems.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Co-composting is the controlled aerobic degradation of organics, using more than one feedstock. By combining the spent mushroom substrate of Pholiota nameko (SMS) and pig manure (PM), the benefits of each could be used to optimize the composting process and the final product. This study introduced a comprehensive evaluation strategy aimed at identifying the optimal co-composting ratio for these two substrates. A 120-day composting trial was conducted, blending SMS and PM in various ratios to evaluate the benefits of co-composting SMS-PM. The results indicated that dissolved organic matter (DOM) in SMS-derived compost primarily originated from plants, whereas PM-derived compost predominantly consisted of microbial metabolic products, and cocomposting combined both sources. An increase in aromaticity and humification degree of DOM occurred during the composting process itself rather than being derived from autochthonous origin. Carbohydrates like phenols and alcohols broke down during composting, and microbes utilized polysaccharides as an energy source for humus formation. As co-composting progressed, the treatments with varying mass ratios of SMS to PM, including 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, 4:6, and 3:7 were observed to result in a decline in aliphatic hydroxylated chains alongside an enhancement in aromaticity within the compost. Additionally, there was a conversion from organic carbon (C) to carboxyl C within humic acid (HA) due to oxidation and dehydrogenation processes that facilitated the formation of stable nitrogen-containing compounds characterized by condensed aromatic structures. Following thorough evaluation, it was determined that optimal composting efficacy occurred at a mass ratio of SMS to PM equal to 6:4. Post-compost analysis revealed increases in nutrient content; specifically, germination index (GI) value reached 132.7%, while organic matter content attained 45.3%. Conversely, electrical conductivity (EC), C contents of water-soluble substances and humin (Cwss and CHu) decreased by approximately 11.8%, 73.4%, and 29.8% respectively; meanwhile, C contents of humic-extracted acid and HA (CHE and CHA), along with degree of polymerization (DP), increased by 17.3%, 20.3% and 9.9% respectively. The proposed cocompost formula not only facilitated simultaneous recycling of both SMS and PM waste but also transformed them into high-quality organic fertilizers suitable for soil enrichment-effectively addressing challenges faced by both edible fungi cultivation and livestock industries while augmenting organic fertilizer sources for Black land protection.

AB  - Ecological theory predicts that herbivory should be weaker on islands than on mainland based on the assumption that islands have lower herbivore abundance and diversity. However, empirical tests of this prediction are rare, especially for insect herbivores, and those few tests often fail to address the mechanisms behind island-mainland divergence in herbivory. In particular, past studies have not addressed the relative contribution of top-down (i.e. predator-driven) and bottom-up (i.e. plant-driven) factors to these dynamics. To address this, we experimentally excluded insectivorous vertebrate predators (e.g. birds, bats) and measured leaf traits associated with herbivory in 52 populations of 12 oak (Quercus) species in three island-mainland sites: The Channel Islands of California vs. mainland California, Balearic Islands vs. mainland Spain, and the island Bornholm vs. mainland Sweden (N = 204 trees). In each site, at the end of the growing season, we measured leaf damage by insect herbivores on control vs. predator-excluded branches and measured leaf traits, namely: phenolic compounds, specific leaf area, and nitrogen and phosphorous content. In addition, we obtained climatic and soil data for island and mainland populations using global databases. Specifically, we tested for island-mainland differences in herbivory, and whether differences in vertebrate predator effects or leaf traits between islands and mainland contributed to explaining the observed herbivory patterns. Supporting predictions, herbivory was lower on islands than on mainland, but only in the case of Mediterranean sites (California and Spain). We found no evidence for vertebrate predator effects on herbivory on either islands or mainland in any study site. In addition, while insularity affected leaf traits in some of the study sites (Sweden-Bornholm and California), these effects were seemingly unrelated to differences in herbivory. Synthesis. Our results suggest that vertebrate predation and the studied leaf traits did not contribute to island-mainland variation patterns in herbivory, calling for more nuanced and comprehensive investigations of predator and plant trait effects, including measurements of other plant traits and assessments of predation by different groups of natural enemies.
   La teor & iacute;a ecol & oacute;gica predice que la herbivor & iacute;a ha de ser m & aacute;s d & eacute;bil en las islas que en el continente, ya que las islas tienen una menor abundancia y diversidad de herb & iacute;voros. Sin embargo, todav & iacute;a no contamos con suficiente evidencia emp & iacute;rica que apoye estas predicciones, especialmente en lo que se refiere a la herbivor & iacute;a por insectos, y los pocos estudios que existen a menudo no abordan los mecanismos que generan estos patrones de divergencia entre islas y continente en los niveles de herbivor & iacute;a. En particular, las investigaciones previas no han examinado la contribuci & oacute;n relativa de las fuerzas top-down (es decir, efectos mediados por los depredadores) y bottom-up (es decir, efectos mediados por los rasgos funcionales de las plantas) en estas din & aacute;micas. En este trabajo, excluimos experimentalmente a depredadores insect & iacute;voros vertebrados (p. ej., aves, murci & eacute;lagos) y medimos rasgos foliares asociados con la herbivor & iacute;a en 52 poblaciones de 12 especies de robles (Quercus) en tres sitios insulares y continentales: las Islas del Canal de California vs. California continental, las Islas Baleares vs. Espa & ntilde;a continental, y la isla de Bornholm vs. Suecia continental (N = 204 & aacute;rboles). En cada sitio, al final de la & eacute;poca de crecimiento, medimos el da & ntilde;o foliar causado por insectos herb & iacute;voros en ramas control vs. ramas con exclusi & oacute;n de depredadores, y medimos diferentes rasgos foliares, en particular, la concentraci & oacute;n de compuestos fen & oacute;licos, el & aacute;rea foliar espec & iacute;fica y el contenido de nitr & oacute;geno y f & oacute;sforo. Adem & aacute;s, obtuvimos datos clim & aacute;ticos y de suelo de las poblaciones insulares y continentales utilizando bases de datos globales. Espec & iacute;ficamente, evaluamos los efectos de la insularidad sobre la herbivor & iacute;a y si exist & iacute;an patrones contrastados de los efectos de depredaci & oacute;n y expresi & oacute;n de rasgos foliares entre islas y continentes que contribuyesen a explicar los patrones observados en la herbivor & iacute;a. De acuerdo con la teor & iacute;a ecol & oacute;gica, la herbivor & iacute;a fue menor en las islas en comparaci & oacute;n con el continente, pero solo en el caso de los sitios mediterr & aacute;neos (California y Espa & ntilde;a). No encontramos evidencia de efectos de los depredadores sobre la herbivor & iacute;a en ninguno de los sitios de estudio, ya sea en las islas o en el continente. Adem & aacute;s, aunque la insularidad afect & oacute; a la expresi & oacute;n de rasgos foliares en algunos de los sitios de estudio (Suecia-Bornholm y California), estos efectos no estuvieron aparentemente relacionados con las diferencias observadas en la herbivor & iacute;a. S & iacute;ntesis. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la depredaci & oacute;n por vertebrados y los rasgos foliares estudiados no contribuyeron a los patrones de variaci & oacute;n entre islas y continente observados en los niveles de herbivor & iacute;a, lo que plantea la necesidad de investigaciones m & aacute;s exhaustivas que incluyan la evaluaci & oacute;n de otros rasgos funcionales y evaluaciones de la depredaci & oacute;n por otros grupos de enemigos naturales de los herb & iacute;voros.

AB  - The parameters of hydrological models should be determined before applying those models to estimate or predict hydrological processes. The Xin'anjiang (XAJ) hydrological model is widely used throughout China. Since the prediction in ungauged basins (PUB) era, the regionalization of the XAJ model parameters has been a subject of intense focus; nevertheless, while many efforts have targeted parameters related to runoff yield using in-site data sets, classic regression has predominantly been applied. In this paper, we employed remotely sensed underlying surface data and a machine learning approach to establish models for estimating the runoff routing parameter, namely, CS, of the XAJ model. The study was conducted on 114 catchments from the Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) data set, and the relationships between CS and various underlying surface characteristics were explored by a gradient-boosted regression tree (GBRT). The results showed that the drainage density, stream source density and area of the catchment were the three major factors with the most significant impact on CS. The best correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) between the GBRT-estimated and calibrated CS were 0.96, 0.06 and 0.04, respectively, verifying the good performance of GBRT in estimating CS. Although bias was noted between the GBRT-estimated and calibrated CS, runoff simulations using the GBRT-estimated CS could still achieve results comparable to those using the calibrated CS. Further validations based on two catchments in China confirmed the overall robustness and accuracy of simulating runoff processes using the GBRT-estimated CS. Our results confirm the following hypotheses: (1) with the help of large sample of catchments and associated remote sensing data, the ML-based approach can capture the nonstationary and nonlinear relationships between CS and the underlying surface characteristics and (2) CS estimated by ML from large samples has a robustness that can guarantee the overall performance of the XAJ mode. This study advances the methodology for quantitatively estimating the XAJ model parameters and can be extended to other parameters or other models.

AB  - PurposeVerification monitoring was performed over five years following the sediment remediation of the Buffalo River Area of Concern (AOC), New York, USA. Monitoring results were compared with surface sediment cleanup goals to determine whether natural sedimentation allowed the AOC to achieve long-term remedial goals without the placement of cover material to manage dredge residuals.Material and methodsMonitoring was conducted two years and five years following sediment remediation and included: 1) bathymetric surveys to understand sediment stability and deposition rates, and 2) the analysis of surface sediment samples for four primary chemicals of concern (COCs), including polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), lead, and mercury, to compare surface sediment concentrations over time with site-specific sediment remedial goals.Results and discussionThe monitoring results demonstrated the following: 1) sedimentation is occurring, 2) a stable depositional environment is present throughout the Buffalo River AOC, and 3) measurable reductions in sediment concentrations were observed for PAHs, PCBs, lead and mercury in the newly deposited sediment. By Year 5, surface sediment chemistry results generally achieved the remedial goals throughout the Buffalo River AOC.ConclusionMonitored natural recovery (MNR) was effective in physically isolating dredge residuals in the Buffalo River AOC, following sediment removal. This post-dredging MNR approach met the surface sediment remedial goals in most areas, resulted in a protective and cost-effective project by not requiring the placement of clean cover material in the dredge areas, and was an environmentally sustainable strategy by eliminating the need to collect, transport, and place millions of kilograms of clean quarried material in the river.

AB  - It is generally believed that marsupials are more primitive than placentals mammals and mainly solitary living, representing the ancestral form of social organization of all mammals. However, field studies have observed pair and group-living in marsupial species, but no comparative study about their social evolution was ever done. Here, we describe the results of primary literature research on marsupial social organization which indicates that most species can live in pairs or groups and many show intra-specific variation in social organization. Using Bayesian phylogenetic mixed-effects models with a weak phylogenetic signal of 0.18, we found that solitary living was the most likely ancestral form (35% posterior probability), but had high uncertainty, and the combined probability of a partly sociable marsupial ancestor (65%) should not be overlooked. For Australian marsupials, group-living species were less likely to be found in tropical rainforest, and species with a variable social organization were associated with low and unpredictable precipitation representing deserts. Our results suggest that modern marsupials are more sociable than previously believed and that there is no strong support that their ancestral state was strictly solitary living, such that the assumption of a solitary ancestral state of all mammals may also need reconsideration.

AB  - The life history aspects of dormancy of the weevil Anthonomus rufipennis LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) were studied a 57-month period in a seasonally dry tropical forest of central Mexico. Weevil populations and their physiological status were monitored on both the reproductive host tree, Senna polyantha (Collad.) H.S: Irwin & Barneby (Fabales: Fabaceae) and the highly favored refuge host, Tillandsia recurvata L. (Poales: Bromeliaceae) or "ball moss." During the dry season, weevils were only found on the refuge host with a mean total density of 1.014 +/- 2.532 individuals/ball moss (N = 1,681). Weevil densities on T. recurvata between early and late dry seasons were not significantly different, suggesting that dry season survival was relatively high. Weevils collected during these seasons revealed little reproductive development and relatively high-fat accumulation in both sexes. During 5 of 6 yr, densities of the weevils in T. recurvata dropped significantly during the early rainy seasons, when the reproductive host trees leafed out and began producing oviposition sites (flower buds). At this time, more males than females initially moved to vegetative trees and showed significant signs of reproductive development. Recolonization of ball moss by weevils began during the late rainy season when oviposition sites (flower buds) were still available. A proportion of the weevils remained on the reproductive host, suggesting that A. rufipennis is facultatively multivoltine. The methodologies and results of the study can serve as a model system for future studies of the dormancy of other insects in dry tropical forests and provide insight into the dormancy of other anthonomine weevils of economic importance.

AB  - Livestock wastewater has led to serious eco-environmental issues. To effectively treat livestock wastewater and realize the resource utilization of livestock solid waste, manure waste has been widely used to prepare biochar for the recovery of nitrogen and phosphorus. However, fresh biochar has a poor ability to adsorb phosphate due to its negative charge. To overcome the defect, the proportion of biochar samples prepared at 400 ? and 700 ? was optimized under a mass ratio of 2:3 to obtain mixed biochar PM 4-7, achieving the purpose of enhanced ammonium and phosphate recovery in livestock wastewater simultaneously without any modification. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, dosage, and pH were studied, different adsorption models were used to explore the adsorption mechanism, and the effect of biochar loaded with nutrient elements on seed was verified through a seed germination experiment. It was revealed that the maximum removal rates of phosphate and ammonium were 33.88 % and 41.50 %, respectively, endorsing that mixed biochar PM 4-7 can recover nutrients from livestock wastewater, and could be used as a slow-release fertilizer to promote seed germination and growth. This method provides a new potential way for the efficient resource utilization of pig manure and the recovery of nutrients from breeding wastewater.

AB  - A statewide survey of the tick fauna found on deer, using harvested deer heads as the sample unit, was conducted during the Alabama hunting seasons of 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. Four species of ticks: Ixodes scapularis (n= 936, % of catch 69.1%), Amblyomma americanum (315, 23.2%), Dermacentor albipictus (97, 7.1%), and Amblyomma maculatum (6, 0.4%) were taken from 151 deer heads harvested from 21 deer processing centers (n = 4-17 heads/processor). A total of 87.7% (prevalence) of deer heads had one or more ticks. We used two standard numerical descriptors of tick numbers, abundance, and relative abundance. No significant stepwise regressions (p > 0.05) were found between tick abundance (all ticks, I. scapularis, A. americanum) and the predictor variables of latitude, deer density, season, and year. In addition, the correlation between the abundance of I. scapularis and A. americanum was not significant (p > 0.5). In contrast, the relative abundance of both I. scapularis and A. americanum showed a significant (P < 0.05) relationship with latitude, with the relative abundance of I. scapularis increasing on deer with increased latitude and A. americanum showing the opposite pattern.

AB  - This study provides an updated list of fish in the Class Chondrichthyes sampled during all research projects conducted in the north-western Ionian Sea from 1985 to 2020. A total of 36 Chondrichthyes species belonging to 8 orders and 19 families were detected, most of them distributed over a wide depth range, between shelf and slope. For species assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 8 species are listed as Critically Endangered, 3 as Endangered, 6 Vulnerable and 5 as Near Threatened species. The distribution of cartilaginous fish was examined exploring the historical series of MEDITS data (1995-2020. Changes in the species diversity and in their abundance with time and space were detected and some environmental and anthropogenic drivers that could have caused these changes were analysed. An increase in the presence, number of species and biomass of Chondrichthyes was detected from 1995 to 2020. The GAM analyses seem to indicate that the observed increase in species number and biomass is due to the decrease in fishing capacity and increase in salinity and temperature on the bottom. Furthermore, for the most abundant species, Galeus melastomus, an increase of biomass, size and a deeper distribution over the last 26 years were detected. Significant changes in biomass were also observed for other abundant species in the study area (Scyliorhinus canicula and Raja miraletus). The increase in biomass over time, different from several Mediterranean observations, is discussed in relation to the presence of refuge areas in the north-western Ionian Sea.

AB  - Invited Research Highlight: Matthews, A. E., Trevelline, B. K., Wijeratne, A. J., & Boves, T. J. (2024). Picky eaters: Selective microbial diet of avian ectosymbionts. Journal of Animal Ecology. Trophic interactions such as herbivory and predation are crucial regulators of ecological communities, yet few examples exist for these processes within host-associated microbiomes. In a recent study, Matthews et al. (2024) looked for evidence of selective microbial predation of bacteria and fungi by microscopic mites on the feathers of wild Prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea). The authors quantified the bacterial and fungal diet of commensal feather mites and compared this with the composition of microbial communities living directly on the feather. They found that, despite a large variety of microbes to choose from, mites strongly preferred to eat a small number of bacterial and fungal genera. Some of these selectively enriched taxa are known keratin-degraders, suggesting that mites may protect feathers by selectively consuming harmful microbes. This study presents a rare example of a trophic interaction within the microscopic ecosystem of the feather that may act as an important force shaping microbial communities in ways that benefit the host, providing an overlooked mechanism by which symbioses between birds and mites could evolve.

AB  - Alpacas, important genetic resources in the Andean region of Peru, are vulnerable to diarrhea caused by pathogenic parasites such as Eimeria lamae and Giardia sp., which can be fatal, especially in neonates, due to their physiological immaturity and limited adaptability. The study investigated the diversity and abundance of intestinal fungi and protists in alpacas infected with Eimeria lamae and Giardia sp. compared to healthy alpacas. A total of 19 alpacas, aged between one and two months, were included. They were divided into two groups, one with pathological conditions (nine) and the other healthy (ten). Parasitological analyses for the detection of parasites and subsequent molecular analysis were performed on the collected fecal samples. The results revealed a greater diversity and abundance of protists in infected alpacas in comparison with healthy alpacas, while the fungal composition did not show significant changes. Therefore, parasitic infections affect the protist component of the alpaca gut microbiota. Also, it was observed that Blastocystis was identified in all healthy alpacas, serving as a possible marker of the health of the intestinal microbiota; in addition, Prussia and Pichia are beneficial fungi that help control diseases. This groundbreaking study in neonatal alpacas is the first to explore potential changes in the intestinal microbiota during an infectious state, underscoring the importance of further research to comprehend its effects on alpaca health and immune responses.

AB  - Background and aims - Variation in flower color among individuals within plant populations has long fascinated horticulturalists and evolutionary biologists alike. Nevertheless, the diversity of genetic factors and ecological interactions that act to maintain flower-color polymorphisms over time are understood for very few species. Here, we suggest that Solanum carolinense (horsenettle) makes an excellent model system for studying the evolutionary ecology of a flower- color polymorphism, and we begin to shed insight into factors that might affect the stability of the polymorphism. Material and methods - We transplanted 24 horsenettle ramets of each of 40 field-collected genets (10 genets per each of four source fields) into a common-garden plot (in an oldfield with an existing horsenettle population). For each ramet, we visually characterized petal color and quantified production of flowers, fruits, seeds, and damage by 11 species of herbivores. Key results - Rather than varying continuously within ramets and among genets, petal color fell into three relatively discrete categories that are common in most horsenettle populations: purple, white, and mauve. In the common-garden experiment, purple-petalled morphs initiated significantly more flower buds, opened more flowers, and produced more fruits and seeds than did the mauve-petalled or white-petalled morphs. Petal-color morphs differed only slightly in resistance to a minority of the herbivore community, with no consistent advantage for color morphs across species of herbivores or types of tissues fed upon. Conclusion - Horsenettle has numerous characteristics that make it an excellent system for studying the genetics and ecology that drive the maintenance of flower-color polymorphisms. Although pleiotropic effects of flower-color on resistance to herbivory appear to be minimal in horsenettle, potential pleiotropies that differentially affect maternal and paternal reproduction, or sexual and vegetative reproduction, are worthy of further study.

AB  - The current study investigated the nutrients removal efficiency of the sedge macrophyte Cyperus alopecuroides to treat water eutrophication, besides evaluating the recycling possibility of the harvested material. Samples of sediment, water, and plant tissues were taken seasonally from six polluted and three unpolluted locations for this investigation. The growth properties of C. alopecuroides showed remarkable seasonal differences in plant density and biomass, with the maximum values (7.1 individual/m(2) and 889.6 g/m(2), respectively) obtained during summer and the minimum (4.1 individual/m(2) and 547.2 g/m(2), respectively) in winter. In polluted locations, the above-ground tissues had an efficiency to remove more contents of N and P (11.9 and 3.8 g/m(2), respectively) than in unpolluted ones (7.1 and 3.4 g/m(2), respectively). The high-nutrient standing stock of C. alopecuroides supports its potential use for nutrient removal from eutrophic wetlands. The tissues of C. alopecuroides had the maximum nutrients removal efficiency to remediate great amounts of Na, K, and N in summer, and Ca, P, and Mg in spring. Above- and below-ground parts of C. alopecuroides from unpolluted locations can be considered as a rough forage for beef cattle, dairy cattle, goats, and sheep. The present study indicated the potential of C. alopecuroides in restoring eutrophic freshwater ecosystems, and, thus, it can be used in similar habitats worldwide.

AB  - Goats are ubiquitous, including in hot and dry regions, while also being very sensitive to climate fluctuations, expressed in temperature differences. This affects their productivity and milk quality. Adaptation to heat requires high energy costs, affects "neurohumoral" regulation and is accompanied by oxidative stress with the increased production of free radicals. The aim was to study the main biochemical parameters of goat milk and its antioxidant activity depending on the season of the year. Sampling was carried out in April, June, August and October. Analysis of the biochemical components and antioxidant activity of goat milk was performed using modern analytical systems. From spring to autumn, the mass fraction of true or crude proteins in goat milk increased by 14.6-63.7% or by 12.3-52.1%, and the mass fraction of caseins also increased by 13.6-60.6%. For vitamin C level and the total amount of water-soluble antioxidants, a pronounced gradual decrease from spring to autumn was observed. In the summer period, a small increase in the carotene level in milk (by 3.0-6.1% compared to April) was established. Vitamin A content increased by 86.5% (June) or by 70.3% (October) compared to April. Thus, the numerous significant changes in the major parameters of goat's milk depending on the season were revealed.

AB  - Addition of organic amendments, such as manure and straw, to arable fields as a partial substitute for mineral phospho-rus (P), are a sustainable practice in high-efficiency agricultural production. Different organic inputs may induce var-ied soil organic carbon (OC) stability and phoD harboring microbes, subsequently regulate P behavior, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. A 11-year field experiment examined P forms by 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), OC chemical composition by 13C NMR, and biologically-based P availability methods, phoD bacte-rial communities, and their co-occurrence in soils amended with chemical P fertilizer (CF), chemical P partly substituted by organic amendments including pig manure (CM), a mixture of pig manure and corn straw (CMS), and corn straw (CS), with equal P input in all treatments. Organic amendments significantly increased soil labile Pi (CaCl2-P, citrate-P, 2.91-3.26 and 1.16-1.32 times higher than CF) and Po (enzyme-P, diesters, 4.08-7.47 and 1.71-2.14 times higher than CF) contents and phosphatase activities, while significantly decreased aromaticity (AI) and recalcitrance indexes (RI) of soil C, compared with CF. The keystone genera in manured soils (Alienimomas and Streptomyces) and straw-applied soils (Janthinobacterium and Caulobacter) were significantly correlated with soil enzyme-P, microbial biomass P (MBP), diesters, and citrate-P. Soil AI and RI were significantly correlated with the phoD keystone and soil P species. It suggested that the keystone was impacted by soil OC stability and play a role in regulating P redistribution in amended soils. This study highlights how manure and straw incorporation altered soil OC stability, shaped the phoD harboring community, and enhanced soil P biological processes promoted by the keystone taxa. The partial substitution of mineral P by mixture of manure and straw is effectively promote soil P avail-ability and beneficial for environmental sustainability.

AB  - One of the basics of effectively managing a wild boar population is knowledge of its home range, spatial patterns, and habitat use. However, little is known about the reaction of wild boar to changes in the agricultural landscape during the time of harvesting. In this study, we assessed the impact of crop harvesting on habitat selection of wild boar. For this reason, we analyzed radio-collared animals in four summer months (from June to September) in an agricultural landscape in Poland. We analyzed the habitat selection by wild boar with a generalized linear model and Jacob's selectivity index. The wild boar preference for arable land, pastures and the "other" category showed clear monthly dynamics. In contrast, a stable preference for forests and mosaics was observed throughout all months. The preference of wild boar to arable land dropped significantly in August, which we interpret as the impact of the harvest. We conclude that intensive agriculture contributes to significant changes in the frequency of wild boar in various habitats. This, however, does not apply to all habitats, because forest habitats are constantly visited by wild boar as their main daytime refuge. Moreover, extensive farming, although less attractive for wild boar, is rather neutral and does not alter the abundance of animals in habitats.

AB  - Background Measuring coastal-pelagic prey fields at scales relevant to the movements of marine predators is challenging due to the dynamic and ephemeral nature of these environments. Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) are thought to aggregate in nearshore tropical waters due to seasonally enhanced foraging opportunities. This implies that the three-dimensional movements of these animals may be associated with bio-physical properties that enhance prey availability. To date, few studies have tested this hypothesis.
   Methods Here, we conducted ship-based acoustic surveys, net tows and water column profiling (salinity, temperature, chlorophyll fluorescence) to determine the volumetric density, distribution and community composition of mesozooplankton (predominantly euphausiids and copepods) and oceanographic properties of the water column in the vicinity of whale sharks that were tracked simultaneously using satellite-linked tags at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. Generalised linear mixed effect models were used to explore relationships between the 3-dimensional movement behaviours of tracked sharks and surrounding prey fields at a spatial scale of similar to 1 km.
   Results We identified prey density as a significant driver of horizontal space use, with sharks occupying areas along the reef edge where densities were highest. These areas were characterised by complex bathymetry such as reef gutters and pinnacles. Temperature and salinity profiles revealed a well-mixed water column above the height of the bathymetry (top 40 m of the water column). Regions of stronger stratification were associated with reef gutters and pinnacles that concentrated prey near the seabed, and entrained productivity at local scales (similar to 1 km). We found no quantitative relationship between the depth use of sharks and vertical distributions of horizontally averaged prey density. Whale sharks repeatedly dove to depths where spatially averaged prey concentration was highest but did not extend the time spent at these depth layers.
   Conclusions Our work reveals previously unrecognized complexity in interactions between whale sharks and their zooplankton prey.

AB  - In October 2023, a disease outbreak in pufferfish (Takifugu obscurus) farms in Zhongshan City, Guangdong, China, caused high mortality. Diseased fish (mean length: 15 +/- 1 cm) exhibited swimming disorders, fin rot, hemorrhage, and an enlarged spleen. Histopathological observations generally revealed inflammation, necrosis, and congestion in the spleen, kidneys, and brain tissues. The most severe pathological changes included interstitial edema and tubular atrophy in the kidneys, hemosiderin deposition in the spleen, massive red blood cell infiltration, and a decrease in lymphocytes. A single strain of bacteria (Tol-1) was isolated from the diseased pufferfish and identified as a Gram-positive streptococcus strain, exhibiting alpha-hemolysis on sheep blood agar plates. Through biochemical characterization, 16S rDNA sequencing, morphological analysis, and specific primer-based identification, the Tol-1 strain was identified as Lactococcus garvieae, serotype I. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that Tol-1 was sensitive to Chloramphenicol, Ampicillin, Cephalexin, and Doxycycline, but resistant to Kanamycin, Gentamicin and Ciprofloxacin. In addition, 15 common virulence factors were detected in the Tol-1 strain, including adhPav, adhPsaA, adhC I-II, adh, and hly 1-3. Pufferfish (mean length: 17 +/- 1 cm) subjected to artificial infection via intraperitoneal injection (IP) with the Tol-1 strain exhibited clinical symptoms and histopathological damage similar to those observed in naturally infected fish. An infection dose of 1 x 105 CFU/fish resulted in 80% mortality. The study fulfilled Koch's postulates, indicating that the disease outbreak in pufferfish was caused by L. garvieae, which exhibited a high mortality rate in pufferfish despite the subtle clinical symptoms. These results serve as a warning for pufferfish farming areas and provide a scientific basis for future prevention and control efforts.

AB  - Parasitoids induce physiological changes in their herbivorous hosts that affect how plants respond to herbivory. The signature of parasitoids on induced plant responses to feeding by parasitized herbivores indirectly impacts insect communities interacting with the plant. The effect may extend to parasitoids and cause indirect interaction between parasitoids that develop inside different herbivore hosts sharing the food plant. However, this type of interactions among parasitoid larvae has received very little attention. In this study, we investigated sequential and simultaneous plant-mediated interactions among two host-parasitoid systems feeding on Brassica oleracea plants: Mamestra brassicae parasitized by Microplitis mediator and Pieris rapae parasitized by Cotesia rubecula. We measured the mortality, development time, and weight of unparasitized herbivores and performance of parasitoids that had developed inside the two herbivore species when sharing the food plant either simultaneously or sequentially. Plant induction by parasitized or unparasitized hosts had no significant effect on the performance of the two herbivore host species. In contrast, the two parasitoid species had asymmetrical indirect plant-mediated effects on each other's performance. Cotesia rubecula weight was 15% higher on plants induced by M. mediator-parasitized hosts, compared to control plants. In addition, M. mediator development time was reduced by 30% on plants induced by conspecific but not heterospecific parasitoids, compared to plants induced by its unparasitized host. Contrary to sequential feeding, parasitoids had no effect on each other's performance when feeding simultaneously. These results reveal that indirect plant-mediated interactions among parasitoid larvae could involve any parasitoid species whose hosts share a food plant.

AB  - In the present study, nine strains of Aeromonas spp. were isolated from diseased Nile tilapia in Thailand and identified based on 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequences and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis. Phenotypic characterization was performed for all the isolates. For the antimicrobial susceptibility test, all isolates were resistant to amoxicillin, whereas most of the isolates were susceptible to enrofloxacin. Pathogenicity analysis revealed that most A. hydrophila strains were highly virulent to fish, corresponding with the hemolytic activity test demonstrating that clear hemolysis occurred on sheep blood agar. To develop a vaccine for fish against A. veronii and A. hydrophila infection, a bivalent vaccine based on the formalin-killed cells (FKC) of A. veronii A5 and A. hydrophila A9, which showed higher virulence to fish, was prepared. This FKC vaccine was administered to Nile tilapia by intraperitoneal injection. The booster vaccination was conducted at 4 weeks after the first vaccination. The specific antibody titer was evaluated during rearing since the first vaccination, and then at 8 weeks after the first vaccination, the fish were challenged with A. veronii A5 and A. hydrophila A9 via intraperitoneal injection. There is not significance different in relative percentage survival of the vaccinated fish against A. veronii (63.49 +/- 19.51%) and A. hydrophila (93.33 +/- 6.67%). These results suggest that this candidate bivalent vaccine is effective against both A. veronii and A. hydrophila infection in Nile tilapia and could be an "motile Aeromonas septicemia (MAS)" control measure. However, to obtain the promising vaccine efficacy, the optimization of vaccine formulation might be achieved and be validated vaccine efficacy in field trial.

AB  - Intra-specific variation in conifers has been extensively studied with respect to defense against herbivores and pathogens. While studies have shown the ability of individual or specific mixtures of compounds to influence insects and microbes, research testing biologically relevant mixtures of defense compounds reflecting intraspecific variation amongst tree populations to enemy complexes is needed. We characterized the variations in lodgepole pine monoterpenes from a progeny trial in western Canada and grouped trees in four clusters using their monoterpene profiles. We then selected 11 representative families across four clusters and amended their entire monoterpene profiles (with the exception of beta-phellandrene) in media to determine how representative families affect the performance of the mountain pine beetle or its fungal symbiont. We placed adult beetles or inoculated fungus on the amended media and measured beetle performance and fungal growth as a proxy to host suitability. We found that different clusters or families differentially influenced beetle or fungal responses. However, monoterpene profiles of trees suitable to the beetle or the fungus were dissimilar. These outcomes reflect a co-evolutionary arms-race between the host and the bark beetle-fungus complex, which has resulted in the production of complementary defense metabolites among different pine populations to enhance tree survival.

AB  - During maximal cold challenge (cold-induced VO2,max) in hypoxia, highland deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) show higher rates of circulatory fatty acid delivery compared with lowland deer mice. Fatty acid delivery also increases with acclimation to cold hypoxia (CH) and probably plays a major role in supporting the high rates of thermogenesis observed in highland deer mice. However, it is unknown which tissues take up these fatty acids and their relative contribution to thermogenesis. The goal of this study was to determine the uptake of circulating fatty acids into 24 different tissues during hypoxic cold-induced VO2,max, by using [1-14C]2- bromopalmitic acid. To uncover evolved and environment-induced changes in fatty acid uptake, we compared lab-born and -raised highland and lowland deer mice, acclimated to either thermoneutral (30 degrees C, 21 kPa O2) or CH (5 degrees C, 12 kPa O2) conditions. During hypoxic cold-induced VO2,max, CH-acclimated highlanders decreased muscle fatty acid uptake and increased uptake into brown adipose tissue (BAT) relative to thermoneutral highlanders, a response that was absent in lowlanders. CH acclimation was also associated with increased activities of enzymes citrate synthase and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase in the BAT of highlanders, and higher levels of fatty acid translocase CD36 (FAT/CD36) in both populations. This is the first study to show that cold-induced fatty acid uptake is distributed across a wide range of tissues. Highland deer mice show plasticity in this fatty acid distribution in response to chronic cold hypoxia, and combined with higher rates of tissue delivery, this contributes to their survival in the cold high alpine environment.

AB  - Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) causes intrusive symptoms and avoidance behaviours due to dysregulation in various brain regions, including the hippocampus. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) shows promise for refractory PTSD cases. In rodents, DBS improves fear extinction and reduces anxiety-like behaviours, but its effects on active-avoidance extinction remain unexplored. Medial forebrain bundle intracranial self-stimulation (MFB-ICSS) enhances two-way active avoidance (TWAA) conditioning by activating brain regions involved in reinforcement, learning, and memory, including the hippocampus. Methods: This study investigates whether reinforcing DBS in the MFB enhances the extinction of conditioned active avoidance responses and examines its effects on hippocampal mossy fibber sprouting using Timm staining. We administered MFB-ICSS treatment following two 50-trial extinction sessions and assessed short-term (24 hours) and long-term (28 days) extinction in a TWAA task in rats. Results: MFB-ICSS enhances short-term extinction and accelerates long-term reacquisition of extinction in a spontaneous recovery test. MFB-ICSS also promotes mossy fibber sprouting in the CA2 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, with CA3 staining positively correlated with the level of extinction. Conclusions: These findings suggest that MFB stimulation may enhance extinction and promote neural plasticity mechanisms, including mossy fibber sprouting. However, it does not fully prevent spontaneous recovery, highlighting the need for further optimization of treatment parameters. These results are relevant for PTSD as they suggest a potential enhancement in therapy for extinguishing avoidance responses in patients.

AB  - Several ecological processes - from population dynamics to species co-existence - are driven by density dependence (DD) in population growth rate. Thus, to predict and manage ecological outcomes, we need a deep understanding of which factors and demographic traits drive variation in DD. In the insect pest Tribolium castaneum, we found large variation in DD across habitats but not across source populations. We modeled DD in population growth as the product of DD in fecundity and survival, experimentally estimating each parameter. Across habitats, survival parameters varied more than fecundity, including in simulations with varying parameter values. Thus, DD in survival drives variation in density-dependent population growth. Hence, under strong density-dependent selection, we expect evolutionary change in density-dependent survival, provided sufficient genetic variance. Our general framework combining detailed experiments and simulations with a simple model can be used for other species to better understand the causes and consequences of density dependent population growth.

AB  - Geopolitical boundaries can present challenges to wildlife conservation because of varying environmental regulations, and increasingly, the existence of border barriers. As of 2024, approximately 1,023 km of border walls (i.e., steel bollard walls 5.5-9.1 m tall with interstitial spaces <= 10 cm) and 169 km of vehicle barriers (i.e., variable steel structures designed to stop vehicles but not pedestrians) exist along the USA-Mexico border. Some small wildlife passages (21.5 x 27.8 cm) were installed in border walls but few other accommodations for wildlife connectivity exist. As such, ecological consequences of border barriers may be severe and documenting the ability of wildlife to traverse these barriers will be essential to conservation efforts. We placed 36 wildlife cameras across 163.5 km of the USA-Mexico border in Arizona, USA and Sonora, MX to evaluate crossing rates through border barriers for 20 terrestrial species. We observed 9,240 wildlife events, including 1,920 successful crossing events. All focal species crossed through vehicle barriers, whereas white-tailed deer, mule deer, American black bear, American badger, wild turkey, and mountain lion appeared unable to cross through interstitial spaces in border walls. Small wildlife passages improved crossing rates for several species, including American badger, collared peccary, coyote, and mountain lion. Yet, small wildlife passages were scarce with only 13 along >130 km of continuous border wall and failed to allow American black bear, deer, and wild turkey to cross. Additional research on the impacts of border barriers and potential mitigation strategies will be critical for effective transboundary conservation.

AB  - The geographical range of common hippopotamus' (Hippopotamus amphibius) has retracted over the last century as a result of anthropogenic pressures. At present, extant common hippopotamus (hereafter, hippo) populations are fragmented and largely constrained to Protected Areas. There is an urgent need for conservation management, but data and information on the spatial ecology of hippos to base conservation strategies on are lacking. Without a centralised and collaborative database that documents their distribution and abundance, comprehensive population assessments remain a challenge. This study establishes a detailed spatial database of hippo population estimates and distribution across southern Africa, by collating recent survey data from a range of sources, facilitating population monitoring and informed conservation decision making. Drawing from a review of the primary literature, grey literature, aerial surveys, websites, and expert input, we provide a comprehensive geographic range map for hippos and evaluate hippo distribution within Protected Areas. Our review reveals several discrepancies between our data and previous hippo distribution and abundance estimates. We also highlight inconsistent methods used to survey hippo populations across southern Africa. By identifying twelve regions with large populations of hippos (>1000 individuals), our findings underscore the importance of extensive and well-connected Transfrontier Conservation Areas to support large, dense hippo populations. We encourage the IUCN SSC Hippo Specialist Group to promote standardised and coordinated surveys and progress a spatial database of hippo distribution and abundance across the rest of Africa.

AB  - Parasites pose a significant threat to wildlife, yet their impact remains largely understudied, with limited research conducted on the parasites of wild animals. This study provides the first quantitative analysis of gastrointestinal parasites in the endangered Himalayan musk deer (Moschus leucogaster), while also documenting a wider variety of parasites within the Manaslu Conservation Area (MCA), Nepal. Non-invasive sampling of 52 fresh fecal pellets from Kaltal (n = 28) and Mugumba (n = 24) revealed a high prevalence (94.2 %) of gastrointestinal parasites including two nematodes (Pneumocaulus sp. and Strongyle) and one parasitic protist (Eimeria sp.). Pneumocaulus sp. was the most abundant parasite, present in 100 % of Kaltal and 87.5 % of Mugumba samples. Strongyle was absent in Kaltal but had a lower prevalence (12.5 %) in Mugumba. Co-infection was identified in 25 % of samples, which could potentially threaten the health of musk deer. Statistical analysis with Firth's logistic regression indicated that higher elevations were associated with a lower chance of strongyle being present (p = 0.0057). Slope, aspect, and distance from water or roads did not significantly affect the distribution of the parasites. Parasite communities showed moderate similarity between the sites (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity = 0.22; Jaccard similarity = 0.67), with no significant difference in prevalence between Mugumba and Kaltal. Pneumocaulus sp. was found widely over the elevation gradient, most typically at 3600-3700 m, while strongyle was confined to lower elevations below 3500 m. This baseline study demonstrates the substantial gastrointestinal parasite burden in Himalayan musk deer and underscores the need for conservation and health management efforts for this endangered species in the MCA. Holistic conservation methods, including habitat management, disease detection, and further studies, including a large-scale sampling, seasonal data collection, and molecular techniques, can significantly enhance our understanding of the intricate relationship among parasites, hosts, and their environment in the endangered species conservation.

AB  - Cyanobacteria negatively affect zooplankton through several mechanisms including mechanical interference, toxicity, and poor food quality due to a shortage of essential lipids. To understand the nature of each of these mechanisms, they should be examined independently. The goal of our study was to assess the influence of cyanobacteria food quality on the competitive outcomes between the small-bodied Daphnia longispina and the large-bodied Daphnia magna. We conducted life-table experiments to assess R* (population threshold food concentration), competition experiments to determine the outcome of competition, and computer simulation experiments at high levels of food supply, which are difficult to realize in laboratory conditions. We used two types of food: the high-quality green algae Chlamydomonas klinobasis (GREEN) and the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus (CYANO), which contains low levels of essential lipids, but is non-toxic and unicellular. We found that the small-bodied D. longispina was a superior competitor in GREEN, while the large-bodied D. magna was more abundant in CYANO. We established that the species ratio in GREEN was dependent on competitive interaction, while abundances of daphnids in CYANO were controlled by poor food quality. Since cyanobacteria act as a powerful force for structuring cladoceran communities, the role of competition for food between these two Daphnia species greatly declined under their effects.

AB  - . Myrmecophytes of the genus Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) have symbiotic relationships with specific ant species in which ants protect the host plant from herbivores. The intensity of such anti-herbivore defenses elicited by symbiotic ants has been shown to decline with the increase in tree size during tree growth and drastically decrease with various types of disturbances, such as tree falls and ant predation during tree growth. These decreases in anti-herbivore defense during tree growth may cause differences in host plant utilization among leaf-chewing lepidopteran species that vary in the degree of development of myrmecophilous traits. In this study, to test this hypothesis, we determined the interspecific differences in host plant use response to tree size variation and the absence or presence of symbiotic ants among three dominant leaf-chewing lepidopteran species, a myrmecophilous species (Arhopala amphimuta), and two non-myrmecophilous species (Shafferiella macarangae and Aetholix flavibasalis) feeding on a Macaranga myrmecophyte species, M. bancana, in a primary forest in Borneo. The results showed that there were significant differences in the responses to the absence or presence of symbiotic ants and tree size among the three lepidopteran species. The literature has suggested that the larvae of myrmecophilous species prefer trees with symbiotic ants. Although larvae of the nonmyrmecophilous S. macarangae were found on trees with and without symbiotic ants, the moth species may prefer trees with weak anti-herbivore defense intensity. We identified another non-myrmecophilous species, A. flavibasalis, that used M. bancana trees as host plants only when symbiotic ants were no longer present on the trees. These results support our hypothesis and suggest that changes in anti-herbivore defense intensity associated with the growth of Macaranga myrmecophytes have a strong influence on host plant usage by lepidopteran leaf chewers.

AB  - Genome-wide homozygosity, caused for example by inbreeding, is expected to have deleterious effects on survival and/or reproduction. Evolutionary theory predicts that any fitness costs are likely to be detected in late life because natural selection will filter out negative impacts on younger individuals with greater reproductive value. Here we infer associations between multi-locus homozygosity (MLH), sex, disease and age-dependent mortality risks using Bayesian analysis of the life histories of wild European badgers Meles meles in a population naturally infected with Mycobacterium bovis (the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis [bTB]). We find important effects of MLH on all parameters of the Gompertz-Makeham mortality hazard function, but particularly in later life. Our findings confirm the predicted association between genomic homozygosity and actuarial senescence. Increased homozygosity is particularly associated with an earlier onset, and greater rates of actuarial senescence, regardless of sex. The association between homozygosity and actuarial senescence is further amplified among badgers putatively infected with bTB. These results recommend further investigation into the ecological and behavioural processes that result in genome-wide homozygosity, and focused work on whether homozygosity is harmful or beneficial during early life-stages.

AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural soils can accelerate climate change, therefore, different soil fertilization techniques should be assessed before application to reduce GHG emissions. Pig slurry applications can greatly influence soil carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ammonia (NH3) emissions of arable fields; thus, it is important to find site-specific techniques to lessen any negative environmental impacts. In this study, we examined the short-term effect of pig slurry application techniques of spreading and injection on soil greenhouse gas and NH3 emissions under different irrigation amounts. We used the dynamic chamber method with in-situ gas analyzers. Our study showed that there were elevated emissions during the first week after slurry application; however, the difference between GHG emissions of spreading and injection treatments were not significant. Elevated GHG emissions (213-338% and 250-594% in the case of CO2 and N2O emissions, respectively) were observed under dry circumstances compared to irrigated treatments, as well as significantly higher NH3 emissions occurred for surface spreading under non-irrigated (dry) circumstances compared to other treatments. There were no statistically significant differences between the soil chemistry of different application techniques. However, pig slurry increased the available nitrogen forms (ammonium- and nitrate-nitrogen), which caused N2O and NH3 peaks regardless of treatment type. Leachate chemistry was more affected by irrigation strategies than application techniques. Our study highlights the importance of soil conditions at the time of application, rather than the application technique for fertilization using pig slurry.

AB  - Ongoing global climate change is increasing the risk of drought stress in some areas, which may compromise forest health. Such drought events also increase outbreaks of insect herbivores, resulting in plant defoliation. Interactions between drought and defoliation are poorly understood. In a greenhouse experiment, we selected a native species, Quercus acutissima Carr. and an alien species, Quercus rubra L. to explore their physiological responses to drought and defoliation treatments. After the treatments, we determined the seedlings' physiological responses on Days 10 and 60. Our results showed that the defoliation treatment accelerated the carbon reserve consumption of plants under drought stress and inhibited the growth of both seedling types. Under the drought condition, Q. rubra maintained normal stem-specific hydraulic conductivity and normal growth parameters during the early stage of stress, whereas Q. acutissima used less water and grew more slowly during the experiment. Sixty days after defoliation treatment, the stem starch concentration of Q. acutissima was higher than that of the control group, but the stem biomass was lower. This indicates that Q. acutissima adopted a 'slow strategy' after stress, and more resources were used for storage rather than growth, which was conducive to the ability of these seedlings to resist recurrent biotic attack. Thus, Q. acutissima may be more tolerant to drought and defoliation than Q. rubra. The resource acquisition strategies of Quercus in this study suggest that the native Quercus species may be more successful at a long-term resource-poor site than the alien Quercus species.

AB  - Rapid urbanization, anthropogenic pollution and frequent flooding events are affecting the soil and water quality along the streams and bayous of Houston. Soil acts as sink and reservoir of heavy metals and nutrients affecting human and animal health. The objectives of the study are 1) to analyze the effects of the metal and nutrient concentration of bayou flood plain surface soil samples on the gut cell cytotoxicity and 2) to evaluate the spatial and temporal difference in soil contamination on cell viability of colon cancer (HT-29) and normal colon epithelial (CCD 841 CoN) cell lines. To evaluate soil contamination between pre- and post-hurricane (Summer and Fall) conditions in six Bayous (Brays, Buffalo, Halls, Hunting, Greens and White Oak Bayous) of Harris County, Texas, in vitro bioassay analysis was applied to soil extracts. The MTT assay determined that, with increase in concentration of Bayou soil from 12.5% to 100%, the viability of CCD 841 CoN and HT-29 cells decreased significantly, across all sampling locations during both summer and fall seasons. Among all the bayous, the viability of CCD 841 CoN cells in summer and fall followed the pattern of White Oak > Greens > Halls > Brays Bayou, where the viability of cells exposed to White Oak soils was 3-4 times higher than cells exposed to Brays Bayou soil at 100% soil concentration. The viability of HT-29 cells in both seasons followed the pattern of Greens > White Oak > Halls > Brays Bayou, where the viability of cells exposed to Greens Bayou soil was more than 3-4 times higher than the cells exposed to Brays Bayou soil at 100% concentration. The higher concentration of metals and nutrients such as P, Zn, Cd, and Cu might have contributed to the significant cell lethality in Brays Bayou samples compared to other locations.

AB  - To facilitate the adoption of a food safety standard by producers, it is essential to understand their perception of it. However, few empirical studies have examined how livestock farmers perceive food safety standards in Vietnam. This research examines sheep farmers' attitudes towards Vietnamese Good Agricultural Practices (VietGAP), a type of a food safety standard in Vietnam. A sample size of 109 farmers was selected for interviews and a structured questionnaire was generated to collect data. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were employed. The study results show that sheep farmers were well aware of most VietGAP requirements. They perceived that adopting VietGAP requires practical changes in sheep farming systems, including: selecting breeding stock from clear sources to ensure sheep product traceability, collecting and treating wastes daily to protect the environment, and frequent sterilization of sheep cages. The farmers were changing several practices to comply with VietGAP. Key changed practices identified included: bought breeding stock from clear and reliable sources, frequent collecting and treating of sheep wastes, and used veterinary medicine according to instructions of veterinary medicine producers. Statistically significant relationships existing between the sheep farmers' perceptions and their education level (Pearson = 0.229, p = 0.017), farm size (Pearson = -0.193; p = 0.049), gender (Eta = 0.173, p = 0.060), practice of using labours (Eta = 0.202, p = 0.028), training participation (Eta = 0.211, p = 0.022), credit participation (Eta = 0.177, p = 0.050), community-based organisations (Eta = 0.153, p = 0.087), and veterinary/extension contacts (Eta = 0.217, p = 0.019) were found. This means that a male sheep farmer who had a higher education level, possessed a smaller farm, practiced hired labours, participated in training/credit programs, was a member of community-based organisation, and had contacts with veterinary/extension workers likely perceived VietGAP better than their counterparts. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that the promotion of VietGAP for livestock farmers should be developed and carried out as joint attempts along the value chain actors. New food marketing practices and legal framework and policy for using safe food certifications are required to address to promote farmers' adoption of VietGAP and facilitate transition towards a sustainable agri-food system in Vietnam. This study provides significant insights into safety food standard adoption by livestock farmers and highlights aspects that require to be considered when developing policies to improve the adoption of safety food standards in developing countries.

AB  - Plants are continuously interacting with other organisms to optimize their performance in a changing environment. Mycorrhization is known to affect the plant growth and nutrient status, but it also can lead to adjusted plant defense and alter interactions with other trophic levels. Here, we studied the effect of Laccaria bicolor-mycorrhization on the poplar (Populus x canescens) metabolome and volatilome on trees with and without a poplar leaf beetle (Chrysomela populi) infestation. We analyzed the leaf and root metabolomes employing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the leaf volatilome employing headspace sorptive extraction combined with gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mycorrhization caused distinct metabolic adjustments in roots, young/infested leaves and old/not directly infested leaves. Mycorrhization adjusted the lipid composition, the abundance of peptides and, especially upon herbivory, the level of various phenolic compounds. The greatest change in leaf volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions occurred four to eight days following the beetle infestation. Together, these results prove that mycorrhization affects the whole plant metabolome and may influence poplar aboveground interactions. The herbivores and the mycorrhizal fungi interact with each other indirectly through a common host plant, a result that emphasizes the importance of community approach in chemical ecology.

AB  - The use of wildlife imagery in society is highly varied and could contribute to reinforcing national identity. Standard depictions of wildlife include photographs, video, artwork and symbols or icons, including on currency. We investigated the representation of native fauna on 4541 banknotes from 207 countries between 1980 and 2017, to identify geographic hotspots and taxonomic patterns and determine whether threatened and endemic species were more readily represented. Native fauna was depicted on 15.2% of banknotes reviewed (352 unique species) with a strong bias towards terrestrial species (89%) and a dominance of bird and mammal species (83% combined). African banknotes had the highest mammal representation while birds were favoured in South America. Globally, threatened species were commonly depicted on banknotes with 30% of all imagery representing these species. The fauna species depicted on banknotes generally perpetuate existing perceptions about these species (i.e., charismatic species). We recommend several avenues for further investigation to explore relationships between perceived value and wildlife representation. These include longitudinal studies of how representation changes over time, the inclusion of flora and/or coin imagery, identifying species-specific traits for selected wildlife and examining the decision-making processes governing wildlife imagery on banknotes.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary inclusion of green tea powder on growth performance, feed utilization and body composition of rainbow trout. A total of 546 fish with an average body weight of 40.4 +/- 0.01 g were divided in the seven experimental treatments. The fish were fed with diets containing 0%(control), 0.25%(diet1), 0.5%(diet2), 1%(diet3), 2%(diet4), and 3%(diet5) of dried green tea (GT) powder containin 5.3 +/- 0.04% epigallocatechin gallate-3-gallate (EGCG), 1%(diet6) green tea dust (GTD) containing 6.5 +/- 0.07% EGCG for 60 days. Fish fed with diet 2 had higher weight gain, specific growth rate, apparent net protein retention, and protein efficiency ratio than other groups, and had a lower feed conversion ratio than other groups, but not significantly changed than control group (P>0.05). Crude lipid content of liver and fillet in fish fed experimental diets were significantly lower than of fish fed the control diet (P<0.05). These results showed that dietary supplementation of GT powder in trout feed promoted the growth performance and feed utilization, and also administration of 1% level of GTD and different doses of GT powder in the experimental diets showed lipid-lowering effects for rainbow trout.

AB  - Rhinogobius candidianus is a freshwater goby distributed in north, northwest, west, and south Taiwan, but this species has been introduced to east Taiwan and became dominant. To investigate its native population genetic diversity and structure and evaluate the sources and diversity of translocated populations, the mitochondrial DNA control region and cytochrome b gene (1981 bp) from 220 specimens were analyzed. These results indicated that (1) the east populations originated from two sources in west Taiwan; (2) translocated populations exist in east Taiwan and south Taiwan; (3) many populations have likely been moved secondarily by human intervention; (4) the effective size of the populations had declined greatly; (5) within the native populations, the ancestral populations colonized Taiwan during the land bridge phase in the Pleistocene through north Taiwan; (6) the landform changes in Taiwan shaped the population structure; and (7) the landforms of the coastline during glaciation also shaped the native range. The low-level genetic diversity, high population differentiation, and population decline greatly suggest the need for resource management and conservation interventions. Four clades (alpha-delta) should be managed as four distinct evolutionarily significant units, while the translocated populations should be managed as separate management units. Moreover, the translocated populations in east Taiwan should be evaluated and monitored carefully.

AB  - Pineapple (Ananas comosus L.) is an edible fruit and the most economically important tropical plant of the family Bromeliaceae. Genetic diversity analysis can better support in pineapple advanced breeding that ultimately leads to improved quality of pineapple. The following study aimed to analyze the genetic diversity of five pineapple accessions originating from the Nusantara Pineapple Garden, Kudus, Indonesia, i.e., Blitar, Indralaya, Jambi, Riau Siak, and Madu Subang. The study collected plant samples from each accession, consisting of pineapple fruit crowns. The DNA isolated from each sample underwent amplification by the PCR using eight RAPD primers, viz., OPA-02, OPA-07, OPA-14, OPA15, OPB-10, OPB-15, OPC-05, and OPD-01. The results showed the lowest genetic diversity among the five pineapple accessions, with variations in the number of amplified bands and DNA fragment size. Primer OPA 15 (900 bp) was the choice used to evaluate genetic variability in Ananas comosus between the smooth cayenne and queen types. Two clusters' identification resulted from the UPGMA analysis. Cluster 1, comprising four pineapple accessions, Blitar, Indralaya, Riau Siak, and Jambi, indicated the highest genetic similarity. However, the pineapple accession Madu Subang, placed in cluster 2, showed the lowest genetic similarity with other pineapple accessions.

AB  - Blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say, transmit Lyme disease spirochetes and other human pathogens in the eastern United States. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are key reproductive hosts for I. scapularis adults, and therefore control methods targeting deer have the potential for landscape-wide tick suppression. A topical acaricide product, containing 10% permethrin, is self-applied by deer to kill parasitizing ticks when they visit 4-Poster Tick Control Deer Feeders (hereafter, 4-Posters) Previous 4-Poster intervention studies, including in residential settings, demonstrated suppression of I. scapularis populations but did not include human-based outcomes. To prepare for a proposed 4-Poster intervention trial in residential areas of Connecticut and New York that would include human-tick encounters and tick-borne diseases as outcomes, we sought to identify areas (study clusters) in the 80-100 ha size range and specific locations within these areas where 4-Poster devices could be deployed at adequate density (1 device per 20-25 ha) and in accordance with regulatory requirements. Geographic Information System-based data were used to identify prospective study clusters, based on minimum thresholds for Lyme disease incidence, population density, and forest cover. Ground truthing of potential 4-Poster placement locations was done to confirm the suitability of selected clusters. Based on these efforts, we failed to identify more than a few residential areas fulfilling all criteria for a treatment cluster. We, therefore, reconsidered pursuing the intervention trial, which required inclusion of >30 treatment clusters to achieve adequate statistical power. The 4-Poster methodology may be more readily evaluated in natural or public areas than in residential settings in NY or CT.

AB  - Mongolian sheep are characteristically cold-tolerant and thus can survive well and maintain genetic stability in the extremely cold environment of the Mongolian Plateau. However, the adaptive mechanism of Mongolian sheep during the cold season in the plateau environment remains unknown. Browning of white adipose tissues (WAT) can trigger nonshivering thermogenesis as a potential strategy to promote an animal's tolerance to cold environments. Thus, a comparative analysis of the genes and proteins of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-dependent and UCP1-independent browning pathways, mitochondrial biogenesis, lipogenic and lipolytic processes of WAT from grazing Mongolian sheep in the cold and warm seasons was conducted. We found seasonal browning of both retroperitoneal WAT and perirenal WAT, and the signalling of the process was mainly transduced by the UCP1-dependent pathway, primarily reflected in the upregulated gene levels of UCP1 and peroxisome prolif-erative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha). In addition, the mean adipocyte diameter and mRNA expression of lipogenic genes in both interscapular WAT and subcutaneous WAT were significantly elevated during the cold season. The findings of this study demonstrate that grazing Mongolian sheep could depend on seasonal browning of both retroperitoneal WAT and perirenal WAT together with the expansion of both interscapular WAT and subcutaneous WAT to acclimate to cold environments of the Mongolian Plateau.

AB  - The non-pathogenic intestinal microbes that conquer our intestines are not an accidental jumble of organisms, but rather a disparate community of microbes that coexist, and sustain a mutualistic and symbiotic relationship with the host. The gut microbiome has been shown to be influenced by animal physiology and vice versa. However, information is still scanty. The present study aimed to analyse the variation between faecal bacteria of three different stages (proestrus, estrus and postestrus) of the estrous cycle of Murrah buffalos. A phylogenetic study of buffalo faeces derived from three different stages of estrous cycle was conducted in order to compare the bacterial diversity among these three stages. We performed an exploratory microbiome analysis of buffalo faeces using 16S rRNA sequencing during these stages of the buffalo estrous cycle. A total of three bacterial phyla with six different bacterial orders and twenty-three different genera were identified among all the three comparative phases of the estrous cycle. Among them, the Clostridiales were found to be the most abundant, and Bacteroidales were present exclusive during the estrus phase. As faeces is a source of gut microbes and a non-invasive representative of the metabolic steroids and perceptible pheromones, the profiling of gut microbes during estrous cycle would provide clues towards the major microbes contributing to the perceptible pheromones during estrus stage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever report describing the faecal bacterial diversity during estrous cycle of any ruminant species. Although future studies are required to understand the role of Clostridiales and Bacteroidales in faecal pheromone metabolism.

AB  - Chitosan-coated liposome was used to encapsulate pomegranate-peel phenolic extract (PPE). The liposome loaded with PPE demonstrated a notable encapsulation efficiency of 82.64 % and exhibited sizes ranging from 223.99 to 320.15 nm. The liposomal PPE displayed adequate antimicrobial activity depending on the concentration. Gram-positive strains appeared to be more sensitive. The probiotic strains exhibited a varied degree of extinction, with L. plantarum being the most resistant strain. Further evaluation was conducted after incorporating these liposomes into yoghurt, focusing on the changes observed during refrigeration storage. Optimization of the in vitro release behavior of milk beverages through response surface methodology (RSM), the physicochemical, microbiological, and sensory attributes of yoghurt containing PPE-loaded liposome at various concentrations (YF25, YF50, and YF75, representing 25, 50, and 75 mg phenolics per 100 g yoghurt) during the cold storage were evaluated. Results indicated YF25 exhibited the most favorable properties, resembling the control sample. All lactic bacteria strains loaded in yoghurt were enhanced for ten days of storage. The liposome loaded with PPE demonstrated stability under acidic conditions and resisted the stomach's harsh environment. The optimal conditions for the encapsulation process were achieved at encapsulation value of 0.289 or nonencapsulated value of 0.711 for YF75 and digest 1 (intestinal stage). Under these conditions, the responses for total phenolic content (TPC), together with total flavonoid content (TFC), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured at 9.677, 1.510, and 1208.421 mu g of compound/g of extract, respectively. In contrast, the antioxidants increased approximately tenfold, as determined by the DPPH assay.

AB  - Aim: The remarkable ecomorphological diversity of the bat superfamily Noctilionoidea is the result of a diet-mediated adaptive radiation. Stemming from a putatively insectivorous ancestor, noctilionoid bats diversified to adapt to the widest range of dietary ecologies among mammals. The high concentration of noctilionoid diversity in the Neotropics raises the question as to whether competitive ecological interactions influenced their diversification. However, patterns of morphological diversification along gradients of coexistence in Noctilionoidea are understudied. Here, we assessed the effect of dietary adaptations on patterns of morphological divergence associated with coexistence in noctilionoid bats.Location: The Americas and the Caribbean.Taxon: Bat superfamily Noctilionoidea.Methods: Using a set of five dental morphological traits and a sample of 108 species, we quantified morphological distances between noctilionoid species pairs to reveal patterns of morphological divergence along gradients of range overlap and dietary similarity. We incorporate phylogenetic information to control for the effects of species' relatedness on morphological distances.Results: Overall, we found a significant association between morphological divergence, coexistence and diet. Decomposing the correlation between morphological divergence and sympatry across dietary groups, our results revealed distinctive pat-terns consistent with both character convergence and divergence. Specifically, we found evidence of character convergence in herbivorous species and character diver-gence in omnivorous species.Main Conclusions: Our results indicate that the morphological diversification of noc-tilionoid bats followed parallel evolutionary trajectories of directional (both divergent and stabilising) and nonselective evolution linked to dietary adaptations.

AB  - Simple Summary The objective was to evaluate the effect of prepartum dietary energy level on performance of Nili Ravi buffaloes. Buffaloes were fed low, medium or high energy diet during 63 days prepartum and same lactation diet during 14 weeks postpartum. Buffaloes fed the high energy diet had better performance compared with buffaloes fed the medium or low energy diet. While, prepartum feeding of low energy diet adversely affected buffalo performance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of prepartum dietary energy level on postpartum production and reproduction in Nili Ravi buffaloes (n = 21). The buffaloes were offered low energy (LE: 1.31 Mcal/kg DM NEL (net energy for lactation)), medium energy (ME: 1.42 Mcal/kg DM NEL) or high energy (HE: 1.54 Mcal/kg DM NEL) diet for 63 days prepartum, and received the same lactation diet (LD: 1.22 Mcal/kg DM NEL) during 14 weeks postpartum. The effects of dietary energy level and week were analyzed with Proc GLIMMIX model. Dry matter intake (DMI) was lower in buffaloes fed the LE diet compared with buffaloes fed the ME or HE diet. Calf birth weight (CBW) was higher in buffaloes fed the HE diet compared with buffaloes fed the ME or LE diet. Milk production was similar in buffaloes fed the HE, ME or LE diet within 14 weeks postpartum and throughout the lactation. Milk fat was higher in buffaloes fed the LE diet compared with buffaloes fed the ME or HE diet. Milk protein and lactose yields was high in buffaloes fed the HE diet compared with buffaloes fed the ME or LE diet. Body condition score was high in HE and was affected by diet x week interactions during pre and postpartum period. The concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) and triglycerides in serum was lowest in buffaloes fed the HE diet compared with the buffaloes fed the ME or LE diet. The buffaloes fed the HE diet had early uterine involution (UI), first estrus, short dry days, and calving interval (CI) compared with buffaloes fed the ME or LE diet. None of buffaloes fed the LE diet exhibited estrus during the first 14 weeks postpartum compared with buffaloes fed the ME or HE diet. In conclusion, prepartum feeding of high energy diet can be helpful in improving the postpartum productive and reproductive performance in Nili Ravi buffaloes.

AB  - Chinese seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) is an important economic and ecological tree species widely distributed in regions of extreme cold and drought in China. In this study, we examined the ecological and physiological response of Chinese seabuckthorn to saline-alkali stress. The results showed that the relative growth in height and base-diameter, as well as biomass, photosynthesis rate, water potential and nonstructural carbohydrate content, are significantly affected by saline-alkali soil under SS1 (0.2% of the mixed salt solution NaHCO3: Na2CO3: NaCl: Na2SO4 = 9:1:81:9) and SS2 (0.5% of the mixed salt solution NaHCO3: Na2CO3: NaCl: Na2SO4 = 9:1:81:9) conditions. The soluble salt content in the soil was approximately 8.87-9.22 g center dot kg(-1) and the pH was above 8.02. After applying 2.0 kg/m(3) saline-alkali soil conditioner (invented by Shanxi Agricultural University and granted a national invention patent in China, ZL2010-1-0,281,671.1), the growth and physiological status of Chinese seabuckthorn seedlings recovered compared to the control, and the content of soluble salt decreased to 7.29-7.86 g center dot kg(-1). These results indicated that saline-alkali stress inhibits the normal growth and development of Chinese seabuckthorn seedlings and the application of suitable soil conditioner improves the soil conditions and promotes growth development. The results of this study will provide a theoretical basis for vegetation restoration, comprehensive utilization of saline-alkaline land, and will contribute to ecological development in China.

AB  - Simple Summary
   With the grassland desertification intensified, pasture carrying capacity decreased, and grass seasonal changed, stall-feeding fattening has become an effective means to protect the natural environment. The stall-feeding fattening increased the cashmere goats' weight but reduced the meat quality and increased the saturated fatty acids content in muscle and fat tissue of cashmere goats. Supplementing flaxseed and flaxseed oil rich-in linolenic acid (ALA) to diet to improve meat quality is an effective nutritional regulation means. Previous research results of our team showed that compared to diet supplemented with flaxseed oil, added flaxseed increased linoleic acid biohydrogenation by reducing the Ruminobacter relative abundance and increasing the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 and Fretibacterium in rumen, protected ALA away from biohydrogenation, and more n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids entered the post-intestinal tract. Based on the previous research, this study explored whether the ALA flowing into the posterior intestine can reduce fat deposition and blood lipid by affecting intestinal microbiota. The results showed that adding flaxseed grain to diet decreased the growth performance, lipid deposition, and blood lipid content of goats by regulating the blood lipid-related enzyme activity, which positively associated with [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group, but negatively associated with unclassified_f_Peptostreptococcaceae, Intestinibacter, and Ruminococcus_2.
   The present study investigated the effect of flaxseed grain or flaxseed oil on ileal microbiota and lipid deposition of cashmere goats. Sixty kid goats (average body weight 18.6 +/- 0.1 kg) were allocated to three treatments, fed for 90 days, with control treatment: basal diet (CON, total-mixed ration), experimental treatment: basal diet with added flaxseed oil (LNO), experimental treatment: basal diet with added heated flaxseed grain (HLS). The final body weight, body weight gain, the weight of kidney fat, omental fat, tail fat, and fat tissue, the activity of fatty acid synthetase, acetyl-coa carboxylase, and malic dehydrogenase, and the relative abundance (RA) of unclassified_f_Peptostreptococcaceae and Intestinibacter were remarkably higher in the LNO treatment than in the HLS treatment, but the [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group RA showed the opposite result. The content of triglyceride, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly higher in the CON and LNO treatments than in the HLS treatment, while the hormone-sensitive lipase activity and the non-esterified fatty acid content showed the opposite result. In conclusion, the flaxseed grain is more efficient than flaxseed oil in ameliorating the blood lipid profiles and it is a potential product for decreasing the lipid deposition of cashmere goats.

AB  - Tropical tree species employ varying strategies in young leaves to minimise losses to herbivory. The young leaves of species with delayed greening are thought to be less visible to herbivores, but likely incur a cost to leaf-level carbon gain via lower photosynthetic rates during leaf development. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations may reduce the cost of delayed greening, and/or modify leaf expansion rates, altering the ecological interaction of species. In this study, we evaluated the effects of elevated CO2 concentrations on physiological responses of three Australian rainforest tree species, two with delayed greening in young leaves. Net photosynthesis rates were significantly lower in recently flushed leaves of species with delayed greening than in the species with normal greening. Yet, surprisingly, total nitrogen concentrations were higher in the former than in the latter. Intrinsic water-use efficiency increased at a steeper rate during leaf development under elevated CO2 in all three species, irrespective of greening strategy. Leaf growth rate, in terms of area expansion, did not increase under elevated CO2 in any of the species. Although elevated CO2 did not boost the performance of the delayed greening species more than that of the normal greening species, we found higher nitrogen concentrations in their young leaves. This supports the intriguing possibility that delayed greening may have evolved in these species to protect young leaves that are especially rich in nitrogen.

AB  - Characterizing microorganisms and enzymes involved in lignin biodegradation in thermal ecosystems can identify thermostable biocatalysts. We integrated stable isotope probing (SIP), genome-resolved metagenomics, and enzyme characterization to investigate the degradation of high-molecular weight, C-13-ring-labeled synthetic lignin by microbial communities from moderately thermophilic hot spring sediment (52 degrees C) and a woody "hog fuel" pile (53 and 62 degrees C zones). C-13-Lignin degradation was monitored using IR-GCMS of (CO2)-C-13, and isotopic enrichment of DNA was measured with UHLPC-MS/MS. Assembly of 42 metagenomic libraries (72 Gb) yielded 344 contig bins, from which 125 draft genomes were produced. Fourteen genomes were significantly enriched with C-13 from lignin, including genomes of Actinomycetes (Thermoleophilaceae, Solirubrobacteraceae, Rubrobacter sp.), Firmicutes (Kyrpidia sp., Alicyclobacillus sp.) and Gammaproteobacteria (Steroidobacteraceae). We employed multiple approaches to screen genomes for genes encoding putative ligninases and pathways for aromatic compound degradation. Our analysis identified several novel laccase-like multi-copper oxidase (LMCO) genes in C-13-enriched genomes. One of these LMCOs was heterologously expressed and shown to oxidize lignin model compounds and minimally transformed lignin. This study elucidated bacterial lignin depolymerization and mineralization in thermal ecosystems, establishing new possibilities for the efficient valorization of lignin at elevated temperature.

AB  - Gene tree discordance is a significant legacy of biological evolution. Multiple factors can result in incongruence among genes, such as introgression, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), gene duplication or loss. Resolving the background of gene tree discordance is a critical way to uncover the process of species diversification. Camellia, the largest genus in Theaceae, has controversial taxonomy and systematics due in part to a complex evolutionary history. We used 60 transcriptomes of 55 species, which represented 15 sections of Camellia to investigate its phylogeny and the possible causes of gene tree discordance. We conducted gene tree discordance analysis based on 1,617 orthologous low-copy nuclear genes, primarily using coalescent species trees and polytomy tests to distinguish hard and soft conflict. A selective pressure analysis was also performed to assess the impact of se-lection on phylogenetic topology reconstruction. Our results detected different levels of gene tree discordance in the backbone of Camellia, and recovered rapid diversification as one of the possible causes of gene tree discor-dance. Furthermore, we confirmed that none of the currently proposed sections of Camellia was monophyletic. Comparisons among datasets partitioned under different selective pressure regimes showed that integrating all orthologous genes provided the best phylogenetic resolution of the species tree of Camellia. The findings of this study reveal rapid diversification as a major source of gene tree discordance in Camellia and will facilitate future investigation of reticulate relationships at the species level in this important plant genus.

AB  - Many studies have shown that only a few breeds of goat have the trait of high fertility, and genes play an important role in regulating litter size. This study investigated the effects of GnRHR, BMP6, and FSHR gene polymorphisms on litter traits in four goat breeds (Chongqing black, Chuanzhong black, Leizhou, and Nubian). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (g.75G > A in GnRHR, g.951T > C in BMP6, and g.-112C > T/g.3236C > A in FSHR) were genotyped using PCR-RFLP/HRM in 959 goats. Association analysis revealed significant correlations between these SNPs and litter size in the Chongqing, Chuanzhong, and Leizhou breeds, with genotypes AA (GnRHR), CC (BMP6), TT (FSHR), and AA (FSHR) linked to higher prolificacy. Polygene polymerizing effect analysis identified the optimal combinations (e.g., AATTCC, AACCAACC) with enhanced litter sizes. Tissue-specific qPCR in Chuanzhong goats showed GnRHR, BMP6, and FSHR were significantly more highly expressed in reproductive tissues (pituitary, breast, ovary, oviduct) of the prolific group than those in the non-prolific group. These SNPs serve as potential molecular markers for improving goat litter traits through polygenic selection, emphasizing the synergistic impact of multi-gene interactions on prolificacy.

AB  - Benzodiazepines, commonly used for anxiolytics, hinder conditioned fear extinction, and the underlying circuit mechanisms are unclear. Utilizing remimazolam, an ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine, here we reveal its impact on the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) and interconnected hippocamposeptal circuits during fear extinction. Systemic or RE-specific administration of remimazolam impedes fear extinction by reducing RE activation through A type GABA receptors. Remimazolam enhances long-range GABAergic inhibition from lateral septum (LS) to RE, underlying the compromised fear extinction. RE projects to ventral hippocampus (vHPC), which in turn sends projections characterized by feed-forward inhibition to the GABAergic neurons of the LS. This is coupled with long-range GABAergic projections from the LS to RE, collectively constituting an overall positive feedback circuit construct that promotes fear extinction. RE-specific remimazolam negates the facilitation of fear extinction by disrupting this circuit. Thus, remimazolam in RE disrupts fear extinction caused by hippocamposeptal intermediation, offering mechanistic insights for the dilemma of combining anxiolytics with extinction-based exposure therapy.
   Remimazolam, an ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine, disrupts fear extinction by modulating the thalamic nucleus reuniens and hippocamposeptal circuits, complicating the use of benzodiazepines with exposure therapy.

AB  - Simple Summary The Yunnan snub-nosed monkey is one of the most endangered species on the IUCN Red List. The study of its population changes and its habitat quality and rarity changes over time are important for identifying opportunities for conserving and improving habitat quality while minimizing the adverse impact on ongoing human socio-economic development. Conserving and improving habitat quality is an important part of protecting and improving habitat diversity and biodiversity. Minimizing adverse impact to human development is important for earning energetic buy-in from the local people needed for long-term sustainability of such opportunities. Habitat Quality measures the land cover for an area at a given point in time compared to the preferences of a species or group of species. A high habitat quality indicates a large part of the area has land cover the species prefers, such as Huashan Pine for the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey. Habitat Rarity represents the change in rarity of a land coverage type (such as Huashan Pine) in an area over two points in time. A high habitat rarity indicates the land coverage type significantly decreased between the two points in time. A high Huashan Pine rarity, for example, means a significant decrease in the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey's most preferred land cover and hence will likely significantly impact the monkey's survival. Our analysis of the change in habitat quality and habitat rarity over time indicate increases in socio-economic developments in the villages around the habitat area have adversely affected the habitat quality and habitat rarity. This has resulted in a decline in biodiversity persistence, resilience, and breadth. It also has exacerbated the risk of declining species populations, potentially to extinction. Though focused on the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey, our approach toward the assessment of habitat quality and rarity over time based on species habitat suitability introduces a new perspective for assessing village development impacts on habitats for the conservation of other species. The reduction in habitat quality (as shown, in part, by the increase in habitat rarity) is an important challenge when protecting the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey. We used the InVEST model to quantitatively analyze the dynamic changes in the habitat of the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey from 1975 to 2022. The results show that in the study period, the degree of habitat degradation increased, with the degradation range at its widest in the south, and the degradation intensity highest in the north, especially along a center "spine" area in the north. Over the latter part of the study period, the habitat quality of most monkey groups improved, which is conducive to the survival and reproduction of the population. However, the habitat quality and monkey populations are still at significant risk. The results provide the basis for formulating the protection of the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey and provide research cases for the protection of other endangered species.

AB  - In parts of Angola, Namibia and South Africa the sparse vegetation at the margin of the Namib Desert is often dotted with roughly circular bare patches. The origin of these "fairy circles" (FC) is subject of an ongoing debate. In a recent article in PPEES, Getzin et al. (2022) provided assessments of grasses and termites combined with soil moisture measurements, in and near to fairy circles in several areas in Namibia. In their interpretation they state that termite herbivory is not causing this grass death as the plants had undamaged roots. Instead they propose that the matrix grasses severely depleted the water in FCs. Here, we use a comprehensive, detailed body of measurements and assessments collated during the last 14 years to propose an alternative interpretation. We structure our interpretation with four statements, each of them based on shown evidence: (1) Long-term soil moisture measurements confirm that the soil beneath the dry topsoil of the bare patch of fairy circles contains an equal or, especially during the biologically active season, higher amount of moisture than the surrounding matrix, at any given time. The grasses of the fairy circles bare patch die during the moist phase of the first weeks after a rain, before even the soil beneath the matrix vegetation gets depleted by transpiration. (2) Within the sandy soils of fairy circle landscapes, there is no sufficiently strong "uptake -diffusion feedback" that could cause a horizontal movement of soil moisture over several meters within a few days. (3) The grasses of the fairy circles bare patch first die at the centre of the bare patch and later towards the margin. (4) The grass in the bare patch of fairy circles dies because of damage to roots due to herbivory by sand termites.

AB  - The odor emission such as ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) during the composting process is a severe prob-lem that adversely affects the environment and human health. Therefore, this study aimed to (1) evaluate the variation of physicochemical characteristics during the co-composting of food waste, and sawdust mixed biochar; (2) assess the efficiency of biochar-composting combined amendment materials for reducing odor emissions and their maturity. The raw materials including food waste (FW), straw dust (SD), and biochar (BC) were prepared and homogeneously mixed with the weight ranging from 120.0 kg to 135.8 kg with five treatments, BC0 (Control), BC1 (5 % biochar), BC2 (5 % distilled water washed biochar), BC3 (10 % biochar), BC4 (20 % biochar). Adding biochar could change physicochemical properties such as temperature, moisture, and pH during composting. The results indicated applying biochar-composting covering to minimalized NH3 and H2S aided by higher porous structure and surface functional groups. Among trials, biochar 20 % obtained the lowest NH3 (2 ppm) and H2S (3 ppm) emission on day 16 and stopping their emission on day 17. The NH3/NH4+ adsorption on large specific surface areas and highly porous microstructure of biochar lead to reduced nitrogen losses, while nitrification (NH4+-, NO2--, NO3-) may also contribute to nitrogen retention. The H2S concentration decreased with increasing the biochar proportion, suggesting that biochar could reduce the H2S emission. Correlation analysis illustrated that temperature, moisture, and oxygen are the most critical factors affecting H2S and NH3 emissions (p < 0.05). The physicochemical properties and seed germination index indicated that the compost was mature without phytotoxicity. These novelty findings illustrated that the biochar amendment is an effective solution to reduce odor emission and enhances the maturity of compost mixture, which is promising to approach in real-scale conditions and could apply in agricultural fields.

AB  - Plant-to-plant volatile-mediated communication and subsequent induced resistance to insect herbivores is common. Less clear is the adaptive significance of these interactions; what selective mechanisms favour plant communication and what conditions allow individuals to benefit by both emitting and responding to cues? We explored the predictions of two non-exclusive hypotheses to explain why plants might emit cues, the kin selection hypothesis (KSH) and the mutual benefit hypothesis (MBH). We examined 15 populations of sagebrush that experience a range of naturally occurring herbivory along a 300 km latitudinal transect. As predicted by the KSH, we found several uncommon chemotypes with some chemotypes occurring only within a single population. Consistent with the MBH, chemotypic diversity was negatively correlated with herbivore pressure; sites with higher levels of herbivory were associated with a few common cues broadly recognized by most individuals. These cues varied among different populations. Our results are similar to those reported for anti-predator signalling in vertebrates.

AB  - Transport infrastructures, such as highways, disrupt animal migrations and cause roadkill. To mitigate the latter problem, fences have been built but their effectiveness has rarely been tested under controlled conditions. Here, we tested the effectiveness of the most commonly used fence in France and probably in Europe (wire netting fence) to block animals. We tested the wire netting fence, with and without a structural modification (i.e. an overhang), with three small mammalian species (the European hamster: Cricetus cricetus Linnaeus, 1758; the common vole: Microtus arvalis Pallas, 1778 & the wood mouse: Apodemus sylvaticus Linnaeus, 1758) and two amphibian species (the marsh frog: Pelophylax ridibundus Pallas, 1771 & the European green toad: Bufotes viridis Laurenti, 1768). During testing, all small vertebrate species tested were placed into an arena, from which they could only escape by crossing the wire netting fence. Without an overhang, almost all adult individuals of all tested species were able to climb over a 30 to 40 cm high wire netting fence. Furthermore, the addition of an 8 cm long overhang at the top of the fence stopped the amphibian species tested but not the most agile mammalian species, such as the hamster and the wood mouse. Based on these results, we do not support the construction of wire netting fences along roads as a measure to stop small animals from crossing. We recommend the use of more effective and durable fences, which, in addition, can be associated with wildlife passages to reconnect isolated populations.

AB  - Who interacts with whom is a key question in community and network ecology. The concept that these interactions may be driven by a match between the traits of consumer and resource species is known as trait-matching. If trait-matching would allow for general predictions of interaction structure based on sufficiently few and easily-measurable traits, then this approach could replace the laborious description of each individual pairwise interaction. To resolve imprints of trait-matching in a species-rich tri-trophic Salix-galler-parasitoid network, and to identify the most relevant traits, we applied five different methods, each approaching the same phenomenon from a different perspective. As traits, we used, body sizes, gall type (position on plant, structure of gall) and phenology, among others, as well as phylogenetic proxies. When jointly applied, the methods demonstrate distinctly different imprints of traits within the two bipartite network elements (Salix-galler versus galler-parasitoid interactions). Of the galler-parasitoid sub-network's interactions, approximately half were explainable by the species traits used; of the Salix-galler sub-network's interactions, traits explained at most two-fifths. Gall type appeared to be the most important structuring trait in both networks. Phylogeny explained as much, or more than did our tested traits, suggesting that traits may be conserved and phylogeny therefore an effective proxy. Overall, the more specialized structure of the Salix-galler network versus the more nested structure of the galler-parasitoid network meant that different methods were more effective at capturing interactions and interaction structure in the different sub-networks. Thus, our analysis reveals how structuring impacts may vary even between levels within the same multitrophic network, and calls for comparative analyses of trait matching across a wide set of systems and methods.

AB  - In recent years, Jiangsu Province has increasingly prioritized the coordinated regional development of innovation. Unicorn and gazelle companies, characterized by technological or business model innovation, serve as significant indicators of regional innovation capacity. Therefore, this study uses unicorn and gazelle companies recognized between 2020 and 2022 in Jiangsu Province as samples, employing ArcGIS and geographical detectors to investigate the spatial distribution characteristics and influencing factors of these companies, and to propose optimization strategies, with the aim of assessing the innovation landscape of Jiangsu Province. The key findings and conclusions are as follows: (1) over the past three years, the average nearest-neighbor distance decreased from 10.491 km to 1.706 km, indicating a significant spatial agglomeration; the peak core density of business clusters increased substantially, reflecting the growth in the number of companies as clustering deepened. (2) Unicorns and gazelles exhibit clear clustering characteristics. The standard deviation ellipse of unicorns is centered around Suzhou, while gazelles display a continuous distribution pattern in Southern and Central Jiangsu. (3) Geographical detector analysis reveals that the level of urban technological innovation is the most influential factor, with key determinants of distribution including total retail sales and patent grants. (4) To foster the development of unicorn and gazelle companies in Jiangsu, the government should focus on enhancing regional innovation capacity, ensuring the sustainable nurturing of innovative firms, and promoting the catalytic development of surrounding areas through core cities.

AB  - Simple Summary Regarding the European Union Recommendation on alternatives to surgical castration of pigs, it would be appropriate to search for new alternatives to commercialize the entire pig that could be affected by boar taint, as a sensory defect. The goal of this study was to evaluate if fat reduction in meat products could diminish the boar taint in dry-cured sausages with high levels of AND and SKA, and to study the technological and sensory quality by using inulin, beta-glucan and grape fibre as fat substitutes in fat-reduced products. The addition of fibres in reduced-fat fuet provided a similar technological and sensory profile to the traditional, achieving a reduction of sexual odour. Thus, these alternative formulations in reduced-fat meat products could be useful to allow high boar-tainted pork a place in the market. Reduced-fat cured sausages were evaluated as a strategy to reduce boar taint in entire male pork products with high levels of androstenone and skatole, both lipophilic. Three fuet-type sausages (two replicates each) were developed: the control (C) (60% lean, 33.69% fat), and two reduced-fat (60% lean 21.19% fat) products; R1, 6% inulin, 0.5% beta-glucan and R2, 3% inulin, 0.5% grape skin and 1% beta-glucan. All of them were prepared from entire male pork with an androstenone concentration of 6.887 mu g/g and 0.520 mu g/g of skatole. Significant differences (p <= 0.001) in the moisture content were described between the fuet R1 and the C and R2, which obtained the highest percentage. Regarding the CIELAB, the C samples had the highest L* value, while the R2 sausages were the darkest. Boar taint was reduced in both R1 and R2, with a greater reduction in R2 (p <= 0.000). The addition of inulin and beta-glucan in fuet R1 provided a similar technological and sensory profile to C. However, both strategies provided a reduction of sexual odour, which was higher when grape skins were included. In addition, R2 gave a characteristic sausage with more odour and flavour, dark colour and overall rating than C and R1.

AB  - Antimony (Sb) tailings pose a significant environmental challenge. N-fixing microorganisms are essential for nutrient accumulation and plant colonization in degraded habitats. However, the oligotrophic conditions of tailings often inhibit the energy-intensive N-fixing process. This study identified a chemolithoautotrophic Sb(III) oxidation-coupled nitrogen fixation (SbNF) pathway in the rhizosphere of local plants. SbNF integrates biological detoxification and nutrient accumulation, enabling plant colonization and ecological restoration of degraded habitats. Multi-omic analyses reveal that Sb content strongly shapes the composition of Sb-oxidizing and N-fixing bacterial communities in the rhizosphere. Abundant marker genes for carbon fixation (cbbL), Sb(III) oxidase (aioAB/anoA), and nitrogenase (nifH) were consistently detected in SbNF metagenome-assembled genomes. Positive correlations between gene abundances associated with autotrophic potential (aioA-cbbL) and coupling potential (aioA-nifH) were observed in the rhizoplane but not in the endosphere. In addition to genetic potentials, high-throughput cultivation of native SbNF-isolates (e.g., Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas) confirmed their rapid Sb(III) oxidation coupling autotrophic growth and nitrogen fixation. Isolates also exhibited plant growth-promoting traits, including indole-3-acetic acid production, phosphate solubilization, and siderophore secretion, providing multiple benefits to host plants. Co-cultivation of these isolates revealed minimal antagonism, suggesting the potential for designing synthetic microbial communities for sustainable phytoremediation. Cross-validation further suggests that SbNF is widespread in the rhizosphere of various local plants. These findings uncover a novel biogeochemical process in the rhizosphere, linking mineral oxidation, autotrophic growth, and nitrogen fixation, highlighting its importance for the ecological restoration of degraded tailing area.

AB  - Fecal sludge and tannery liming sludge management is essential for humans and the environment. The emitted amount of waste from two industries is reduced in composting leading to value-added products. This research focused on the effectiveness and feasibility of co-composting fecal sludge and hair-burning liming sludge from tannery. Fecal sludge was intermittently mixed with hair-burning liming sludge which also consisted of chicken manure and sawdust. Five piles (Pile 1, Pile 2, Pil3, Pile 4, and Pile 5) indicated respectively as P#1, P#2, P#3, P#4, and P#5, contained various ratios of composting materials were mixed, piled onto a horizontal bamboo frame, and observed for 120 days. To ensure a suitable oxygen supply, the composting piles were turned on in the thermophilic stage so that pathogens could not survive. The highest temperatures in the thermophilic stage were 39.0 degrees C, 49.2 degrees C, 55.7 degrees C, 41.7 degrees C, and 51.3 degrees C. These referred to the respective piles P#1, P#2, P#3, P#4, and P#5. The Dewar stability index confirmed the stability of each composting pile, and the maximum degradation was found for P#3. The metals chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), iron (Fe), and nickel (Ni) in the final compost were found to be 38.1, 144.7, 15.1, 450.5, and 22.7 mg/kg, respectively. TCLP results reveal only an insignificant amount of metal leaching. Fecal coliform of the compost was below the standard level; Helminth eggs and Salmonella spp. were absent. SEM micrographs reflect the decomposition of composting materials. The maximum germination index and germination capacity of compost pile P#3 for compost-soil ratio 1:0 and 1:1 were 90%-92.8% and 100%, respectively. The present approach produced nutrient-enriched compost from fecal sludge and hair-burning liming sludge from a tannery emerges as a suitable solution for reducing solid wastes.

AB  - In the central Sikhote-Alin Mountains, tigers prey mainly on underyearlings and adult female wild boars (67-74% of the total number of prey of this species). In key plots (>= 10-15 km2) in the Sikhote-Alin Nature Reserve, (a) wild boar encounters and their tracks in the network of routes were recorded; (b) wild boar snow tracking was conducted; and (c) tiger encounters and snow tracking were recorded (114 episodes). We obtained 16 movement patterns of wild boar groups using snow tracking. Snow tracking of each wild boar group took six to 23 days. Many maternal groups occupied a position central in relation to other accompanying groups (up to eight) and individuals (up to 15) moving in the vicinity, usually over an area (1.5-9.4 km2 or more) that was 1.1-2.2 or more times larger than the area of the maternal group under normal conditions. Such a dynamic organization of associations that serves as a kind of pre-adaptation to the probable appearance of a predator revealed the effectiveness against the tiger both randomly searching for prey and tracking it along a trail. The number of tiger attacks on the accompanying wild boars temporarily separated from the parental group was nearly three times (p < 0.05) as high as the number of attacks by the predator on maternal groups in key plots. In the relationships between the predator and prey species, (a) the location of the habitats of the maternal wild boar groups matters as well, in snowy winters also of compact sites, all usually at a distance from regular tiger routes; (b) disturbed wild boars broadened the search areas, under tiger pursuits and attacks they also changed the site; (c) the tuskers, the male wild boars that accompany maternal groups, often "covered" and "disguise" these groups by moving to the side of the most likely appearance by tigers.

AB  - Due to its peripheral location and formidable geography, the livelihood of people in Leh mostly depends on locally accessible resources, particularly livestock, tourism, horticulture, agriculture and services. The current study is an attempt to investigate the development and diversity of livelihood in the region by considering six relevant criteria for each of the five livelihood-generating resources. The data retrieved via structured questionnaires and interviews were analyzed by employing the widely used Livelihood Development Index and sophisticated Simpson's Livelihood diversity index across constituent spatial units or blocks. The Principal Component Analysis reported tourism as the most significant potential predictor influencing the growth of livelihood across the region. This was subsequently followed by contributions from services, livestock, agriculture and horticulture. Of the selected criteria, income from tourism per month, income from transportation of tourists, income from commercial shops per month, income from services per month, income from milk and milk products per month, income from the sale of sheep and goats per year, income by selling of apricot and vegetables (only sale) per month were reported as the most significant criteria determi livelihood development in the region. Moreover, 18 criteria out of 30 showed significant values for Simpson's livelihood diversity index reflecting the impact of these criteria on livelihood development across the study area. The aggregate value of the index was highest for livestock (S.D.I = 0.894) that was followed by agriculture (S.D.I = 0.881), services (S.D.I = 0.876), horticulture (S.D.I = 0.871) and tourism (S.D.I = 0.851). Based on the results, the study would like to insist on more diversified opportunities and reduced vulnerability of livelihood to the people especially residing in the southern blocks of the study area.

AB  - Goats were raised in different regions of the world for various purposes including milk and meat production as well as skin and fiber. The number of goats evaluated to be about 2.5 million heads, which represent about 30% of total meat income of Saudi Arabia. Saudi local goat breeds did not receive the required attention about their genetic information, despite their important adaptive characteristics. This study aims to access genetic diversity of some Saudi goat breeds depending on sequence analysis of specific mitochondrial D-loop region. Results showed that the Saudi goats resemble two main groups (1 and 2). Group one, is classified into two subgroups. Subgroup 1a (Saudi goats with accession numbers MG725669, MG725670 and MG725673 of Habsi breed) and Subgroup 1b (Saudi goats with accession numbers MG725674, MG725676 and MG725677 of Harri breed). Lineage A (group one), showed characteristic difference compared to all other studied goat members around the world. The nearest goat to this Lineage is goat accession number (KJ940969). On the other hand, Saudi goats outside this group (group 2) showed high similarity with other sequences of goats obtained from GenBank database, which included in this study. The results of Lineage 2 (group 2) showed no noticed sharp difference with the published GenBank database sequences. Finally, Lineage 1(group one) showed novel results including specific SNPs and one deletion, which is characteristic only to this group. This will give more insights about correlation between sequence, classification and function of these breeds.

AB  - Societal interest in all aspects of sustainability has increased. Therefore, pig farmers need to be aware of their strengths and weaknesses in all dimensions of sustainability: economy, environment, social wellbeing, and animal health and welfare. Our aim was to describe and critically discuss the development of a sustainability assessment tool for pig farms and to evaluate its suitability by applying it to 63 European pig farms (13 breeding, 27 breeding-to-finishing, and 23 finishing farms). The multi-criteria assessment tool was developed in several steps (the selection and scaling of indicators and their aggregation and weighting) in order to summarise the indicators into subtheme and theme scores. The indicators contributing the most to the subtheme/theme scores were identified and discussed in order to evaluate the procedure of the development. For example, some indicators, such as Ecological compensation area, Fairness of prices, and Tail docking, for which farms were scored low, were also identified as "real world problems" in other studies. For other sustainability aspects with low performance, the threshold might have been set too ambitiously, e.g., for Number of sows per annual working unit. Furthermore, to analyse the suitability of the tool, we assessed the best and worst median theme scores (good and poor performances) for each dimension, as well as the variability of the performances of the farms within the themes. Some themes were found to be moderate, such as Pig comfort, Biodiversity, or Resilience, whereas others were found to be good, e.g., Water and the Human-animal relationship, as well as several themes of the social wellbeing dimension. Overall, the sustainability tool provides a comprehensive assessment of the sustainability of pig production. Furthermore, this publication contributes to both the theory (development of a robust sustainability tool) and the practice (provision of a tool to assess and benchmark the sustainability on farms). As a next step, a sensitivity analysis should be performed, and the tool should be applied for further development.

AB  - Simple Summary The type and quantity of fat are among the key factors influencing the carcass and meat quality in yak. The effect of gender to fat in yak and the correlation of meat quality with fat were studied in this paper. The meat of male yaks (MYs) is healthier from the point of nutritional value, whereas the meat of female yaks (FYs) possesses better qualities in relation to the visual impact and mouthfeel. The below results can provide a theoretical basis for the deep processing of yak meat. Yak meat quality (especially tenderness) can be improved by increasing the content of fat, C18:0, cis-C18:2, and cis-C18:1 in muscle during yak production. These genes, including SCD, PLIN5, LPL, ME1 and DBI, play a crucial role in the regulation of fat deposition in yak. Above candidate genes for fat deposition in yak can supply the theoretical basis in molecular breeding of yak with a high fat content in muscle. This study aimed to explore the differences in fat deposition between female (FYs) and male yaks (MYs). Compared with MYs, the tenderness, L*, marbling, absolute content of fat, and most fatty acids (FAs) of longissimus dorsi (LD) in FYs were higher or better (p < 0.05), whereas the relative content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and n-3 PUFAs were lower (p < 0.01). The absolute content of fat, C18:0, cis-C18:2, cis-C18:1, and C24:0 were positively correlated with L*(45 min), b*(24 h), tenderness, and marbling score of LD in FYs and MYs (p < 0.05), respectively. LPL, FATP2, ELOVL6, HADH, HACD, and PLINS genes play a crucial role in improving the marbling score and tenderness of yak meat. The results of gene expression and protein synthesis showed the effect of gender to FA biosynthesis, FA transport, lipolysis, and FA oxidation in the adipose tissue of yak was realized by the expressions of ME1, SCD, ACSL5, LPL, FABP1, PLIN4, and PLIN2 in peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling. This study established a theoretical basis for the improvement of the meat quality of yak and molecular breeding.

AB  - The mean trophic position (TP) of mesozooplankton largely determines how much mass and energy is available for higher trophic levels like fish. Unfortunately, the ratio of herbivores to carnivores in mesozooplankton is difficult to identify in field samples. Here, we investigated changes in the mean TP of mesozooplankton in a highly dynamic environment encompassing four distinct habitats in the southern South China Sea: the Mekong River plume, coastal upwelling region, shelf waters, and offshore oceanic waters. We used a set of variables derived from bulk and amino acid nitrogen stable isotopes from particulate organic matter and four mesozooplankton size fractions to identify changes in the nitrogen source and TP of mesozooplankton across these habitats. We found clear indications of a shift in N sources for biological production from nitrate in near-coastal waters with shallow mixed layer depths toward an increase in diazotroph-N inputs in oceanic waters with deep mixed layer depths where diazotrophs shaped the phytoplankton community. The N source shift was accompanied by a lengthening of the food chain (increase in the TP). This may provide further support for the connection between diazotrophy and the indirect routing of N through the marine food web. Our combined bulk and amino acid delta N-15 approach also allowed us to estimate the trophic enrichment (TE) of mesozooplankton across the entire regional ecosystem. When put in the context of literature values, a high TE of 5.1 parts per thousand suggested a link between ecosystem heterogeneity and the less efficient transfer of mass and energy across trophic levels.

AB  - Reconstructing the history (spatio-temporal patterns) of biological invasions at a small spatial scale is challenging, notably because the required data are often not available in sufficient quantity and quality. In this study, we present a mixed approach using six different data sources to explore the spreading history of four non-native invasive tree species, Ailanthus altissima, Celtis occidentalis, Prunus serotina and Acer negundo in a high conservation value foreststeppe habitat with an area of 1000 ha (Peszer Forest, Central Hungary). We carried out a literature search, compiled all the archived and currently valid data of the National Forestry Database (NFD) in a GIS database, conducted a full-coverage field survey, mapped all the large/old tree specimens and carried out annual ring counts, performed a hotspot analysis on the abundance data provided by the field survey and gathered local knowledge. Each of these approaches proved indispensable and their complementary use made it possible to reconstruct the invasion history of all four tree species. According to the available source literature, P. serotina was first planted in the area in 1937 and the first known occurrence of A. altissima could also be traced back to the 1930s. The examination of large specimens of C. occidentalis and querying the NFD for data related to A. negundo provided evidence that these species have been present in the area since at least the 1940s. However, based on the NFD and local knowledge, it is certain that the rapid expansion of the four tree species occurred simultaneously and only around the turn of the millennium, with a lag of at least 60-70 years. The exploration of local knowledge revealed three possible explanations, which interestingly also coincided in time. With the change in the political regime, the intensity of forest use started to decrease in the 1990s, the population of game was drastically reduced at the end of the decade and droughts became more frequent from 2000 onwards. The field survey clearly showed that these tree species were 2-3 times more prevalent and abundant than the relevant NFD data indicated. Finally, the primary hotspots of A. altissima and A. negundo overlapped with the locations of their first known occurrences, while in the case of C. occidentalis and P. serotina, they did not. However, local knowledge revealed that the former two had been ignored since at least the 1950s, while the latter two were occasionally planted until the 1990s. It is likely that the primary hotspots of C. occidentalis and P. serotina indicate the locations of these undocumented plantations.

AB  - Seaweed aquaculture produces enormous economic and ecological service benefits, making significant contributions to achieving global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, large-scale development of seaweed aquaculture and the unreasonable use of aquaculture rafts may trigger green tide, bringing negative ecological, social, and economic impacts. Therefore, it is vital to monitor the seaweed aquaculture industry accurately. Here, we mapped 10-m-resolution seaweed aquaculture along the Jiangsu coast of China based on active and passive remote sensing (Sentinel-1/2) and Random Forest using Google Earth Engine. The results demonstrate satisfactory model performance and data accuracy. The square seaweed aquaculture in the Lianyungang Offshore (Mode-I) has gradually expanded to the deep sea since 2016, with a maximum area of 194.06 km(2) in 2018. Between 2021 and 2022, the area of the strip-shaped seaweed aquaculture in Subei radiation shoals (Mode-II) was considerably reduced, with most of the reduced land lying on the east side of the Dafeng Elk National Nature Reserve. In general, the area of the seaweed aquaculture in the prohibited breeding area was reduced from 20.32 km(2) to 3.13 km(2), and the area of the seaweed aquaculture in the restricted breeding area was reduced from 149.71 km(2) to 33.15 km(2). Results show that under the policy restriction, the scale of unsustainable seaweed aquaculture along the Jiangsu coast has been greatly reduced within seven years. This study can provide an efficient approach for the medium-scale extraction of seaweed aquaculture and provide decision support for the sustainable development of marine aquaculture.

AB  - Cockchafers Melolontha spp. are polyphagous root pests and outbreak species of considerable economic importance to forestry in Europe. Knowledge of genetic diversity within and between cockchafer populations is largely unexplored but could lead to more effective monitoring and management strategies of these pests. In this study, we fill several gaps in the knowledge of the genetic population structure of Melolontha melolontha and Melolontha hippocastani. Using microsatellite loci and over 200 individuals per species, we examined the genetic structure of Melolontha spp. populations collected from three primary outbreak areas in central and southeastern Poland. We demonstrated that our focal species share some common genetic patterns, such as considerable genetic diversity within subpopulations (within sampling sites) with minor effects of past bottlenecks possibly masked by current population sizes. The estimates of effective population sizes, although subject to wide credibility intervals, indicated a large number of individuals contributing to further generations of the population. The migration rates exceed the threshold of one per generation required for gene flow and maintenance of population equilibrium, indicating limited impact from forest management practices on either cockchafer species. While genetic differentiation was observed in M. melolontha populations, supported by various indices (fixation index, principal coordinate analysis, assignment tests), the M. hippocastani populations were genetically similar. This disparity may hint at the potential historical divergence between these species. In this aspect, more detailed phylogeographic and population genetic studies covering a large area of the Palaearctic distributions of both species are required. Our findings constitute one of the initial efforts aimed at delineating the genetic diversity, differentiation, population structure, gene flow, and migration patterns within Melolontha spp. This exploration is especially significant for M. hippocastani, given its completely unexplored genetic population structure.

AB  - The escalating anthropogenic activities in recent decades are constantly affecting the aquatic ecology and posing a threat to freshwater species. In this study, a two-dimensional ecohydraulic model and multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) coupled framework is employed in the Dikhow River, India, to investigate the favourable habitat condition for the nearly threatened Notopterus chitala fish locally known as Chital fish. The habitat residence suitability and habitat suitability indices are calculated at the observed and ecological flows. The ecological flow rates are computed from flow duration curve shifting and flow duration curve analysis methods. The hydrodynamic computations are carried out using a 1D-2D coupled MIKE FLOOD model. The habitat assessment of the targeted species is carried out by constructing the suitability curves from the computed hydraulic parameters at different environmental management conditions. Results from the habitat assessment curves indicate that the maximum habitat suitability index is found for the targeted fish species at average annual flow. Based on the MCDA analysis, the outer banks of the meander zones are identified as not suitable residence regions for the target species. This study revealed that the coupled approach could be useful to regulate the stream restoration strategies and identify potential habitat preference locations in the domain.

AB  - Warming temperatures and drought are leading to unprecedented irruptions of forest insects worldwide. Altered climatic regimes have the potential to allow native forest insects to express novel behaviors and expand in latitude and elevation beyond their hypothesized thermal tolerances. Yet, disentangling the drivers of novel behaviors and range expansions is difficult due to cross-scalar interactions that dictate forest insect population dynamics. We investigated the irruptive dynamics of western balsam bark beetle (Dryocoetes confusus Swaine), which undergoes intermittent, long-lasting, but low-severity outbreaks in subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa Hook) forests. We compiled data from 1998 to 2019 across British Columbia, Canada, at 1 and 16 km(2) resolutions to describe the spatiotemporal structure of beetle outbreaks, predict the landscape susceptibility to outbreaks, explain when outbreaks occur based on bioclimatic drivers, explore whether beetle populations exhibit self driving growth, and determine whether the extent of outbreaks has increased. Overall, we found that outbreaks occur in discrete clusters and are synchronous at distances of 10-25 km. Further, we found that landscape susceptibility to beetle outbreaks was best explained by latitude*elevation (i.e., the product of latitude [m] and elevation [m] Z-standardized) and volume of fir (m(3)/ha; > 17.5 cm size class; > 100 yrs.) both within 8 km and each pixel. Meanwhile, a longer growing season, increased growing degree day accumulation, and drought best explained when outbreaks occurred. Further, we did not find evidence to suggest that beetle populations exhibit self-driving population growth. Finally, we found that the extent of beetle outbreaks has increased over the last 20 years and that increases in landscape susceptibility primarily occurred at higher latitude*elevations and were best explained by an increase in the mean growing season and degree day accumulation. In other words, abnormally warm temperatures have facilitated a northward and upward expansion of western balsam bark beetle. Collectively, these results serve as the first quantification of the spatiotemporal dynamics of this understudied insect and support previous modeling efforts to investigate the multi-scale drivers of western balsam bark beetle outbreaks. We propose that future work should identify specific supercooling points, the relationship between temperature and development rate, and how the relatively high within-stand variability in age and size class of subalpine fir affect the irruptive dynamics of this understudied bark beetle.

AB  - Neighbouring plant species can indirectly affect each other's fitness through insect herbivores. For instance, the number of eggs an insect deposits on a focal plant can be influenced by the presence of a neighbouring plant species because of the herbivore's relative host plant preferences. Yet, the relationship between oviposition preferences (measured in no-choice tests) and the strength and direction of such indirect effects among neighbouring plants remains poorly understood. We performed a lab experiment using bean beetles (Callosobruchus maculatus) and five species of beans to determine if beetles' no-choice preferences for a neighbouring bean species correlated with the number of eggs laid on a focal species in two-species environments (diculture). We predicted that as the preference for the neighbouring beans increased compared to the focal host, beetles would lay fewer eggs on the focal bean host. Across all pair-wise combinations, our prediction was supported: as the relative no-choice preference of neighbouring beans increased, the number of eggs laid on focal beans decreased. However, this relationship was relatively weak. We also found that beetles tended to lay more eggs in diculture compared to arenas with one bean species. These results provide empirical evidence linking herbivores' no-choice preferences to the strength of neighbourhood effects and suggest that even within a relatively controlled environment, neighbourhood effects can be weak. Our results also highlight that unexpected changes to the total number of eggs laid by herbivores in mixed-plant patches relative to monoculture can complicate predictions.
   We used no-choice oviposition tests to investigate the relationship between the relative preference of a neighbouring plant species and the number of eggs laid on a focal plant species. Bean beetles oviposited less on focal beans as their preference for neighbouring beans increased. This effect was weak partly because beetles laid more eggs in dicultures than in no-choice tests. We demonstrate that predicting the effects of neighbours requires an understanding of how neighbours influence the total number of eggs laid in addition to how eggs are distributed among plants. image

AB  - The foliage of the tree Brosimum alicastrum is widely employed by small farmers in Latin America to supplement cattle, sheep and goats during the dry season. Foliage is manually cut, and the branches are chopped and fed directly, being highly palatable to ruminant species. The foliage remains green throughout the year, and the tree can be defoliated twice per year. Cattle can also directly browse the foliage from the tree, but it is mostly used in cut and carry systems and transported in carts to farms. The experiment hereby described showed that the crude protein fraction of the foliage of B. alicastrum is highly fermentable in the rumen, supplying nitrogen for growth of the microbial population. As the percent of foliage of B. alicastrum in the ration was increased, dry matter intake by sheep was concomitantly increased, as was the rate of the passage of digesta through the rumen and the supply of microbial nitrogen to the small intestine. The foliage of B. alicastrum is a valuable feedstuff for ruminants in the tropics and can be used as a cheap source of protein during the critical periods of the year to improve weight gain and milk yield in a sustainable way. An experiment was carried out to assess the effect of the incorporation of sun-dried foliage of Brosimum alicastrum into rations based on hay of Megathyrsus maximus on intake, rumen fermentation, kinetics of passage, microbial nitrogen supply to the small intestine, apparent digestibility in Pelibuey hair sheep. Four rations were randomly allotted to four rumen-cannulated lambs (BW = 37.4 +/- 4.9 kg) using a 4 x 4 Latin square design to assess the effect of increasing levels (0, 15, 30 and 45% DM basis) of foliage of Brosimum alicastrum on a basal ration of M. maximus. Organic matter intake and water consumption increased linearly (p < 0.01) with increasing levels of B. alicastrum in the ration. The rate and potential extent of rumen fermentation of OM and CP of B. alicastrum were 10.6%/h and 86.6% and 11.4%/h and 95.2%, respectively, but no effect (p > 0.05) was found on the potential rumen degradation of DM (40.2%) or on the rate of degradation of DM (0.033%/h) of M. maximus, although a positive effect was found in the rumen degradation rate of NDF (p < 0.05). VFA and ammonia concentration in the rumen and the rate of passage of solids and liquids through the rumen (k1) increased linearly (p < 0.01) with increasing levels of B. alicastrum. Rumen pH was not affected by the incorporation of B. alicastrum (p > 0.05). Microbial nitrogen supply to the small intestine (p < 0.001), apparent digestibility of dry matter (p < 0.01) and NDF (p < 0.05) of the rations were also significantly increased as a result of the incorporation of B. alicastrum foliage. Results from this experiment suggest that the foliage of Brosimum alicastrum can be readily incorporated at around 30% of the ration of dry matter in hair sheep with beneficial effects on feed intake, rate of passage and microbial N supply to the lower tract.

AB  - The feeding behaviour of pigs can be continuously recorded using sensors, providing promising avenues for automatic monitoring of pig performance and welfare. To utilise this potential, however, the data must be cleaned and aggregated meaningfully. A common aggregation is from visits into meals, in which visits separated by intervals shorter than a meal criterion (s or min) are merged. Methods to determine the criterion and the criteria themselves vary widely between studies, and have been applied indiscriminately or only when no pen mates visited the feeder during the interval. Aggregation choices should be biologically relevant, but there is no empirical knowledge on how pigs behave during these intervals or how the intervals are influenced by feeder competition. This study had three aims: 1) test the method that classifies intervals using a three-part probability density function (short, intermediate and long intervals); 2) determine whether feeder competition differed between interval types and application methods; and 3) describe and compare the behaviours of pigs between intervals. Visit intervals were obtained from 110 barrows in ten pens with one IVOG (R) electronic feeding station each. A three-part probability density function was fitted to the log-transformed intervals, and its fit was assessed visually. For each pig, a short and an intermediate interval were selected for behavioural observations from camera. We found that pigs had relatively more intermediate intervals (1-28 min) than cows and that the fit of the three-part function was suboptimal. Nevertheless, identified meal criteria were in similar ranges as for other species. Intermediate intervals were more often initiated by displacements than short intervals (<= 1 min), and there was more aggression and less pen exploration if pen mates visited the feeder during these intervals. Short intervals reflected interruptions in feeding behaviour, shown by standing (e.g. vigilance/chewing outside the feeder) and pen exploration (e.g. rooting, searching for pellets), while intermediate intervals contained nonfeeding behaviours, such as social nosing, drinking and, predominantly, lying inactive. We conclude that intermediate intervals indicated completed feeding bouts, while short intervals reflected continued feeding-focused behaviours. Therefore, only visits separated by short intervals should be merged into meals. The exact criterion depends on the dataset but may, considering the suboptimal fit of the function, be more precisely determined using other methods. Whether visits should be merged indiscriminately or only when no pen mates entered the EFS during the interval depends on whether competition effects are of interest in the study.

AB  - The Central American river turtle (Dermatemys mawii) is one of the of the most critically endangered turtle species worldwide, as a result of habitat loss and heavy hunting for consumption. Research on D. mawii becomes more challenging as wild populations are disappearing, while basic ecological data are still required to inform conservation efforts. In this study, our aim was to analyze the diet of D. mawii based on sex, and compare the information provided by stomach flushing and fecal samples. We examined both types of samples from individuals captured in 2017 and 2018 in a lentic system in the Lacantun River Basin, Chiapas, Mexico. We identified 3 broad categories (aquatic macrophytes, riparian resources and invertebrates) and 12 different food items, of which four are new reports of vascular plants for the diet of this turtle. The principal items consumed by D. mawii were Pistia stratiotes (a free-floating macrophyte) and Ludwigia sp. (a riparian plant). A low index of relative importance (<= 0.5) for invertebrates suggests that they may be ingested accidentally when feeding on plants. We did not detect significant sex differences in the relative contribution of food items between the two sampling methods; additionally, we found a large dietary overlap (Ck$ 0.89) between sexes that indicates a similar use of resources in this lentic system. We found all 3 broad food categories in stomach flushing samples and only one (riparian resources) in fecal samples; however, we did not find significant differences in the number of food items. The use of both postingestion sampling methods provided a more comprehensive view of the diet of this herbivorous freshwater turtle.

AB  - This article considers changes in the composition of the fauna and in the abundance of alien mammals from the group of introduced species over the past two decades, which in Ukraine are marked by two powerful processes. These are the distinct processes of climate warming and shortening of winters, on the one hand, and the large-scale war waged by Russia against Ukraine on the territory of Ukraine, on the other. Such changes in the natural environment lead to significant shifts in the boundaries of natural zones and, accordingly, the living conditions of all species, not only local biota but also aliens. Among the latter, a special group is made up of introduced species, as those that appeared not as a result of natural dispersal in the context of global climate change, but due to various types of introductions. Among them are three species from the superorder Rodentia (Oryctolagus cuniculus, Ondatra zibethicus, Myocastor coypus), three species from the superorder Carnivora (Nyctereutes procyonoides, Neogale vison, Procyon lotor), five species from the superorder Ungulata (Cervus nippon, Dama dama, Ovis gmelini, Equus hemionus, Equus ferus). The following five factors contributed to the success of the introductions: 1) captivity with the possibility to escape, 2) destruction of various kinds of nurseries (during the war), 3) reduction of the abundance of native species, 4) increase in the share of degraded habitats, 5) reduction of all forms of nature use and population regulation. The factors of successful introductions are analysed in terms of habitat types and the structure of guilds in which the introductions are integrated. It is shown that introductions of species confined to eutrophic habitats and species occupying 'windows' or marginal places in the guild structure are successful. Most of the introductions carried out in Ukraine have resulted in the formation of natural populations of alien species, mainly semi-aquatic mammals: rodents (O. zibethicus, partially M. coypus) and carnivores (N. vison, N. procyonoides). Terrestrial species did not show significant expansion and naturalisation, with the exception of the sika deer. The increase in the number of some alien species (O. zibethicus, C. nippon, N. vison) occurred simultaneously with a decrease in the number of their competitors from the native fauna (Arvicola amphibius, Cervus elaphus, Mustela lutreola). The most problematic was the entry ofN. vison into the mustelid guild. The appearance of alien species has led to the extinction of a significant part of ecologically similar native species, and the total number of these two groups of animals has become almost equal. Hunting of animals as a means of regulating their populations has proved to be ineffective, as the volume of hunting is 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than the annual population growth of these species, which indicates that alien species are not vulnerable to hunters.

AB  - Wildlife conflicts between people and large herbivores or mammalian carnivores are widely researched in Africa, but there is limited work on human-crocodile conflicts (HCC). In Uganda, conservation efforts have enabled the recovery of the Nile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) population, yet the expanding human population and activities increasingly overlap with crocodile habitats resulting in negative interactions. This study used a combination of literature review, surveys, and the Nominal Group Technique to investigate the factors underpinning HCC around Murchison Falls Conservation Area. Results indicate that 115 attacks on humans occurred during 2012-2017, 84.3% of these being fatal. Also, 93.1% of the attacks occurred as victims were either fishing or collecting water. Construction of crocodile exclusion enclosures and translocation of problem crocodiles to protected areas were the most preferred mitigation measure. To reduce the prevalence of human injuries and offset local hostility toward crocodiles, conservation actors need to actively engage the affected communities.

AB  - Context. Free-roaming dogs are ubiquitous worldwide and pose a threat to wildlife. An understanding of the roaming behaviour of dogs is useful for developing effective management strategies. Aims. We aimed to assess the activity ranges and patterns of free-roaming dogs in a rural Cambodian village. An adjacent wildlife sanctuary protects populations of threatened species that may be negatively impacted by dogs. Methods. We used rudimentary hand-made GPS collars to track village dogs and quantify their movements. Activity ranges were calculated for male and female dogs, and the mean distances travelled at night and during the day were determined. Additionally, forays outside of the activity range were characterised. Key results. We estimated a mean activity range of 178 +/- 190 ha and found that dogs typically travelled longer distances at night. Females had significantly smaller activity ranges, as well as covering shorter distances per day. Foray behaviour was variable, with some dogs entering the wildlife sanctuary regularly and others not at all. Conclusions. Free-roaming Cambodian dog activity overlapped with native mammals in the study site, posing a risk of predation, resource exclusion, harassment and competition of Cambodian species. Implications. The data suggest that although dogs generally spend the majority of their time within the village, there is significant risk to wildlife. Actions are required to mitigate threats to native wildlife, in particular threatened species such as Eld's Deer.

AB  - Dispersal is a critical process that shapes the structure of wild animal populations. In species that form multi-level societies, natal dispersal might be social (associating with a different social community while remaining near the natal area), spatial (moving away from the natal area while continuing to associate with the same community) or both social and spatial (associating with a different community and moving away from the natal area). For such species, classical spatial measures of dispersal, such as distance moved, might not capture social dispersal. We examined dispersal outcomes for 67 male and 70 female giraffe calves over 7 years in a large, unfenced, ecologically heterogeneous landscape. We tested predictions about the influence of sex, food availability, low- and high-impact human settlements, and local giraffe population density on social or spatial dispersal, dispersal distance, and age of dispersal. We found that dispersal is sex-specific, with females being predominately philopatric. When dispersing, both sexes did so at a mean of 4 years of age. Most (69% of total) young males dispersed, with 84% of male dispersers associating with a different adult female social community than that of their mother, but one in four of these dispersers remained spatially near to their natal area. For adolescent males that dispersed socially but not spatially, overlapping female social communities may represent a potential pool of unrelated mating partners without the risks of travelling to unfamiliar areas. Just 26% of young females dispersed and half of these continued to associate with the adult female social community into which they were born, confirming the importance of maintaining ties among females from calf to adulthood. Furthermore, individuals born farther from high-impact human settlements were more likely to spatially or socially-and-spatially disperse, move greater distances from their natal areas, and disperse at a younger age. Our study highlights the potential importance of social structure in dispersal decisions, and of tracking social structure when studying dispersal in multi-level societies, as effective dispersal can be attained without large-scale spatial displacements.

AB  - Shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic impacted air traffic, industry bodies warned of the potential increase in wildlife strike risk. Prior to the pandemic, wildlife strikes were already a concern to the industry. We sought to evaluate industry warnings using interrupted time series analysis of wildlife strike trends in the United States. Using pre-pandemic wildlife strike trends, we compared a forecast of the expected monthly strike rates through the COVID-19 impact period (March 2020 to December 2020) to the actual wildlife strike rates for the same period. Our results showed an increase in wildlife strike rates in 5 out of the 10 months analyzed, supporting the need for careful consideration of wildlife strike risk through the industry's recovery.

AB  - The potassium-oxygen battery (KOB) has distinguished itself from other metal-oxygen batteries by its facile cell chemistry that enables thousands of cycles with negligible performance loss. Recently, the main discharge product KO2 was reported to undergo a reduction towards K2O2 in the absence of oxygen, which was identified as the cause of diminished rechargeability. This raises the question how oxygen partial pressure p(O-2) affects the discharge behavior of KOB. In this study, the influence of p(O-2) on the discharge performance is assessed between 0.2 atm and 11 atm. The p(O-2)-dependent cell failure mechanisms are investigated by post mortem analysis of the discharge product formed on a carbon cathode. Low p(O-2) results in insufficient oxygen transport throughout the cathode leading to low rate capability and capacity. In addition, we find that oxygen depletion promotes parasitic reactions involving the electrolyte solvent dimethyl sulfoxide. High p(O-2) is identified as an effective approach towards preventing oxygen depletion and subsequent side reactions. Furthermore, high p(O-2) also drastically improves the discharge performance by enabling more efficient cathode utilization. These findings suggest that a high-pressure supply of pure oxygen will be advantageous to further increase cell performance of KOB and thus open avenues for yet unexplored applications.

AB  - The Florida spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius ambarvalis) is disjunct from other eastern spotted skunk (S. putorius) subspecies and has rarely been studied. Declines in eastern spotted skunk populations elsewhere underscore the importance of better understanding the Florida subspecies' ecology and resource use, including its potential impacts as a nest predator of imperiled ground-nesting birds. The objective of our study was to gather baseline information on Florida spotted skunk diet in the dry prairie ecosystem of Central Florida. We conducted a stable isotope analysis using hair samples from 39 skunks and compared these with 106 samples from potential food items in dry prairie in 2016 and 2017 at Three Lakes Wildlife Management Area in Osceola County, Florida. Our resultant Bayesian mixing model indicated that the most prevalent food items in the Florida spotted skunk diet were millipedes (Diplopoda; similar to 42% of the diet) and a group consisting of amphibians and reptiles (similar to 16%). Less prevalent were the groups including ground-nesting birds-one group containing granivorous or herbivorous species (similar to 15%) and another containing insectivorous species (similar to 13%). Our study provides evidence that Florida spotted skunks in the dry prairie ecosystem likely have a generalist diet, like spotted skunks outside of Florida, as no food item composed a majority (> 50%) of their diet. This study provides the first insights into the diet of free-ranging Florida spotted skunks and fills a key knowledge gap in the ecology of this important predator of the Florida dry prairie ecosystem.

AB  - In the Caleri lagoon, a coastal lagoon in the Po River Delta, Northern Adriatic, the transplant of the dwarf eelgrass Zostera noltei was used as a nature-based solution to attempt the ecological restoration of a previously depleted lagoon area. A total of 135 15-cm-diameter sods were transplanted, with the donor site at the Venice lagoon. Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), eelgrass transplants were mapped and monitored with great precision. After two years, the area covered by eelgrass increased from the initial 2.5 m2 to 60 m2. Changes in the community structure and on the frequency of biological traits of macrobenthos occurred at the transplant site, with a higher frequency of epifaunal predators and herbivores, and of organisms with longer life spans and larger body sizes. Sensitive and indifferent taxa were always higher in the transplant site than in the bare bottom control site, where opportunistic taxa continued to dominate. Ecological quality status measured through M-AMBI and HBFI indices showed a clear improvement in the transplant site. The rapid changes in benthos demonstrate that even relatively small-scale transplantation of dwarf eelgrass can restore faunal communities very rapidly.

AB  - Initial enteric microbial colonisation influences animal health and disease, hence an understanding of the first microbial colonisers within the piglet is important. The spiral colon of piglets that were stillborn (n = 20), born-alive (n = 10), and born alive and had sucked (n = 9) were collected from 28 sows to investigate whether initial microbial colonisation occurs pre- or post-partum and how it develops during the first 24 h post-partum. To examine this, DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA amplicon analysis was performed to allow analysis of microbial communities. The results indicate that microbial colonisation of the spiral colon had occurred in stillborn pigs, suggesting microbial exposure prior to birth. Alpha diversity metrics indicated that the number of taxa and community richness were higher in piglets that sucked (p < 0.001) and community evenness was lower in stillborns in comparison to born-alive (p < 0.001) but was not affected by colostrum consumption (p < 0.001). Additionally, when compared with stillborn piglets, the bacteria colonising the spiral colon during the first 24 h post-partum included the potentially pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium celatum, and potentially beneficial bacteria Lactobacillus reutueri and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. The relative presence of Archaea was high in stillborn piglets but decreased with post-natal environmental exposure. It is evident that stillborn piglets have bacteria present within their spiral colon, however further studies are needed in order to determine the time at which colonisation is initiated and the mechanisms determining how colonisation occurs. Additionally, as expected, the immediate post-natal environment largely influences the microorganisms colonising, while colostrum consumption further contributes to the microbial community enrichment.

AB  - Climate change intensifies, so does the need to reduce carbon emissions to achieve the goal of being "carbon neutral" for China. This paper focuses on carbon emission prediction and constructs a comprehensive model integrating least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), principal component analysis (PCA), support vector regression (SVR), and differential evolution-gray wolf optimization (DE-GWO). Firstly, LASSO is used for feature selection, and important information is extracted from various influencing factors to find out what have a great impact on carbon emission. Principal component analysis is used to extract the features of the remaining variables to avoid missing information caused by feature selection. Secondly, DE-GWO algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of SVR to improve the prediction accuracy. The scenario analysis and prediction algorithm are combined to predict China's carbon emissions. The results show that (1) coal and oil consumption, plate glass, pig iron, and crude steel production are important factors affecting carbon emissions; (2) the use of PCA to comprehensively consider the impact of remaining factors on carbon emissions has a positive influence on carbon emissions prediction; and (3) DE-GWO optimized SVR has higher prediction accuracy than other algorithms.

AB  - The Anthropocene's human-dominated habitat expansion endangers global biodiversity. However, large mammalian herbivores experienced few extinctions during the 20th century, hinting at potentially overlooked ecological responses of a group sensitive to global change. Using dental microwear as a proxy, we studied large herbivore dietary niches over a century across mainland China before (1880s-1910s) and after (1970s-1990s) the human population explosion. We uncovered widespread and significant shifts (interspecific microwear differences increased and intraspecific microwear dispersion expanded) within dietary niches linked to geographical areas with rapid industrialization and population growth in eastern China. By contrast, in western China, where human population growth was slower, we found no indications of shifts in herbivore dietary niches. Further regression analysis links the intensity of microwear changes to human land-use expansion. These analyses highlight dietary adjustments of large herbivores as a likely key factor in their adaptation across a century of large-scale human-driven changes.
   The study examined dietary shifts in Chinese large mammalian herbivores during the Anthropocene period using dental microwear as a proxy. The researchers found widespread and significant shifts in dietary niches, particularly in areas with rapid industrialization and population growth in eastern China. These shifts were linked to human land-use expansion. The study highlights the importance of dietary shifts in the adaptation of large herbivores to a changing world influenced by human activities.image

AB  - Plant-soil interactions have bottom-up and top-down effects within a plant community. Heavy metal pollution can change plant-soil interactions, directly influence bottom-up effects and indirectly affect herbivores within the community. In turn, herbivores can affect plant-soil interactions through top-down effects. However, the combined effects of heavy metals and herbivores on soil enzymes, plants and herbivores have rarely been reported. Therefore, the effects of lead (Pb), Spodoptera litura and their combined effects on soil enzyme activities, pakchoi nutrition, defence compounds and S. litura fitness were examined here. Results showed that Pb, S. litura and their combined effects significantly affected soil enzymes, pakchoi and S. litura. Specifically, exposure to double stress (Pb and S. litura) decreased soil urease, phosphatase and sucrase activities compared with controls. Furthermore, the soluble protein and sugar contents of pakchoi decreased, and the trypsin inhibitor content and antioxidant enzyme activity increased. Finally, the S. litura development period was extended, and survival, emergence rates and body weight decreased after exposure to double stress. The combined stress of Pb and S. litura significantly decreased soil enzyme activities. Heavy metal accumulation in plants may create a superposition or synergistic effect with heavy metal-mediated plant chemical defence, further suppressing herbivore development. Pb, S. litura and their combined effects inhibited soil enzyme activities, improved pakchoi resistance and reduced S. litura development. The results reveal details of soil-plant-herbivore interactions and provide a reference for crop pest control management in the presence of heavy metal pollution.

AB  - Background The establishment of non-native populations of threatened and legally protected species can have many implications for the areas where these species have been introduced. Non-native populations of threatened species have the potential to be exploited and therefore the subject of legal protection, while conversely, if they have become invasive in their introduced range, there is the likelihood that population control will be carried out to reduce abundance and negative impacts associated with introduced species. From both a legal and invasive species monitoring standpoint, it is important to know how many individuals are present. Methods and results Short tandem repeats (STRs) were developed for the hog deer, an endangered species that was introduced following European settlement to Victoria, Australia using Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology. These markers were combined with previous STRs characterised for hog deer to create a 29-plex identification system. A total of 224 samples were genotyped across the population in Victoria, and further analyses of null allele frequencies, deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and the removal of monomorphic or low amplifying markers resulted in a final marker panel of 15 loci. Despite low values for number of alleles at each locus (2-4), probability of identity showed sufficient discrimination power, with an average probability of identity at 2.94 x 10(-6), and a probability of sibling identity of 8.9 x 10(-4) across all sites. Conclusions It is feasible to create an informative DNA profiling system that can distinguish between individuals for applications in both wildlife forensic and population control research.

TI  - Olfactory misinformation provides refuge to palatable plants from mammalian browsing
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
LA  - English
KW  - HERBIVORE
AB  - Mammalian herbivores browse palatable plants of ecological and economical value. Undesirable neighbours can reduce browsing to these plants by providing 'associational refuge', but they can also compete for resources. Here we recreated the informative odour emitted by undesirable plants. We then tested whether this odour could act as virtual neighbours, providing browsing refuge to palatable eucalyptus tree seedlings. We found that protection using this method was equivalent to protection provided by real plants. Palatable seedlings were 17-20 times more likely to be eaten by herbivores without virtual, or real, neighbours. Because many herbivores use plant odour to forage, virtual neighbours could provide a useful practical management approach to help protect valued plants.
   Unpalatable plants can deter herbivory on palatable plants grown in the same vicinity, but managing unwanted herbivory by planting unpalatable plants is not time- or cost-effective. This paper shows that artificial odour, designed to mimic the informative volatile compounds of unpalatable plants, can deter herbivory on the target plants, offering a potentially useful management strategy

AB  - Populations must continuously respond to environmental change or risk extinction. These responses can be measured as phenotypic rates of change, which allow researchers to predict their contemporary evolutionary responses. In 1999, a database of phenotypic rates of change in wild populations was compiled. Since then, researchers have used (and expanded) this database to examine the phenotypic responses as a function of the features of the study system (i.e., the population or set of populations, of a given species, that experienced a specific driver or disturbance), the measured traits, and methodological approaches. Therefore, PROCEED (Phenotypic Rates of Change Evolutionary and Ecological Database) is an ongoing compilation of rates of phenotypic change, typically calculated as Haldanes and Darwins, published in peer-reviewed literature (but also including data from theses and technical reports). Studies in this database measure the intraspecific change in quantitative (continuous or discrete) traits and report either the time elapsed from the onset of environmental novelty, or reference a historical or biological event reported in other sources (e.g., a mine opening or a well-documented biological invasion). Included studies either follow a single population through time (allochronic design) or compare two or more populations that diverged at a known time (synchronic design). Some included studies account for the total phenotypic variability in the field (i.e., phenotypic studies), while others employed common-garden or other quantitative genetic approaches to account for the heritable component of the phenotypic change (i.e., genetic studies). PROCEED includes systems in both natural and experimental conditions, provided that reproduction was not manipulated (i.e., artificial selection experiments were excluded). In the included experimental systems, the environment of the focal populations was manipulated (e.g., an herbivory exclusion experiment, where the type and load of herbivory are manipulated) but the studies did not deliberately select for trait values in the study population (e.g., the plant height). PROCEED does not include systems where the phenotypic change is presumably due to interspecific hybridization, polyploidy, or other chromosomal alterations. Here, we present the most recently updated PROCEED (Version 6.1). This new, curated version has 9263 records (n) collated from 326 studies, 1801 systems, and 428 species. The database includes records belonging to mammals (n = 686), birds (n = 1475), reptiles (n = 96), amphibians (n = 23), fishes (n = 3671), invertebrates (n = 1141, mostly arthropods), and plants (n = 2171). The maximum elapsed time between the environmental change and the sampling is 500 years but is typically less than 100 years (third quartile 89.5; median 45 years). The database also includes a set of variables describing biological and methodological aspects of the study system and measured traits, along with features of the sampling design in the primary source of information. This new version of PROCEED also includes a time series dataset comprising a subset of records included in the general dataset. These are allochronic studies with three or more sampling times throughout the entire study period. The time series dataset contains 655 time series (s)-belonging to 61 studies, from 156 systems, and 77 species-including mammals (s = 140), birds (s = 77), reptiles (s = 4), amphibians (s = 8), fishes (s = 404), and plants (s = 22). The data are released under a Creative Commons CC0 1.

AB  - To date, research on the welfare impacts of wildlife contraceptives has mostly been focused on the potential harms of contraceptives. However, there are compelling theoretical reasons to expect direct and indirect welfare benefits of wildlife contraceptives. These positive welfare effects would be experienced by more than just the treated individuals, because per capita resource availability will increase with decreasing numbers of individuals sharing a resource. In the present article, we discuss the potential for wildlife contraceptives to alleviate resource competition and their associated negative welfare effects at different scales. These effects are expected to vary across contexts and would presumably be stronger when wildlife contraceptives are used with the explicit purpose of improving wild animal welfare. The potential for considerable welfare gains for wildlife through the targeted use of contraceptives highlights the importance of both species-specific studies on the welfare benefits of wildlife contraceptives and further research on the links between population dynamics and wild animal welfare.

AB  - The occurrence of Dalbergia obovata, which is typically associated with forests, in grasslands within conservation areas in a metropolitan municipality was investigated to assess whether it was encroaching and what the possible causes might be. Relevant legislation has not regarded D. obovata as an encroacher species in grasslands. The abundance and distribution patterns of D. obovata in four conservation areas were mapped in the field and captured as GIS layers to facilitate calculation of the proportion of each grassland area deemed to have been encroached over two decades. Management records for 17 conservation areas were analysed to determine whether there were associations between different management practices and D. obovata encroachment. We found that more than one third of grasslands present in 1999 were lost to encroachment by D. obovata and that some grassland areas were almost completely (99%) encroached. Results of a Chi-squared test and principal components analysis of management records indicated that the absence of large herbivores was significantly associated with D. obovata encroachment into grasslands. We conclude that D. obovata should be listed as a woody encroacher species and that some conventional management practises applied to control woody encroachers, such as the use of fire, are ineffective against D. obovata.

Yaks have long inhabited high-altitude hypoxic environments and do not exhibit fibrotic damage under chronic hypoxia. However, the underlying protective mechanisms remain unclear. This study compared the renal tissue structure and collagen volume between low-altitude cattle and high-altitude yaks, revealing that yaks possess a significantly higher number of renal tubules than cattle, though collagen volume showed no significant difference. Under hypoxic treatment, we observed that chronic hypoxia induced renal fibrosis in cattle, but did not show a significant effect in yaks, suggesting that the hypoxia adaptation mechanisms in yaks may have an anti-fibrotic effect. Further investigation demonstrated a significant upregulation of P-AMPK/AMPK, Parkin, PINK1, LC3II/I, and BECN1, alongside a downregulation of P-mTOR/mTOR in yak kidneys. Additionally, hypoxia-induced renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) showed increased expression of mitophagy-related proteins, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and an increased number of lysosomes, indicating that hypoxia induces mitophagy. By regulating the mitophagy pathway through drugs, we found that under chronic hypoxia, activation of mitophagy upregulated E-cadherin protein expression while downregulating the expression of Vimentin, alpha-SMA, Collagen I, and Fibronectin. Simultaneously, there was an increase in SLC7A11, GPX4, and GSH levels, and a decrease in ROS, MDA, and Fe2(+) accumulation. Inhibition of mitophagy produced opposite effects on protein expression and cellular markers. Further studies identified ferroptosis as a key mechanism promoting renal fibrosis. Moreover, in renal fibrosis models, mitophagy reduced the accumulation of ROS, MDA, and Fe2(+), thereby alleviating ferroptosis-induced renal fibrosis. These findings suggest that chronic hypoxia protects yaks from hypoxia-induced renal fibrosis by activating mitophagy to inhibit the ferroptosis pathway.

AB  - Atlantic salmon is an important aquaculture species that has fascinated naturalists for centuries, resulting in its biology being widely characterized. Certain details about the early development and the inheritance of meristic variation in the post-cranial axial skeleton are, however, largely unexplored. The present study gives a detailed description of the sequence of formation of the post-cranial axial skeleton based on whole-mount staining and used radiology to investigate the inheritance of meristic variation in isogenic hybrid all-male families of Atlantic salmon (similar to 4 kg). Eight different families were created by crossing two homozygous double haploid XX females (dam A, B) with four different double haploid homozygous YY super males (sires a to d). In the caudal fin complex, the first bone to form is hypural 1 and its associated lepidotrichia followed by a bidirectional formation of new bones. In the dorsal and anal fins, development starts in the cranial part, and new bones form bidirectionally towards the head and tail fin. The neural and haemal arches start to form at segment 43, and further development is bidirectional. The first parapophysis form in the caudal part of the abdomen followed by a unidirectional completion cranially. The first ribs form at segment 3 and new ribs develop unidirectional caudally. Chordacentra formation starts at segment 24 followed by formation of chordacentrum number 58 (caudal-most vertebra). New chordacentrae form bidirectionally from segment 24 in parallel with the formation of chordacentrum number 57. The first epineuralia form at segment 1 followed by a unidirectional completion caudally until segment 30. The first supraneuralia to develop is number 10 closely followed by number 1, then new supraneurals form bidirectionally from number 10. Analysis of the inheritance on the post-cranial axial skeletal bones showed a strong maternal effect on total vertebrae centra and tail fin lepidotrichia counts. For these skeletal counts, dam A produced offspring with modes of 58 and 45 respectively, while dam B produced offspring with modes of 59 and 42. The higher number of total vertebrae centra produced by dam B was associated with additional abdominal and/or transitional vertebrae. The completion of formation in different post-cranial axial skeletal parts are either bi- or unidirectional, and the initiation of formation is site specific for each skeletal part with some inter-part similarities. Further, the present results may suggest that there has been a maternally driven selection for more abdominal vertebrae associated with a higher number of total vertebrae, and more tail fin lepidotrichia associated with a lower number of total vertebrae. These changing meristic counts may impact on important fitness-related traits, such as fecundity and swimming ability, making the present findings relevant for both ecological and aquaculture sciences.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is heterogeneously distributed in the environment and multiple sources like Pb ammunition and fossil fuel combustion can increase the risk of exposure in wildlife. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Sweden have higher blood Pb levels compared to bears from other populations, but the sources and routes of exposure are unknown. The objective of this study was to quantify the contribution of two potential sources of Pb exposure in female brown bears (n = 34 individuals; n = 61 samples). We used multiple linear regressions to determine the contribution of both environmental Pb levels estimated from plant roots and moose (Alces alces) kills to blood Pb concentrations in female brown bears. We found positive relationships between blood Pb concentrations in bears and both the distribution of moose kills by hunters and environmental Pb levels around capture locations. Our results suggest that the consumption of slaughter remains discarded by moose hunters is a likely significant pathway of Pb exposure and this exposure is additive to environmental Pb exposure in female brown bears in Sweden. We suggest that spatially explicit models, incorporating habitat selection analyses of harvest data, may prove useful in predicting Pb exposure in scavengers.

AB  - Mixed stands of Norway spruce and birch have the potential to simultaneously produce timber and provide large ungulates with a significant amount of forage during the regeneration phase. While the growth and yield of such mixtures are well studied, little is known about potential trade-offs between timber and forage production and which management techniques are suitable for meeting both goals. In this study, four different pre-commercial thinning (PCT) strategies were used to study the trade-offs between production and available forage for free-ranging ungulates in a Norway spruce-birch mixture. The four PCT strategies were: 1) retaining 2000 birch stems ha(-1) with 2000 Norway spruce ha(-1), 2) removing all birches within a 0.75 m radius around Norway spruce stems, 3) removing all birches and other broadleaves, and 4) no PCT (control). Growth of Norway spruce was higher in the 2000 birch ha(-1) and full removal treatments compared to the untreated control, but these two treatments did not differ from one another in volume production of Norway spruce. We found a negative effect of PCT on forage availability but no effect on ungulate browsing. Therefore, PCT strategies that provide both sufficient birch forage and maximize volume production of Norway spruce can be implemented.

AB  - Simple Summary The aphid Aphis gossypii Glover is a serious pest that inflicts severe damage upon goji berry plants in China. The current prevailing approach to pest prevention involves the utilization of chemical insecticides, which presents potential risks to both human health and the environment. The improper use of pesticides leads to the emergence of drug-resistant pests, thereby contributing to the resurgence of rampant pest populations. Therefore, the conservation and management of predators in agricultural ecosystems should receive increased attention, given their crucial role. Ladybirds have previously been identified as the primary predators of aphid species. However, their effectiveness as biological agents against aphids on goji berry plants remains uncertain. We found that the potential of ladybirds in controlling the aphid populations is promising, thus possibly making a contribution to environmental protection. By conducting an analysis of functional responses, intraspecific competition, and a semi-field study, we have determined that H. axyridis and C. septempunctata exhibit greater potential as biocontrol agents against aphids in comparison to H. variegata. Notably, future field studies will play a pivotal role in ensuring the effective implementation of a biological control program.Abstract The aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, is identified as a significant pest that causes severe damage to goji berries in China. To analyze the ladybird consumption of aphids, the functional responses of three ladybird species, Harmonia axyridis, Coccinella septempunctata, and Hippodamia variegata, and intraspecific competition among ladybird individuals were evaluated under laboratory conditions. Moreover, the practical impact of ladybirds on aphid population reduction was investigated in semi-field conditions. We found that all adult ladybirds of the three species exhibited a type II functional response toward aphids. According to Holling's disc equation, H. axyridis exhibited the highest searching efficiency (a = 0.79), while C. septempunctata had the shortest handling time (Th = 5.07 min) among the three ladybird species studied. Additionally, intraspecific competition had a greater impact on H. variegata (m = 0.41) compared to the other two ladybird species. The semi-field study demonstrated that H. axyridis (83.9% reduction) and C. septempunctata (78.7% reduction) exhibited higher efficacy in reducing aphid populations compared to H. variegata (27.3% reduction). This study suggests that H. axyridis and C. septempunctata exhibit potential as effective biological control agents against aphids on goji berry plants and highlights the importance of considering intraspecific competition. However, the results obtained from laboratory and semi-field studies cannot be directly extrapolated to field conditions due to the simplification of these experimental systems. Future field studies are crucial in ensuring the effective implementation of a biological control program.

AB  - Conserving terrestrial megafauna presents distinct challenges to policymakers. Despite decades of evolving regulatory measures, wild rhinoceros populations remain threatened by illegal killing to acquire rhino horn, a valuable commodity in East Asian markets. In Africa, rhino conservation performance has varied with geography and over time. This research draws on institutional economic theories to seek plausible explanations for such variable conservation outcomes. Such theories suggest that institutional variables such as property rights profoundly influence human behaviour, leading to hypotheses that we test using comparative institutional analytic methods. Our inquiry affirms that blanket trade restrictions do not account for local conservation success and that other institutional factors appear more relevant. We find that positive overall conservation outcomes correlate with greater institutional diversity within countries, notably those that enable non -state actors to play a meaningful role in rhino management. Our research further suggests that strengthening institutions through decentralization is a sensible conservation strategy for rhinos. However, a specific case study of the economics of white rhino ownership in South Africa reveals that this approach is not considered a panacea for conservation as it raises concerns over potential domestication. We conclude with recommendations for policy -notably, to avoid recentralization -and further research.

AB  - Information on the distribution and abundance of marine birds is needed to evaluate current status in relation to threats from potential increases in vessel traffic off southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia (BC), Canada, in the Salish Sea. We conducted year-round boatbased surveys in waters between Sidney, BC and Victoria, BC from November 2015 to August 2019 and examined seasonal variation in bird distribution and abundance. Our study area included parts of the Sidney Channel Important Bird Area, the Shoal Harbour and Victoria Harbour Migratory Bird Sanctuaries, and the Chain Islets Ecological Reserve, adjacent to major shipping lanes, as well as ports and marinas. With the approval for the proposed expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline to Burnaby, BC, tanker traffic is expected to increase in our study area. Increases in several categories of marine vessel traffic have occurred recently in the Salish Sea and are expected to increase further with the development of Liquefied Natural Gas projects and the Delta Port expansion on Roberts Bank. Within that context, we counted all marine birds but focused primarily on alcids: Rhinoceros Auklet Cerorhinca monocerata, Common Murre Uria aalge, Pigeon Guillemot Cepphus columba, Marbled Murrelet Brachyramphus marmoratus, and Ancient Murrelet Synthliboramphus antiquus. Alcids were present year-round but showed species-specific seasonal spatial patterns. These patterns are likely related to seabird annual cycles as well as fluctuations in forage fish prey populations, their habitats, and variation in seasonal availability to birds. Increasingly busy shipping lanes for tanker, cargo, and passenger vessels pass nearby and through our study area. These shipping lanes, together with traffic from tugs, fishing vessels, and recreational motor and sailing vessels, plus the many marinas and terminals in the area, pose significant risks to marine birds.

AB  - The implementation of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) concepts has been pointed out as an indirect strategy that could potentially help mitigating the environmental impacts of livestock production systems. To date, few studies have focused on analyzing specifically the relationship among PLF adoption and environmental performance, so sustainability benefits have not yet been quantified for many technologies. Moreover, studies evaluating the environmental impact of dairy production have traditionally focused on cattle, and when exploring sheep or goats, they have often involved extensive, low-productive systems, providing an incomplete picture of the sector. In this study we apply life cycle assessment (LCA) to analyze the environmental impact associated to intensive dairy goat production, and to explore the influence of adopting a smart-farming PLF platform on the environmental performance of a group of dairy goat farms in Spain. The PLF-platform relies on systematic on-farm monitoring of individual animal data, coupled with big data processing and interpretation, which supports farmers to take adequate -and timely-farm management decisions. In order to capture its influence, two different periods were analyzed in five selected farms: a baseline year just before innovation was implemented (2014) and four years after (2018), when most of the effect of improved management was reflected. Results after the PLF-platform implementation showed significant reductions (-11%) in greenhouse gas emissions and similar trends in other impact categories (9-16% reductions). The PLF platform provided a precise monitoring of the productivity, genetic merit and physiological state of each animal, allowing adequate criteria for a number of decision-making processes, such as selecting animals for breeding, replacement or culling. This optimization led to an increase in the genetic selection progress, ultimately reflected on milk productivity. Moreover, a reduction of unproductive periods such as first partum age or dry period length was often achieved. As a result of this general improvement, the efficiency of resource usage in relation to milk (and meat) production was increased, with positive effect on the environmental performance. Production of 1 kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) resulted in 1.53-1.71 kg CO2 eq. Results in other impacts categories were also in a similar range than previously reported values for highly productive dairy systems, including dairy cattle, which stresses the important role that small ruminant farming can play on environmentally sustainable livestock production, particularly in the Mediterranean context.

AB  - Homeothermic mammals can assert equilibrium in heat production and heat exchange with the ambient environment to maintain their body temperature through modification of physiology and behavior. However, the newborn piglets do not possess a well-developed thermoregulatory center resulting in a welfare issue, that is, piglet mortality due to hypothermia. Therefore, the present study was aimed to evaluate the early life welfare crisis of thermal adaptability of neonatal piglets. For this purpose, 127 newborn piglets were selected immediately after their birth. Rectal temperature (RT), which represents the core temperature of the neonate piglets, was recorded for three consecutive days from the second day of the birth. The first-day recording was avoided to minimize the disturbance of the farrowing mother. The RT was recorded for three days (second, third, and fourth day) at 0600, 0800, 1000, 1200, 1400, and 1600 hours of the day. Concurrently, the ambient temperature and relative humidity were recorded. The average RT increased significantly (P < 0.01) as the neonatal piglets became older. The cosinor analysis demonstrated significant (P < 0.01) rhythmicity in RT of daytime on all three days. Furthermore, the gradual reduction of acrophase value indicated the gradual gaining of thermal control of neonates. The daytime RT of neonates was positively (P < 0.01) correlated with the ambient temperature (r(2) = 0.301). The results indicated that the RT of neonatal piglets in the early days of life was modified as per the ambient temperature and their thermoregulatory system gradually developed as age increased.

AB  - Simple Summary: Wildfires are increasing in frequency and severity across the Western United States. Efforts to understand the health impacts on humans are widespread and expanding; however, very little is known about the impact of wildfires and smoke exposure on livestock. This work presents the results of a survey of cattle, sheep, and goat producers in California, Oregon, and Nevada, on their experiences during the 2020 wildfire season. While few direct impacts of fires were reported among the 70 responses, 26% of respondents reported they had to evacuate livestock and 19% reported pasture losses. Indirect losses from smoke exposure, including pneumonia and reproductive losses were reported more broadly. This preliminary work highlights the need to better understand impacts of wildfires on livestock and how policy changes can help support the livestock production industry through these crises.Wildfires are increasing in frequency and severity across the Western United States. However, there is limited information available on the impacts these fires are having on the livelihood of livestock producers and their animals. This work presents the results of a survey evaluating the direct and indirect impacts of the 2020 wildfire season on beef cattle, dairy cattle, sheep, and goat, producers in California, Oregon, and Nevada. Seventy completed surveys were collected between May and July 2021. While dairy producers reported no direct impacts from the fires, beef, sheep, and goat producers were impacted by evacuations and pasture lost to fires. Only beef producers reported losses due to burns and burn-associated deaths or euthanasia. Dairy, beef, sheep, and goat producers observed reduced conception, poor weight gain, and drops in milk production. All but dairy producers also observed pneumonia. Lower birthweights, increased abortion rates, and unexplained deaths were reported in beef cattle, sheep, and goats. This work documents the wide-ranging impacts of wildfires on livestock producers and highlights the need for additional work defining the health impacts of fire and smoke exposure in livestock, as well as the policy changes needed to support producers experiencing direct and indirect losses.

AB  - Seahorses (genus Hippocampus Rafinesque, 1810) are a group of bony fish distributed in warm and temperate marine waters around the world. Currently they are under anthropogenic pressure derived from the destruction and modification of the habitat, as well as its commercial exploitation for food, medicine (especially in Asia) and aquaculture, which has led to a drastic decrease in wild populations. In Mexico, four species of seahorses are distributed (H. erectus, H. ingens, H. reidi, H. zosterae), however, there is still a lack of knowledge relating biologicalecological aspects. Although they are protected by national and international regulations, wildlife populations are affected by incidental fishing (mainly by shrimp and scale fish industry) and furtive fishing. This review describes information regarding biological and population parameters, exploitation, commercialization, and uses of the four Hippocampus species present in Mexico. The ultimate purpose is to establish the bases for future conservation programs focused on these fish.

AB  - Simple Summary The Yunnan snub-nosed monkey is one of the most endangered species on the IUCN Red List. The study of its population and habitat quality is important in identifying opportunities for balancing socio-economic development against species conservation in the area's villages. Such balances are important to protecting and improving habitat diversity and biodiversity. Our habitat quality analysis indicates that increases in socio-economic developments in the villages around the habitat area have decreased both the habitat area and the habitat quality over time. This has resulted in a decline in biodiversity persistence, resilience, and breadth. It also has exacerbated the risk of declining species populations, potentially to extinction. Though focused on the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey, our approach toward the assessment of habitat quality based on species habitat suitability introduces a new perspective for assessing village development impacts on the habitat quality for the conservation of other species. The habitats of the already endangered Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) are degrading as village economies develop in and around these habitat areas, increasing the depopulation and biodiversity risk of the monkey. The paper aims to show the areas of these monkeys' high-quality habitats that are at highest risk of degradation by continued village development and hence be the focus of conservation efforts. Our analysis leveraged multiple tools, including primary component analysis, the InVEST Habitat-Quality model, and GIS spatial analysis. We enhanced our analysis by looking at habitat quality as it relates to the habitat suitability for the monkey specifically, instead of general habitat quality. We also focused on the impact of the smallest administrative scale in China-the village. These foci produced a clearer picture of the monkeys' and villages' situations, allowing for more targeted discussions on win-win solutions for both the monkeys and the village inhabitants. The results show that the northern habitat for the monkey is currently higher quality than the southern habitat, and correspondingly, the village development in the north is lower than in the south. Hence, we recommend conservation efforts be focused on the northern areas, though we also encourage the southern habitats to be protected from further degradation lest they degrade beyond the point of supporting any monkeys. We encourage developing a strategy that balances ecological protection and economic development in the northern region, a long-term plan for the southern region to reduce human disturbance, increase effective habitat restoration, and improve corridor design.

AB  - Simple Summary As a domestic animal living in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at high altitudes from 2000 to 5000 m, the growth rate of the yak is slow under extremely harsh natural environmental conditions, such as high altitude, low temperatures, and low oxygen. Compared with conventional selection, using molecular markers in breeding to improve yak growth traits is more efficient. Many studies have indicated that CNV mutations can significantly affect the phenotypic traits of livestock and poultry. This study explored the association between the growth traits and CNVs of SOX5 and SOX8 in 326 Ashidan yaks. Our results showed that CNVs and the CNV combination of SOX5 and SOX8 were significantly associated with withers height and chest girth (p < 0.05), suggesting these mutations could be new markers for the selection of yak growth traits. Copy number variation (CNV) is a structural variant with significant impact on genetic diversity. CNV has been widely used in breeding for growth traits, meat production or quality, and coat color. SRY-like box genes (SOXs) are a class of transcription factors that play a regulatory role in cell fate specification and differentiation. SOX5 and SOX8 belong to subgroups D and E of the SOXs, respectively. Previous studies have shown that SOX5 and SOX8 are essential in the development of bones. In this study, we explored the association between the growth traits and CNVs of SOX5 and SOX8 in 326 Ashidan yaks and detected mRNA expression levels in different tissues. Our results illustrated that CNVs of SOX5 and SOX8 were significantly associated with withers height at 18 months of age and chest girth at 30 months of age (p < 0.05). The CNV combination of SOX5 and SOX8 was significantly associated with withers height at 18 months of age (p < 0.01). SOX5 expression in the lung was significantly higher than in the heart, spleen, kidney, and muscle (p < 0.05). SOX8 expression in the lung was significantly higher than in the liver and muscle (p < 0.05). Our results provide evidence that the CNVs of SOX5 and SOX8 genes could be used as new markers for the selection of yak growth traits.

AB  - Simple Summary Cattle-yak is an excellent hybrid of male cattle and female yak, which has many more outstanding production traits, such as better adaptability to high altitudes and better meat quality. However, the male sterility of cattle-yak restricts the utilization of superior heterosis. Few studies have focused on the comprehensive analysis of cattle-yak and its parents, in order to find factors on infertility of the cattle-yak. This study comprehensively analyzed the mRNA and lncRNA expression profiles of testicular tissue samples of cattle, yak, and cattle-yak by RNA-seq technology, and identified some differentially expressed genes that may be related to male sterility of cattle-yak, in order to provide a theoretical basis for solving the problem of breeding work. Cattle-yak is an excellent hybrid of cattle and yak; they are characterized by better meat quality and stronger adaptability of harsh environments than their parents. However, male sterility of cattle-yak lay restraints on the transmission of heterosis. In this study, next generation sequence technology was performed to profile the testicular tissues transcriptome (lncRNA and mRNA) of cattle, yak, and cattle-yak. We analyzed the features and functions of significant differentially expressed genes among the three breeds. There are 9 DE lncRNAs and 46 DE mRNAs with comparisons of cattle, yak, and cattle-yak. Among them, the upregulated targeting genes, such as IGF1 and VGLL3 of cattle-yak lncRNA, may be related to the derangement of spermatocyte maturation and cell proliferation. Similarly, we found that the LDOC1 gene, which is related to the process of cellular apoptosis, is overexpressed in cattle-yak. GO enrichment analysis demonstrated that the cattle-yak is lacking the regulation of fertilization (GO: 0009566), spermatogenesis process (GO: 0007283), male gamete generation process (GO: 0048232), sexual reproduction (GO: 0019953), and multi-organism reproductive process (GO: 0044703), such processes may play important and positive roles in spermatogenesis and fertilization. Furthermore, the KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the upregulated DEGs of cattle-yak most enriched in Apoptosis (ko04210) and Hippo signaling pathway (ko04390), may lead to excessively dead of cell and inhibit cell growth, resulting in obstruction of meiosis and spermatogenesis processes. This study will enable us to deeper understand the mechanism of male cattle-yak infertility.

AB  - With the popularization and application of biogas engineering, byproduct biogas slurry has excellent application potential as organic liquid fertilizer, while its source and application rate significantly affect its effect. Irrational application of biogas slurry, can reduce crop yields and cause environmental problems such as soil salinization and diffuse source pollution. In this study, the impact of different types of biogas slurry from various materials (i.e., pig manure, chicken manure, vinasse, and kitchen waste) and their required application rates on the growth and incidence of cucumber were investigated by analyzing the dry weight of cucumber, soil chemical properties, soil extracellular enzyme activity, and the incidence of cucumber wilt disease. The results showed that the effects of the four selected types of biogas slurry on cucumber growth and disease were similar. It was shown that 3% was the most suitable application rate considering the dry weight of cucumber plants and the incidence of wilt disease. At this application rate, it was achievable to increase soil pH, soil AN, AK, Olsen P content, and enzyme activities without increasing the risk of salinization. In summary, despite different sources, biogas slurry showed the best growth promotion and disease suppression ability in 3% (v/w) application, without the risk of soil salinization.

AB  - Eutrophication has been shown to increase production of nutritionally low-quality cyanobacteria and decrease the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content of seston. Contrarily, lake browning inhibits cyanobacteria contribution in seston and favours poorly grazable mixotrophic algal species. These environmental changes have probable impacts on the diet and long-chain PUFA content of primary consumers. However, herbivorous zooplankton may preferentially retain PUFAs through diet selection for optimal growth and reproduction, but such selective feeding is challenging to document in nature owing to the difficulties in quantifying zooplankton diet. Here, we sampled seston and herbivorous cladocerans (Daphnia sp. and Bosmina sp.) from lakes (n = 23) in Finland along eutrophication (total phosphorous) and browning gradients (dissolved organic carbon [DOC]). We analysed the fatty acid content of seston (mg FA/g POC [particular organic content]) and cladocerans (mg FA/g C), and estimated available and consumed diet biomass percentages with quantitative fatty acid signature analysis. Cladoceran diet preference was evaluated as the difference between consumed and available food sources, to understand if they preferentially retain high nutritional quality diet. Generally, lake chemistry and morphometry poorly explained seston and cladoceran long-chain PUFA contents. However, multiple linear models for shorter chain PUFAs (linoleic acid [LA] and alpha-linolenic acid [ALA]) performed better in explaining variation in the LA and ALA content of seston (20% and 11%) and cladocerans (36% and 46%, respectively). The factors most strongly and positively associated with the LA and ALA content of seston and cladocerans were phosphorus and DOC concentrations, respectively. Seston and cladoceran PUFA contents were clearly uncorrelated. In most of the sampled lakes, high-quality diet (i.e., diatoms and cryptomonads) was preferred by cladocerans and low-quality diet (cyanobacteria) was avoided. Lake chemistry poorly explained cladoceran diet preference, but high-quality preference was positively associated with lake average depth. In summary, our space-for-time study approach did not reveal that eutrophication or browning downgraded the seston nor cladoceran PUFA quality. We found no correlation with seston and cladoceran PUFA content, but a clear mismatch between available and consumed diet. Our results suggest a selective feeding strategy of cladocerans, possibly through foraging in high-quality algae patches or selective assimilation of PUFAs.

AB  - The use of spatial memory is well-documented in many animal species and has been shown to be critical for the emergence of spatial learning. Adaptive behaviors based on learning can emerge thanks to an interdependence between the acquisition of information over time and movement decisions. The study of how spatio-ecological knowledge is constructed throughout the life of an individual has not been carried out in a quantitative and comprehensive way, hindered by the lack of knowledge of the information an animal already has of its environment at the time monitoring begins. Identifying how animals use memory to make beneficial decisions is fundamental to developing a general theory of animal movement and space use. Here we propose several mobility models based on memory and perform hierarchical Bayesian inference on 11-month trajectories of 21 elk after they were released in a completely new environment. Almost all the observed animals exhibited preferential returns to previously visited patches, such that memory and random exploration phases occurred. Memory decay was mild or negligible over the study period. The fact that individual elk rapidly become used to a relatively small number of patches was consistent with the hypothesis that they seek places with predictable resources and reduced mortality risks such as predation.

AB  - Simple Summary Herbivorous insects and plants greatly affected each other's evolution due to their close interactions. This resulted in the development of a variety of adaptations on both sides. Through the need for protection against herbivorous insects, surfaces with lower attachment ability evolved in many plants. As a response, the attachment systems of insects have developed numerous specializations. Stick insects (Phasmatodea) have an attachment system, consisting of paired claws, arolium (attachment pad between the claws) and euplantulae (paired attachment pads on the tarsomeres), which is well adapted to different natural surfaces. We used measurements of pull-off and traction force in two species (Medauroidea extradentata and Sungaya inexpectata) representing the most common microstructures used for attachment within stick insects (nubby and smooth) to quantify the attachment ability of Phasmatodea on natural surfaces. Plant leaves with different surface properties (smooth, trichome-covered, hydrophilic and covered with crystalline waxes) were selected as substrates. Wax-crystal-covered fine-roughness substrates revealed the lowest, whereas strongly structured substrates showed the highest attachment performance among the stick insects studied. Removing the claws of the insects resulted in lower attachment ability on structured substrates. Furthermore, claw removal revealed that the attachment performance of the pads is less reduced by contaminating wax crystals in the species with nubby attachment structures. Long-lasting effects of the leaves on the attachment ability were briefly investigated, but not confirmed. Herbivorous insects and plants exemplify a longstanding antagonistic coevolution, resulting in the development of a variety of adaptations on both sides. Some plant surfaces evolved features that negatively influence the performance of the attachment systems of insects, which adapted accordingly as a response. Stick insects (Phasmatodea) have a well-adapted attachment system with paired claws, pretarsal arolium and tarsal euplantulae. We measured the attachment ability of Medauroidea extradentata with smooth surface on the euplantulae and Sungaya inexpectata with nubby microstructures of the euplantulae on different plant substrates, and their pull-off and traction forces were determined. These species represent the two most common euplantulae microstructures, which are also the main difference between their respective attachment systems. The measurements were performed on selected plant leaves with different properties (smooth, trichome-covered, hydrophilic and covered with crystalline waxes) representing different types among the high diversity of plant surfaces. Wax-crystal-covered substrates with fine roughness revealed the lowest, whereas strongly structured substrates showed the highest attachment ability of the Phasmatodea species studied. Removal of the claws caused lower attachment due to loss of mechanical interlocking. Interestingly, the two species showed significant differences without claws on wax-crystal-covered leaves, where the individuals with nubby euplantulae revealed stronger attachment. Long-lasting effects of the leaves on the attachment ability were briefly investigated, but not confirmed.

AB  - The Elephant Marsh lies on the floodplain of the lower Shire River, in southern Malawi. It is both a cultivated, seasonal floodplain and a wetland, characterised by a complex mosaic of meandering channels, marshland and shallow lakes. In 2016, the Marsh was granted RAMSAR status based on a series of supporting studies, including the modelling of eco-social options for managing its ecological condition. This paper describes two-dimensional (2-D) hydrodynamic modelling using RMA2, in support of this eco-social assessment. The hydraulic model was parameterised using mostly existing data but augmented with bathymetric channel and lake surveys. Calibration and verification used water level data from the hydrometric network for the period 1999 to 2009. Generally, observed water level time-series are well replicated in the model, but there are large discrepancies prior to this period. These are due to temporal changes in hydraulic controls, mainly sedimentation, but also breaching of an embankment at the downstream end of the Marsh. Selected hydraulic-habitat variables (based on daily hydrological time-series 1976 to 2009) provide the indictors of hydrological and hydraulic change used to inform a DRIFT eco-social assessment. The Marsh displays moderate flood attenuation characteristics, but the importance of this will likely increase under continued sedimentation and predicted climate futures, which include more severe storms. The 2-D modelling contributes to an improved understanding of the Marsh's hydraulic behaviour, particularly regarding anthropogenic influences since the early 1900s.

AB  - The outbreak of epidemics such as African swine fever has intensified the use of disinfectants in pig farms, resulting in an increasing residual concentration of disinfectants in environmental media; however, the high-frequency excessive use of disinfectants that damage pig farm manure anaerobic fermentation systems and their mechanisms has not attracted enough attention. Especially, the complex effects of residual disinfectants on anaerobic fermentation systems for pig manure remain poorly understood, thus impeding the application of disinfectants in practical anaerobic fermentation systems. Herein, we explored the effects of glutaraldehyde disinfectant on methane production, effluent physicochemical indices, and microbial communities in a fully automated methanogenic potential test system (AMPTSII). The results show that adding glutaraldehyde led to remarkable alterations in methane production, chemical oxygen demand (COD), volatile solids (VS), and polysaccharide and phosphorus concentrations. During the anaerobic process, the production of methane displayed a notable decrease of 5.0-98% in all glutaraldehyde treatments, and the trend was especially apparent for treatments containing high levels of glutaraldehyde. Comparisons of the effluent quality showed that in the presence of 0.002-0.04% glutaraldehyde, the COD and total phosphorus (TP) increased by 12-310% and 15-27%, respectively. Moreover, the addition of 0.01-0.08% glutaraldehyde decreased the ammonium (NH4+-N) concentration and VS degradation rate by 7.7-15% and 4.9-26.2%. Furthermore, microbiological analysis showed that the glutaraldehyde treatments had adverse effects on the microbial community. Notably, certain functional bacteria were restrained, as highlighted by the decreases in relative abundance and microbial diversity by 1.3-17% and 0.06-21%, respectively. This study provides a theoretical basis for the rational use of disinfectants in anaerobic fermentation systems.

AB  - Insecticide toxicity to insect herbivores has long been known to vary across different host plants; this phenomenon has been widely documented in both foliage-feeders and sap-feeders. Species-specific phytochemical content of hostplant tissues is assumed to determine the pattern of induction of insect enzymes that detoxify insecticides, but specific phytochemicals have rarely been linked to host plant-associated variation in pesticide toxicity. Moreover, no studies to date have examined the effects of nectar source identity and phytochemical composition on the toxicity of insecticides to pollinators. In this study, we compared LD50 values for the insecticide bifenthrin, a frequent contaminant of nectar and pollen in agroecosystems, in the western honey bee, Apis mellifera, consuming three phytochemically different monofloral honeys: Nyssa ogeche (tupelo), Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust), and Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat). We found that bifenthrin toxicity (LD50) values for honey bees across different honey diets is linked to their species-specific phytochemical content. The profiles of phenolic acids and flavonoids of buckwheat and locust honeys are richer than is the profile of tupelo honey, with buckwheat honey containing the highest total content of phytochemicals and associated with the highest bifenthrin LD50 in honey bees. The vector fitting in the ordination analysis revealed positive correlations between LD50 values and two honey phytochemical richness estimates, Chao1 and Abundance-based Coverage Estimator (ACE). These findings suggest unequal effects among different phytochemicals, consistent with the interpretation that certain compounds, including ones that are rare, may have a more pronounced effect in mitigating pesticide toxicity.

AB  - Assessing how bats respond to habitat attributes requires an integrative approach to reliably predict direct community-level effects. We focused on hipposiderid and pteropodid bats because of their diverse resource use patterns, body size ranges, and dispersal abilities. We combined an array of bat species-level characteristics with key forest stand characteristics that may covary with habitat use. Twelve stations were sampled in the Lomami and Yangambi landscapes, Democratic Republic of the Congo. We investigated whether species-level flight ability of bats and forest stand characteristics can affect bat commuting flights and community-level estimates of both species detection and habitat occupancy. We captured bats for 108 trap-nights. Three sampling events (early evening, middle of the night, and early morning) were replicated for each survey night. Hipposiderids showed an early evening flight peak, while flight activity of pteropodids was constant throughout the night, but increased around the middle of the night. Species capture probability decreased with higher wing loading in hipposiderids and was negatively correlated with higher wing aspect ratio in pteropodids. Forest occupancy of hipposiderids increased along the gradient towards waterways, while pteropodid occurrence was not directly linked to measured forest stand variables. This suggests a consequence of habitat patterns at larger spatial scales, which would need clarifying through additional data collection. We discuss these findings in terms of resource-use strategies of clutter-tolerant and clutter-intolerant species. We argue that the occurrence of specific bat species and their habitat use patterns can serve as surrogate measures of ecosystem health.

AB  - Although the studies on antibiotic contamination are common at present, large-scale sampling studies drawing highly representative conclusions are still scarce. This study conducted a comprehensive investigation on a total of 1183 samples from 70 livestock farms within a sensitive area around reservoir waters. 45 types of antibiotics belonging to 5 different classes were monitored. This is the first analysis to comprehensively investigate the density distribution, source apportionment, ecological and health risk of antibiotics in an entire area of sensitive waters. The results showed that the layer manure samples had highest detection rate of antibiotics (0.0 %-96.1 %, average value = 30.7%) followed by pig manure samples. Oxytetracycline had the highest concentration of 712.16 mg/kg in a pig manure sample. Different from using antibiotic concentration as a proxy for pollution level, the spatial density was calculated by averaging antibiotic concentration to area and converting different livestock to pig equivalent. The spatial density of pig equivalent can more realistically reflect the pollution caused by different breeds of livestocks. It was shown that the pig farms contributed higher to total antibiotic density than the layer and cattle farms did. After assessed, a few antibiotics (oxytetracycline, chlorotetracycline and tetracycline) have posed high ecological risks to soil around the farms. However, none of them caused hazard quotient (HQ) risk and carcinogenic risk (CR) to human health in the water of reservoir. Children were more likely to be at hazard risk than adults. Antibiotic mass fluctuation rules were analyzed along the chain (feed - livestock waste - soil - surface water). Feed, livestock waste and soil had similar diversity, but the antibiotic concentrations continued to decline, implying the possible sources of antibiotic residues were similar. Thus, it is important to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use to prevent the potential long-term risk of antibiotics.

AB  - In this laboratory-scale study, the biological activities and vermicomposting potential of Eisenia fetida in pig manure were investigated to evaluate the influence of temperature (10 degrees C-50 degrees C) on vermicomposting effect. The enzyme activities of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in earthworm, macro-nutrients (N, P, K), total organic carbon (TOC), humification index (HIX) and C/N ratio in pig manure have been investigated simultaneously. Results revealed that CAT activity elevated initially and then declined with the increased temperature. The increased POD, SOD activity and MDA content indicated the antioxidant stress response of earthworm and the optimum temperature was found at 30 degrees C. After vermicomposting the pig manure for 60 d under temperature range of 10 degrees C-50 degrees C, the vermicompost exhibited a significant increase in macro-nutrients, whereas a reduction was observed in TOC, C/N ratio and HIX, reflecting the efficient decomposition of organic waste driven by earthworms and microorganisms synergistically. The result of total microbial population showed the increase of actinomycetes and bacterial population. The enhancement percentage was in the order: 30 degrees C > 40 degrees C > 50 degrees C > 20 degrees C > 10 degrees C, revealing the impact of temperature. The results indicated the advantage of vermicomposting with Eisenia fetida and the regulation mechanism of temperature on the vermicomposting effect of pig manure. The present study will benefit to the utilization of agricultural wastes and achieving environmental sustainability. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous bacterium, successfully exploiting a variety of environmental niches due to its remarkable metabolic versatility. The World Health Organization classifies P. aeruginosa as a "priority pathogen " due to its a great ability to overcome the action of antimicrobials, including carbapenems. Hitherto, most studies have focused on clinical settings from humans, but much less on animal and environmental settings, particularly on wildlife. In this work, we report the isolation of a carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain recovered from the faeces of a red deer adult female sampled in a humanized area. This isolate was obtained during a nationwide survey on antimicrobial resistance in wildlife aimed to determine the occurrence of carbapenem-resistant bacteria among 181 widely distributed wild ungulates. This P. aeruginosa isolate was found to be a high-risk clone, belonging to the sequence type (ST) 274. The genomic analysis of P. aeruginosa isolate UP4, classified this isolate as belonging to serogroup O3, which was also found to harbour the genes bla(PAO), bla(PDC-24), bla(OXA-486) (encoding resistance to beta-lactams), aph(3')-IIb (aminoglycosides resistance), fosA (fosfomycin resistance) and catB7 (chloramphenicol resis-tance). Antimicrobial susceptibility screening, according to EUCAST, showed resistance to imipenem and intermediate resistance to meropenem and doripenem. To our knowledge, this is the first description of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa in deer in Europe. Our results highlight the importance of wild ungulates either as victims of human activity or amplifiers of AMR, either way with potential impacts on animal, human and ecosystem health, since excretion of AMR bacteria might directly or indirectly contaminate other animals and the surrounding environment, perpetuating the spill-over and chain dissemination of AMR determinants.

AB  - Rugulopteryx okamurae is an invasive non-indigenous species (NIS) of marine alga present in the benthic communities of the Strait of Gibraltar, where it has colonized most of the coast triggering ecological, economic and social consequences. The purple sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus is a generalist herbivore with potential to provide resistance to this NIS. Two experiments were carried out to determine if (i) P. lividus consumes R. okamurae under laboratory conditions, (ii) to assess its grazing preferences when this NIS is offered together with the native Ulva sp. and (iii) to find biochemical tissue markers related to R. okamurae ingestion. In the first experiment, sea urchins fed with R. okamurae, Ulva sp. or both diets were evaluated in groups for two months. Ingestion, food preference, growth and survival were assessed. In the second one, the same specimens from the R. okamurae and mixed diets were used to analyse their individual preferences, ingestion rates, growth and fatty acid profiles during another two months. Ingestion rates showed that sea urchins accepted the NIS R. okamurae as food under laboratory conditions, increasing its intake after a long exposure period. The electivity values for R. okamurae also increased when P. lividus was exposed to this alga for a long time. Regarding the fatty acids profile of tissues, the results showed that intestinal arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4n-6) clearly differentiates sea urchins fed with R. okamurae from those fed with the mixed diet. ARA also appeared to be related to the feeding preferences, highlighting this fatty acid as a reliable marker of R. okamurae ingestion. Further research is needed in order to determine P. lividus feeding behaviour and its role as a biocontrol species in the areas invaded by R. okamurae.

AB  - This paper examines the role of cattle in the Roman economy acrossthe region of the river Rhine (the Netherlands, western and south-western Germany, eastern France, and northern and eastern Switzerland). This large region marked the northern frontier of the Roman Empire. Taxonomic data (over 606,000 animal remains - cattle, sheep/goat and pig) are considered, and biometrical data (nearly 15,000 cattle bone measurements) are analysed through the log-ratio - or LSI-technique, in order to look at broad changes in cattle husbandry over time (from the Late Iron Age to the Late Roman period) and across different regions. The results show the central role of cattle in the Roman economy in this frontier region, in the context of increased agricultural production and urban demand for meat and raw products, as well as the efforts put on improving and intensifying cattle husbandry.

AB  - Grasslands cover a substantial share of land area in the world and in Europe, where they are used to feed herbivores and provide a range of ecosystem services. Grasslands also help in animal health maintenance by hosting a diversity of plant species with antioxidant components. This animal health benefit has been under-researched. The aim of this study is to capture how farmers perceive links between grassland diversity and animal health, and to examine whether their perceptions are related to their farm and its structure. For that purpose, we conducted 103 surveys in three regions of France to collect farmers' perceptions regarding animal health, grassland diversity, and the link between the two. We then used factorial analysis of mixed data to study the relationship between the farmers' perceived links between grassland and animal health and their type of farm structure and management. For 61 farmers, there was a strong link between grassland diversity and animal health. However, we found no statistical relationship between the type of farm and the type of farmer-perceived link between grassland diversity and animal health, and the farmers who perceived a strong link employed a wide range of feeding systems. Further research is needed to deeply analyze farmers' practices and perceptions of grassland-health links.

AB  - Aim Genetic connectivity and diversity are key components of species' resilience to environmental change. However, the specific factors shaping species' resilience are poorly understood. We here aim to strengthen our understanding of resilience in two butterfly species, by identifying regions of high genetic diversity and barriers to dispersal. Location European Alps. Taxon Copper butterflies (Lycaena spp.). Methods We sampled 21 Lycaena hippothoe and 14 L. virgaureae populations with 18 individuals each in the European Alps. Using 14 and 9 microsatellite markers, respectively, we analysed genetic diversity and population structure (using arlequin, genalex, structure and snmf). We analysed spatial patterns of gene flow and genetic diversity (using an estimated effective migration surface), population demographic history and effective population size (diyabc), habitat suitability (maxent), and isolation by distance, and with resistance (genalex, circuitscape). Results We found higher genetic diversity and a more pronounced genetic structure in L. hippothoe than in L. virgaureae. Both species displayed a major genetic barrier in the central Alps. Western and eastern populations showed the highest genetic diversity in L. hippothoe, but central ones in L. virgaureae. Populations of both species were structured by geodetic distance, and minimum and maximum altitude. Main Conclusions The population genetic structure of both Copper butterflies seemed to be strongly affected by population history, demography and geographic features. Valleys and high mountain ridges seem to comprise major dispersal barriers. The high genetic diversity and pronounced population structure found in L. hippothoe seems to be related to a low dispersal ability and closed populations with high local abundances as opposed to L. virgaureae. We suggest that different conservation strategies are needed for these closely related species, focussing on connecting suitable habitats in L. hippothoe and increasing local population sizes in L. virgaureae.

AB  - Leh is a high-altitude district in the union territory of Ladakh. It is situated on the Indus river's bank and the high elevation of the mountains predominates the surrounding area. Very little information is available about the nematode fauna of these regions. Hence, a survey was conducted and soil samples were collected from agricultural fields of different localities of district Leh (Ladakh) to understand the diversity of soil and plant nematode fauna, to ascertain its current status and to study nematode communities. A total of 27 nematode genera were encountered during the present study. Among them, eleven belong to herbivores, six to bacterivores, four to predaceous, and three each belong to the fungivores and omnivores group. Helicotylenchus sp. was the most prevalent and dominating species in the overall nematode community. The herbivores trophic group was the most prevalent, whereas the bacterivores trophic group was more abundant and prominent in the population. This study showed that a significant variety of nematode fauna remains undiscovered, and it is vital to investigate the variety of beneficial and harmful nematodes in this area.

KW  - SCIENCE
AB  - The capacity of environmental impact assessment to adequately consider cumulative effects on Indigenous territories in Canada is limited by several deficiencies, including the problematic use of recent or current state as a baseline, adopting a narrow spatial and temporal scope, and marginalizing Indigenous knowledge and experiences. The result is an environmental assessment process that strains Indigenous community resources yet fails to address concerns. Using the Fort McKay M & eacute;tis Nation (FMMN) of northeastern Alberta as a case study, Indigenous knowledge and simulation modeling were brought together in pursuit of a more comprehensive assessment of cumulative effects on Indigenous land use. Focus group meetings and interviews established that the ability of FMMN members to hunt, fish, trap, and harvest in their territory has rapidly diminished in recent decades, a finding also documented by a simulation that reconstructed landscape changes occurring over the past 120 years across a 103,000 km2 region. The direct footprint from industrial activities, negligible until the 1970s, has since expanded to over 5000 km2, largely due to oil sands and forestry development. Although impacts to moose, fisher, and low-bush cranberry habitat have been relatively minor, opportunity for Indigenous land use has declined substantially due to the effects of industrial footprint, protected areas, and military sites on the accessibility of the land. To facilitate application of this strategic perspective to project assessment, a web application was developed that allows FMMN to assess impacts of development proposals in combination with other past and potential future development relative to a natural baseline.

AB  - Scavenging has been profusely studied in the last decades. However, carrion is more than a direct source of food for scavengers and decomposers, as it may provide many non-scavenging ecological functions. These include the provision of carrion insects to insectivores and hair to nest-building species. However, the patterns of use of these resources are greatly unknown. In this context, carnivore carcasses may represent an outstanding study model because they usually persist in the environment for longer than herbivore carcasses. Here, we used videotrapping to explore the consumption of carrion insects and hair taking at 99 red fox (Vulpes vulpes) carcasses in three areas of southeastern Spain. Carcasses were frequently used for consuming insects and taking hair (7.3 events in total on average per carcass). These non-scavenging behaviors were observed over eight weeks for most carcasses, peaking around the fifth week. Birds were the main users of carcasses, distantly followed by mammals; reptiles were only recorded feeding occasionally on carrion insects. These behaviors were more frequent during spring, when the demand for insects for offspring feeding and hair for nest building is maximized by many vertebrates. Moreover, the community of species exhibiting each of these behaviors was highly organized, as evidenced from their nested structure. We observed co-occurrence of insect consumption and hair taking in a quarter of carcasses, with co-occurrence being mostly due to chance and certain individuals and groups that used some carcasses for both purposes. Overall, non-scavenging uses of fox carcasses by vertebrates in our study area is more frequent than scavenging, which highlights the broad ecological relevance of carnivore carcasses and opens exciting future research avenues.

AB  - Restoring habitats degraded by intensive agriculture is challenging, and the resulting communities often have lower quality and host fewer species than reference ecosystems. To improve restoration outputs, we need to understand what limits both establishment and performance of target species in restored populations. In this study, we focused on grassland restoration with regional seeds and compared the performance of two target herbs, Betonica officinalis and Centaurea jacea, between restored and reference populations. We also measured plant functional traits and environmental characteristics to understand which parameters affect population performance. Individual plants of both species were smaller in restored populations, which indicates reduced performance. Leaves of plants from restored populations contained more delta N-15 and, in Betonica, also less nitrogen and higher C:N ratio, which suggests that the performance of the target species may be limited by nitrogen. Nitrogen limitation of all restored communities was further corroborated by the low N:P ratio of bulk biomass. In Centaurea, we also recorded massive herbivory damage in restored populations, which likely further reduced this species' performance in restored meadows. In summary, target plants in restored populations showed lower performance than conspecifics in reference sites, probably due to nutrient imbalance (low nitrogen availability) and excessive herbivory damage.

AB  - With the overuse of antibiotics in health care and animal husbandry, antibiotic resistance becomes a serious threat to public health. Antibiotic residues from veterinary medicine have increased the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) by horizontal gene transfer globally, leading to the enrichment of ARGs in wildlife. Plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) is a small herbivore endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Previous studies reveal that pika evolves a coprophagy behavior toward cohabitated yak, which makes the pika population a potential reservoir of ARGs. Yet, little is known about the resistome of pika under different grazing intensities. Here, we sampled the cecum content of pika from three different grazing intensity areas in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to evaluate the effect of grazing on its gut microbiota and resistome. By using the 16S full-length amplicon and metagenomic sequencing, our study revealed that livestock grazing significantly altered the gut microbial community of plateau pika as compared to prohibited grazing areas. We found bacterial lineage Prevotellaceae, Lachnospirales, and RF39 increased in grazing areas. Analysis of the resistome revealed that pika from continuous grazing areas enriched a higher abundance of colistin (MCR) and streptogramin (vat) resistance genes. Moreover, we observed significant correlations between the gut microbial community, ARGs, and mobile genetic element profiles, hinting that pika gut microbiota was an important shaping force of the resistome. In future studies, the continuous monitoring of wildlife gut resistome and environmental antibiotic residues is imperative for a better understanding and for tackling the horizontal gene transfer of ARGs across the wildlife-livestock interface.

AB  - Leatherjackets (Tipula spp.) are soil-dwelling pests associated with agriculture. Land management decisions made at farm scale can have subsequent effects on their populations. Between 1980 and 2020, surveys were conducted across Scotland to collect field histories and larval population data from grassland farms. To assess the impact of management and bioclimatic factors on leatherjacket occurrence over time, this study investigated data from fields continuously sampled between 2009 and 2018. We utilized a Generalized Linear Mixed-Effect Model on a dataset of 61 fields on 19 farms. Results indicated three significant factors affecting larval populations; field size, grazing type and application of insecticides or herbicides (referred to collectively as pesticides). Larval populations were significantly lower in fields that were larger in size and under sheep grazing, compared to no grazing. Pesticide application also caused a significant reduction in larval populations. Management variables were amalgamated to create a Management Intensity Index, revealing significantly increased larval populations under low-management systems. These results, coupled with significant effects of bioclimatic variables, pinpoint predictive signals for high infestations and potential routes for control strategies.

AB  - Manure utilization is the most important current practices economically and, ecologically. The combined use of active forms of silicon together with other types of soil amendments or fertilizers has been shown to reduce P, N and K leaching from upper soil horizon or fixation, which positively affect crop production. The present study evaluated the performance of pig manure co-treated with quicklime (calcium oxide -CaO) and monosilicic acid (Si(OH)(4)) as sources of nutrients for rice production conducted in greenhouse and field tests for the reduction of negative environmental effects through the soil-plant system. Results indicated that quicklime/monosilicic acid-treated pig manure reduced the phosphorus and potassium leaching and phosphorus fixation which resulted in an increase in the biomass of rice by 38.3-52.3% in greenhouse and rice yield in field increased by up to 17.4%. Phosphorus plant-availability in the soil and its uptake by rice plants were enhanced by the mixture of treat-ments. Furthermore, quicklime/monosilicic acid -treated pig manure enhanced the accumulation of potassium in rice leaves.

AB  - Using multi-scale trembling aspen tree-ring width data from Alberta, we show that scaling has a profound influence on dendroecological inferencing. At all scales of sampling, there is a significant climatological signal whose strength is nevertheless superseded by the pervasive effect of insect herbivory. At the smallest spatial scale, 20 km x 20 km, we demonstrate a quasi periodic pattern of sharp growth reductions and the existence of negative spatial correlations among successive outbreaks. At the intermediate spatial scale of 20 km x 80 km, we show that the period 1930-1963 was marked by extremely low correlations in aspen ring widths, with much higher correlations occurring both before and after, despite high variance in precipitation that might have caused ring widths to correlate under moisture limitation. At the largest spatial scale of the entire province, aspen ring widths in the boreal forest became decorrelated abruptly in 1916, after cycling synchronously for the previous 80 years. This occurred despite a warming climate that heightened moisture limitation. Something in the environment prevents some outbreak cycles from rising to maximum intensity and from spreading to maximum extent. This appears to be the key to better predictability and management of forest insects and forests at short and long time-scales.

AB  - This study describes the feeding ecology, spatial distribution of each ontogenetic phase and the corresponding plastic debris contamination, in the Caribbean sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon porosus as a function of spatial-temporal parameters in the Western South American coastal region. The density and biomass of all individuals, captured in a surface drift gillnet fishery, were 1.3 +/- 0.3 ind.day (-1) and 877 +/- 232 g.day (-1), respectively. Neonates, and juveniles were captured during all seasons. Adults were largely caught during the late rainy and early dry seasons, probably moving offshore to adjacent open waters during the late dry season. The diet of R. porosus consisted mainly of fish (FO = 71.8%). All ontogenetic phases were contaminated by plastic debris (FO = 100%). Among the plastic debris detected in R. porosus, 91.6% were microplastics (MP) (<5 mm), of which blue fibers contributed 53.7%. The MP samples were identified as polyethylene by Optical microscopy (OM), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and by Energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). R. porosus has a high gut concentration of MP compared to fishes of lower trophic levels. In addition, many fishes within the stomach contents of R. porosus were themselves contaminated with MP (e.g., Eugerres brasilianus, Harengula clupeola, Rhinosardinia bahiensis, Anchovia clupeoides, Monacanthus ciliatus, Polydactylus virginicus, Trachinocephalus myops, Eucinostomus melanopterus, and Lutjanus analis). The piscivorous diet of R. porosus likely leads to accumulation of MP contamination in this top predator through trophic transfer.

AB  - The distribution of runs of homozygosity (ROH) may be shaped by a number of interacting processes such as selection, recombination and population history, but little is known about the importance of these mechanisms in shaping ROH in wild populations. We combined an empirical dataset of >3000 red deer genotyped at >35,000 genome-wide autosomal SNPs and evolutionary simulations to investigate the influence of each of these factors on ROH. We assessed ROH in a focal and comparison population to investigate the effect of population history. We investigated the role of recombination using both a physical map and a genetic linkage map to search for ROH. We found differences in ROH distribution between both populations and map types indicating that population history and local recombination rate have an effect on ROH. Finally, we ran forward genetic simulations with varying population histories, recombination rates and levels of selection, allowing us to further interpret our empirical data. These simulations showed that population history has a greater effect on ROH distribution than either recombination or selection. We further show that selection can cause genomic regions where ROH is common, only when the effective population size (N-e) is large or selection is particularly strong. In populations having undergone a population bottleneck(,) genetic drift can outweigh the effect of selection. Overall, we conclude that in this population, genetic drift resulting from a historical population bottleneck is most likely to have resulted in the observed ROH distribution, with selection possibly playing a minor role.

AB  - Novel cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) cDNA in tree shrews (which are non-rodent primate-like species) and pig CYP3A227 cDNA were identified, along with known pig CYP3A22, CYP3A29, and CYP3A46 cDNAs. All five cDNAs contained open reading frames encoding a polypeptide of 503 amino acids that shared high sequence identity (72-78 %) with human CYP3A4 and were more closely related to human CYP3As than rat CYP3As by phylogenetic analysis. CYP3A5 was the only CYP3A in the tree shrew genome, but pig CYP3A genes formed a CYP3A gene cluster in the genomic region corresponding to that of human CYP3A genes. Tree shrew CYP3A5 mRNA was predominantly expressed in liver and small intestine, among the tissues analyzed, whereas pig CYP3A227 mRNA was most abundantly expressed in jejunum, followed by liver. Metabolic assays established that tree shrew CYP3A5 and pig CYP3A proteins heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli metabolized typical human CYP3A4 substrates nifedipine and midazolam. These results suggest that novel tree shrew CYP3A5 and pig CYP3A227 were functional enzymes able to metabolize human CYP3A4 substrates in liver and small intes-tine, similar to human CYP3A4, although pig CYP3A227 mRNA was minimally expressed in all tissues analyzed.

AB  - To improve wildlife connectivity across the U.S., managers need to identify and prioritize movement barriers in need of mitigation. Roadway barriers may be semi-permeable and allow some movement either at-grade or via non-wildlife underpasses, but permeability can depend on species-specific behaviors and underpass characteristics. We used a combination of trail cameras and GPS collars to monitor desert bighorn ( Ovis canadensis nelsoni) ) movement near highways and use of non-wildlife underpasses along I-15 and I-40 near Mojave National Preserve, CA. After year 1, we installed guzzlers near target underpasses in a before-after-control-impact (BACI) framework to assess changes in desert bighorn detection over 2 years post-installation. GPS collar data confirmed that desert bighorn moved close enough to 10 of 11 focal underpasses to easily access and use these structures to cross I-15 and I-40. Trail cameras at five sites recorded desert bighorn using habitat very near underpasses and even resting in a culvert tunnel, but no data indicated desert bighorn used underpasses or culverts to cross either highway. Meanwhile, species including coyote ( Canis latrans), ), bobcat ( Lynx rufus), ), and feral burro ( Equus asinus) ) regularly used monitored underpasses. Adding a novel water resource did not significantly increase desert bighorn detection rate on underpass cameras at impact sites relative to control sites after 2 years, and no images suggested bighorn used the installed guzzlers. Patterns of desert bighorn habitat use in the region and lack of observed highway crossings during the study indicate generally low permeability of I-15 and I-40 for this species and a mismatch between non-wildlife underpass locations, design, and desert bighorn behavior.

AB  - Temperament in sheep is commonly presented as unidimensional, with a 'nervous' temperament indicative of fear and reactivity towards humans and novel environments. However, temperament is multidimensional, with some traits expressed only under certain conditions (context-specific). There is evidence that a common temperament test in sheep, the isolation-box (IB), measures level of activity and not fearfulness as intended, and that behaviours measured in the IB test are indicative of different traits. To investigate this, 16 behavioural responses to a human, to being startled, and to confinement (IB test) were measured in 89 lambs, twice, three months apart. Our results agree with previous studies that vocalisations in all tests and locomotion in two, show high repeatability over time. A principal component analysis identified that vocalisations are domain-general, and are indicative of the trait 'sociability', however locomotion is context-specific' and captures the traits 'exploration-avoidance', 'boldness-shyness' and 'general activity'. A cluster analysis identified four behavioural profiles that indicate the trait 'boldness-shyness' captures reactivity towards humans. This suggests the IB test, which measures 'general activity', is unsuitable for measuring reactivity towards humans in sheep, and that when studying the impact of temperament on other factors, multiple conditions should be used when identify temperament traits.

TI  - Semen characteristics of the three genetic types of boars reared in Benin
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTION
LA  - English
AB  - Objective: To characterize the semen of three genetic types of boars (local, improved and Large White) reared in Benin.
   Methods: Semen of local, improved and Large White boars reared in Benin were collected using the gloved hand method and analyzed to determine volume, pH, concentration, mobility, motility, and morphology. The effect of the genetic type of boar on semen characteristics was aslo studied.
   Results: Duration of ejaculation and semen volume of Large White boar were significantly higher than those of local and improved boars (P<0.05). The semen of improved boars had a higher motility score than that of Large White and local boars (P<0.001). The semen of local boars was more concentrated in the spermatozoa than that of improved and Large White boars (P<0.05). The proportion of spermatozoa of improved boars with normal morphology (93.6%) was significantly higher than that of local (82.2%) and Large White boars (81.6%) (P<0.001). The proportion of spermatozoa with folded tails in the semen of Large White boars (9.2%) was significantly higher than that observed in improved (1.8%) and local (5.0%) boars (P<0.001). The proportion of spermatozoa with proximal cytoplasmic droplets in semen of improved boars (2.7%) was significantly lower than that in Large White (6.8%) and local (9.7%) boars (P<0.001). The local (1.5%) and Large White boars (1.1%) showed more spermatozoa with distal cytoplasmic droplets in their semen compared to the improved boars (0.4%).
   Conclusions: The semen characteristics of pigs reared in Benin vary from one genetic type to another. Each genetic type has a strong point. The Large White boar produces larger semen, the local boar produces more concentrated semen and the improved boar produces spermatozoa that are morphologically better. The semen of these three genetic types can be used in artificial insemination but the improved boar's semen is more recommended.

AB  - Maternal undernutrition during gestation affects the behaviour, metabolism, and sensitivity to stressors of the offspring. Shearing is a stressor that triggers physiological and behavioural changes and augments the thermo-regulatory demands in sheep. The aim of this study was to compare the thermoregulatory, metabolic, and behavioural responses to spring shearing of aged ewes born to mothers who grazed different pasture allowances during gestation. Nineteen non-gestating six-year-old Corriedale ewes born to mothers who grazed two pasture allowances from 23 days before conception until 122 days of gestation were used. The pasture allowance offered to the mothers was high [HPA group; n = 11; 10-12 kg of dry matter (DM)/100 kg of body weight (BW)/day] or low [LPA group: n = 8; 5-8 kg of DM/100 kg of BW/day]. The adult offspring of both experimental groups were sheared during spring (Day 0), and remained outdoors, grazing natural grassland, and the behaviour, the surface temperature and the rectal temperature were recorded. Blood concentrations of albumin, total protein, glucose, and insulin were also determined. Data were compared with a mixed model. The LPA ewes had lower ear and nose maximum and minimum surface temperatures before shearing (P < 0.05). On Day 15, the average surface temperature of the vulva was lower in LPA than in HPA ewes (P < 0.05). After shearing, rumination frequency was greater in HPA than in LPA ewes (P = 0.01), and LPA ewes were observed more time standing up than HPA ewes (P < 0.0001). Insulin concentration tended to be greater in LPA than HPA ewes (P = 0.06). Maternal undernutrition during gestation modified the thermoregulatory responses and the acute behavioural changes after shearing in aged female offspring, whilst the metabolism was affected to a lesser degree. The long-term effects noticed in this study highlight the importance of providing proper nutrition to pregnant ewes.

AB  - Simple Summary Black pigs are the most competitive hogs in Taiwan as they have a higher price than commercial non-black hogs due to their desirable meat quality for locals, and they have accounted for 15% of Taiwan's hog production since 2011. However, the litter sizes before the weaning of local black sows are much smaller than those of maternal breeds such as Landrace and Yorkshire, which are commonly used in Taiwan. Herd productivity is highly influenced by dam litter size and piglet weight before weaning. The KHAPS Black Pig was registered as a new breed in Taiwan in 2010 and was designed as a maternal line for black hog production. The direct-maternal genetic effects on litter size and piglet weight were tested for selection efficiency. The direct-maternal genetic correlation had a great impact on the prediction of maternal breeding value. Therefore, it is crucial to estimate the direct-maternal genetic parameters of litter size and piglet weight to assist future selection decisions for the genetic progress of this new breed. The objective of this study was to estimate the genetic parameters of litter size and piglet weight from farrowing to weaning in KHAPS Black sows. The genetic parameters investigated were the direct (h(d)(2)), maternal (h(m)(2)), realized (h(r)(2)), and total (h(T)(2)) heritability, as well as correlations (r(d), r(m), and r(dm)) within and between traits. The analyses were performed using single- and three-trait animal models with and without maternal genetic effects. In the three-trait model with maternal genetic effect, all estimates of h(d)(2) and h(m)(2) were significantly different from zero except the h(d)(2) of mean birth weight. Positive values of r(d) and r(m) between traits were observed as expected in the range of 0.322-1.000. Negative values of r(dm) were found within and between traits and were less associated with mean piglet weight traits than litter size traits. Estimates of h(T)(2) were consistently larger than those of h(r)(2) in both the single- and three-trait model analyses. In addition, the three-trait model can take into account the association between the traits, so the estimates are more accurate with smaller SEs. In conclusion, maternal genetic effects were not negligible in this study, and thus, a multiple-trait animal model with maternal genetic effects and full pedigree is recommended to assist future pig breeding decisions in this new breed.

AB  - The direct grazing of herbivores on submerged macrophytes has long been recognized as an important contributor to macrophyte loss in shallow lakes. The defense mechanism of aquatic plants against grazing laid a theoretical basis for the conservation of endangered submerged macrophytes against habitat change. Here, we aim to explore the response of the endangered macrophyte Ottelia alismoides to direct grazing by the freshwater snails Radix swinhoei by using physiological, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. Based on field observation, we hypothesize that O. alismoides may not have an effective grazing resistance mechanism. Our 48-h microcosm study revealed 739 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the grazed treatment and the control. GO annotation analysis identified DEGs with molecular functions such as signaling receptor activity and various enzyme activities, as well as biological processes including auxin signaling, responses to oxidative stress, and salicylic acid. DEGs related to phytohormones (especially jasmonic acid, JA) and antioxidant enzymes were significantly up-regulated. In addition, the 20 metabolites changed significantly after being grazed. For example, the up-regulation of the JA biosynthetic pathway led to a marginal increase of the JA content in leaves, and its signal transduction pathway was also up-regulated, consistent with that the precursor of secondary metabolism of flavonoids was up-regulated and that the transcriptome biosynthesis pathway of flavonoids was also upregulated. Though evident defensive steps were found at the aspects of transcriptome and metabolome, leaf intactness and the photosynthetic parameters in the leaves were strongly negatively affected by snail grazing. We argued that the efficiency of those defensive strategies has probably been compromised due to the degenerative secondary metabolism in submerged leaves. Thus, to protect endangered submerged macrophytes, countermeasures for herbivory should be considered along with other important policies.

AB  - Simple Summary After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident, a highly contaminated area with radionuclide appeared and was designated a difficult-to-return zone (DRZ). After that, the increase in number of wild boars (Sus scrofa) has been pronounced in DRZ, and the spread of highly contaminated wild boars into other areas is cause for concern. Understanding the population structure based on the genetic diversity of wild boars in Fukushima provides important information for the management of the animals. In this study, we carried out MIG-seq analysis to clarify the dispersal and gene flow of the local wild boar population and uncover the genetic population boundary in Fukushima. We obtained 328 single-nucleotide polymorphisms from 179 wild boars. Based on STRUCTURE analysis, we found significant genetic differences between groups of wild boars inhabiting in the east and west, divided by the Abukuma River. Since the urbanized area is concentrated along the Abukuma River in Fukushima, both the Abukuma River and the urbanized area are likely to interfere in the migration and dispersal of wild boars. Furthermore, our results indicate that the population in the western area was established by the migration from other neighboring prefectures rather than by that from the eastern group of Fukushima Prefecture. We aimed to reveal the dispersal and gene flow of the local wild boar (Sus scrofa) population and find their genetic boundary in Fukushima Prefecture. After the nuclear incident in 2011, the land was considered a difficult-to-return zone, and the increase in the number of wild boars was pronounced. To provide an effective management strategy for the wild boar population, we used multiplexed inter-simple sequence repeat genotyping by sequencing (MIG-seq) and clarified the genetic structure of wild boars. We obtained 328 single-nucleotide polymorphisms from 179 samples. STRUCTURE analysis showed that the most likely number of population cluster was K = 2. Molecular analysis of variance showed significant genetic differences between groups of wild boars inhabiting in the east and west across the Abukuma River. The migration rate from the eastern population to the western population is higher than in the reverse case based on BayesAss analysis. Our study indicates that both the Abukuma River and anthropogenic urbanization along the river may affect the migration of wild boars and the population in western was established mainly by the migration from other neighboring prefectures.

AB  - The changing climate has a serious bearing on agriculture, particularly livestock production in Botswana. Therefore, studying the relationship between climate and livestock, which at present is largely missing, is necessary for the proper formulation of government policy and interventions. This is critical in promoting the adoption of relevant mitigation strategies by farmers, thereby increasing resilience. The aim of this research is to establish associations between climate variability and livestock production in Botswana at the national level. The paper employs time series data from 1970 to 2020 and the Vector Autoregression with Exogenous Variables (VARX) model for statistical analysis. The trend shows that both cattle and goat populations are decreasing. The VARX model results reveal that cattle and goat populations are negatively associated with increasing maximum temperatures. Cattle respond negatively to increased minimum temperatures as well, while goats tend to respond positively, implying that livestock species react differently to climatic conditions due to their distinct features. The results of the roots of the companion matrix for cattle and goat production meet the stability condition as all the eigenvalues lie inside the unit circle. The study recommends further intervention by the government to deal with increasing temperatures, thereby addressing the dwindling populations of goats and cattle, which have significant contributions to the household economies of smallholders and the national economy, respectively.

AB  - Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a common diarrheal pathogen in humans and animals. To prevent and treat ETEC induced diarrhea, we synthesized mannan oligosaccharide selenium (MOSS) and studied its beneficial effect on ETEC-induced diarrhea. A total of 32 healthy weaned piglets (6.69 +/- 0.01 kg) were randomly divided into four groups: NC group (Basal diet), MOSS group (0.4 mg/kg MOSS supplemented diet), MOET group (0.4 mg/kg MOSS supplemented diet + ETEC treatment), ETEC group (ETEC treatment). NC and ETEC group fed with basal diet, MOSS and MOET group fed with the MOSS supplemented diet. On the 8th and 15th day of the experiment, MOET and ETEC group were gavaged with ETEC, and NC and MOSS group were gavaged with stroke-physiological saline solution. Our data showed that dietary MOSS supplementation increased average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) and significantly decreased diarrhea index and frequency in ETEC-treated piglets. MOSS did not affect the alpha diversity and beta diversity of ileal microbial community, but it significantly decreased the proportion of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in ileal microbial community. MOSS supplementation regulated colonic microbiota community composition, which significantly increased carbohydrate metabolism, and inhibited lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway in colonic microbial community. Moreover, MOSS significantly decreased inflammatory stress, and oxidative stress in ETEC treated piglets. Furthermore, dietary MOSS supplementation significantly decreased intestinal barrier permeability, and alleviated ETEC induced intestinal mucosa barrier irritation. In conclusion, our study showed that dietary MOSS supplementation ameliorated intestinal mucosa barrier, and regulated intestinal microbiota to prevent ETEC induced diarrhea in weaned piglets.

AB  - A BSTRACT : The Blue Economy is estimated to be worth over USD 2.5 trillion annually, or almost 3% of the world's GDP in 2020. St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) in the Caribbean region has a vast and rich marine space that is underutilized. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of pearl oyster and sponge farming to advance the country's Blue Economy through sustainable mariculture. A qualitative approach was applied, using a literature review and thematic analysis of data gathered through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with relevant stakeholders. Among several species evaluated, the result of the study revealed that the Pinctada imbricata oyster species and Hippospongia lachne sponge species are the most suitable for cultivation in SVG coastal waters, specifically in the Ashton Lagoon of Union Island. The study concluded that while there is strong support from the stakeholders in SVG for pearl oyster and sponge farming in the country, challenges still exist. Nevertheless, it has been found that by learning and adopting the strategies of the leading Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Blue Economy development combined with the critical enablers such as meticulous planning, stakeholder collaboration, establishment of legal frameworks, and ecosystem-based management, pearl oyster and sponge mariculture in the identified location in SVG could potentially aid the expansion of the country's Blue Economy.

AB  - Feed conversion ratio (FCR) is a key indicator of pig productivity, but its measurement is labor-intensive and time-consuming. This study aimed to construct a predictive model for cumulative feeding intake (CFI), which could help estimate FCR more efficiently and reduce the time and effort needed for measurements. This study included a total of 987 Yorkshire boars raised in specific pathogen-free environments, with feeding and growth data collected using automatic feeders. The segmented R package and Bayesian ridge regression (BRR) were used to build a predictive model for CFI. The results showed that the optimal body weight range for predicting FCR was 80-110 kg. The BRR model achieved 80% accuracy for CFI prediction, and FCR calculated from predicted CFI showed 81.4% similarity to the corrected FCR. The results clearly demonstrate that even with a limited training dataset, the BRR model has good predictive potential for FCR. The findings of this study could reduce the selection pressure on FCR traits, decrease production costs, and shorten measurement periods, ultimately benefiting the swine industry significantly.

AB  - Obtaining precise and unbiased estimates of feral burro (Equus asinus) abundance in the western United States is challenging due to their cryptic pelage and the rugged terrain they inhabit. Management agencies employ helicopter-based, simultaneous double-observer sightability surveys (hereafter denoted as DOS) to estimate abundance of burros; but the DOS method routinely produces negatively biased estimates due to residual heterogeneity in detection probability. Consequently, testing alternative methods to improve upon current procedures is warranted. Residual heterogeneity in DOS surveys can be minimized by including radio-collared individuals in the population. Alternatively, if distance measurements are recorded, residual heterogeneity can also be reduced via a mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) approach. Aerial infrared (IR) surveys offer a safer alternative than helicopter-based surveys because they can be flown at a higher altitude and require fewer observers in the aircraft. Further, IR surveys using a distance sampling approach have been shown to generate accurate and precise estimates of feral horse (E. caballus) populations. Accordingly, we compared results of surveys using aerial IR distance sampling, the standard DOS survey, a DOS survey incorporating detections of radio-collared individuals, and an MRDS analysis of a feral burro population with a known minimum population size in central Utah, winter 2015-2016 and spring 2016. The minimum number of burros known alive during the winter and spring surveys were 236 and 136, respectively. The average detection probability of IR surveys was P = 0.88 (SE = 0.16) and distance models produced estimates of 127 burros (95% CIs = 99-175) for the winter survey, and 94 burros (CIs = 72-134) for the spring survey. Mean detection probability of the standard DOS surveys was P = 0.78 (SE = 0.09), and model-generated abundance estimates were 155 burros (CIs = 133-227) in winter, and 92 burros (CIs = 79-139) in spring. Incorporating detections of radio-collared individuals in the DOS survey resulted in a decreased detection probability (P = 0.46; SE = 0.06) and increased abundance estimates to 267 (CIs = 169-571) and 155 (CIs = 128-263) for winter and spring, respectively. Mark-recapture distance sampling produced a mean detection probability of P = 0.48 (SE = 0.12) and resulted in estimates of 282 (CIs = 178-385) and 169 (CIs = 73-310) burros in winter and spring, respectively. Our study demonstrated that aerial IR surveys conducted using standard distance sampling can produce precise estimates of burro population sizes; however, estimates were negatively biased relative to the known population size. Small sample size limits generalization of our results, but the IR-based distance approach did not improve upon DOS surveys. Accounting for residual heterogeneity through use of radio-collars and mark-recapture distance sampling eliminated the negative bias from the standard DOS survey but decreased survey precision. Managers will need to decide whether unbiased but less precise abundance estimates are preferable compared to a more precise, but biased, estimate.

AB  - How does an elephant population recover after being pushed to the brink of extinction? In this and a separate paper on behaviour we present an account of war-induced collapse and post-war recovery of an elephant population. Mozambique's 15-year civil war from 1977-1992 had a profound impact on the elephants of Gorongosa National Park. Elephant numbers plummeted from similar to 2,200 pre-war to <200 post-war impacting the structure of the population and its families, the physical appearance of the elephants, their genetic make-up and behaviour (companion study). Using individual registration, this study aimed to collect baseline data to estimate the population size, reproductive parameters and growth and to document its composition, including age and sex structure, tusk configuration, family and clan membership. A quarter of a century after the war, rapid reproductive rate and growth in numbers are indications of recovery, but the skewed sex ratio among older age classes and the prevalence of tusklessness in post-war generations are evidence of long-lasting scars.

AB  - Individual variation in habitat selection and movement behaviour is receiving growing attention, but primarily with respect to characterizing behaviours in different contexts as opposed to decomposing structure in behaviour within populations. This focus may be limiting advances in understanding the diversity of individual behaviour and its influence on population organization. We propose a framework for characterizing variation in space-use behaviour with the aim of advancing interpretation of its form and function. Using outputs from integrated step-selection analyses of 20 years of telemetry data from African elephants Loxodonta Africana, we developed four metrics characterizing differentiation in resource selection behaviour within a population (specialization [magnitude of the response independent of direction], heterogeneity [inter-individual variation], consistency [temporal shift in response] and reversal [frequency of directional changes in the response]). We contrasted insight from the developed metrics relative to the mean population response using an example focused on two covariates. We then expanded this contrast by evaluating if the metrics identify structurally important information on seasonal shifts in resource selection behaviours in addition to that provided by mean selection coefficients through principal component analyses (PCAs) and a random forest classification. The simplified example highlighted that for some covariates focusing on the population average failed to capture complex individual variation in behaviours. The PCAs revealed that the developed metrics provided additional information in explaining the patterns in elephant selection beyond that offered by population average covariate values. For elephants, specialization and heterogeneity were informative, with specialization often being a better descriptor of differences in seasonal resource selection behaviour than population average responses. Summarizing these metrics spatially and temporally, we illustrate how these metrics can provide insights on overlooked aspects of animal behaviour. Our work offers a new approach in how we conceptualize variation in space-use behaviour (i.e. habitat selection and movement) by providing ways of encapsulating variation that enables diagnoses of the drivers of individual-level variability in a population. The developed metrics explicitly distil how variation in a behaviour is structured among individuals and over time which could facilitate comparative work across time, populations or strata within populations.

AB  - Coal is mined for energy generation around the world, producing large amounts of waste and extensive disturbances to the environment. Post-mining lands with sandy soils to be reclaimed for agricultural uses are very challenging. The use of humic substances such as soil amendments has been discussed, although little information is available regarding application timing in the field. We conducted a field experiment over two consecutive growing seasons on a former coal mine in China, to investigate soil and vegetation response to a lignite-derived humic product called "nano humus" and to determine optimal application timing. Three economically valuable agricultural species, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.), were used for this study. The benefits of the humic product on soil properties and plant growth under field conditions were expressed after 2 yr of application. A single application at the beginning of each growing season provided better results than splitting into two applications, with no impact of duration (months) between applications. A single application significantly increased soil available phosphorus by 63% and potassium by 96% relative to the control; it significantly enhanced total biomass of alfalfa by 749%, barley by 250%, and sea buckthorn by 147%. Our findings provided important practical implications for using a humic material as a soil amendment in coal mine reclamation, with potential applications in other agricultural and reclamation scenarios.

AB  - The successful design of strategic control measures against the blood-sucking gastrointestinal nematode, Haemonchus contortus in small ruminants can be facilitated by revealing its general features from morphology to the molecular level. In the south Gujarat region of India, a total of 2408 H. contortus were collected from 84 slaughtered sheep's abomasum, consisting of 347 males and 2061 females (1:6 ratio) (p<0.05). Furthermore, 726 H. contortus were collected from 61 goats, comprising 145 males and 581 females (1:4 ratio) (p<0.05). The male worms were approximately 12 +/- 0.06 mm long, while female worms were about 20 +/- 0.09 mm long. The vulvar morphotypes of the female worms were found to be 17.7% linguiform, 76.6 % knobbed/button (p<0.05), and 5.7 % smooth type, demonstrating common features of H. contortus. The nucleotide sequences of the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS-1) of 165 bp or ITS-2 plus of 256 bp were aligned, and it was found that the genotypes of male and female specimens of either sheep or goat origin were identical, with a 100 % match. The present isolates shared >95 % and >94 % homology with published sequences of ITS-1 and ITS-2 plus of H. contortus, respectively, with more nucleotide transitions than transversions in the aligned sequences. The reconstructed phylogram of either ITS-1 or ITS-2 plus revealed two major clades, one for H. contortus and another for other nematodes, with Haemonchus placei showing its proximity with the clade of H. contortus. The study established the role of morphological and molecular features in identifying and differentiating H. contortus parasite at the local level.

AB  - Introduction: Erythrina americana is a tree legume found as part of the fence of livestock farms of the tropical region. However, sheep farmers do not routinely or strategically use the foliage of this type of legume as a dietary supplement due, in part, to ignorance of its chemical composition and foliar performance, as well as the factors that affect them. Objective: To determine the influence of season and diameter of E. americana tree on the chemical composition and foliage yield at a 90-day regrowth age. Methods: 47 trees were used in a two-factor design. The factors were season (dry and rainy) and tree diameter at 0.20 m above ground level (D-9 between 0.05 and 0.09 m and D-13, between 0.091 to 0.13 m). The response variables were dry matter production and crude protein from foliage (kg arbol(-1)). Results: The season did not affect (P > 0.05) the production of dry matter and crude protein. However, the diameter of E. americana affected them (P < 0.01). In diameter D-13, the highest production of dry matter and crude foliar protein tree(-1) was detected with respect to D-9. Conclusions: The diameter of the tree had a more influence than the season on yield of dry matter and crude protein.

AB  - The freeze-thawing process induces osmotic changes that may affect the membrane domain location of aquaporins' (AQP) in spermatozoa. Recent studies suggest that changes in AQP3 localization allows better sperm osmo-adaptation, improving the cryoresistance. Ultra-rapid freezing is an alternative cryopreservation technique that requires less equipment than conventional freezing, and it is faster, simpler and can be used in the field. This study aimed to determine the influence of freezing-thawing rates (slow (control) vs. ultra-rapid) on AQP3 expression and location in the spermatozoa from small ruminants (sheep and goats) and its relationship with sperm cryo-damage. Spermatozoa were collected from 10 Merino rams and 10 Murciano-Granadina bucks. The presence and distribution of AQP3 were assessed by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry (ICC), employing a commercial rabbit polyclonal antibody. Sperm motility was CASA system-analyzed, and membrane and acrosome integrity assessed by fluorescence (PI/PNA-FITC). Western blotting did not detect a significant effect of freezing-thawing rate on the amount of AQP3 while ICC found freezing-thawing rate affecting AQP3 location (P < 0.05). In both species, the percentages of spermatozoa showing AQP3 in the post-acrosome region, mid-piece, and principal piece of the tail were greater in samples cryopreserved by slow freezing-thawing (control) than ultra-rapid freezing-thawing rates (P < 0.05). Spermatozoa cryopreserved using ultra-rapid freezing-thawing showed decrease motility, plasma membrane, and acrosome integrity (P < 0.05), which might be related, at least in part, to a lower expression of AQP3. In conclusion, the cooling rate modifies the location of AQP3 in spermatozoa of sheep and goat, which might be associated with sperm cryosurvival.

AB  - Simple Summary: The yak (Bos grunniens) is a multi-tasking grazing ruminant species playing vital roles for Tibetan nomads living in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Yaks are subjected to undernutrition in traditional pasture management systems during long winters due to inadequate forage intakes. This results in animals losing 25.7 similar to 30.2% of their live weight. Large ruminant animals have high intakes of feed and water. The utilization of dietary nitrogen efficiency of yaks is only about 25.9%, and a large amount of nitrogen is excreted in their feces and urine. Changes in nutritional measurement could improve the utilization of dietary nutrients and regulate the synthesis of proteins in yaks. Methionine and lysine are the first two limiting amino acids in a corn-soybean-meal-based diet for ruminants; therefore, we added rumen-protected methionine and lysine to low- and high-protein diets and found that the low-protein diet supplemented with rumen-protected methionine and lysine is beneficial for rumen and body health, physiological response, and metabolic status in yaks.
   This study investigated the effects of the dietary protein level and rumen-protected methionine and lysine (RPML) on the growth performance, rumen fermentation, and serum indexes of yaks. Thirty-six male yaks were randomly assigned to a two by three factorial experiment with two protein levels, 15.05% and 16.51%, and three RPML levels: 0% RPML; 0.05% RPMet and 0.15% RPLys; and 0.1% RPMet and 0.3% RPLys. The trial lasted for sixty days. The results showed that the low-protein diet increased the DMI and feed conversion ratio of yaks. The diet supplemented with RPML increased the activities of IGF1 and INS and nutrient digestibility. The high-protein diet decreased the rumen butyrate concentration and increased the rumen isovalerate concentration. The low-protein diet supplemented with RPML increased the rumen pH and the concentrations of total volatile fatty acids, butyrate and NH3-N; the high-protein diet supplemented with a high level of RPML decreased the rumen pH and the concentrations of isobutyrate, isovalerate, propionate and NH3-N. The low-protein diet supplemented with RPML increased the total antioxidant capacity and glutathione peroxidase activity, along with the concentrations of malondialdehyde and amino acids such as aspartic acid, lysine, cysteine, etc. In conclusion, a low-protein diet supplemented with RPML is beneficial for rumen and body health, physiological response, and metabolic status in yaks.

AB  - A new regulation has led to the prohibition of recreational hunting on estates located within Spanish National Parks (NPs). Before the ban, eleven NPs in Spain had already reported negative ecological consequences associated with high densities of wild ungulates. The new situation that has occurred after the ban signifies that policies with which to control populations of wild ungulates in NPs, most of which do not have a sufficient natural capacity to regulate populations, depend exclusively on the parks ' authorities. The banning of recreational hunting implies a series of social, ecological, economic and logistic challenges. The control of wild ungulate populations in NPs requires: i) the legal basis for culling; ii) social acceptance as regards removing animals and the extractive procedures employed in NPs; iii) the long-term monitoring of wild ungulates and the damages that they cause, and iv) sufficient financial and human resources. A more integrated management and policy plan is, therefore, required, which should be supported by two pillars: i) the sustainability of natural resources and the conservation of functional environments, and ii) providing society with explanations regarding the need to manage wild ungulates. In order to bridge the potential gap between these key pillars, it is important to involve stakeholders in the decision-making processes concerning wild ungulate management. The forthcoming changes in Spanish NPs provide a promising opportunity to make a substantial improvement to wild ungulate management in these protected areas. This management approach could, moreover, serve as an example and be transferred to other protected spaces.

AB  - This study determined the response of methane emission and growth performance of yearling male Boer goats fed a basal diet of Avena sativa hay supplemented with Acacia karroo (sweet thorn) leaf meal. Twelve yearling male Boer goats with initial mean live weights of 23 +/- 2 kg were used in a 21-day experiment. The goats were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments, each containing sweet thorn leaf meal at 10, 15, 20 and 30% with Avena sativa hay as a basal diet. The data collected was subjected to analysis of covariance and analysis of variance in a completely randomized design using Statistical Analysis Software. Differences were separated at 5% level of probability. Sweet thorn leaf meal inclusion level had no effect (p > 0.05) on diet intake, methane emission, live weight changes and digestibility. Feed conversion ratio improved linearly with increased Sweet thorn leaf meal inclusion level. The low tannin contents in sweet thorn leaves indicate that these leaves can be safe to use as a source of protein in animal nutrition if used sparingly. Although, sweet thorn leaf meal reduced methane emission, the optimal dose was not determined. Further validation is required to determine sweet thorn inclusion levels for optimal methane production and emission by goats.

AB  - Illegal hunting threatens conservation, but little research has explored structural correlates of illegal hunting trends. The leading theoretical understanding of illegal hunting is from a situational crime perspective. These situational and individual studies provide vital information on the decision-making of a wildlife offender and help improve enforcement strategies. However, correlates explaining the concentration of illegal hunting across multiple locations has yet to be explored. There has not been any criminological development to examine the overall geographical distribution of illegal hunting across a nation, territory, or state. The current study applies a green criminological perspective to analyze how the production institutions of the economy correlates with the trends of illegal hunting of terrestrial species across Texas counties. Results indicate that the treadmill of production does relate to illegal hunting, suggesting that there is conflict between the economy and public over the use of the wilderness.

AB  - Physiological and hematological traits and productive performance of Spanish Majorera and Palmera goats reared on the Island of Tenerife-Spain were assessed. 50 adult, clinically healthy, multiparous female goats were studied for 18 months. The data were analyzed in a two (breeds) x four (season) factorial scheme. Multivariate analysis and machine learning were used to assess the relationship between adaptive responses and climatic variables. There was no interaction effect between season of the year and breed for physiological responses (P > 0.05), except for coat surface temperature (P < 0.001). Respiratory rate and rectal temperature had no effect on breed c unlike heart rate and coat surface temperature. All thermoregulatory variables showed variations between seasons. The goats had a higher respiratory rate (P < 0.001) in summer and autumn. Rectal temperature was higher in spring (P < 0.001), but similar to winter (P > 0.05), whereas the heart rate was higher by 16.67% in winter when compared to other seasons (P < 0.001). The surface temperature of the coat presented higher values for the Majorera breed when compared to the Palmera in summer and spring. The Majorera breed showed greater productive performance (body weight; P < 0.05). In winter, the red blood series of Majorera goats showed higher values for hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (P < 0.05). The white blood series is similar between breeds (P > 0.05). There is a dynamic in the adaptive mechanisms used by Majorera and Palmera goats during the seasons. The temperate climate on Tenerife Island has a greater impact on Majorera goats (r2 canonical = 0.76; P < 0.001) when compared to Palmera goats (P = 0.68; P < 0.001). The surface temperature of the coat is the first activated thermoregulatory mechanism for both breeds (P < 0.001). However, only Majorera goats presented secondary mechanisms which are related to heart rate for lower coat surface temperature values, possibly due to vasoconstriction in winter; and for higher values of rectal temperature when the surface temperature of the coat increases in summer. It is concluded that both breeds are adapted to the temperate climatic conditions of the Island of Tenerife, but there is a seasonal adaptive dynamic. Majorera breed animals have greater body weight, but are less tolerant to the Island's climate. In the warmer seasons, these animals increase the surface temperature of the coat to dissipate endogenous heat and in the colder seasons they increase the number of red cells, which demonstrates their adaptability to the winter climate on the Island of Tenerife.

AB  - The interactions between hyperaccumulators and their associated herbivores have been mostly investigated in their natural habitats and largely ignored in the phytoremediation practice. Herein, we investigated the herbivory status of Zn/Cd-hyperaccumulating plant Sedum alfredii from both their natural habitats and their applied remediation field, and inspected the adaptive strategies of the herbivores from the perspective of their facilitative gut microbiota. Field investigations showed that snail species Bradybaena ravida was the dominant herbivore feeding on S. alfredii and they can be only found in sites with lower levels of heavy metals compared with the plant natural habitat. Gut microbial community was analyzed using two sequencing methods (16S rRNA and czcA-Zn/Cd resistant gene) to comparatively understand the effect of gut microbes in facilitating snail feeding on the hyperaccumulators. The results revealed significant differences in the diversity and richness between the gut microbiota of the two snail populations, which was more pronounced by the czcA sequencing method. Despite of the compositional differences, their functions seemed to converge into three categories as metal-tolerant and contaminant degraders, gut symbionts, and pathogens. Further function potentials predicted by Tax4Fun based on 16 S sequencing data were in accordance with this categorization as the most abundant metabolic pathways were two-component system and ABC transporter, which was closely related to metal stress adaptation. The prevalence of positive interactions (~80%) indicated by the co-occurrence network analysis based on czcA sequencing data in both groups of gut microbiota further suggested the facilitative effect of these metal-tolerant gut microbes in coping with the high metal diet, which ultimately assist the snails to successfully feed on S. alfredii plants and thrive. This work for the first time provides evidence that the herbivore adaptation to hyperaccumulators were also associated with their gut microbial adaptation to metals.

AB  - Understanding fuel system performance during anticipated transients without scram (ATWSs) in boiling water reactors (BWRs) is necessary for refining current and future safety limits. High-fidelity material models and simulations are fundamental to rigorous assessment of zirconium-based cladding performance. However, experimental thermomechanical data during simulated ATWSs to validate these modes are limited. To provide relevant in-situ data, Zircaloy-4 cladding was subjected to cyclic heating in a steam environment to simulate an out-of-pile BWR ATWS. Digital image correlation was used to capture the cladding strain behavior in-situ for comparison against simulations using the BISON finite element code. Conventional high-temperature models were compared using multiple schemes to gain a better understanding of the applicability of three BISON models to BWR ATWS: (1) the default combination of creep models in BISON, (2) the high-temperature Erbacher model alone, and (3) the low-temperature Limback-Andersson model alone. The cases run with the Limback-Andersson model alone produced the lowest root mean square error (RMSE). The lowest RMSE for the Limback-Andersson model alone was 0.659%, and the highest RMSE reported was 4.22%. A data gap within the model in the temperature regime of interest was also identified, and to account for this gap, the current model in BISON is linearly interpolated between two separate datasets. This evaluation highlights the need to either develop a new model or to improve the existing model to capture transient creep effects resulting from a cyclic temperature transient.

AB  - Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) are important transcription regulators in hypoxic cells and for maintaining cellular homeostasis, but it is unclear whether they participate in hypoxiainduced excessive proliferation of yak pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). In this study, we identified distribution of HIF-1 alpha and HO-1 in yak lungs. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence results revealed that both HIF-1 alpha and HO-1 were mainly concentrated in the medial layer of small pulmonary arteries. Furthermore, under induced-hypoxic conditions, we investigated HIF-1 alpha and HO-1 protein expression and studied their potential involvement in yak PASMCs proliferation and apoptosis. Western blot results also showed that both factors significantly increased in age-dependent manner and upregulated in hypoxic PASMCs (which exhibited obvious proliferation and anti-apoptosis phenomena). HIF-1 alpha up-regulation by DMOG increased the proliferation and anti-apoptosis of PASMCs, while HIF-1 alpha down-regulation by LW6 decreased proliferation and promoted apoptosis. More so, treatment with ZnPP under hypoxic conditions down-regulated HO-1 expression, stimulated proliferation, and resisted apoptosis in yak PASMCs. Taken together, our study demonstrated that both HIF-1 alpha and HO-1 participated in PASMCs proliferation and apoptosis, suggesting that HO-1 is important for inhibition of yak PASMCs proliferation while HIF-1 alpha promoted hypoxia-induced yak PASMCs proliferation.

AB  - In the scenario of rising multidrug resistance and allied diseases, antimicrobial peptides can be a considerable alternative for conventional antibiotics due to their broad spectrum activity and ability to bypass common resistance mechanisms. Histone derived antimicrobial peptides are found to have antibacterial, antifungal as well as anticancer properties. Here we have investigated a histone derived peptide sequence from blue swimmer crab, Portunus pelagicus for its general and immunological properties. The Pp-H2A histone derived peptide is an 8.5 kDa peptide with helical conformation on a coiled backbone. Analysis of its physicochemical characteristics such as hydrophobicity, stability and cationicity revealed its suitability as a potential drug candidate possessing antimicrobial function. According to various prediction servers, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-biofilm and anticancer properties could be attributed to the molecule. The study shall serve to strengthen the theoretical framework before proceeding for a time consuming and costly antimicrobial analysis of the molecule.

AB  - Pairwise trade-offs among the main dimensions of life history of plants, namely growth, reproduction and defence, have been hypothesized and repeatedly tested. Experimental evidences, however, are far from conclusive, probably as a consequence of different methodological approaches, but also of an underlying multivariate complexity that is not considered in pairwise analyses. We carried out two long-term field experiments with 81 ramets clonally replicated from 6 genotypes of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) to assess the allocation to growth, reproduction and defence in response to increased resource availability (fertilization and control treatments) and simulated herbivory (low intensity mechanical wounding, high intensity mechanical wounding, needle clipping, jasmonate application and control treatments). Fertilization increased tree growth and N and P concentration, and altered the production of resin and polyphenolics in complex ways, contingent on time and tissue. A natural event of infestation by Pissodes castaneus was more intense on fertilized trees. Fertilization increased both reproductive effort and output in terms of quantity (number of seeds) but not quality (dry weight of seeds). Needle clipping and methyl-jasmonate, but not mechanical wounding, increased the concentration of needle resin and phenols shortly after treatment, while concentrations in the phloem remain unaltered. Damage by P. castaneus did not differ across induction treatments. Generally, needle clipping had the strongest effect on reproductive variables, and mechanical wounding the mildest, with a high variability on intensity and direction of effects. Needle clipping decreased tree growth, while the rest of herbivory treatments did increase it. Complex interactions among life-history dimensions arose, showing that pairwise approaches are too simplistic for unravelling these complexities. This three-way relationship imposes new environmental and physiological constraints to the evolution and maintenance of reproductive strategies.

AB  - Many migratory species have advanced their migration timing as a response to advanced breeding conditions. While data on arrival timing to breeding grounds in Europe is plentiful, information from the African departure sites are scarce. Here we investigated changes in arrival timing of four long-distance migratory passerines to a stopover site in Israel and potential links to Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) at the species-specific African pre-departure sites and local temperatures at the stopover site. We found that Lesser whitethroat (Curruca curruca) and Eastern Bonelli's warbler (Phylloscopus orientalis) advanced arrival to the stopover site. The arrival timing of Thrush nightingale (Luscinia luscinia) and Olive-tree warbler (Hippolais olivetorum) did not change and was associated with mean EVI at the pre-departure site in Africa during the pre-migratory period. Additionally, temperatures at the stopover site affected the arrival timing of Lesser whitethroat only. This is probably because this species breed at higher northern latitudes and fine-tune their migration timing to match local conditions. Our results show that spring migration can be influenced by exogenous cues such as weather condition and food availability, and the level of response is species-specific. Moreover, some species show flexibility and fine-tuned migration speed in response to local conditions en route. While flexibility seems advantageous, dependence on multiple sites with varying conditions may ultimately limit advanced arrival to the breeding ground and result in mismatch with optimal conditions.

AB  - Although individuals with schizophrenia typically present deficits in social interaction, little is known about the quality of their parent-infant interactions. In the present study, we assessed the behavioral effects of neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion (nVHL) in female rats (nVHL is known to induce schizophrenia-like deficits in males). Sexually naive adult nVHL or sham female rats received cognitive and social tests, and their maternal behavior was observed in independent groups of adult nVHL and sham rats on postpartum days 2, 6, and 12. Compared to Sham females, naive nVHL rats displayed elevated locomotor activity, less social interaction, and disrupted habituation of the acoustic startle response (ASR), while dorsal immobility (a defensive behavioral response) and prepulse inhibition of ASR were not affected. Although all nVHL mothers retrieved their pups, adopted the crouching posture, and nursed them, they showed disturbances in the display of pup body licking and nest building. Furthermore, a high proportion of nVHL mothers displayed atypical retrieval of pups and re-retrieving of pups, atypical nest-building, excavation, and cannibalism, as well a high level of these behaviors. These data indicate that cognition, locomotor activity, and maternal care is disrupted in nVHL female, suggesting disturbances in mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic systems and/or in social cognition.

AB  - Simple Summary Salmonella spp. is a very important pathogen in the livestock industry and public health, which poses a major threat to global public health. Yaks and their by-products have a significant economic status in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of salmonella in yak farms and to conduct a molecular characterization and tests on its pathogenicity in mice with the use of salmonella isolated from yaks with diarrhea as well as from drinking water samples. The prevalence of salmonella was 19.75% of 162 samples collected from yak farms, and all isolates were found to belong to the serovar of Salmonella Derby and ST40. All Salmonella Derby isolates from both fecal and drinking water samples from 13 farms were clonally related based on SNP alignment. Salmonella Derby was still detected positively in the feces of model mice on day 24 post-injection. This study reports the prevalence of Salmonella Derby in yaks with diarrhea and in their drinking water. In addition, the pathogenicity of the S. Derby in mice was investigated. Findings suggest that Salmonella Derby excreted by diarrheic yaks is a source of contamination for other yaks and the environment and is highly pathogenic to mice. Seeing that Salmonella Derby has become one of the most common Salmonella serovars, this situation gives rise to further risk from the potential spread of food-borne diseases. Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Derby (S. Derby) is one of the numerous non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars and has been recognized as a food-borne pathogen. In 2019, outbreaks of salmonellosis were reported in 13 yak farms in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, China. A total of 32 salmonella strains were isolated from 162 fecal samples of yaks with diarrhea as well as from drinking water samples. The isolates were subjected to serovar identification, animal experiments, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses. The serovar of all the isolates was S. Derby, and the sequence types (STs) were ST40. The analysis of the differences of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed that the salmonella strains isolated from 13 farms were clonally related. Animal experiments showed that the lethal dose (LD50) was 4.57 x 10(7) CFU (colony-forming units); the shedding time of S. Derby in mice was 24 days; the bacterial loads in spleen were higher than those in other organs (ileum, liver, and cecum). Pathological analyses by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed obvious damage in the spleen, liver, and intestine. These results indicate that the S. Derby from yaks can cause infection in mice.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Enterotype (ET) is defined based on different gut microbial community composition. It has been considered as a critical factor strongly associated with the porcine feed efficiency and growth characteristic. However, little is known about whether the ET clustering depends on the pig breeds and the effects of the different enterotypes on the butyrate metabolism in pigs. Therefore, we studied Jinhua pig's enterotype by using 16S rRNA high throughput sequencing, and then analyzed the interaction between enterotype and butyrate production. Results showed that we identified three ETs driven by discriminative genera dominated by Lactobacillus, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, and Bacteroides, respectively. Significant differences in the fecal contents of butyrate production and butyrate-producing bacteria were observed among ETs. These findings present a first overview of the enterotypes clustering in Jinhua pigs and provide new insights into the relationship between the different ETs and intestinal butyrate production.
   Gut microbiota is thought to play a crucial role in nutrient digestion for pigs, especially in processing indigestible polysaccharides in the diets to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). However, the link between microbiota community structure and phenotypic performances are poorly understood. In the present study, the fecal samples of 105 Jinhua pigs at 105 days of age were clustered into three enterotypes (ETs, ET1, ET2, and ET3) that are subpopulations of distinct bacterial community composition by using 16S rRNA high throughput sequencing. The alpha-diversity indices (the OTU number and Shannon index) were significantly different among the ETs (p < 0.001). At the genus level, the ET1 group was over-represented by Lactobacillus (17.49%) and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (11.78%), the ET2 group was over-represented by Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (17.49%) and Bifidobacterium (11.78%), and the ET3 group was over-represented by Bacteroides (18.17%). Significant differences in the fecal contents of butyrate were observed among ETs, with the highest level detected in ET3 and the lowest in ET2 (p < 0.05). Consistently, more copies of the terminal genes for butyrate synthesis, butyrate kinase (Buk) and butyryl coenzyme A (CoA): acetate CoA transferase (But) were detected by qPCR in the fecal samples of the ET3 group as compared to other two groups (p < 0.05). In addition, of the two genes, But was demonstrated to be more relevant to the butyrate content (R = 0.7464) than Buk (R = 0.4905) by correlation analysis. In addition, based on the taxonomic analysis, we found that Faecalibacterium was the most relevant butyrate-producing genera with fecal butyrate contents in Jinhua pigs, followed by Butyricicoccus, Eubacterium, Butyricimonas, Blautia, and Anaerostipes, all of which showed significantly higher richness in ET3 than as compared to ET1 and ET2 (p < 0.05). Collectively, this work presents a first overview of the enterotypes clustering in Jinhua pigs and will help to unravel the functional implications of ETs for the pig's phenotypic performance and nutrient metabolism.

Scent-marking requires selective strategies to increase the likelihood that these signals persist in the environment and are successfully received. Bears are solitary, non-territorial carnivores, which scent-mark trees, substrate, and other objects to communicate with conspecifics. Signallers place scent marks on trees to increase the detectability of their signals, and possibly also to communicate their size and status. We assessed scent-marking tree selectivity of Andean bears, Tremarctos ornatus, in Ecuadorian cloud forests at two spatial scales: the individual-tree level and at a local scale (3-m radius). We recorded characteristics of marked and unmarked trees along bear trails (5.49 km in total) in the Eastern Cordillera of the Ecuadorian Andes, near the Sumaco Biosphere Reserve. To decrease dimensionality and multicollinearity before explanatory analyses, we performed Principal Component Analysis on data from 467 trees (65 marked trees, 54 control trees, 348 radius plot trees) of 48 tree species. We then used Generalized Linear Models, model selection, and model averaging to discover that Andean bears preferred rubbing leaning trees, aromatic tree species, and hardwood trees with smaller and thicker leaves containing less nitrogen. Thirteen of 59 marking sites contained multiple marked trees, but site-level data do not indicate why bears marked multiple trees at some sites but not others. We thus encourage further analyses of marked-tree cluster sites and their relationship to productive food resources and reproduction, which might present important communication hubs for ursids.

AB  - The ultraphytoplankton composition and dynamics were assessed during a Saharan dust event occurring off the southern Tunisian coasts during the MERITE-HIPPOCAMPE Trans-Mediterranean oceanographic cruise. The composition of atmospheric dust was characterized in terms of nutriments and trace metals. Data-assimilative hydrodynamic model revealed no differences in the hydrological features along the sampling track and almost no water transport occurred during the period of atmospheric deposition. Dust deposition increased the growth rates and the productivity of the major phytoplanktonic cytometric groups, resulting in the highest surface biomass along the Mediterranean transect. One group, distinguished by low fluorescence and nanoplanktonic size, reacted to dust deposition within hours, exhibiting the highest growth rate and net productivity. The dust composition showed a substantial enrichment with organic phosphorous representing (56 % of Total phosphorus) and trace metals mainly Fe, Mn and V.

AB  - Plants have to allocate resources into their growth and reproduction but also in phytochemicals used in interactions with their environment. Some species display an extraordinarily high diversity of such phytochemicals, called chemodiversity. In stands with different neighbors, plot chemodiversity may be even higher and provide associational resistance. Little is known about trade-offs in investment into growth and reproduction versus chemodiversity in plant individuals growing in chemically different neighborhoods.We investigated such trade-offs using the perennial Tanacetum vulgare, which shows differences in leaf terpenoid composition, forming distinct chemotypes. We planted plots consisting of five plants of one of five chemotypes (homogenous neighborhoods) and plots consisting of five different chemotypes (heterogenous) in a field. Plants within each block were offspring from different mother plants (here called maternal genotypes). Over 2 years, plant performance traits related to growth and reproduction were recorded and the leaf terpenoid profiles were measured once. Depending on the chemotype, plants had significantly different chances of flowering. Plants in heterogenous plots produced a higher maximum number of flower heads than those in homogenous plots. The maternal genotype explained some of the variance in growth- and reproduction-related traits. No significant correlations were found between the terpenoid functional Hill diversity (FHD) or its components (terpenoid richness, evenness, and structural disparity) and growth- and reproduction-related plant traits. Our results suggest that both the terpenoid chemotype of an individual and the chemodiversity of its neighborhood can impact reproduction-related traits, possibly driven by interactions of the individual with the environment and different resource allocation.

AB  - Plants resist herbivores and pathogens by using constitutive (baseline) and inducible (change in defense after an attack) defenses. Inducibility has long been predicted to trade off with constitutive defense, reflecting the economic use of resources. However, empirical evidence for such tradeoffs is variable, and we still lack understanding about when and where defense trade-offs occur. We tested for tradeoffs between constitutive and induced defenses in natural populations of three species of long-lived pines (Pinus balfouriana, P. flexilis, P. longaeva) that differ greatly in constitutive defense and resistance to mountain pine beetle (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae). We also assessed how climate influenced constitutive and inducible defenses. At seven high-elevation sites in the western U.S., we simulated MPB attack to induce defenses and measured concentrations of terpene-based phloem defenses on days 0, 15, and 30. Constitutive and induced defenses did not trade off among or within species. Simulated MPB attack induced large increases in defense concentrations in all species independent of constitutive levels. MPB and its symbiotic fungi typically kill trees and thus could be selective forces maintaining strong inducibility within and among species. The contrasting constitutive concentrations in these species could be driven by the adaptation for specializing in harsh, high-elevation environments (e.g., P. balfouriana and P. longaeva) or by competition (e.g., P. flexilis), though these hypotheses have not been empirically examined. Climate influenced defenses, with the greatest concentrations of constitutive and induced defenses occurring at the coldest and driest sites. The interactions between climate and defenses have implications for these species under climate change.

AB  - Vegetable oils rich in unsaturated fatty acids have been shown to improve animal health and enrich milk with functional fatty acids in various studies. This study investigates the effects of dietary supplementation with hemp seed oil (HSO), a native vegetable oil from the "longevity village" of Bama (Guangxi, China), on the milk performance, milk fatty acid composition, blood indicators, and rumen bacterial community of milk-producing buffalo. Seventeen healthy, four-year-old, crossbred, milk-producing buffaloes with the same parity (three), as well as similar body weights (BW = 580 +/- 25 kg), number of days producing milk (DIM, 153 +/- 10 d), and milk yields (8.56 +/- 0.89 kg/d) were divided into three groups (n = 6, 5, and 6) and assigned to the following diets: (1) no HSO supplement (H0, n = 6), (2) a supplement of 100 g/d of HSO (H1, n = 5), and (3) a supplement of 200 g/d of HSO (H2, n = 6). The total experimental period was 42 days (including a 14-day adaptation period and a 28-day treatment period). The data were statistically analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. The results showed that compared to that of no HSO supplement group, the dry matter intake (DMI) showed a decreasing tendency (p = 0.06), while feed efficiency and rumen fermentation remained similar across all the groups (p > 0.05) with dietary HSO supplementation. Moreover, with dietary HSO supplementation, the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) (p = 0.05) and catalase (CAT) (p < 0.01) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (p = 0.02) contents in the serum were greatly increased, with the highest levels observed in the H2 group (increased by 1.16 U/mL, 1.15 U/mL, and 134.51 U/mL, respectively). In contrast, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was significantly decreased with dietary HSO supplementation (p = 0.02) and was the lowest in the H1 group (decreased by 0.72 nmol/mL). The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) content in the blood showed an increasing tendency with dietary HSO supplementation (p = 0.09). Moreover, with dietary HSO supplementation, the proportions of C18:0 (p = 0.02), C18:1n9t (p = 0.02), C18:2n6c (p = 0.02), C18:3n3 (p < 0.01), C18:2n9c (p = 0.04), omega-3 (p = 0.02), and omega-6 (p = 0.02) were significantly increased, with the highest levels observed in the H2 group (increased by 5.29 g/100 g FA, 1.81 g/100 g FA, 0.55 g/100 g FA, 0.14 g/100 g FA, 0.75 g/100 g FA, 0.17 g/100 g FA, and 0.56 g/100 g FA, respectively). Additionally, rumen Acetobacter abundance was significantly affected by HSO addition (p = 0.03), with rumen Acetobacter abundance decreasing in the H1 group (by 0.55%) and increasing in the H2 group (by 0.73%). These results suggest that adding HSO to milk-producing buffalo diets does not affect feed efficiency or rumen fermentation, although it decreases the DMI. Meanwhile, it can improve the nutritional quality of milk, enhance the antioxidant status, and regulate blood lipid metabolism in milk-producing buffaloes.

AB  - Simple Summary As a product originating from the most natural living conditions with free foraging, red deer (Cervus elaphus) meat is becoming increasingly popular among consumers. A greater supply of this type of meat can be ensured by dynamically developing red deer farming on permanent grasslands. The study presents a comparison of the properties of lipids and the content of cadmium and lead in the LL and SM muscles of red deer kept in forest, organic farm, and conventional farm feeding grounds. The greater species and phytoncide diversity in the organic feeding ground enriched the quantitative profile and significantly increased the content of beneficial polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) (CLA-conjugated linoleic acid, ALA-alpha-linolenic acid, AA-arachidonic acid, and EPA-eicosapentaenoic acid) and the sum of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), n-6 PUFA, and n-3 PUFA, in comparison with conventional farm and forest feeding grounds. It also contributed to a significantly lower n-6/n-3 ratio in both muscles. The study provides valuable data on the nutritional value and ecological safety of venison, which should be regarded as a health-enhancing food product. Furthermore, the present results can help breeders to make decisions about the locations of farms and the choice of red deer nutrition strategies. The aim of the study was to compare the properties of lipids and the content of cadmium and lead in the meat of red deer (Cervus elaphus) kept in a forest feeding ground (FFG) and on organic and conventional farms in Poland. Longissimus lumborum (LL) and Musculus semimembranosus (SM) muscles were collected for the study from 36 red deer carcasses in an equal sex and age ratio (3 and 4 years old). From April to October, the animals consumed only the vegetation growing in the feeding grounds. The floristic and phytoncide composition, as well as the fodder value, of the feeding grounds were assessed. Additionally, the intramuscular fat and cholesterol content, the profile, sum, and ratios of fatty acids (FAs), lipid nutraceutical parameters, and cadmium and lead content were determined in LL and SM. The plant composition comprised 116 species in the organic feeding ground (OFG) and 78 species in the conventional feeding ground (CFG). The LL and SM muscles of the red deer from the organic and forest feeding grounds exhibited significantly lower amounts of fat and cholesterol than those from the conventional system. The differences in the fatty acid composition between the three groups were quite small. Differences in intramuscular fat content contributed to a higher percentage of PUFAs in the FFG and OFG, in comparison to the CFG. In all types of feeding ground, the cadmium (0.002 to 0.008 mg/kg) and lead (0.009 to 0.019 mg/kg) content determined in the meat did not pose a threat to consumers.

AB  - The behaviour and spatial use patterns of juvenile manta rays within their critical nursery habitats remain largely undocumented. Here, we report on the horizontal movements and residency of juvenile reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) at a recently discovered nursery site in the Wayag lagoon, Raja Ampat, Indonesia. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, we provide further corroborative evidence that the lagoon serves as an important M. alfredi nursery. A total of 34 juvenile rays were photo-identified from 47 sightings in the sheltered nursery between 2013-2021. Five (14.7%) of these individuals were resighted for at least 486 days (~1.3 years), including two juveniles resighted after 641 and 649 days (~1.7 years), still using the nursery. Visually estimated (n=34) disc widths (DW) of juveniles using the nursery site ranged from 150-240 cm (mean +/- SD: 199 +/- 19), and the DW of two juveniles measured using drones were 218 and 219 cm. Five juveniles were tracked using GPS-enabled satellite transmitters for 12-69 days (mean +/- SD: 37 +/- 22) in 2015 and 2017, and nine juveniles were tracked using passive acoustic transmitters for 69-439 days (mean +/- SD: 182 +/- 109) from May 2019-September 2021. Satellite-tracked individuals exhibited restricted movements within Wayag lagoon. The minimum core activity space (50% Utilisation Distribution-UD) estimated for these five individuals ranged from 1.1-181.8 km(2) and the extent of activity space (95% UD) between 5.3-1,195.4 km(2) in area. All acoustically tagged individuals displayed high residency within the nursery area, with no acoustic detections recorded outside the lagoon in the broader Raja Ampat region. These juveniles were detected by receivers in the lagoon throughout the 24 h diel cycle, with more detections recorded at night and different patterns of spatial use of the lagoon between day and night. The observed long-term residency of juvenile M. alfredi provides further compelling evidence that the Wayag lagoon is an important nursery area for this globally vulnerable species. These important findings have been used to underpin the formulation of management strategies to specifically protect the Wayag lagoon, which will be instrumental for the survival and recovery of M. alfredi populations in Raja Ampat region.

AB  - Simple Summary Cryptorchidism is believed to be one of the leading causes of infertility in male yaks. In this study, we compared the morphology of the normal testis of the yak with that of the cryptorchidism, and found dysplasia of the seminiferous tubules, impaired tightness of the Sertoli cells, and a disruption of the integrity of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) in the cryptorchidism. Based on RNA-seq, bioinformatics analysis and biological experiments, CAV1 up-regulates or down-regulates the expression levels of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-11 via the FAK/ERK pathway in vitro cell model assays. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which CAV1 modulates tight junctions and BTB, suggesting that CAV1 may be involved in the regulation of the occurrence of yak cryptorchidism.Abstract Yaks, a valuable livestock species endemic to China's Tibetan plateau, have a low reproductive rate. Cryptorchidism is believed to be one of the leading causes of infertility in male yaks. In this study, we compared the morphology of the normal testis of the yak with that of the cryptorchidism, and found dysplasia of the seminiferous tubules, impaired tightness of the Sertoli cells, and a disruption of the integrity of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) in the cryptorchidism. Previous studies have shown that CAV1 significantly contributes to the regulation of cell tight junctions and spermatogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesize that CAV1 may play a regulatory role in tight junctions and BTB in Yaks Sertoli cells, thereby influencing the development of cryptorchidism. Additional analysis using immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting confirmed that CAV1 expression is up-regulated in yak cryptorchidism. CAV1 over-expression plasmids and small RNA interference sequences were then transfected in vitro into yak Sertoli cells. It was furthermore found that CAV1 has a positive regulatory effect on tight junctions and BTB integrity, and that this regulatory effect is achieved through the FAK/ERK signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings, the first application of CAV1 to yak cryptorchidism, provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of cell tight junctions and BTB. This paper suggests that CAV1 could be used as a potential therapeutic target for yak cryptorchidism and may provide insight for future investigations into the occurrence of cryptorchidism, the maintenance of a normal physiological environment for spermatogenesis and male reproductive physiology in the yak.

AB  - The optimum levels of essential amino acids (EAAs) are required to be maintained in fish feed for obtaining normal body protein synthesis and muscle growth. This study aimed to determine the optimum dietary EAA pattern for adult pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus) by the amino acid (AA) deletion method. A total of 165 adult fish of 1109.83 +/- 14.26 g (initial body weight +/- standard deviation) were equally distributed among 11 treatments in a recirculation aquaculture system. Each of the 11 treatments consisted of three randomly arranged replicates (tanks) and 5 fish were stocked per tank. During the 60-day experimental period, fish were fed with 11 diets including a control diet (CD) and 10 EAA limiting diets (LDs) two times daily until apparent satiation. The body nitrogen (N) retention and weight gain in fish fed with EAA LDs was lower (P 0.05) than the CD. The feed efficiency in fish fed with CD was similar (P 0.05) to most EAA LDs, except arginine and histidine LDs. The specific growth rate in fish fed with tryptophan, arginine and histidine LDs was different (P < 0.05) as compared to the CD. Based on the present N retention data obtained through the AA deletion method, the optimum pattern of dietary EAAs estimated in relation to lysine requirement (100%) was as follows: arginine 72.16%; phenylalanine 40.83%; histidine 30.15%; isoleucine 53.01%; leucine 81.71%; methionine 24.97%; threonine 58.20%; tryptophan 9.13% and valine 54.69%.

AB  - The term 'coexistence' is increasingly being used by academics and practitioners to reflect a re-conceptualisation of human-wildlife interactions (HWI). Coexistence has become a popular buzzword and is central to several proposals for transformative change in biodiversity conservation, including convivial conservation. Although ideas about how to achieve coexistence proliferate, critical exploration of the framing and use of the term is lacking. Through analysis of semi-structured interviews, webinars and online and offline documents, this paper critically interrogates how 'coexistence' is being conceptualised and translated into practice. We characterise coexistence as a boundary object that reflects a broadly agreed on 'hopeful mission', while being flexible enough to be meaningful for a wide range of actors. We identify three main framings of coexistence, which reflect the ways of knowing, values and approaches of different epistemic communities. We find that although the idea of coexistence has the potential to help facilitate transformative change in wildlife management, so far it largely manifests in practice as a positive-sounding label for standardised packages of tools and incentives. We argue that as the meaning of coexistence continues to be contested, there is an opportunity for activists, academics, and practitioners to reclaim its transformative roots. We identify a role for convivial conservation within this agenda: to re-politicise coexistence through the concept of 'meaningful coexistence'.

AB  - Exposure to mercury (Hg) and silver (Ag) has been shown to induce autoimmune diseases in genetically sus-ceptible rodents. Here, A.SW mice were initially exposed to HgCl2, AgNO3 or tap water (control) for 3 weeks. After 13 weeks of stoppage, all mice had secondary exposure to 203HgCl2. After secondary exposure, higher and earlier ANoA titers were observed in mice initially exposed to Hg or Ag compared to control. Further, mice initially exposed to Ag showed higher total IgG1 and IgG2a, Whole Body Retention and lymph nodes and spleen accumulation of Hg compared to mice initially exposed to Hg and controls. These findings showed an earlier and stronger immunological response in A.SW mice compared with control, following re-exposure to heavy metals indicating an immunological memory. Additionally, secondary exposure to a different heavy metal may aggra-vate the effects of exposure of at least one of the metals indicating cross-reactivity.

AB  - The current study is focuses on a sustainable agricultural ecosystem for soil fertility and human health improvement. To estimate the effects of applying organic amendments (compost, vermicompost, biochar, organic manure and rapeseed cake) on crop growth of maize and nutrient uptake in calcareous soil, eleven treatments were studied, which included compost (CM), cow manure vermicompost (CMV), pig manure vermicompost (PMV), biochar vermicompost (BCV), biochar (BC), conventional synthetic fertilizers (NPK), CMV in addition to NPK (CMV + NPK), and PMV in addition to NPK (PMV + NPK), organic manure (OM), rapeseed cake (RC) and control without any fertilization (CK). Maize above and belowground biomass were analyzed in glass greenhouse experiments. The results showed that nitrogen and carbon contents showed significant differences among treatments. Vermicompost significantly showed higher biomass as compared to inorganic fertilizers except for RC. All vermicompost treatments also showed better nutrient availability as compared to NPK and CK. In conclusion, vermicompost with all substrates are recommended for application as organic fertilizers. Our study will help promote the application of organic fertilizers alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizers rather than only inorganic fertilizers for environmental health and sustainability.

AB  - Gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) serve as key priming sites for intestinal adaptive immune responses. Most of our understanding of GALT function and development arises from studies in mice. However, the diversity, structure and cellular composition of GALT differs markedly between mammalian species and the developmental window in which distinct GALT structures develop in large mammals remains poorly understood. Given the importance of pigs as models of human disease, as well as their role in livestock production, we adapted a recently developed protocol for the isolation of human GALT to assess the diversity, development and immune composition of large intestinal GALT in neonatal and adult pigs. We demonstrate that the large intestine of adult pigs contains two major GALT types; multifollicular submucosal GALT that we term submucosal lymphoid clusters (SLC) which develop prenatally, and as yet undescribed mucosal isolated lymphoid follicles (M-ILF), which arise after birth. Using confocal laser microscopy and flow cytometry, we additionally assess the microanatomy and lymphocyte composition of SLC and M-ILF, compare them to jejunal Peyer's patches (PP), and describe the maturation of these structures. Collectively, our results provide a deeper understanding of the diversity and development of GALT within the porcine large intestine.

AB  - Several fragrant tree species, i.e., Aesculus hippocastanum, Magnolia brooklynensis,Yellow Bird,. Catalpa bignonioides, and Prunus serrulata were previously registered in the database. A. hippocastanum, Ailanthus altissima, C. bignonioides, and Robinia pseudoacacia were found to be the most common and important species in the parks and gardens of Yerevan, Armenia. These species were found in almost all of the studied gardens. The present study aimed to investigate the species composition of the pests of fragrant trees in different landscaped areas of Yerevan, Armenia, during 2020-2021. This study found 48 species of pests of fragrant trees in various parks and gardens. The species belonged to three taxonomic classes, 11 orders, and 33 families. These pest species significantly suppressed the growth and development of fragrant trees, and in some cases, even caused the trees to dry out. In the early spring, the pest species Parthenolecanium corni Bouche., Euproctis chrysorrhoea, Aphis laburni Kalt., Myzus cerasi, Panonychus ulmi, Tetranychus urticae, and Schizotetranychus pruni were observed on fragrant plants. Notably, this study revealed six species of fragrant tree pests, of which four, i.e., Dasineura gleditchiae, Halyomorpha halys, Trioza neglecta, and Calophya rhois, were found for the first time in the fauna of Armenia, and two, i.e., Obolodiplosis robiniae and Euura tibialis, were found previously in Tavush Region, Dilijan, Armenia.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict poses significant challenges to both wildlife conservation and rural livelihoods, particularly where agricultural lands border forest habitats. This study assessed the extent, patterns, and socioeconomic impacts of crop damage by the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) in Kupwara, Kashmir, Northwestern Himalayas. Household surveys (n = 236) and field assessments across 15 villages revealed that 95% of respondents experienced crop damage, with maize identified as the most vulnerable crop. Land use analysis showed that forests covered 66.73% of the area, intensifying bear incursions into croplands. The average economic loss per farmer was Indian Rupee5,150.43 +/- Indian Rupee387.78 for maize and Indian Rupee32,071.85 +/- Indian Rupee4,853.05 for apples. Mean production losses were 171.68 kg for maize and 64.14 boxes for apples, highlighting significant livelihood impacts. Regression analysis showed a significant positive relationship between crop loss and the distance of fields from houses (p = 0.0185). Temporal analysis indicated that most bear attacks occurred during the autumn and at night. Despite adopting mitigation measures like guarding (56.36%), scarecrows, and noise-making, 40.68% of respondents perceived no measure as effective. Negative experiences with crop damage significantly influenced conservation attitudes, with livestock and maize losses emerging as strong negative predictors. The study emphasizes the urgent need for targeted mitigation strategies, enhanced compensation mechanisms, and community-based management approaches to promote human-wildlife coexistence in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - Human-carnivore conflicts threaten carnivores worldwide; they are an escalating concern for the conservation of carnivores and the well-being of subsistence farmers. While most of the available information focuses on large carnivores and livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goats, the interaction between mesocarnivores and poultry is a significant challenge that has not received sufficient attention. Chile is no exception; few studies suggest that carnivore predation on poultry threatens small-scale producers and is a nationwide problem. To better assess this conflict, we developed a survey aimed at professionals who work directly with small-scale farmers across the country to examine the current conflict between native, invasive, and domestic carnivores (dogs and cats) and small-scale poultry farmers in rural areas of Chile. A staggering 92.4% of professionals surveyed mentioned that small-scale farmers deal with predation issues, with dogs (with or without owner) being the most frequently mentioned predator (86%), followed by Lycalopex foxes, lesser grison (Galictis cuja) and American mink (Neovison vison). Our results show that confinement, the primary method to prevent predation, could reduce predation event frequency. Despite being illegal, lethal control was mentioned by 36.4% of surveyed professionals as a used method to reduce predation, therefore, representing a potential threat to native carnivores and animal welfare. Addressing poultry predation by native and non-native carnivores (dog and mink) is a crucial step toward advancing human-mesocarnivore coexistence in Chile.

AB  - Soybean (Glycine max) is the most widely grown legume crop in the world, providing important economic value. Pest herbivory damage by insects and mammalian wildlife, in particular the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), limits yields in soybean. Incorporating trypsin inhibitors (TIs) as plant protectant against herbivory pests has been of interest. We previously showed that the overexpression of soybean TIs in soybean conferred insect deterrence under greenhouse experiments. In this study, we examined the potential of transgenic TI-overexpressing lines in deterring insects under field conditions at Knoxville, Tennessee. Our results indicate that the overexpression of TI could lead to a significant reduction in leaf defoliation of the transgenic compared to non-transgenic lines without negatively impacting plant growth and yield under field conditions. Furthermore, we extended our study by comprehensive evaluation of these transgenic plants against the white-tailed deer herbivory in a separate field setting at Jackson, Tennessee, and with controlled deer feeding experiments. No significant differences in growth characteristics were found between transgenic and non-transgenic lines under field conditions. There were also no significant differences in deer deterrence between transgenic and non-transgenic lines in ambient deer herbivory field or controlled deer feeding trials. Our study provides further insights into more exploration of the role of TI genes in pest control in this economically important crop.

AB  - The gut microbiota (GM) participates in various physiological processes in fish. Although there are many host- and environment-related factors affecting the composition of fish GM, there are relatively few reports on the inheritance of fish GM across seasons and the impact of environmental water microbiota (WM) on fish GM. Here, we aimed to identify the differences in the composition of Rhinogobio cylindricus GM (RGM) in autumn and summer, and to determine how the summer RGM affected the autumn RGM. Samples of R. cylindricus were collected in summer and autumn and the composition of GM was analyzed through high-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA. Our results showed that the alpha diversity indices of RGM in autumn were significantly higher than those in summer. The RGM collected in summer and autumn showed significant differences. The relative abundances of the most dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were significantly different between the summer and autumn RGM samples. The proportions of OTUs in autumn RGM from summer RGM were significantly lower than those in WM. Moreover, there was no sampling site difference in the proportion of RGM compared with that of WM. Our results provide important insight into understanding the maintenance mechanisms of RGM.

AB  - Context Baits are used to deliver lethal or other substances in wildlife management programs across the globe. Successful baiting campaigns are contingent upon the availability of baits to target animals. Bait density is often increased in an attempt to improve bait encounter probabilities. However, this comes with a concomitant increase in cost and may result in significant bait wastage if deployed in areas of low target species activity.Aims The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness, efficiency and cost of different bait transect methods in intersecting home and core ranges of feral pigs as a case study to determine optimal spacing and placement of baiting transects.Methods The authors simulated a variety of systematically spaced aerial transects, watercourse-aligned aerial transects and ground transects along property boundaries and farm tracks, and compared them with home and core ranges of feral pigs, at two study sites in Queensland, Australia. Transect effectiveness at intersecting pig ranges was determined through beta-regression and estimated marginal means (emmeans); efficiency was considered as emmeans per unit of transect length.Key results The study found that systematically spaced aerial transects at 4 km intervals were the most efficient means of intersecting both home and core ranges of feral pigs. Additionally, no alternate transect method, either aerial or ground, provided significantly greater effectiveness at intersecting feral pig home and core ranges at these study sites. Ground transects along farm tracks and property boundaries were also between 113% and 192% more expensive than aerial transects at 4 km spaced intervals for either fixed-wing or rotary aircraft.Conclusion Systematically spaced aerial transects at 4 km intervals are among the most effective and are the most efficient means of intersecting feral pig ranges at the study sites examined.Implications Our methodology offers a blueprint for both vaccination and toxin baiting programs to assess and compare bait transect placements. More specifically for feral pig control, aerial transects with 4 km systematic spacing provide an effective and efficient means for intersecting feral pig ranges. Furthermore, additional data on bait encounter and interaction probabilities are required to determine transect effectiveness at bait uptake by the target species.
   Baiting is used in conservation and invasive species management. Increased bait density increases probability of bait encounter, but it can also escalate costs and risks wastage. To refine bait placement, we compared simulated aerial and ground transects with feral pig ranges in Queensland. Aerial transects at 4 km intervals were the most efficient, and no alternate transect placement significantly improved effectiveness at intersecting pig ranges. Additional data on bait encounter and interactions is critical to assess effectiveness of bait uptake. Photograph by Darryl Duff, Charleville.

AB  - Typically, conservation is achieved by excluding, evacuating, or legally dismissing the rights of local/native people from using protected areas, resulting in evictions, ongoing distress, and dejection among many Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs) worldwide. However, the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Wildlife Sanctuary (BRTWS) in the Western Ghats offers a unique example of conservation where local tribal people, Soligas, have persisted and been living with tigers, elephants, bears, leopards, and other wild animals for millennia. In the past, they managed the forest which, under the colonial and later modern conservation policies, has been restricted and penalised. However, Soligas' continuous existence in the Sanctuary suggests that people's knowledge and skills must be contributing to enable them to co-exist with wild animals. Our integrated analysis of ecological, socio-cultural, and policy aspects and experience of working with Soligas in the BRT landscape typifies the importance of locals' knowledge in managing the forest - urging the need to recognise and support IPLCs' work for achieving conservation as well as socio-economic outcomes. This Note highlights the necessity to understand, recognise, and embrace IPLCs' knowledge systems from a conservation context. Emerging future economic opportunities through Nature-based Solutions, if developed equitably, sustainably, and in culturally appropriate ways in line with IPLCs' aspirations and responsibilities, can benefit both wildlife and people, while reducing wildlife conflicts and delivering multiple-faceted conservation outcomes globally.

AB  - Stable isotope analysis of animal tissues is a valuable tool for understanding foraging ecology, habitat use, and developmental changes throughout an animal's life. Stable isotope values of whisker segments offer long-term data on mammalian foraging, as whisker growth incorporates isotopic signals from the diet and reflects dietary shifts during events like birth and weaning. We estimated birth dates of 7-week-old Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) pups (n = 17) by analyzing stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope values measured from sequentially sampled whisker segments to evaluate the technique's accuracy in predicting early developmental events. We also estimated prenatal and postnatal whisker growth rates to construct a timeline for each pup using the stable isotope values measured longitudinally along each whisker. All pups showed consistent trends in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values along the length of their whiskers, with no evidence of a weaning signal. Post-birth, delta N-15 values across the sequentially sampled segments of vibrissae steadily increased, likely reflecting the pups' dependence on maternal milk. The delta C-13 values remained mostly constant, suggesting that mothers did not forage far from their breeding colonies, and the delta N-15 values were similar across individual timelines, indicating that mothers occupied a narrow trophic range.

AB  - Background: Data regarding yeast microbiota in goat milk is scarce.
   Aims: To isolate and identify species of the genus Candida in milk samples from clinically healthy goats, and evaluate their enzymatic activity and biofilm formation.
   Methods: 1092 milk samples from clinically healthy goats were collected and processed. The yeast isolates were identified by phenotypic, methods and their enzymatic activity (phospholipase, hemolysin and protease) and biofilm formation evaluated.
   Results: We obtained 221 Candida isolates belonging to six species: Candida kefyr (35.7%), Candida guilliermondii (33%), Candida famata (23.5%), Candida glabrata (5.9%), Candida albicans (1.35%) and Candida parapsilosis sensu lato (0.45%). Protease activity was detected in all Candida species while hemolysin activity was only present in C. kefyr, C. guilliermondii, C. famata and C. albicans. Only C. albicans showed phospholipase activity. With the exception of C. parapsilosis sensu lato, all Candida species formed biofilm, with 60.19% of the isolates being poor producers, 9.93% moderate producers, and 1.35% strong producers.
   Conclusions: The milk of clinically healthy goats contains several species of the genus Candida that could play a role as opportunistic pathogens in mastitis. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. on behalf of Asociacion Espanola de Micologia.

AB  - Evolutionary correlations between chemical defense and protection by mutualist bodyguards have been long predicted, but tests of these patterns remain rare. We use a phylogenetic framework to test for evolutionary correlations indicative of trade-offs or synergisms between direct defense in the form of plant secondary metabolism and indirect defense in the form of leaf domatia, across 33 species in the wild grape genus, Vitis. We also performed a bioassay with a generalist herbivore to associate our chemical phenotypes with herbivore palatability. Finally, we tested whether defensive traits correlated with the average abiotic characteristics of each species' contemporary range and whether these correlations were consistent with plant defense theory. We found a negative evolutionary correlation between domatia size and the diversity of secondary metabolites in Vitis leaf tissue across the genus, and also that leaves with a higher diversity and richness of secondary metabolites were less palatable to a generalist herbivore, consistent with a trade-off in chemical and mutualistic defense investment. Predictions from plant defense theory were not supported by associations between investment in defense phenotypes and abiotic variables. Our work demonstrates an evolutionary pattern indicative of a trade-off between indirect and direct defense strategies across the Vitis genus.

AB  - Context Wildlife agencies spend considerable effort developing comprehensive communication programs to educate various publics about chronic wasting disease (CWD). Deer hunters are important in CWD management, especially regarding surveillance and testing.Aims This article examined the influence of the number of years CWD had been in a state on hunters' knowledge of the disease. Knowledge level was then related to perceived risks associated with CWD, trust in the agency responsible for managing CWD and beliefs about CWD management.Methods Survey data were obtained from resident deer hunters in the US states of Kansas (n = 1170), North Dakota (n = 3242) and Illinois (n = 1237). State of residence served as one independent variable. The second independent variable was knowledge of CWD. Respondents were asked eight true/false questions regarding CWD (0 = incorrect, 1 = correct). A knowledge index was created by summing the correct responses. The index was categorized as low, medium, and high knowledge. There were four multiple-item dependent variables: risk to deer, risk to humans, hunters' trust in the CWD management agency, and beliefs about CWD management.Key results Kansas hunters had the highest knowledge, followed by North Dakota, then Illinois. As knowledge increased, perceived risk to humans decreased, and perceived risk to deer increased. There was a positive relationship between knowledge and trust in agency information. Across beliefs, high knowledge hunters agreed with positively worded statements and disagreed with negatively worded items more than either of the other two knowledge groups. Low knowledge respondents always reported the lowest belief scores, and the middle knowledge group was always in between the other two groups. All tests were statistically significant, but effect sizes were minimal.Conclusions CWD existed in Kansas for only 4 years when the study was conducted. Kansas hunters reported the highest percentage of correct knowledge questions. By comparison, the disease had existed in Illinois for 20 years; Illinois hunters reported the lowest percentage of correct responses. Knowledge is influenced by the newness of a disease. With a new disease, people attend to information campaigns. Over time, experience tempers concerns and knowledge about diseases.Implications Findings highlight complexities managers should consider when designing communication strategies to influence wildlife disease knowledge.

AB  - Ecological analyses typically involve many interacting variables. Ecologists often specify lagged interactions in community dynamics (i.e. vector-autoregressive models) or simultaneous interactions (e.g. structural equation models), but there is less familiarity with dynamic structural equation models (DSEM) that can include any simultaneous or lagged effect in multivariate time-series analysis. We propose a novel approach to parameter estimation for DSEM, which involves constructing a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) representing simultaneous and lagged path coefficients, and then fitting this as a generalized linear mixed model to missing and/or non-normal data. We provide a new R-package dsem, which extends the 'arrow interface' from path analysis to represent user-specified lags when constructing the GMRF. We also outline how the resulting nonseparable precision matrix can generalize existing separable models, for example, for time-series and species interactions in a vector-autoregressive model. We first demonstrate dsem by simulating a two-species vector-autoregressive model based on wolf-moose interactions on Isle Royale. We show that DSEM has improved precision when data are missing relative to a conventional dynamic linear model. We then demonstrate DSEM via two contrasting case studies. The first identifies a trophic cascade where decreased sunflower starfish has increased urchin and decreased kelp densities, while sea otters have a simultaneous positive effect on kelp in the California Current from 1999 to 2018. The second estimates how declining sea ice has decreased cold-water habitats, driving a decreased density for fall copepod predation and inhibiting early-life survival for Alaska pollock from 1963 to 2023. We conclude that DSEM can be fitted efficiently as a GLMM involving missing data, while allowing users to specify both simultaneous and lagged effects in a time-series structural model. DSEM then allows conceptual models (developed with stakeholder input or from ecological expertise) to be fitted to incomplete time series and provides a simple interface for granular control over the number of estimated time-series parameters. Finally, computational methods are sufficiently simple that DSEM can be embedded as component within larger (e.g. integrated population) models. We therefore recommend greater exploration and performance testing for DSEM relative to familiar time-series forecasting methods.

AB  - Plants connect both pollinators and herbivores, and motivate the exploration of community structure in ecological networks merging antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. Evidence has shown that the two opposite plant-animal interactions are not independent from each other, in particular, herbivores can affect plant-pollinator pairwise interactions. Here, we explored effects of herbivore-induced pollinator limitation on com-munity stability (including temporal stability and composition stability) of the mutualism-antagonism contin-uum. Our model demonstrated that pollinator limitation can boost up both temporal stability (i.e., the proportion of stable communities) and composition stability (i.e., species persistence), while the positive effects also depend on the strength of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. Specifically, a community with higher temporal stability has a higher composition stability. Meanwhile, the correlations between network architecture and composition stability are also affected by pollinator limitation. Therefore, our results highlight that pollinator limitation can enhance community stability and may alter network architecture-composition stability relation-ship, and further advance the interplay between multiple types of species interactions within ecological networks.

AB  - Sarcocystis spp. and Toxoplasma gondii are heteroxenous protozoan parasites, which form cysts in muscle tissue of intermediate hosts (IH) and oocysts in the intestinal mucosa of definitive hosts (DH). Wild boars (Sus scrofa) are IH for Sarcocystis miescheriana (with wild and domestic canids as DH), S. suihominis (with humans and nonhuman primates as DH) and T. gondii (with felids as DH). The aim of this study was to identify and characterize Sarcocystis spp. and T. gondii in the muscle tissue of wild boars hunted and/or consumed in Switzerland. DNA was extracted from muscle samples of 286 wild boars and tested by PCRs targeting the 18S rRNA gene of Sarcocystis spp., the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (cox1) gene of S. suihominis and by a qPCR targeting a 529 bp genomic repeat of T. gondii. Besides, 225 samples were processed by homogenization and direct microscopic examination and 42 samples by histopathology. Sarcocysts were detected microscopically in 89.3 % (201/225) and 35.7 % (15/42) of the samples, respectively. The 18S rRNA PCR detected parasite DNA in 91.3 % (261/286) of the samples, and all 62 sequences obtained were 100 % identical, and also with GenBank sequences reported as S. miescheriana, suggesting a high environmental contamination with canid faeces. The S. suihominis-cox1 PCR was positive in 1.75 % of the samples (5/286), and the six cox1 sequences (772 bp primers trimmed) obtained were 97.3-99.6 % similar among them and 97.7-100 % identical with a sequence reported as S. suihominis. Despite the identity differences, all these sequences were grouped together in a phylogenetic tree, in a sister clade of S. miescheriana sequences. All samples tested negative for T. gondii by qPCR. This study revealed for the first time the presence of S. suihominis in wild boars hunted in Switzerland.

AB  - Due to factors such as overfishing, hydropower development, and water pollution, their wild populations have drastically declined, with many species being classified as endangered or vulnerable. Understanding the driving factors behind the gut microbiota of cold-water fish holds significant implications for conservation. Therefore, to investigate the influence of different factors on the gut microbes of cold-water fish, 112 gut samples from farmed and wild habitats were collected from Schizothorax wangchiachii (herbivorous), Schizothorax kozlovi (omnivorous) and Percocypris pingi (carnivorous), in the Jinping Dahewan range of lower reaches of the Yalong River. The results of 16 S rRNA gene sequencing of the gut contents showed that habitat was the major factor influencing the gut microbes of the three cold-water fishes. In terms of microbial composition, farmed cold-water fish exhibited a dominant bacterial phylum, Proteobacteria (82 %), while those in wild environment presented multiple dominant taxa, such as Proteobacteria (38 %), Fusobacteria (30 %), Firmicutes (11 %), and Cyanobacteria (11 %). Gut microbial diversity, both alpha diversity and beta diversity, in wild cold-water fish was significantly higher than that in farmed individuals. Network complexity of gut microbiota was notably higher in wild cold-water fish than in farmed individuals. From farmed to wild environments, the relative influence of deterministic processes in the gut microbiota assembly mechanism of cold-water fish gradually diminishes, while the contribution of stochastic processes steadily increases. The gut microbiota construction mechanism in farmed cold-water fish was primarily influenced by deterministic processes of homogeneous selection, while in wild cold-water fish, it was mainly driven by stochastic processes of homogeneous dispersal. Overall, this study is an important reference for the study of the gut microbiota of cold-water fish and the conservation of their wild populations.

AB  - Estimating the abundance or density of wildlife populations is a critical part of species conservation and management, but estimates can vary greatly in precision and accuracy according to the sampling and statistical methods, sampling and ecological variation, and sample size. We used images of moose (Alces americanus) from camera traps to parameterize N-mixture models and tested the effect of ecological conditions, the spatial scale of measurement, and the criteria used to define independent detections on estimates of population abundance. We compared the model estimates to those generated empirically with aerial survey data, the standard method for many species of ungulate. We explored the sensitivity of estimates to model choice based on the common statistical criterion of parsimony. The two most parsimonious N-mixture models (i.e. AICc) were considerably biased, producing implausibly large and considerably imprecise estimates of abundance. Most of the other models produced estimates of moose abundance that were ecologically realistic and relatively accurate. The accuracy of population estimates produced by N-mixture models was not overly sensitive to the formulation of models, the scale at which ecological conditions were measured, or the criteria used to define independent detection and by extension sample size. Our results suggested that parsimony was a poor measure of the predictive accuracy of the population estimates produced with the N-mixture model. We recommend using a suite of models to generate predictions of abundance instead of the single top-ranked model. Collecting and processing data from the aerial survey was less expensive and took less time, but data from camera traps provided a broader set of insights into the behaviour of moose and the co-occurrence of competitors and predators.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is used to improve the welfare of captive animals by providing increased environmental variety, the provision of choice, and the opportunity to develop competency. The efficacy of a range of environmental enrichment should be measured on a species-by-species basis to encourage species-specific behaviours and to reduce abnormal behaviours. This study aimed to identify whether different types of enrichment affected feeding, locomotive or resting behaviours in two (1.1) captive lowland tapir Tapirus terrestris housed at Dartmoor Zoo in the hour after enrichment was provided. A baseline period occurred in which no enrichment was given in the morning. The experimental period followed, in which five nutritional enrichments and four forms of sensory enrichment items were provided, randomly alongside the tapirs' morning feed over a period of three months. Behavioural observations were collected at thirty second intervals during the hour immediately after provision. Generalised Linear Mixed Models found that nutritional enrichment significantly increased feeding behaviour, and this was the case for all five enrichment items, compared with baseline observations. Locomotion, resting and other behaviours were not significantly different compared with baseline observations. Post-hoc comparisons between enrichments revealed significant behavioural differences between enrichment categories. The results indicate that a wide range of enrichment, such as food based cognitive enrichment and biologically relevant olfactory enrichment, should be used and evaluated in tapir husbandry plans.

AB  - 1.Phylogenetic diversity metrics have been used to tackle an increasing number of questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. Here we present a novel use of phylogenetic diversity metrics namely the investigation of insect herbivore assemblages on select plant species in order to investigate possible drivers shaping the phylogenetic structure of those assemblages.
   2. We investigated the phylogenetic structure of lepidopteran herbivore assemblages on 208 species of central European vascular plants. A dataset of 2,553 species of Lepidoptera from 68 families, comprising 8,584 individual herbivore-host associations, was analysed for patterns of phylogenetic alpha- and beta-diversity in relation to plant growth form, plant phylogeny and the accumulation of some characteristic major classes of secondary plant metabolites.
   3. Distinct patterns of phylogenetic beta-diversity were detected when plants were partitioned into three growth form categories (graminoid, herbaceous and woody). In contrast, groupings of plants according to higher taxa or key secondary metabolites did not yield similarly clear patterns. Notable exceptions were assemblages on graminoid plants, especially those containing silica, which could be distinguished by both plant phylogeny and their phytochemical characteristics. Additionally plants containing highly toxic glucosinolates (all of the family Brassicaceae) harbour highly distinct lepidopteran assemblages. Phylogenetic alpha-diversity of associated caterpillars differed greatly between graminoid, herbaceous and woody plants. Assemblages on graminoid plants were found to be the most phylogenetically clustered, followed by herbs and woody plants which showed the least degree of phylogenetic clustering. In conclusion, our results indicate that the phylogenetic structure of the investigated herbivore assemblages in the nemoral and boreal zones of the Western Palaearctic region is most heavily influenced by plant growth form while categories derived from higher plant systematics or classifications reflecting secondary metabolites leave far less signal at this macroecological scale.
   4. The approach taken in this study proved to be very successful in identifying patterns in the phylogenetic structure of herbivore assemblages. Our findings are in line with the 'classical' plant apparency hypothesis. Plant secondary compounds were found to have only limited explanatory power on our scale of analysis.

AB  - 1. Studying the impact of bycatch on marine megafauna, including sea turtles, is challenging for a variety of technical and biological reasons. The Mediterranean Sea has among the highest levels of turtle bycatch globally, notably of the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), and bottom trawling represents a particularly relevant threat.
   2. Bottom trawlers from a recently discovered neritic foraging area, the Gulf of Manfredonia, reported 1,152 loggerhead turtles incidentally caught in the period 2015-2020. Capture locations were available for 497 turtles. These data were complemented by the distribution of fishing effort obtained by the vessel monitoring system.
   3. High bycatch rates were observed, leading to more than an estimated 5,600 annual captures and to the death of a minimum of 560 large individuals with high reproductive value. These findings are extremely concerning for the affected population and require immediate action. A strong seasonality of turtle bycatch was observed, with most captures occurring in November-March when fishing effort occurs in shallow waters where turtles concentrate all year round.
   4. Therefore, a seasonal approach (e.g. adopting measures only in the high-turtle bycatch season) can be pursued as long as the spatial distribution of fishing effort varies among seasons. However, such a spatio-temporal pattern should be monitored; then, in the case of change, although more difficult to implement, an area-based conservation approach should be pursued. Several recommendations are provided, including the urgent implementation of turtle excluder devices, at least on a seasonal basis.
   5. This case shows that identifying the best conservation approaches requires information on the actual spatio-temporal pattern of turtle occurrence and bycatch. Such information can only be derived from spatial distribution of bycatch and fishing effort obtained through a voluntary collaboration of fishers.

AB  - Cladocerans, an important zooplankton community, are consumers from the base of the food web of aquatic environments. We investigated the contribution of produces (phytoplankton and periphytic biofilm) and particulate organic carbon (POC). Collections were carried out in lakes of the Upper Parana River Floodplain, the last stretch free of dams in the second-largest South American basin. Isotope ratios (delta 13C and delta 15N) were measured, besides the contributions of probable food sources to the cladocerans biomass. The phytoplankton constituted the source of carbon for cladocerans, followed by POC. Thus this work, in addition to emphasizing the importance of cladocerans in nutrient cycling, highlighted the need for the conservation of environments surrounding the lakes as they are the sources of organic matter for aquatic communities. Besides, the analyzed zooplanktonic organisms demonstrated their role in the interconnection between the green and brown food webs, which have been studied separately for a long time.

AB  - Mulching techniques can comprise a solution that better utilizes precipitation and irrigation water in such a manner that mitigates soil degradation and drought damage; however, there are still gaps in the literature with regard to the effect of the use of mulch materials on the development of plant-soil-microbe interactions. Waste fibers, as alternative biodegradable mulch materials, are becoming increasingly prominent. The effect of wool mulch (WM) on water use efficiency, with regard to pepper seedlings, was investigated in different soil types (sand, clay loam, peat) in a pot experiment. Two semi-field experiments were also set up to investigate the effect of WM-plant interactions on sweet pepper yields, as compared with agro textiles and straw mulches. Soil parameters (moisture, temperature, DHA, beta-glucosidase enzymes, permanganate-oxidizable carbon) were measured during the growing season. The effect of WM on yield and biomass was more significant with the less frequent irrigation and the greater water-holding capacity of soils. Microbiological activity was significantly higher in the presence of plants, and because of the water retention of WM, the metabolic products of roots and the more balanced soil temperature were caused by plants. In the sandy soil, the straw mulch had a significantly better effect on microbiological parameters and yields than the agro textiles and WM. In soils with a higher water capacity, WM is a sustainable practice for improving the biological parameters and water use efficiency of soil. The effect of WM on yields cannot solely be explained by the water retention of the mulch; indeed, the development of biological activity and plant-soil-microbe interactions in the soil are also contributing factors.

AB  - Simple Summary Cattle-yak milk is rich in numerous bioactive substances that function beyond their nutritive value. Given the high content of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), this exponent suggests a potential role for cattle-yak milk in preventing cancer, heart disease, and metabolic disorders, such as diabetes. It is expected to isolate probiotic strains with natural and excellent characteristics in optimizing human health. However, little research data and much fewer studies on probiotics from cattle-yak milk are reported. Therefore, in the present study, the beneficial strains from cattle-yak milk were identified to evaluate probiotic characteristics of potential strains, and to screen potential probiotics with an emphasis on making better use of milk in such extreme climatic environments. These findings support the potential application of cattle-yak milk in human health, animal food processing, and drug production in the future as a potential candidate for probiotics. Cattle-yak milk is an important raw material and an indispensable source of high-quality food for local farmers and herdsmen to produce ghee, milk residue, yogurt, and other dairy products. In this study, Lactobacillus strains were isolated from cattle-yak milk for potential probiotic candidates using a series of in vitro tests, including probiotic characterization and safety evaluation (antibiotic susceptibility and hemolytic ability). The results found that the Lactobacillus rhamnosus CY12 strain showed a high survival rate in bile salts, under acid conditions, and in the gastrointestinal juice environment, as well as showing high antimicrobial activity and adhesive potential. The safety evaluation showed that all strains were considered non-hemolytic. In addition, the whole-genome sequencing indicated that the strain CY12 spanned 2,506,167 bp, with an average length of 881 bp; the GC content in the gene region (%) was 47.35, contained 1347 protein-coding sequences, and accounted for 85.72% of the genome. The genome annotation showed that genes mainly focused on the immune system process, metabolic process, carbohydrate utilization, carbon metabolism, galactose metabolism, and biological adhesion, etc. This study revealed that the Lactobacillus rhamnosus CY12 strain might be an excellent potential probiotic in the development of feed additives for animals and has the ability to promote health.

AB  - With increasing global attention toward the need for mitigating climate change, the transition to sustainable energy sources has become an essential priority. Introducing alternative oilseed crops, such as camelina (Camelina sativa L.), into intercropping systems with staple food crops can mitigate ILUC (indirect land use change) and their negative impact on biofuel production. The present study compared camelina + field pea intercropping (ICw + IP, winter sowing) and camelina + lentil intercropping (ICs + IL, spring sowing) with their respective single crops regarding weed control, soil coverage, yields, and camelina seed quality (1000-seed weight, oil, and fatty acid composition). The comparison between different cropping systems was conducted using a one-way ANOVA. Both intercropping improved weed control at an early stage but no differences in soil coverage were found. Camelina seed yield was negatively affected by the presence of peas, whereas the pulse was unaffected. Conversely, camelina seed yield was not affected when intercropped with lentils while lentils reduced their yield in the intercropping. Furthermore, when camelina was intercropped with lentils, a significant increase was reported in 1000-seed weight and alpha -linolenic acid (C18:3) compared with the sole-camelina. However, both intercropping systems had a land equivalent ratio (LER, based on total seed yield at maturity) higher than one. Defining the best combination of crops and the optimal sowing and harvesting settings remain key to increasing the adoption of intercropping systems by farmers.

AB  - The research objective was to evaluate the effect of dietary incorporation of hemp seeds in goats fed with hay or mixed shrubs-grass rangeland on the production, FA profile and health-related lipid indices, antioxidant content and total antioxidant capacity of milk, with the purpose to increase the content of beneficial ingredients in milk and to improve its functional activity. Forty indigenous Carpathian goats were allocated into two groups according to the type of basic forage in their diet: hay (H) or mixed shrubs-grass rangeland (SG); each of them was further divided into two subgroups according to the presence of Hs in the concentrate mixture (250 g/kg) or not. Milk production was determined, and milk samples were collected and analyzed for fat, protein, lactose, and cholesterol content, as well as FA profile, lipophilic antioxidant content (alpha-tocopherol and retinol), and milk TAC. SG goats gave less milk (p < 0.01) but with higher milk fat (p < 0.001) and lower cholesterol content (p < 0.01) than H goats, while milk protein and lactose contents were not affected. Supplementing the diet with Hs caused a significant increase in milk production (p < 0.05) and milk fat content (p < 0.001) and a decrease in cholesterol content (p < 0.05). Grazing compared to indoor feeding but also supplementing the diet with Hs had the effect of decreasing the proportion of SFAs and increasing the concentrations of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) in goat milk fat (p < 0.01). Fats in the milk of SG goats compared to H, but also in those supplemented with Hs, showed significantly higher proportions of vaccenic acid (VA), rumenic acid (CLA c-9,t-11) and omega-3 FA (alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA)) which are considered healthy for consumers. The feeding system based on SG and the diet supplementation with Hs ensured the best nutritional and functional quality of milk, confirmed by the FA profile, antioxidant content, and by the value of health-related lipid indices (n-6/n-3 FA ratio and hypo-/hypercholesterolemia, atherogenic index (AI), thrombogenic index (TI), and health promotion index (HPI)). The results of our work will be useful for the development of optimal nutritional strategies that improve the FA profile and the antioxidants content in goat milk, with beneficial effects on human health.

AB  - Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential trace element, yet excessive intake can result in toxicity, adversely affecting animal health and food safety. Due to increasing environmental Mo contamination from industrial and agricultural activities, understanding its toxic effects on livestock is of global concern. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of Mo-induced muscle damage in goats using an integrative multi-omics approach. Twenty black goats were divided into a control group (CJM) and a Mo-exposed group (JM; 50 mg/kg Na2MoO4<middle dot>2 H2O), and fed for 60 days. Compared with the CJM group, the JM group showed significantly reduced muscle fiber diameter, average cross-sectional area, and levels of sulfur, iron, copper, and zinc, along with significantly increased Mo accumulation (p < 0.05). Compared with the CJM group, the JM group showed significantly reduced cysteine, methionine, proline, glutamate, and arginine (p < 0.05). Metabolomics identified 274 significantly altered metabolites, primarily enriched in energy and amino acid metabolic pathways. Proteomics revealed 221 differentially expressed proteins related to stress response, protein synthesis, and energy metabolism. These proteins interfere with muscle development by affecting cell stress responses, protein synthesis, and energy metabolism pathways. Moreover, the protein digestion and absorption and sulfur metabolism pathways were significantly associated with both metabolomics and proteomics. We found that Mo exposure primarily affects muscle energy and amino acid metabolism, thereby impairing muscle development in goats. This is the first study to use multi-omics integration to elucidate the mechanism of Mo-induced muscle toxicity in goats, providing new insights into heavy metal toxicity and food safety risks in livestock.

AB  - Temperature regulates the location, frequency, and extent of irruptive forest insect herbivore outbreak cycles. Across the Pacific coastal temperate rainforest, recent outbreaks by a native defoliator, western blackheaded budworm, have impacted the greatest land area recorded since the advent of aerial detection programs and led to widespread losses of canopy leaf area and forest growth. Evidence suggests that the geographic distribution of budworm outbreaks has tracked a poleward shift in suitable temperature across the ecoregion. In this manuscript, we compile aerial observer estimates of insect defoliation, forest inventory data, and historical and projected climate data under three emissions scenarios to hind- and forecast the distribution of budworm outbreaks from 1901 to 2100. Climate data indicate that seasonal temperatures have warmed and are projected to warm further across the ecoregion, while seasonal precipitation has and will remain relatively constant. Models indicate that a range of spring and summer temperatures primarily constrain the biogeography of budworm outbreaks, while minimum host availability, autumn and winter temperatures, and seasonal precipitation further contribute. Projected warming will shift a substantial portion of regional forestland beyond the upper temperature threshold of historic outbreaks. Thus, our forecasts suggest that budworm outbreak distribution will narrow under all three future climatic scenarios tested. Across much of the ecoregion, the distribution of forestlands suitable for budworm outbreaks is projected to shift poleward and upslope, eventually eclipsing its host's elevational distribution. The possible disruption of periodic defoliator outbreak disturbances in this system may have important ramifications for primary productivity, forest dynamics, and forest structure.

AB  - Sickness behaviours are believed to be an adaptive response to infection. However, the degree to which these behaviours can be expressed may be impacted by an individual's social environment. Here we tested, first, whether parasitism reduces the activity behaviour of lambs, Ovis aries, second, whether this occurs prior to other observed costs of parasitism and, third, whether the infection status of other in-dividuals affects the degree to which these behaviours are expressed. Sixty lambs were separated into replicate groups within three treatments: (1) parasitized: all lambs were infected with the parasitic nematode Teladorsagia circumcincta; (2) nonparasitized; all lambs were dosed with water; (3) mixed: some of the group were infected and some were dosed with water. Activity behaviour was monitored before, during and after parasite infection. Parasitized groups had reduced activity levels following infection, and this occurred before any other impact or measure of parasitism was detected. Infected animals in the mixed groups had reduced activity levels following infection, but the level of change was less than that in animals in the fully parasitized groups. Activity levels remained low until lambs were treated with anthelmintic when activity levels of the groups that had been parasitized returned to the same level as nonparasitized groups. These findings show that parasite-induced behavioural changes occur earlier than other more commonly observed signals of infection, but the infection profile of an individual's group can shape these behavioural responses to infection.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - In 2018-2020, Central -European forests suffered from extremely hot and dry summers. We used data from longterm forest monitoring of six stands of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and two stands of oak (Quercus petraea/ Q. robur) growing on different geological substrates in the climatically uniform state of Saarland (south-western Germany) for analyzing leaf traits of the period 2004-2021. We aimed at detecting overall effects of the drought on foliar morphology, nutrient concentrations, and injury, and long-term alterations in these traits. Across sites, drought resulted in a decrease in leaf size and specific leaf area (SLA) and increased fruiting in the beech and a decrease in the foliar nitrogen (N) concentrations in both tree genera. During drought, foliar calcium and manganese concentrations were lower and potassium (K) concentrations higher across the beech stands, whereas in the oak stands, drought led to a reduction in the foliar phosphorus (P) and magnesium (Mg) concentrations. High rates of anthropogenic N deposition during recent decades have resulted in high foliar N concentrations and low to deficient concentrations of P and, in the beech, of Mg. However, a significant (negative) long-term trend in leaf traits across the study sites was only found for the K concentration and necroses of the beech leaves. Foliar N correlated positively with SLA in the beech and with leaf size in the oak but was not related to herbivory. Chlorosis was the only leaf trait that, in the beech, correlated (negatively) with the climatic water balance. We conclude that even severe drought during three consecutive years does not seem to critically affect the nutrient supply to the two most important deciduous forest tree genera of Central Europe. In the beech, a decrease in leaf size and SLA might be used as an early indication of severe drought stress effects in regular monitoring programs.

AB  - Inadequately managed solid organic waste generation poses a threat to the environment and human health globally. Biotransformation with the black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) is emerging as talent technology for solid waste management. However, there is a lack of understanding of whether BSFL can effectively suppress potential pathogenic microorganisms during management and the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the temporal variations of microorganisms in two common types of solid waste, i.e., kitchen waste (KW) and pig manure (PM). Natural composting and composting with BSFL under three different pH levels (pH 5, 7, and 9) were established to explore their impact on microbial communities in compost and the gut of BSFL. The results showed that the compost of kitchen waste and pig manure led to an increase in relative abundance of various potentially pathogenic bacteria. Temporal gradient analyses revealed that the most substantial reduction in the relative abundance and diversity of potentially pathogenic microorganisms occurred when the initial pH of both two wastes were adjusted to 7 upon the introduction of BSFL. Through network and pls-pm analysis, it was discovered that the gut microbiota of BSFL occupied an ecological niche in the compost, inhibiting the proliferation of potentially pathogenic microorganisms. This study has revealed the potential of BSFL in reducing public health risks during the solid waste management process, providing robust support for sustainable waste management.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds emitted by plants (pVOCs) protect themselves from abiotic and biotic stresses. Plants are under constant threats from biotic stress especially herbivores which facilitate plants to emit herbivoreinduced plant volatiles (HIPVs), an inducible defense in plants against herbivores by communicating to herbivores' natural enemies and neighboring plants. HIPVs are reported to act as feeding and/or oviposition deterrents to herbivores, belonging to four major groups including terpene/terpenoids, benzenoids and phenylpropanoids, the volatile fatty acid derivatives, and the volatile aminoacid derivatives. However, the plant volatile profiles induced by herbivores have been reported to be altered by silicon (Si)-fertilization, priming of plants with chemical elicitors and climate change which can induce plants to produce and emit novel plant volatiles that are not expressed by plants in response to damage by herbivory. Transgenic crops and/or sentinel crops with enhanced pVOCs emission profiles have been proposed to improve plant resistance, health and yields. Currently several technological advances in devices including field-portable electronic devices (e-Nose) and hand-held smartphone-based biosensors for in situ early detection of pVOCs profiles which are now available and supported by artificial intelligence (AI), to increase detection accuracy of these systems. The present review highlights the multi-dimension approaches emerging in pVOCs research for early and rapid detection of specific VOCs indicators as markers with associated plant biotic stressors.

AB  - Alpha S1-casein (alpha(S1)-CN) is a major casein in milk, which exerts a crucial role in casein transport and is related to individual milk components, nutritive value and production traits of milk. So far, alpha(S1)-CN coding gene (CSN1S1) has been widely studied in dairy cattle, but the polymorphisms of the CSN1S1 gene have not been fully understood in buffalo. In this study, the polymorphisms in coding sequence (CDS) of the CSN1S1 gene for river and swamp buffalo were detected using PCR product direct sequencing. The CDS for both types of buffalo was the same in length, which contained 645 nucleotides and encoded a peptide composing of 214 residues. A total of 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was identified in two types of buffalo. Among them, c.516T>C and c.578C>T were observed only in river buffalo, while c.175A>G, c.580T>C and c.609T>G were found only in swamp buffalo. The c.175A>G, c.578C>T and c.580T>C were non-synonymous, which led to substitutions of p.I44V, p.L178S and p.F179L. The prediction showed that the p.F179L may affect the function of buffalo alpha(S1)-CN. Eight buffalo CSN1S1 haplotypes were defined in this study, and accordingly, 6 protein variants and 2 synonymous variants of alpha(S1)-CN were inferred and named. The variants A, B', B '', C, E and F were observed only in river buffalo, whereas variant D was found only in swamp buffalo. The variant B was shared by both types of buffalo with high frequencies. The buffalo variants determined here did not exist in Bos genus. In addition, 9 amino acid differential sites of alpha(S1)-CN between buffalo and Bos genus were identified, of which p.42T and p.115S were located at phosphorylation sites, which may lead to differences in the physicochemical properties of alpha(S1)-CN between buffalo and Bos genus.

AB  - Simple Summary Exosomes are multivesicular bodies produced and secreted by living cells as membranous vesicles with a diameter of about 30-150 nm, density of 1.13-1.19 g/mL, and a typical "cup dish" shape. Exosomes carry proteins, miRNA, lncRNA, circRNA, and mRNA and their degradation fragments are involved in intracellular signal transduction important for regulation of cellular activities. Of these, miRNAs play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in important biological processes such as cell division, tissue development, and immune response. In this study, milk quality was determined and exosome miRNAs from yak and Jeryak milk sampled in June and December were characterized by sequencing. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and pathways related to lactation performance were identified. In summary, this study provides data that can be used to develop alternative strategies for improving the lactation performance of yaks and Jeryaks. The Jeryak is the hybrid offspring of yaks and Jersey cattle and exhibit improved milk and meat yields. Biomolecules carried within milk exosomes are important for cell growth, development, immune regulation, and various pathophysiological processes. Previous studies showed that miRNAs regulate mammary gland development, lactation, and milk quality. This study explored the relationship between milk exosomes miRNAs and lactation performance. A comparison of the milk content showed that yak milk was of a better quality compared to Jeryak milk (casein, fat, TS, SNF, lactose). Milk collected in December was superior to that collected in June for both yak and Jeryak, except for lactose concentrations. Exosomes were extracted by density gradient centrifugation and miRNA expression profiles in milk exosomes from three yaks and three Jeryaks collected in June and December were detected by small RNA sequencing. In all, 22, 120, 78, and 62 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified in Jun_ JY vs. Jun_ Y (P1: Jeryak in June vs. Yak in June), Jun_ JY vs. Dec_ JY (P2: Jeryak in June vs. Jeryak in December), Dec_ JY vs. Dec_ Y (P3: Jeryak in December vs. Yak in December), and Jun_ Y vs. Dec_ Y (P4: Yak in June vs. Yak in December) groups. These DEMs were enriched in functions and signaling pathways related to lactation performance. In conclusion, these findings are a reference tool to study the molecular basis of lactation performance.

AB  - This study aims to elucidate the characteristics of the mitogenome of Lysmata lipkei and investigate its phylogenetic relationships. Using both the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and PacBio Sequel II (Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA) platforms, the complete mitogenome sequence of L. lipkei was determined. The mitogenome of L. lipkei was annotated, measuring 17,497 bp in length and comprising 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs), and 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs). The nucleotide composition of the genome exhibited an AT bias of 63.4%. Among the PCGs, the most frequently used codon was UUA. All tRNAs, except for trnD, which lacks the T psi C loop, were capable of forming the typical cloverleaf structure. Phylogenetic trees for Caridea were constructed using Bayesian Inference (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods based on the nucleotide sequences of the 13 PCGs. Both methods yielded consistent topological structures, with L. lipkei showing the closest phylogenetic relationship to L. kuekenthali. Additionally, Lysmatidae, Thoridae, and Hippolytidae formed a monophyletic clade. This research not only filled the gap in mitogenome data for Lysmatidae but also provided novel molecular insights into Caridean phylogenetics.

AB  - Simple Summary Predation relationships and competition relationships shape interspecies coexistence in wild animal communities. Studying the temporal and spatial activity patterns of wild animals is crucial for understanding their behavior, species interactions, and resource requirements. We evaluated the spatiotemporal overlap between 15 different dominant species in the southwestern mountains of China, including Carnivora (such as Panthera pardus and Lynx lynx), Artiodactyla (such as Moschus spp. and Rusa unicolor), Primate (Macaca mulatta), and Galliformes (Crossoptilon crossoptilon, Ithaginis cruentus). We found that different species exhibit different activity patterns to reduce intense resource competition, with competition being more intense in cold seasons than warm seasons. This may be due to abundant resources in summer but scarce food in winter, as well as increased energy demands during cold seasons, as expected using physiology theory.Abstract Temporal and spatial factors regulate the interactions between apex predators, mesocarnivores, and herbivores. Prey adjust their activity patterns and spatial utilization based on predator activities; in turn, predators also adapt to the activities of their prey. To elucidate the factors influencing the daily activity rhythms of animals, 115 camera traps were established from September 2019 to June 2023 to assess the influences of interspecific relationships and seasons on the daily activity rhythms of animals in the southwest mountains of China. The species captured by the cameras included six Carnivora (such as Panthera pardus and Lynx lynx), six Artiodactyla (such as Moschus spp. and Rusa unicolor), one Primate (Macaca mulatta), and two Galliformes (Crossoptilon crossoptilon, Ithaginis cruentus). The results demonstrated that the 15 species exhibited different activity rhythms and peak activities to reduce intense resource competition. There were differences in the species' activity rhythms in different seasons, with competition among different species being more intense in the cold season than in the warm season. In predation relationships, the overlap coefficient in the cold season exceeded that of the warm season, possibly due to the abundant resources in summer and food scarcity in winter. In competitive relationships, 15 pairs of species exhibited significantly higher overlap coefficients in the cold season compared to the warm season, possibly due to increased demands for energy during the cold period or seasonal changes in predatory behavior. By analyzing the daily and seasonal activity patterns of dominant species in the study area, temporal niche overlaps were established to compare the competition levels between species. These findings indicate that the activity rhythms of the animals in this area not only result from evolutionary adaptation but are also influenced by season, food resources, and interspecific relationships (predation and competition). Thus, efforts should be made to reduce human interference, protect food resources in the winter, and monitor animals' interspecific relationships to protect animal diversity and maintain the stability of the ecosystem in this biodiversity hotspot in China.

AB  - Human-wildlife interactions are present wherever both humans and wildlife are found. Interactions can be positive or negative for humans and can include impacts that range from damage to property, agriculture, health and human safety, to emotional effects. Livestock-wildlife interactions form a major component of human-wildlife conflicts with foci often centered on the implications of livestock predation by wildlife. While most vulture species are obligate scavengers, several species, including the American black vulture (Coragyps atratus), may attack weak or newborn livestock. Black vulture populations and distributions are expanding in the Midwestern U.S., and attacks create a novel problem for livestock producers. We used online and printed surveys to determine the experiences and perceived losses of producers in Indiana and Kentucky. Surveys were distributed March-July 2021. Losses to black vultures were reported by 22% of goat producers, 24% of sheep producers, 38% of cattle producers, and 44% of mixed-livestock producers. The criteria used to determine a perceived predation event were presence of vultures on the carcass, followed by missing eyes or tongue, damage to the perineal area, reported visual observation of the kill, or presence of feathers around the carcass. Sixty-two percent of livestock producers employed at least one mitigation technique. Common mitigation techniques included the removal of carcasses and afterbirth, followed by nonlethal harassment of vultures, modifying farm management practices, use of guard animals, lethal control, and use of effigies. With the exception of nonlethal harassment, all mitigation techniques were rated as being effective by the majority of respondents. Fifty-three percent of respondents indicated a willingness to acquire a lethal control permit from the federal government, 70% from the state government, and 56% from the state Farm Bureau, assuming the permit was free. We found that perceived losses to black vultures generally did not exceed losses to other causes and varied widely with livestock species and age class. For cattle producers, mitigation employment and vulture sightings during the calving seasons best predicted reported predation by black vultures. For mixed livestock producers, vulture sightings during the birthing season and losses to causes other than black vultures best predicted producers reporting predation by black vultures. Our results quantify producer perceptions of conflict between livestock producers and black vultures in the Midwestern U.S. Our results can be used to develop strategies to address growing conflicts between black vultures and livestock producers.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA), one of the main climate-change-related stressors linked to increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, is considered an important threat to marine biodiversity and habitats. Studies on CO2-vents systems, naturally acidified environments that mimic future ocean scenarios, help to explore the sensitivity of species and to understand how benthic communities rearrange their structure and functioning under the pressure of OA. We addressed this problem by studying the benthic invertebrates associated with a habitat-forming brown alga (Cystoseira brachycarpa) in the Bottaro crater vents system off Panarea island (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy), by sampling along an OA gradient from the proximity of the main venting area (station B3, pH 7.9) to a control zone (B1 station, pH 8.1). Samples were collected in September 2016 and 2018. A total of 184 taxa and 23 different functional traits have been identified, considering feeding habit, motility, size, reproductive and developmental biology, and occurrence of calcareous structures. Invertebrates are distributed according to the distance from the high venting zone and low pH levels and results very consistent between the two investigated years. In the low-pH area (B3), 43% of the species are selected. The functional traits of the fauna mirror this zonation pattern, mainly changing the relative proportion of the number of individuals of the various functional guilds along the OA gradient. Invertebrates inhabiting the low-pH zone are mainly composed of weakly or non-calcified species, with small size, burrower/tubicolous habit, omnivorous or suspension feeders, and with direct development and brooding habit. In the other stations, heavily calcified forms, herbivore and herbivore/detritivore, and with medium (1-5 cm) and large (>5 cm) sizes prevail, showing indirect benthic and planktic development. The taxonomic analysis, coupled with functional aspects, increases our prediction of which traits could be potentially more advantageous for species to adapt to the hypothesized scenarios of OA, and identify present and future winner and/or loser organisms in the future ocean of the Anthropocene.

AB  - The present study aims to use Wood's model to determine the parameters of individual lactation curves in a local goat population and their factors of variation under a pastoral system. A total of 137,927 records from 432 local goats were collected to assess the impact of litter size, year and month of kidding, herd and the age of the dam on lactation curve parameters. Wood's model parameters were estimated using non-linear regression, and individual curves were fitted. The characteristics of the lactation curves were computed. The initial yield (A), rate of increase (B) and rate of decline (C) parameters in Wood's model for local goats were 730 g, 0.26 and 0.09 respectively. The values of peak milk production (PP), peak date (PD) and persistency (PC) were 931.88 g/d, 23.39 days and 91.50%, respectively. Persistence was higher in goats with simple births, while peak production increased by around 0.3 kg for each additional kid. The curve parameters "A" and "C" differed according to the herd and month of kidding (p < 0.05); the age of the dam only had an impact on parameter "A" (p < 0.01). Parameter "B" was not significantly influenced by any of the factors considered (p > 0.05). Correlation coefficients among lactation curve characteristics were ranged from -0.20 to 0.89. Due to a significant negative correlation, selecting for parameter "A" may have an adverse effect on parameter "B", resulting in a shorter time to reach peak production and less persistency, but an increase in peak production among goats. The curves derived from Wood's model suggest that the shape of the curve may serve as a basis for herd management planning and to improve local population potentialities.

AB  - Egg predation by invasive and native species may have severe impacts on endangered species and negatively affect species recovery. We assessed the levels of egg predation within green turtle (Chelonia mydas) clutches on the island of Diego Garcia (7.42 degrees S, 72.45 degrees E), Chagos Archipelago (Indian Ocean). Native coconut crabs (Birgus latro) and ghost crabs (Ocypode spp.), as well as introduced black rats (Rattus rattus), were predators of eggs, with these species entering nests via tunnels dug obliquely in the sand. Often whole eggs were removed from clutches. For example, the mean clutch size at oviposition (mean 127.8 eggs, n = 23, range = 74-176) was significantly larger than at the end of incubation (mean 110.9 hatched and unhatched eggs, n = 16, range = 9-147). In other cases, egg predation was recorded where the egg had been opened and contents were eaten in the nest. Overall, hatching success (the percentage of eggs laid leading to a hatchling emerging from the egg) was 64.9%, while 3.1% of eggs were predated within nests, 18.1% died during incubation without predation and 13.9% were removed. We reviewed evidence from 34 sites around the world identifying 36 predators that were either native (e.g., crabs, and goannas, n = 30) or invasive (e.g., rats, and pigs, n = 8). Depending on location, a predator could be identified as both native and invasive (e.g., dogs). We discuss how either nest protection and/or invasive predator eradication may be used to increase egg survival and when these approaches might be used.

AB  - Affiliative relationships are well documented in a wide range of wild animals. However, there is limited evidence of their existence in social farm animals, despite potential significant animal welfare implications. We aimed to determine whether pigs have preferential partners for affiliative interactions and associations and whether these preferences remain stable over time or are influenced by sex, dominance rank or litter of origin (i.e. kinship or familiarity). Two pens of 12 domestic pigs, Sus scrofa, two males and two females from three litters, were weaned at 28 days of age and observed from 42 to 57 days (postweaning phase) and from 70 to 85 days (finishing phase) following a change of housing at 62 days. Sociopositive behaviours, including nose-to-nose and nose-to-body contacts, allogrooming and associations while lying were scored on video observations over 6 days per phase. Using social network analysis methods, we found nonrandom social preferences for allogrooming in both pens of pigs, which remained stable between the postweaning and finishing phases. We also observed nonrandom associations for proximities while lying, although these patterns were not found in both pens of pigs and did not systematically persist between phases. In contrast, nose-to-nose interactions were expressed randomly in both pens and phases. Depending on the housing conditions, social preferences for grooming interactions or proximity while lying were only weakly influenced by sex, dominance rank or litter of origin. We did not find any correlation between social networks for grooming interactions and associations while lying. In summary, our study highlights the existence of durable affiliative relationships based on grooming interactions and proximity while lying within stable pig groups. These relationships appear to be minimally affected by sex, dominance, kinship or familiarity. Taking these relationships into account, particularly from a young age, could be pivotal in improving the welfare of pigs on farms. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - The mountainous rivers of Central Asia host diverse ichthyofauna threatened by increasing anthropogenic pressures, particularly water pollution, abstraction, and hydropower development. This study provides valuable morphometric and ecological data for Schizothorax eurycephalus (snow trout) and Triplophysa ferganaensis (stone loach) in the Shakhimardan River basin, Uzbekistan. S. eurycephalus exhibited positive allometric growth, while T. ferganaensis showed negative near-isometric growth. The mean Fulton's Condition Factor was 1.0 for S. eurycephalus and 0.7 for T. ferganaensis, with site-specific variations. Strong correlations among morphometric parameters, particularly length-height relationships, support non-invasive monitoring techniques. Dietary analysis revealed S. eurycephalus was predominantly herbivorous, with around 70% algae consumption. Early sexual maturity was observed in S. eurycephalus males, whereas T. ferganaensis showed no clear maturity signs, but swollen bellies suggested ongoing or recent reproductive activity. These baseline morphometric and ecological data establish a solid foundation for future ecological assessments, conservation strategies, and the design and monitoring of mitigation measures to address anthropogenic impacts in this vulnerable region.

AB  - In groups of gestating sows, accessing feed supply may be a source of tension and induce aggressiveness and fights. Using electronic sow feeders (ESF) could help to ensure that each sow eats its entire ration in a group-housed pen. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a competitive feeding situation related to the management of the ESF, on the overall behaviour, physical activity, and energy requirements of gestating sows. A total of 32 sows, divided into two groups, were involved in the study. The feed competition was created by closing the access of one of the two feeders available in each gestation room for 5 consecutive days. This situation was repeated twice, each time preceded by one control week during which both feeders were available. Automatons, accelerometers and manual video analysis recorded each sow's feeding, drinking and social behaviour, their physical activity, occupation and location in the pen. Linear mixed effect models were used, including the fixed effects of treatment (feed competition or control), repetition (first or second period), group (2 modalities), social ranking (3 modalities), their interactions, and the random effect of sow. During competitive feeding situations, the number of negative interactions doubled (P < 0.001), the sows spending more time standing in the morning (P < 0.001) and in the areas located further away from the feeder (P = 0.005). The number of and time spent for nutritive visits were not affected by treatment, whereas the number and duration of non-nutritive visits decreased (P < 0.001) during feed competition. This later effect was more marked in low-and high-ranking sows (interaction, P < 0.01). During feed competition sow spent less time sleeping (P < 0.01) and more time exploring the feeder (P < 0.001), these effects being less marked in period 2. The calculated metabolizable energy (ME) requirement, and therefore the quantity of feed required, increased during feed competition (P < 0.001), the effect being greater during the second period than the first (interaction P = 0.04). Moreover, ME requirement was greater for higher compared to lower-ranking sows (P < 0.001). The treatment had no significant effect on body weight and back-fat-thickness, neither on health criteria. To conclude, these results indicate that short-term dysfunction of ESF affect the overall behaviour of sows and increase negative interactions and energy requirements, without affecting their performances or health.

AB  - The evolution of plant defenses is often constrained by phylogeny. Many of the differences between competing plant defense theories hinge upon the differences in the location of meristem damage (apical versus auxiliary) and the amount of tissue removed. We analyzed the growth and defense responses of 12 Quercus (oak) species from a well-resolved molecular phylogeny using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Access to light is paramount for forest-dwelling tree species, such as many members of the genus Quercus. We therefore predicted a greater investment in defense when apical meristem tissue was removed. We also predicted a greater investment in defense when large amounts of tissue were removed and a greater investment in growth when less tissues were removed. We conducted five simulated herbivory treatments including a control with no damage and alterations of the location of meristem damage (apical versus auxiliary shoots) and intensity (25% versus 75% tissue removal). We measured growth, defense, and nutrient re-allocation traits in response to simulated herbivory. Phylomorphospace models were used to demonstrate the phylogenetic nature of trade-offs between characteristics of growth, chemical defenses, and nutrient re-allocation. We found that growth-defense trade-offs in control treatments were under phylogenetic constraints, but phylogenetic constraints and growth-defense trade-offs were not common in the simulated herbivory treatments. Growth-defense constraints exist within the Quercus genus, although there are adaptations to herbivory that vary among species.

AB  - Urbanisation is an important driver of changes in streamflow. These changes are not uniform across catchments due to the diverse nature of water sources, storage, and pathways in urban river systems. While land cover data are typically used in urban hydrology analyses, other characteristics of urban systems (such as water management practices) are poorly quantified which means that urbanisation impacts on streamflow are often difficult to detect and quantify. Here, we assess urban impacts on streamflow dynamics for 711 catchments across England and Wales. We use the CAMELS-GB dataset, which is a large-sample hydrology dataset containing hydro-meteorological timeseries and catchment attributes characterising climate, geology, water management practices and land cover. We quantify urban impacts on a wide range of streamflow dynamics (flow magnitudes, variability, frequency, and duration) using random forest models. We demonstrate that wastewater discharges from sewage treatment plants and urban land cover dominate urban hydrology signals across England and Wales. Wastewater discharges increase low flows and reduce flashiness in urban catchments. In contrast, urban land cover increases flashiness and frequency of medium and high flow events. We highlight the need to move beyond land cover metrics and include other features of urban river systems in hydrological analyses to quantify current and future drivers of urban streamflow.

AB  - In this paper, a class of brucellosis transmission model with seasonal alternation, density-dependent growth, stage-structure, maturation delay, time-varying incubation is established. The basic reproduction number go is derived, by which we find that the brucellosis is uniformly persistent if R-0 > 1, while the disease-free periodic solution is globally attractive if R-0 < 1. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulation, from which we find that the brucellosis transmission would be overestimated (or underestimated) if we ignore the influence of time-varying incubation or maturation delay. If density-dependent growth of animals is ignored, the risk of brucellosis may be far underestimated, the extinction of brucellosis can be obtained by numerical simulation under the same conditions. Seasonality significantly affects the long-term dynamic behavior of brucellosis, and the inconsistency of parameter periods results in complex dynamic behavior.

AB  - The reactivity of primiparous goats during milking can significantly affect animal welfare and performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the progression of milking reactivity during lactation and its effects at early lactation on milk yield, milk quality, and plasma cortisol concentration in primiparous Saanen goats. The milking reactivity of 31 primiparous Saanen goats was evaluated on days 10, 30, and 60 of the lactation period by scoring step-kick behavior (SK) and head, ear, and tail movements (MOV). Milk yield, milk protein and fat percentages, somatic cell count (SCC), and plasma cortisol concentration were measured on day 10 of lactation. Goats' milking reactivity was classified as low or high (according to the SK and MOV scores measured on day 10 of lactation). SK and MOV scores decreased over the lactation period, indicating that the goats habituated to the milking procedures. Milking reactivity only affected milk fat percentage, with the less reactive goats having more milk fat than the highly reactive ones. There was no evidence of stress when goats were subjected to milking procedures during early lactation. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationships of milking reactivity with stress response and their effects on milk yield and quality.

AB  - Assessing the state of the grassland-livestock balance is of great practical significance for continuously optimizing grazing management and ensuring the sustainable use of alpine grasslands. However, obtaining fine, dynamic, and continuous information of the grassland-livestock balance in alpine grassland is greatly hindered due to limitations in precision, timeliness, and spatial scale of two key indicators, theoretical livestock carrying capacity (TLCC) and actual livestock carrying capacity (ALCC). On the one hand, this study constructed grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation models using the multispectral remote aerial vehicle (RAV) data and Sentinel-2 data in the northeast of Tibetan Plateau based on the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based differentiated fusion method. The annual high-precision TLCC spatial distribution dataset was obtained through simulation from 2019 to 2023. On the other hand, this study constructed livestock density estimation models based on the livestock statistical data of the smallest administrative unit and various gridded environmental and socioeconomic data from 2019 to 2022; it thus achieved the fine spatialization of the regional-scale ALCC. The spatiotemporal dynamics of TLCC and ALCC sequences were comprehensively analyzed, and the grassland-livestock balance status and its driving factors from 2019 to 2022 were further evaluated in the study area. We concluded that: 1) the R-2 of the optimal RAV-based and Sentinel-2-based grassland AGB models reached 0.88 and 0.77, with corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) of 552.39 and 692.41 kg/ha, respectively; 2) differentiated fusion with RAV spectral data significantly enhanced the estimation accuracy of Sentinel-2 data for regional-scale grassland AGB ( R-2 improved from 0.77 to 0.80); 3) the RF-based livestock density model had the best spatialization effect on ALCC ( R-2=0.80 and RMSE =77.34 sheep/km(2)); 4) from 2019 to 2022, the overall status of the grassland-livestock balance was good, with over 65% of the grassland area consistently nonoverloaded or balanced, while severely overloaded grassland area remained below 16.14%; large interannual fluctuations were observed in nonoverloaded and severely overloaded grasslands; the overloaded areas mainly concentrated in the core pasture and the periphery of high population density areas; and 5) livestock density, temperature, and distance to river were the main driving factors of livestock-grassland balance dynamics. Innovatively, an annual 10-m spatial resolution grassland-livestock balance dataset was developed.

AB  - In long-lived species, although adult survival typically has the highest elasticity, temporal variations in less canalized demographic parameters are the main drivers of population dynamics. Targeting recruitment rates may thus be the most effective strategy to manage these species. We analyzed 1,136 capture-recapture histories collected over 9 years in an isolated population of the critically endangered Lesser Antillean iguana, using a robust design Pradel model to estimate adult survival and recruitment rates. From an adult population size estimated at 928 in 2013, we found a yearly decline of 4% over the 8-year period. As expected under the canalization hypothesis for a long-lived species, adult survival was high and constant, with little possibility for improvement, whereas the recruitment rate varied over time and likely drove the observed population decline. We then used a prospective perturbation analysis to explore whether managing the species' immature cohorts would at least slow the population decline. The prospective perturbation analysis suggested that a significant and sustained conservation effort would be needed to achieve a recruitment rate high enough to slow the population decline. We posit that the high recruitment rate achieved in 2014-likely due to the maintenance in 2012 of the main nesting sites used by this population-would be sufficient to slow this population's decline if it was sustained each year. Based on the results of diverse pilot studies we conducted, we identified the most likely threats targeting the eggs and immature cohorts, stressing the need to improve reproductive success and survival of immature iguanas. The threats we identified are also involved in the decline of several reptile species, and species from other taxa such as ground-nesting birds. These findings on a little-studied taxon provide further evidence that focusing on the immature life stages of long-lived species can be key to their conservation.

AB  - Changes in soil properties and microbial communities regulated rhizosphere protistan assemblages.
   Bacterial community was more sensitive to soil amendments than protists and fungi.
   Soil amendments trigger the role of specific protistan taxa Cercozoa on microbial interactions.
   Understanding the responses of different rhizosphere microbial lineages to soil amendments during in situ remediation of Cd-contaminated soil is of great importance in the assessment of the restoration and crop health. Here, we evaluated the effects of lime (LM), biochar (BC), pig manure (PM), and a commercial MgCa-Si conditioner (CMC) on the rice rhizosphere soil physicochemical properties and community assembly of bacteria, fungi, and protists in a six-year consecutive application of soil amendments field trial. Our results indicated that among the four amendments, the BC and CMC had the best efficiency in increasing soil pH, which were 5.2% and 16.2%, respectively. Despite the differences in soil Cd concentrations is not noticeable, all the soil amendment treatments significantly decreased the proportion of available Cd in total Cd compared to the control. Soil amendments significantly altered the diversity of bacterial community, while they had no effect on fungal and protistan communities. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that the bacteria was more sensitive to soil amendment-induced changes. For protists, treatments with LM and BC changed the groups of protistan consumers, while treatments with PM and CMC significantly increased the relative abundances of protistan phototrophs. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that soil amendments increased microbial network complexity and triggered the role of protists, especially for the predatory protists Cercozoa, on microbial trophic interactions. Further variation partitioning analysis revealed that edaphic properties, bacterial and fungal communities compositions together explained the 77% of the total variation in protistan community, and the stronger correlations between diversity of bacterial and protistan communities suggested that the bacteria community was a more important biotic driver of the protistan community. Overall, our findings demonstrate the distinct responses of rice rhizosphere microbial communities to soil amendment applications, highlighting the interactive associations between microbiomes, which is vital for enhancing our ability to develop effective strategies for sustainable soil management. This study enhances our understanding of the ecological roles of protists under soil amendment applications and highlights their potential contributions in bioremediation and environmental applications for Cd-contaminated soil.

AB  - To ensure global food security, agriculture must increase productivity while reducing environmental impacts associated with chemical nitrogen (N) fertilisation. This necessitates towards more sustainable practices such as recycling organic waste to substitute chemical fertiliser N inputs. However, hitherto how such strategy controls the succession of microbial communities and their relationship with crop yields and environmental impacts have not been comprehensively investigated. We conducted a field experiment with vegetable production in China examining partial substitution (25-50%) of chemical fertiliser with organic forms (pig manure or municipal sludge compost) considering key sustainability metrics: productivity, soil health, environmental impacts and microbial communities. We demonstrate that partial organic substitution improved crop yields, prevented soil acidification and improved soil fertility. Treatments also reduced detrimental environmental impacts with lower N2O emission, N leaching and runoff, likely due to reduced inorganic nitrogen surplus. Microbial communities, including key genes involved in the N cycle, were dynamic and time-dependent in response to partial organic substitution, and were also important in regulating crop yields and environmental impacts. Partial organic substitution increased bacterial diversity and the relative abundance of several specific microbial groups (e.g. Sphingomonadales, Myxococcales, Planctomycetes, and Rhizobiales) involved in N cycling. Additionally, partial organic substitution reduced the number of bacterial ammonia oxidizers and increased the number of denitrifiers, with the proportion of N2O-reducers being more pronounced, suggesting a mechanism for reducing N2O emissions. Comprehensive economic cost-benefit evaluation showed that partial organic substitution increased economic benefit per unit area by 37-46%, and reduced agricultural inputs and environmental impacts per unit product by 22-44%. Among them, 50% substitution of pig manure was the most profitable strategy. The study is crucial to policy-making as it highlights the potential advantages of shifting towards systems balancing chemical and organic fertilisers with economic benefits for farmers, reduced environmental damage and an effi-cient way for organic waste disposal.

AB  - When in 2010 the world's governments pledged to increase protected area coverage to 17% of the world's land surface, several Central African countries had already set aside 25% of their northern savannas for conservation. To evaluate the effectiveness of this commitment, we analyzed the results of 68 multispecies surveys conducted in the seven main savanna national parks in Central Africa (1960-2017). We also assembled information on potential drivers of large herbivore population trends (rainfall and number of rangers) and on tourist numbers and revenues. In six out of the seven parks, wild large herbivore populations declined dramatically over time, livestock numbers increased severalfold, and tourism, the pillar under a once thriving local wildlife industry, collapsed. Zakouma National Park (Chad) stood out because its large herbivore populations increased, an increase that was positively correlated with rainfall and number of rangers (a proxy for management inputs). With increasing insecurity and declining revenues, governments find themselves confronted with too few resources to protect vast areas. To deal with this conversation overstretch, we propose to extend the repeatedly promoted solutions--scaled up funding, enhanced management--with a strategic retreat, focusing scarce resources on smaller areas to save wildlife in the Central African savannas.

AB  - Invertebrate herbivory affects the composition of meadow communities by differentially decreasing the fitness of individual species. The ability of individual species to resist herbivore pressure depends on their traits, which are often phylogenetically structured, and changes seasonally. We conducted a field study assessing invertebrate herbivory damage of 17 selected plant species in an oligotrophic wet meadow, aiming to assess the effect of functional traits, specifically leaf dry matter content (LDMC), carbon content (C), nitrogen content (N), carbon-nitrogen ratio (C:N), specific leaf area (SLA), and plant height on invertebrate herbivory damage, while taking into account seasonal dynamics of herbivory and phylogenetic relationships of studied species. Herbivory damage was different among individual species, with the biggest distinction between monocots and dicots. Herbivory was best predicted by LDMC, season, and interaction of height with season. After filtering the effect of common evolutionary history from the model, the effect of C, height, and interaction of C with season became significant. LDMC was the best trait predictor in both models. Unique relative contributions of phylogeny and traits to the model explained variability were 15.4% and 33.9%, respectively (with phylogeny using 3 and traits 6 df), with their substantial overlap (35.7%) emphasizing that traits are considerably phylogenetically structured. The effect of seasonality was rather minor (15%). In this study, we point out to the strong interplay between traits, evolutionary history, and seasonal changes influencing herbivory damage and stress the importance of phylogenetic context when evaluating the effect of plant characteristics in plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - The chemical and physical silage characteristics can change the animals' feeding behavior (FB). The aim was to evaluate the effects of cutting height (CH) and bacterial inoculation (BI) in whole-plant corn silage (WPCS) on the FB of sheep. A completely randomized design was used in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. The treatments were: WPCS harvested at 25 cm CH without (SI-25) and with (CI-25) BI (L. plantarum and P. acidipropionici), and at 40 cm CH without (SI-40) and with (CI-40) BI. Feeding (FT), rumination (RT), and idle (IDT) times were observed over 3 h throughout 48 h. The CH (p > 0.05) and BI (p > 0.05) affected the FB. The interaction CH x BI affected (p < 0.05) the FT and RT. The FT was higher at 08-11 h and 17-20 h and RT was relevant at night. The period affected (p < 0.05) the animals' IDT. Higher IDT was observed in the 17-20 h period compared to the others.

AB  - Wildlife crossing structures (WCSs) enable wildlife to navigate linear infrastructure, promoting interactions and reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions. However, human use and predator-prey dynamics can influence their effectiveness. To assess these factors at the Qinghai-Tibet Railway (QTR), we monitored seven WCSs with infrared cameras from May 2023 to April 2024. Our results showed that 11 species of wild mammals used these structures. Analysis of occurrence probabilities for three sequences (human-wildlife, prey-wolf, and prey-prey) revealed that in five structures, the human-wildlife sequence occurred significantly less than expected; in five structures, the prey-wolf sequence was also lower than expected; and in six structures, the prey-prey sequence was significantly higher than expected. The time intervals of the prey-prey sequences were significantly shorter than those of the human-wildlife and prey-wolf sequences. In addition, time intervals between prey and wolves are shortened when passing through narrower crossing structures. These results indicate that in most of the WCSs along the QTR, wild animals tend to avoid humans, wolves do not pursue prey, prey species tend to aggregate, and narrower crossing structures may increase predation risks. Our findings demonstrate that the WCSs of the QTR effectively assist local wildlife and narrow WCSs should be broadened.

AB  - The efficient treatment of phenol wastewater is of great necessity since it induces serious pollution of water and soil ecosystems. Using biochar-immobilized functional microorganisms can innovatively and sustainably deal with the existing problem. In this study, we utilized response surface methodology (RSM) combined with life cycle assessment (LCA) to improve phenol biodegradation rate through a novel separated alkali-resistant and thermophilic strain Bacillus halotolerans ACY. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the genetic foundation of ACY to adapt to harsh environments. The characteristics of pig manure biochar (PMB) produced at varying pyrolysis temperatures (300-700 degrees C) and adsorption experiment were investigated, immobilization of the phenoldegrading ACY on PMB600 under alkaline and high pollution load promoted phenol removal and extreme environment resistance, and the phenol removal rate reached 99.5 % in 7d in actual phenol wastewater, which increased compared with those achieved by PMB (50.6 %) and free bacteria (80.5 %) alone. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) observations indicated the successful bacterial immobilization on PMB600. Reusability and economic cost study further demonstrated PMB600 as an excellent carrier for wastewater treatment. LC-MS, toxicology and carbon footprint analyses demonstrated that bacterial metabolism exerted synergy with adsorption for phenol removal, while biodegradation exerted the predominant impact on the immobilized bacterial system. This study provides an eco-friendly and effective approach to treat phenol wastewater.

AB  - Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) use both oceanic and neritic habitats depending on their life stage, eventually undertaking an ontogenetic shift. Juveniles likely start foraging in a purely opportunistic manner and later seek resources more actively. In the Indian Ocean, it is still unclear where oceanic-stage individuals go, what they do, and importantly where they forage. Yet, such information is crucial to protect this endangered species from anthropogenic threats such as bycatch in fisheries. To address this, 67 individuals (66 late juveniles and one adult) bycaught in the open ocean were equipped with satellite tags and released in the Southwestern Indian Ocean between 2008 and 2021. Most individuals traveled to the Northwestern Indian Ocean where they used neritic habitats of the continental shelf (i.e., largely between 0 and 200-m depth). Using hidden Markov models, we identified three types of movements likely associated with traveling, wandering, and foraging behaviors. We found that the movement characteristics of these behaviors differ depending on turtles' target destination and habitat (oceanic vs neritic), highlighting different strategies of habitat use among individuals of presumably the same life stage (late juveniles). The turtles that traveled to the Northwestern Indian Ocean encountered warmer waters (mean = 27.6 & DEG;C, min. = 20.6 & DEG;C, max. = 33.1 & DEG;C) than their counterparts remaining in the Southern Hemisphere (mean = 22.5 & DEG;C, min. = 14.6 & DEG;C, max. = 29.7 & DEG;C) but were found foraging at locations with comparable biomass of potential prey (mean = 2.5 g C m(-2), min. = 0.5 g C m(-2), max. = 10.4 g C m(-2)) once in the Northern Hemisphere. It remains obscure why these individuals undertook a trans-equatorial migration. Once in neritic habitats, the proportion of time spent traveling was considerably reduced (from 33% to 19%) and allocated to foraging instead. In light of this, it is very likely that the individuals migrated to the Northwestern Indian Ocean to undergo an oceanic-to-neritic ontogenetic shift. Our study sheds light on the behavioral ecology of loggerhead turtles and identifies important foraging areas in the Western Indian Ocean, with the top-three most densely used ones being the Gulf of Oman, the Central Somali Coast, and the Western Arabian Sea.

AB  - Simple Summary The global use of anthropogenic radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) in wireless technologies is increasing exponentially and presents a potential risk to animals, especially domestic animals and pets. Additionally, the semen of boar is, in the process of collection, manipulation and storage for the artificial insemination (AI) of sows, surrounded by and exposed to these different sources of wireless technologies devices. A frequency of 2.5 GHz (this frequency band is used in 5G technology) is of particular interest because many studies have used the frequency bands of 4G technology. For the efficiency of pig production and breeding, it is extremely important to determine the effects of such radiation on semen quality and sow fertilization success. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of RF-EMR at 2500 MHz on in vitro exposed breeding boar semen spermatozoa motility and the proportions of spermatozoa subpopulations according to morphometric parameters. The progressive spermatozoa motility and the proportion of the spermatozoa subpopulation with a higher fertilizing potential were significantly reduced in the experimental group. These results indicate the importance of further research on the effects of RF-EMR on different animal species, especially in those undergoing AI procedures, which are important both in terms of the quality of semen and fertilization and production and breeding goals.Abstract Anthropogenic radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) from wireless technologies has increased dramatically. The boar semen used for artificial insemination is essential in sustaining the pig industry, and additionally it is also exposed to the effects of the RF-EMR of wireless technologies. Furthermore, there are no data on the effects of RF-EMR on semen quality, and this is the first analysis of sperm's morphometric parameters for assessing the effect of RF-EMR on the spermatozoa subpopulations of boars. This study investigated the effect of RF-EMR on in vitro exposed breeding boar semen spermatozoa motility and the proportions of spermatozoa subpopulations according to their morphometric head and tail parameters. The semen samples of 12 boars were divided into control and experimental groups. The samples in the experimental group were exposed in a gigahertz transverse electromagnetic chamber at a frequency of 2500 MHz (the frequency band used in 5G technology) and an electric field strength of 10 Vm-1 for two hours. After exposure, the spermatozoa motility was evaluated for both groups. A morphometric analysis of the semen smears was performed using SFORM software (Version 1.0; VAMS, Zagreb, Croatia). The progressive spermatozoa motility was significantly reduced in the experimental group (74.7% vs. 85.7%). PC analysis and cluster analysis revealed two spermatozoa subpopulations: S1, spermatozoa with a more regular head shape and a smaller midpiece outline, and S2, spermatozoa with a more elongated head shape and a larger midpiece outline. The experimental semen samples had a greater proportion of the S1 spermatozoa subpopulation (68.2% vs. 64.4%). The effect of RF-EMR at 2500 MHz on the in vitro exposed boar semen resulted in decreased progressive spermatozoa motility and a lower proportion of the spermatozoa subpopulation with a higher fertilizing potential.

AB  - Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook plantations play an important role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. This experiment explored the effects of seed shell biochar and meal organic fertilizer derived from Camellia oleifera Abel on the growth characteristics of Cunninghamia lanceolata, as well as the effects on soil fertility and microbial community. The results demonstrated that the use of tea seed shell biochar or meal organic fertilizer improved plant height, biomass, chlorophyll content, and N, P, and K content of Cunninghamia lanceolata. They increased the pH of acid-red soil and improved soil fertility, including organic matter, total nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total phosphorus, available phosphorus, total potassium, and available potassium. However, they decreased ammonium nitrogen. They increased the alpha diversity of the bacteria, but had no significant effect on the alpha diversity of the fungi. They also enhanced the relative abundances of Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Leotiomycetes, and Sordariomycetes, but reduced the relative abundances of Acidobacteriae and Agaricomycetes. To sum up, the use of tea seed shell biochar and meal organic fertilizer could promote the growth and nutrient absorption of Cunninghamia lanceolata, while modifying soil fertility and improving the structure of microbial communities.

AB  - ContextIt is essential to assess the suitable habitat for elephants in order to mitigate the effects of forest fragmentation on conservation.AimsThis study aimed to estimate the potential suitable habitats for Sumatran elephants in the fragmented forest in the Padang Sugihan wildlife reserve area in southern Sumatra, Indonesia.MethodsThe habitat suitability was analyzed using some environmental factors such as slope, elevation, land cover, distance to rivers, and distance to agricultural areas. The remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and MaxEnt model were used to determine the potential habitat suitability for Sumatran elephants.ResultsThis study revealed areas of suitable habitat were evenly distributed throughout the study area, with the composition being suitable (45%), highly suitable (5%), and less suitable (50%). This study revealed the most suitable habitats were found in dense forest areas (gelam or Melaleuca cajuputi forest), which were highly affected by river adjacency, whereas agricultural areas resulted in constrained suitability and fragmentation of forested areas.ConclusionsAs a whole, the estimation of elephant habitat using remote sensing and GIS may guide the development of conservation strategies for elephant conservation in this region.
   KEY MESSAGEThe Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus) is on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a species that is "Critically Endangered." The population of elephants has steadily declined in the Sumatra region, which is characterized by peat swamp forests and a tropical rainforest climate and is vulnerable to habitat degradation.

AB  - Flavonoids have attracted considerable attention due to their health benefits. This study aimed to investigate the flavonoid profiles and antioxidant activity of Paeonia lactiflora petal flavonoid extract (PPF). The UHPLC-ESI-Q-Exactive HF MS/MS method was established for characterization, and 21 predominant flavonoid compounds were tentatively identified in PPF. Among them, isoscutellarein-7-(60-acety-lallosyl-(1->2)-glucoside) and scutellarin methylester were discovered in PPF for the first time. Pretreatment with PPF significantly reduced H2O2-induced cell damage, ROS accumulation, and malondialdehyde content and increased the activity of SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px in buffalo rat liver 3A (BRL3A) cells. Moreover, the expression of nuclear Factor E2-related factor (Nrf2) was upregulated by PPF, whose expression trend was consistent with that of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1). These findings suggested that herbaceous peony flavonoids can be used as a natural bioactive agent to prevent oxidative stress.

AB  - The effect of acidifiers on nitrogen transformation during manure wastewater storage remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the effects of two types of acidifiers on nitrogen transformation, bacterial structure, and functional genes during manure wastewater storage. The results indicate that the internal reactions in manure wastewater storage could be divided into three stages, i.e., nitrification (first 35 days), denitrification (mainly from days 36-84), and the final stage during which the internal environment of the manure wastewater stabilized. The addition of acidifiers effectively reduced nitrogen loss, with the total nitrogen content increasing from 12.8 to 25.83 %, and ammonia emissions decreasing from 31.67 to 43.81 %. The optimal nitrogen retention effect was observed for sulfuric acid. Furthermore, acidifiers primarily inhibited microbial activity and the abundance of functional genes, without altering the dominant bacterial community structure or nitrogen transformation pathways. These results provide a foundation for the use of acidifiers to reduce nitrogen loss during manure wastewater storage.

AB  - Two of the main causes of losses in tomato production are the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), and drought, which is becoming a central problem in agriculture due to global climate change. The separate effects of whitefly infestation and drought have been amply studied in many crop systems. However, less is known about their combined effects. To evaluate whether drought stress (DS) affects plant defense against whiteflies, we assessed the joint effects of whitefly infestation and DS on plant vegetative and reproductive performance in four tomato cultivars, and assessed the effects of DS on plant resistance and tolerance (compensatory ability) to whiteflies in a greenhouse experiment. Generally, we found negative effects of DS and whiteflies on plant performance, but the combined effects of DS and herbivory were not worse than those of either stress alone. In fact, plant performance under the combined effect of both stresses was usually similar to that in the presence of whiteflies without DS. Plants growing under DS had greater trichome density. However, plant resistance-as measured by whitefly population growth- decreased under DS in two cultivars and was unaffected in the other two. Compensatory ability decreased under DS in all but one cultivar. These cultivar-specific responses suggest genetic variation in resistance and tolerance to whiteflies and could be associated with differences in drought tolerance among cultivars. Our findings underscore the difficulty in predicting the combined effects of DS and herbivory and point to the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying plant responses to both stresses at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels.

AB  - Simple Summary Exosomes in the follicular fluid can carry and transfer regulatory molecules to recipient cells, thus influencing their biological functions. In this study, after being treated with yak follicular fluid for 24 h, most yak cumulus cells took up the exosomes, activated autophagy, and increased their secretion of 2-hydroxyestrodiol. Conversely, the inhibition of autophagy with the chemical reagent 3-methyladenine blocked these effects, suggesting that autophagy has an important role in 2-hydroxyestrodiol secretion in the yak cumulus cells. The results of rapamycin treatment of the yak cumulus cells showed a similar effect on yak follicular fluid exosomes as there was an increase in 2-hydroxyestrodiol secretion due to the activation of autophagy. The results suggest that autophagy is activated by yak follicular fluid exosomes and this increases 2-hydroxyestrodiol secretion in the yak cumulus cells. Exosomes in the follicular fluid can carry and transfer regulatory molecules to recipient cells, thus influencing their biological functions. However, the specific effects of yak follicular fluid exosomes on 2-hydroxyestrodiol (2-OHE2) secretion remain unknown. Here, we investigated whether yak follicular fluid exosomes can increase 2-OHE2 secretion through the activation of autophagy in cumulus cells (YCCs). In vitro cultured YCCs were treated with yak follicular fluid exosomes for 6, 12, and 24 h. The effects of yak follicular fluid exosomes on autophagy and 2-OHE2 secretion were evaluated through real-time quantitative fluorescence PCR (RT-qPCR), Western blotting (WB), transfected with RFP-GFP-LC3, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA. To further investigate whether 2-OHE2 secretion was related to autophagy, YCCs were administered with yak follicular fluid exosomes, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and rapamycin (RAPA). The results revealed that treatment with yak follicular fluid exosomes activated autophagy in YCCs and increased 2-OHE2 secretion. Conversely, the inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA blocked these effects, suggesting that autophagy has an important role in 2-OHE2 secretion in YCCs. Treatment of YCCs with rapamycin showed similar results with yak follicular fluid exosomes as there was an increase in 2-OHE2 secretion due to the activation of autophagy in the treated cumulus cells. Our results demonstrate that autophagy is enhanced by yak follicular fluid exosomes, and this is associated with an increase in 2-OHE2 secretion in YCCs.

AB  - Pig farming is a major source of carbon emissions in China's livestock industry, and the promotion and application of carbon neutral technologies dedicated to carbon reduction and sequestration is a key measure to promote the realization of carbon neutrality in pig farming industry. In the absence of a system for carbon emission reduction in agriculture, it is important to explore whether large-scale pig farming can spontaneously promote the application of carbon neutral technologies by pig farmers. Combined with the technical background of carbon neutrality in pig farming industry and using the field survey data of 468 pig farmers in Shandong Province, this paper empirically analyzed the effect of large-scale pig farming on the carbon neutral behavior of pig farmers. The findings are threefold. Firstly, because of the effect of economies of scale in the application of carbon neutral technologies, large-scale pig farming can promote the carbon neutral behavior of pig farmers. However, the effect of economies of scale in the application of carbon neutral technologies has a boundary, and the annual output of pigs should be maintained at 3000 to 4999. Secondly, among the effects of pig breeding scale on the application and its degree of composting project, state of planting and breeding cycle has no regulating effect. Thirdly, among the effects of pig breeding scale on the application and its degree of biogas engineering, both state of planting and breeding cycle and subsidy for construction of biogas digester have negative regulating effects. In this paper, the pig farming industry is taken as a typical example to reveal the endogenous incentive mechanism of promoting agricultural carbon emission reduction, which provides theoretical reference and experience enlightenment for the formulation of effective policies to promote agricultural carbon neutrality, which are different from industrial industries.

AB  - Zooplankton are critical to the functioning of ocean food webs because of their utter abundance and vital ecosystem roles. Zooplankton communities are highly diverse and thus perform a variety of ecosystem functions; thus changes in the community or food web structure may provide evidence of ecosystem alteration. Assemblage structure and trophodynamics of mesozooplankton communities were examined across the Adriatic basin, the northernmost and most productive basin of the Mediterranean Sea. Samples were collected in June-July 2019 within the framework of the MEDIAS (MEDiterranean International Acoustic Survey) project, along coastal-offshore transects and from the surface to ca. 200 m depth, covering the whole western Adriatic side; consistently environmental variables were also recorded. Results showed a clear separation between samples from the northern-central Adriatic and the southern ones, with a further segregation, although less clear, of inshore vs. offshore stations, the latter being mostly dominated in the central and southern stations by gelatinous plankton. Such patterns were mainly driven, based on the outputs of the distance-based linear model, by fluorescence (as a proxy for primary production) for northern-central stations, i.e. closer to the Po River input, and by dissolved oxygen, together explaining 44 % of the total variance. Overall, at the basin level, the analysis of stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon allowed for identifying a complex food web characterized by three trophic levels from filter feeders-herbivores to carnivores, passing through a general pattern of omnivory with varying preference towards herbivory or carnivory. Stable isotope signa- tures spatially varied between inshore vs. offshore communities and across sub-areas, with the northern Adriatic exhibiting greater delta N-15 and more variable delta C-13 than the other two sub-areas, likely attributable to the occurrence in the area of organic matter of both terrestrial and marine origin. Our results contribute to the knowledge of mesozooplankton community and trophic structure, at the basin scale across a coastal-offshore gradient, also providing a baseline for the future assessment of pelagic food webs within the European Council (EC) Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

AB  - Heat stress (HS) negatively affects animal productivity and welfare. The usage of wearable sensors to detect behavioral changes in ruminants undergoing HS has not been well studied. This study aimed to investigate changes in sheep's behavior using a wearable sensor and explore how ambient temperature influenced the algorithm's capacity to classify behaviors. Six sheep (Suffolk, Dorset, or Suffolk x Dorset) were assigned to 1 of 2 groups in a cross-over experimental design. Groups were assigned to one of two rooms where they were housed for 20d prior to switching rooms. The thermal environment within the rooms was altered five times per period. In the first room, the temperature began at a thermoneutral level and gradually increased before decreasing. Simultaneously, in the second room, the temperature began at hot temperatures and gradually decreased before increasing again. Physiological responses (respiratory rate, heart rate, and rectal temperature) were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model. A random forest algorithm was developed to classify lying, standing, eating, and ruminating (while lying and standing). Thermal stress shifted daily animal behavior budgets, increasing total time spent standing in hot conditions (p = 0.036). Although models had a similar capacity to classify behaviors within a temperature range, their accuracy decreased when applied outside that range. Although wearable sensors may help classify behavioral shifts indicative of thermal stress, algorithms must be robustly derived across environments.

AB  - Eastern North Carolina has been subjected to widespread water quality degradation for decades, notably throughout the Cape Fear River Watershed, owing largely to the magnitude of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in the region. Long-term nutrient monitoring data from numerous locations throughout southeastern North Carolina have shown significantly elevated organic nitrogen (Org-N) concentrations starting around the year 2000-a concerning development, as labile Org-N can stimulate algal blooms and subsequent bacterial production, thus enhancing eutrophication in freshwater systems. By measuring the stable isotope signatures (delta 13C, delta 15N) of particulate organic matter sampled from a range of southeastern North Carolina waters, the predominant sources to the observed Org-N loadings were elucidated. Isotope data from across the Cape Fear River watershed indicated a large gradient of livestock waste-N contributions, with hog waste-N contributions consistently higher in the Northeast Cape Fear River watershed and with fertilizer-N contributions higher in the Black River watershed-findings that are consistent with each sub-basin's land usage. %N sediment content was positively correlated with hog waste-N contributions in the Black River watershed, indicating that sediments in CAFO-dense regions are reservoirs for agricultural nutrient pollution. Hog waste-N source contributions and %N sample contents for Black River sediments were strongly correlated with regional swine and poultry CAFO densities, establishing a strong connection between industrial animal production and stream sediment nutrient loads. Collectively, these findings suggest a major role of livestock waste, as well as human sewage, in driving the long-term Org-N increase in eastern North Carolina water bodies.

AB  - Atlantic halibut go through a period with reduced or no feed intake during their spawning period. This study with male Atlantic halibut aimed to assess the effect of a two-month starvation period corresponding to the naturally occurring spawning induced starvation. The actual loss of nutrients compared to initial body burden, was estimated to 25% for gross energy, 32% for total lipid, 14% for crude protein, and 40% and 44% respec-tively, for the essential fatty acids EPA (C20:5 n-3) and DHA (C22:6 n-3). This indicates that lipid is the preferred energy source during starvation related to spawning, and the n-3 fatty acids are used to a larger extent than other fatty acids, although mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) comprised the largest energy reserve. The difference in relative amount of energy and nutrients used should be considered when formulating diets for re-feeding broodstock of annual spawners like the Atlantic halibut.

AB  - Microbial transplantation in early life was a strategy to optimize the health and performance of livestock animals. This study aimed to investigate the effect of active ruminal solids microorganism supplementation on newborn lamb gut microbiota and serum metabolism. Twenty-four Youzhou dark newborn lambs were randomly divided into three groups: (1) newborn lambs fed with sterilized goat milk inoculated with sterilized normal saline (CON), supernatant from ruminal solids (SRS), or autoclaved supernatant from ruminal solids (ASRS). Results showed that SRS increased gut bacterial richness and community, downregulating the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and increased the abundance of some probiotics (Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetota, and Fibrobacterota), while reducing the abundance of Fusobacteriota, compared to the CON group. SRS also improved the plasma metabolic function, such as arachidonic acid metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and tryptophan metabolism and then actively promoted the levels of ALP and HLD. Our study indicated that inoculation with active ruminal solids significantly affected the intestinal microbial communities and metabolic characteristics, and these changes can improve the growing health of the newborn lamb. These findings provided an experimental and theoretical basis for the application of ruminal solid-attached microorganisms in the nutritional management of lambs reared for human consumption.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Successful foraging behavior of parasitoids depends on specific organic information emitted by host-infested plants. For instance, the emission of volatile compounds increases in infested plants, and these are the first indicator of host presence. Parasitoids are attracted by these volatiles in a quite specific way. By combining behavioral and chemical studies, we showed bottom-up effects in a broad bean Vicia faba (Fabaceae)-pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Homoptera: Aphididae)-parasitoid Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) model system. We found that behavioral selection of parasitoid females toward plants with a high density of aphid infestation was reduced, and this can be linked to reduced emission of volatile compounds. In practice, if parasitoids are less attracted to plants with high-density aphid infestations, there may be potential negative impacts on biological control. Therefore, the common recommendation in biological control is to release parasitoids early in the season when aphid density on crop plants is still low.</p>
   <br></p>
   Herbivore-induced plant volatiles constitute the first indicators of insect host presence, and these can affect the foraging behavior of their natural enemies. The density of insect hosts may affect the nature and concentration of these plant-induced volatiles. We tested the impact of infestation density (low, intermediate, and high) of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Homoptera: Aphididae), feeding on the broad bean Vicia faba, on the attractiveness of the parasitoid Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), using a Y-tube olfactometer (infested vs. non-infested plants). The emitted volatile compounds from both infested and non-infested plants were collected and identified. In addition, two series of experiments were carried out to test the impact of the presence of a conspecific female parasitoid within the aphid/plant complex on the attractiveness to other females. Parasitoids were significantly more attracted to the plants with low and intermediate aphid infestation levels. The volatile blend composition of the infested plants changed in relation to aphid density and may explain the low attraction of parasitoids toward high aphid density. The presence of conspecific females on the aphid patch had no apparent impact on the behavioral choices of other parasitoid females. Our study adds a new aspect to understanding plant-aphid-parasitoid interactions, including the possibility that aphids may manipulate chemical cues of host plants affecting the orientation of parasitoids.</p>

AB  - Water systems in Southeast Asia accumulate antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from multiple origins, notably including human clinics and animal farms. To ascertain the fate of antibiotics and ARGs in natural water environments, we monitored the concentrations of these items in Thailand. Here, we show high concentrations of tetracyclines (72,156.9 ng/L) and lincomycin (23,968.0 ng/L) in pig farms, followed by nalidixic acid in city canals. The city canals and rivers contained diverse distributions of antibiotics and ARGs. Assessments of targeted ARGs, including sul1, sul2, sul3, and tet(M), showed that freshwater (pig farm wastewater, rivers, and canals) consistently contained these ARGs, but these genes were less abundant in seawater. Although sulfonamides were low concentrations (<170 ng/mL), sul1 and sul2 genes were abundant in freshwater (minimum 4.4 x 10(-3) -maximum 1.0 x 10(0) copies/16S), suggesting that sul genes have disseminated over a long period, despite cessation of use of this class of antibiotics. Ubiquitous distribution of sul genes in freshwater appeared to be independent of selection pressure. In contrast, water of the coastal sea in the monitored area was not contaminated by these antibiotics or ARGs. The density of Enterobacteriales was lower in seawater than in freshwater, suggesting that the number of ARG-possessing Enterobacteriales falls after entering seawater. From the pig farms, through rivers/canals, to the coastal sea, the occurrence of tetracyclines and tet(M) exhibited some correlation, although not a strong one. However, no correlations were found between concentrations of total antibiotics and ARGs, nor between sulfonamides and sul genes. This is the first comprehensive study showing Thai features of antibiotics and ARGs contaminations. The pig farm is hot spot of antibiotics and ARGs, and sul genes ubiquitously distribute in freshwater environments, which become less abundant in seawater. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Cervids are distinguished by the shedding and regrowth of antlers. Furthermore, they provide insights into prion and other diseases. Genomic resources can facilitate studies of the genetic underpinnings of deer phenotypes, behavior, and disease resistance. Widely distributed in North America, the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) has recreational, commercial, and food source value for many households. We present a genome generated using DNA from a single Illinois white-tailed sequenced on the PacBio Sequel II platform and assembled using Wtdbg2. Omni-C chromatin conformation capture sequencing was used to scaffold the genome contigs. The final assembly was 2.42 Gb, consisting of 508 scaffolds with a contig N50 of 21.7 Mb, a scaffold N50 of 52.4 Mb, and a BUSCO complete score of 93.1%. Thirty-six chromosome pseudomolecules comprised 93% of the entire sequenced genome length. A total of 20 651 predicted genes using the BRAKER pipeline were validated using InterProScan. Chromosome length assembly sequences were aligned to the genomes of related species to reveal corresponding chromosomes.

AB  - Simple Summary The yak is the largest mammal in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and also supplies necessary sources of food and finance for the Tibetan people. Their body weight is a valuable trait for breeding. In the traditional breeding processes, pedigree data were used to evaluate individual genetic potency ability. However, based on the free range husbandry and random mating in domesticated yaks, the genetic improvement in yaks' body weight is still very slow. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study using whole genome sequencing data to detect the potential functional genes for body weight in yaks. In total three functional genes were identified as being associated with body weight. The results of this study are important for developing and improving body weight in yaks. The yak is the largest meat-producing mammal around the Tibetan Plateau, and it plays an important role in the economic development and maintenance of the ecological environment throughout much of the Asian highlands. Understanding the genetic components of body weight is key for future improvement in yak breeding; therefore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed, and the results were used to mine plant and animal genetic resources. We conducted whole genome sequencing on 406 Maiwa yaks at 10 x coverage. Using a multiple loci mixed linear model (MLMM), fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU), and Bayesian-information and linkage-disequilibrium iteratively nested keyway (BLINK), we found that a total of 25,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were distributed across chromosomes, and seven markers were identified as significantly (p-values < 3.91 x 10(-7)) associated with the body weight trait,. Several candidate genes, including MFSD4, LRRC37B, and NCAM2, were identified. This research will help us achieve a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationship for body weight.

AB  - In the central Sikhote-Alin Mountains, tigers prey mainly on underyearlings and adult female wild boars (67-74% of the total number of this species' prey). In key plots (>= 10-15 km(2)) in the Sikhote-Alin Nature Reserve, (a) wild boar encounters and their tracks in the network of routes were recorded; (b) wild boar snow tracking was performed; and (c) tiger encounters and snow tracking were registered (114 episodes). We obtained 16 movement patterns of wild boar groups using snow tracking. Snow tracking of each wild boar group took 6 to 23 days. Many maternal groups occupied a position central in relation to other accompanying groups (up to 8) and individuals (up to 15) moving in the vicinity, usually over an area (1.5-9.4 km(2) or more) that was 1.1-2.2 or more times larger than the area of the maternal group under normal conditions. Such a dynamic organization of associations that serves as a kind of pre-adaptation to the probable appearance of a predator revealed the effectiveness against the tiger both randomly searching for prey and tracking it along a trail. The number of tiger attacks on accompanying wild boars temporarily separated from the parental group was nearly three times (p p < 0.05) as high as the number of attacks by the predator on maternal groups in key plots. In the relationships between the predator and prey species, (a) the location of the habitats of the maternal wild boar groups matters as well, in snowy winters also of compact camps, all usually at a distance from regular tiger routes; (b) disturbed wild boars broadened the search areas, at tiger pursuits and attacks they also changed the site; (c) the tuskers, the male wild boars that accompany maternal groups, often "disguise" these groups by moving to the side of the most probable tiger appearance.

AB  - Here, we combined archived mitochondrial sequences for Ponto-Caspian gobiids with new sequences from the south Caspian basin to assess and evaluate its gobioid diversity and taxonomy, and to provide a first mitochondrial-based phylogenetic and phylogeographic framework. We demonstrate that: (i) Proterorhinus nasalis is the tubenose goby taxon in the saline waters of the southern Caspian Sea, whereas the name Pr. semipellucidus for the Azov/northern Caspian Sea/Volga River populations is likely be resurrected depending on the outcome of an integrative taxonomical approach; (ii) the deep-water goby Ponticola bathybius should be re-assigned to the genus Neogobius, as it is the sistergroup of N. melanostomus; (iii) specimens previously identified as Po. cyrius and Po. iljini from the south Caspian basin appear conspecific with Po. iranicus and Po. gorlap, respectively, and should be omitted from the checklist of Iranian and south Caspian freshwater fishes; (iv) the low stand of the Caspian Sea during the Tyurkyanian regression is inferred to have led to the isolation and evolution of Po. iranicus; and (v) similarities in genetic background, and invasion history of Rhinogobius sp. and Pseudorasbora parva in Iran and Turkmenistan indicate that the initial introduction of both species into the region possibly originated from Japan in the 1980s.

AB  - Simple Summary The genetic diversity of southern African sheep remains under-studied. We present here the complete mitochondrial genomes of archaeological southern African sheep, as well as the genomes from three indigenous southern African breeds-Damara, Namaqua Afrikaner, and Ronderib Afrikaner. We show that southern African sheep exhibit limited genetic diversity which is consistent with our understanding of their migration south from northernmost Africa. Intriguingly, many of the modern sheep show close relationships with the archaeological sheep, implying an ancestor-descendant relationship. Similarly, the sheep that do not exhibit a close relationship with the archaeological sheep nonetheless cluster closely with each other and do not show a close relationship with European and Asian sheep. This suggests that they too are descendants of indigenous sheep and not the product of historic introductions of exotic breeds. We investigated the genetic diversity and historic relationships among southern African sheep as well as the relationships between them and sheep outside the continent by sourcing both archaeological and modern sheep samples. Archaeological sheep samples derived from the site Die Kelders 1, near Cape Town, date to approximately 1500 years ago. The modern samples were taken as ear snips from Damara, Namaqua Afrikaner, and Ronderib Afrikaner sheep on a farm in Prieska in the Northern Cape. Illumina sequencing libraries were constructed for both ancient and modern specimens. Ancient specimens were enriched for the mitochondrial genome using an in-solution hybridization protocol and modern specimens were subjected to shotgun sequencing. Sequences were mapped to the Ovis aries reference genome, assigned to haplogroups and subhaplogroups, and used to calculate a phylogenetic tree using previously published, geographically dispersed mitochondrial genome sheep sequences. Genetic diversity statistics show that southern African sheep have lower diversity than sheep in other regions. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that many modern southern African sheep are likely descended from prehistoric indigenous sheep populations and not from sheep imported from Europe during the historic period.

AB  - In order to explore the influences of rice straw mulching on soil fertility in agroforestry systems, the soil C and N contents and enzyme activities were investigated in a C. oleifera-cassia intercropping ecosystem in Central Southern China. Three straw mulching application treatments were set up in this study, in 2021, namely, straw powder mulching (SPM), straw segment mulching (SSM), and non-straw mulching as the control (CK). Soil samples were collected from three soil depths (0-10 cm,10-20 cm, and 20-40 cm) in each treatment on the 90th-day after the treatments. The soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), microbial carbon (MBC), soil enzyme activities (including acid phosphatase (ACP), urease (UE), cellulase (CL), and peroxidase (POD)), and soil water content (SWC) were determined. The results showed that the SOC significantly increased due to the mulching application in SPM and SSM, in the topsoil of 0-10 cm when compared to the CK. The SWC, SOC, TN, and MBC increased by 0.8 and 56.5, 3.5 and 37.5, 21.3 and 61.6, and 5.8% and 76.8% in the SPM and SSM treatments compared to the CK, respectively. The soil enzyme activities of ACP, UE, CE, and POD increased significantly due to straw mulching compared with CK throughout all soil layers. The soil enzyme activities of CL and POD were significantly higher in SSM than in SPM across the soil depth except for ACP. The enzyme activities of ACP were 14,190, 12,732, and 6490 U/g in SSM, SPM, and control, respectively. This indicated that mulching application enhanced the enzyme activity of ACP. Mulching had no significant effects on UE and CL, while the POD decreased significantly in the order of SPM > SSM > CK across all soil layers, being, on average, 6.64% and 3.14% higher in SSM and SPM, respectively, compared to the CK plots. The SOC and MBC were the key nutrient factors affecting the soil enzyme activities at the study site. The results from this study provided Important scientific insights for improving soil physicochemical properties during the management of the C. oleifera intercropping system and for the development of the C. oleifera industry.

AB  - The blue antelope (Hippotragus leucophaeus) is the only large African mammal species to have become extinct in historical times, yet no nuclear genomic information is available for this species. A recent study showed that many alleged blue antelope museum specimens are either roan (Hippotragus equinus) or sable (Hippotragus niger) antelopes, further reducing the possibilities for obtaining genomic information for this extinct species. While the blue antelope has a rich fossil record from South Africa, climatic conditions in the region are generally unfavorable to the preservation of ancient DNA. Nevertheless, we recovered two blue antelope draft genomes, one at 3.4x mean coverage from a historical specimen (similar to 200 years old) and one at 2.1x mean coverage from a fossil specimen dating to 9,800-9,300 cal years BP, making it currently the oldest paleogenome from Africa. Phylogenomic analyses show that blue and sable antelope are sister species, confirming previous mitogenomic results, and demonstrate ancient gene flow from roan into blue antelope. We show that blue antelope genomic diversity was much lower than in roan and sable antelope, indicative of a low population size since at least the early Holocene. This supports observations from the fossil record documenting major decreases in the abundance of blue antelope after the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Finally, the persistence of this species throughout the Holocene despite low population size suggests that colonial-era human impact was likely the decisive factor in the blue antelope's extinction.

AB  - The red deer is an ungulate and large game species. The contamination of the ecosystems by metal(loid)s may lead to the exposure of animals (as well as humans) through water and food resources. The direct contact of hunters and wild animal meat consumers with deer carcasses may be a potential contaminant source. This study aimed to determine the metal(loid)s' concentrations in the liver and kidney of red deer from two regions of Portugal (Idanha-a-Nova and Lous & atilde;), and to relate these with histopathologic lesions. Thirteen young male deer were submitted to metal(loid) determination (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn) by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry (ICP-MS) and histopathology examination. Renal Cd (8.072 +/- 5.766 mg/kg dw) and hepatic Pb (3.824 +/- 6.098 mg/kg dw) mean values were high, considering the maximum values for consumption established by the European Commission. The hepatic mean value of Cu was significantly higher in Idanha-a-Nova (150.059 +/- 33.321 mg/kg dw), and it is at the Cu toxicity limit considered for ruminants (150 mg/kg). The pollution induced by Panasqueira mines (Castelo Branco) may be a possible explanation for some of the findings, especially the higher values of hepatic Cu and Pb found in Idanha-a-Nova deer. These results have high importance under a One Health perspective, since they have implications in public health, and pose at risk the imbalance of animal populations and ecosystems.

AB  - Predictable anthropogenic food subsidies attract species with generalist and opportunistic feeding habits, often resulting in conflicts with human populations. We assessed the spatio-temporal distribution and abundance of Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus) during the annual cycle at anthropogenic food sources located along 70 km of urban and agricultural-livestock landscapes in the lower Chubut River valley, Argentina. We quantified the seasonal abundance of adult and young Kelp Gulls through monthly counts from July 2021 to June 2022 at six identified anthropogenic food sources, complemented with strip transect sampling along cultivated land and cattle grazing areas. In addition, we analysed the differential use of waste types by adult and young Kelp Gulls at a mixed livestock waste dump where different food remains (cattle remains, poultry remains and urban waste) are disposed in independent pits. The total number of Kelp Gulls counted each month along the river valley was variable, with a mean number of 2585 +/- 822.7 individuals (range = 276 in December and 8958 in June). The highest gull abundance was recorded at a pig farm (mean = 1784.5 +/- 640.1 individuals). The transect survey showed a relatively low use by gulls of the cultivated land and cattle grazing areas, with a mean of 29.7 +/- 11.2 individuals recorded per survey (range = 0-96). Kelp Gull abundance patterns recorded in the river valley throughout the annual cycle evidenced a contrasting seasonal use of anthropogenic food sources between the breeding and non-breeding seasons, being clearly less abundant during the former, when gulls move to their main breeding grounds and adjacent marine habitats in coastal Chubut. At the mixed livestock waste dump, Kelp Gull numbers varied among the three waste patches, with higher numbers and a significantly higher proportion of adults at the cattle remains pit. This study shows the high trophic plasticity of Kelp Gulls and their use of alternative foraging habitats. Further monitoring and evaluations of the use by Kelp Gulls of predictable anthropogenic food sources along the Chubut River valley, particularly those related to the growing livestock production, are needed to support management decisions.

AB  - Simple Summary Goat farming is becoming more important in Germany and as dehorning is forbidden, it is necessary to facilitate animal welfare among horned and mixed-horned herds. In this study an optimized automatic concentrated feeding system was installed in a mixed-horned herd and lying behaviour was detected by accelerometer technology. Results show a seasonal progression of lying behaviour in dairy goats and an adjustment of behavioural differences between horned and hornless goats with the new feeding system. The aim of this study was to evaluate lying behaviour in dairy goats before and after installation of an optimized automatic concentrated feeding system (AFS). A mixed-horned herd of Bunte Deutsche Edelziege was used. As many agonistic interactions between goats happen at the feeding place, a new automated feeding system was installed to better fulfil the needs of horned goats. Lying behaviour is an indicator to ascertain animal welfare of ruminants. In order to measure lying behaviour accelerometer technology was used and verified by video analyses. The results show an agreement of 99.62-99.93% per lying time by comparing accelerometers to video data. Over all goats, a mean +/- SD lying time (LT) of 11.78 +/- 1.47 h/d, a mean +/- SD lying bout duration (LBD) of 0.51 +/- 0.10 h/bout and a mean +/- SD frequency of lying bouts (FLB) of 24.35 +/- 5.57 were found. Lying behaviour follows a seasonal progression with significant lowest LBD and highest FLB in summer. With the old AFS significant differences in LBD and FLB were detected between horned and hornless goats, but with the new AFS results were adjusted. Findings suggest that changes in feeding management do not affect the general seasonal progression of lying behaviour but can affect the behavioural differences between horned and hornless dairy goats.

The whole of Bangladesh is reportedly home to the northern hog badger (A. albogularis); however, there is no valid record to date. The greater hog badger (Arctonyx collaris), its larger congener and a globally vulnerable mustelid, has three valid records. This work, between 2001 and 2021, traced 28 records (all of A. collaris: 20 from literature review and social media, 8 from camera-trapping) in Bangladesh including four rare cases of erythrism and seven conflict incidents. All but five were from mixed evergreen forests of southeast Bangladesh, the known A. collaris range. One record was from wet deciduous forests of northern Bangladesh (bordering Meghalaya, India), a region not previously marked as an A. collaris range. In 2021, from 4436 trap-nights of sampling, 17 notionally-independent events (all night-time) were obtained. This produced the first evidence of A. collaris in northeast Bangladesh, a region that borders the Tripura Hills, India (where it was first recorded in 2020) and belongs to the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. The work proves the existence of relict populations whereas the absence of A. albogularis signifies a re-assessment of its westernmost distribution.

AB  - Coexistence between wildlife and farmers can be challenging and can endanger the lives of both, prompting the provisioning of mitigation methods by governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). However, provision of materials, demonstration of the effectiveness of methods or willingness to uptake a method do not predict uptake of methods. We used ethnographic decision models to understand how farmers' work through the decisions of uptake or non-uptake of methods to mitigate crop consumption by elephants, and how the government and NGOs can either enable or impede the ability of farmers to protect themselves and their crops. While farmers were motivated to use methods if they received or could afford to buy materials and they believed in the effectiveness of the methods, they still did not use them if they considered a method to be dangerous, or issues with elephants not to be severe enough, or when the supply of materials or income was not sufficient. Methods were not even considered by farmers if they lacked awareness or knowledge of the method. Government departments and NGOs enabled farmers to mitigate elephant crop consumption by providing opportunities for cash income, and providing materials and knowledge. Yet, there was disparity between the materials farmers received and methods they wished to adopt. One-off inputs of materials did not result in sustainable use of mitigation methods. We see an opportunity for governmental departments or NGOs to stimulate logistics (e.g. roads and retail) to increase availability of mitigation materials since this promoted farmer autonomy. We also highlight the importance of empowering farmers by facilitating within community sharing of mitigation ideas and increasing knowledge about the effectiveness of promising wildlife conscious farming, as despite promising farmer testimonies, only a few farmers used these techniques.

AB  - Extensive home ranges of marine megafauna present a challenge for systematic conservation planning because they exceed spatial scales of conventional management. For elusive species like dugongs, their management is additionally hampered by a paucity of basic distributional information across much of their range. The Red Sea is home to a wide-spread, globally important but data-poor population of dugongs. We surveyed the north-eastern Red Sea in the waters of NEOM, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to locate feeding sites and determine priority areas for dugong conservation. We conducted large-scale in-water surveys of dugong feeding trails across 27 seagrass meadows that span 0.7 degree of latitude and recorded nine seagrass species and 13 dugong feeding sites. Spread over similar to 4,061 km(2) of nearshore and offshore waters, many of these sites clustered around five main core feeding areas. Dugong feeding trails were mostly recorded at sites dominated by the fast-growing pioneer seagrasses Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis and/or H. stipulacea. Multispecific meadows with pioneer seagrasses tended to be sheltered and shallow, reflecting a similar spatial pattern to the identified dugong feeding sites. Often close to hotels and fishing harbours, these high-use dugong areas are subject to high boat traffic, fishing, and coastal development which places considerable pressures on this vulnerable mammal and its seagrass habitat. The rapidly accelerating coastal development in the northern Red Sea directly threatens the future of its dugong population. Although our sampling focuses on feeding signs in early successional seagrasses, the results are valuable to spatial conservation planning as they will trigger overdue conservation interventions for a globally threatened species in a data-poor area. Urgent dugong conservation management actions in the northern Red Sea should focus on shallow waters sheltered by coastal lagoons, bays and the lee of large islands.

AB  - 'More security, more conservation' is the mantra utilised by the Indian forest service to ensure the protection of flora and fauna. Aligned with international agreements aiming at securing wildlife and preserving forests, the Union and the State governments of India have adopted a series of green measures to ensure both the securitisation and participation of local communities in conservation efforts. This research article illustrates how participatory forms of conservation are employed to complement the securitisation of conservation, serving as a means to indirectly control people's lives and create new environmental subjects. It does so through a case study of Kaziranga National Park, a biodiversity conservation hotspot in the northeastern state of Assam, renowned for the successful conservation of the Greater One-horned Rhino Rhinoceros unicornis. This 'success' emerges amidst critiques of its violent and militarised anti-poaching conservation measures and the efforts deployed to protect the rhino 'at any cost'. The research article analyses the participatory protection mechanisms supported by state and non-state agencies to ensure the conservation of Kaziranga, primarily carried out through the revitalisation of two bodies: the eco-development committee and the voluntary defence organisation. The results demonstrate how soft forms of violence complement hard forms, thereby supporting a broader process of structural violence and national building in Assam. It shows how participatory mechanisms are used as 'counterinsurgency practices.' Abstract in Hindi: rb.gy/rhcrzz

AB  - Reliable population abundance estimates are invaluable to wildlife management programs. Mark-recapture techniques are regarded as the gold standard for estimating abundance but can be financially or logistically prohibitive. Recent developments in remote camera analytical approaches have provided alternative methods to estimate unmarked populations efficiently but have undergone limited field testing. In September and October 2020, I assessed 2 camera methods that use the same set of time-lapse photographs; a space to event (STE) model and instantaneous sampling (IS), applied to a case study of feral sheep (Ovis aries) at the US Army's Pohakuloa Training Area (PTA) on Hawai`i Island. Results of the camera methods were compared to an abundance estimate calculated from an aerial distance sampling survey completed concurrently with camera sampling. A comparison of confidence intervals indicated no statistical difference between estimates, but the relative imprecision of IS suggested the STE model to be a more reliable estimator. The cost of camera sampling was approximately 3 times that of the aerial survey, but camera sampling became more economical if the area was resurveyed 3 or more times. My study showed the STE model to be a cost effective, practical abundance estimator of feral sheep when compared to well-established aerial distance sampling techniques, and therefore should offer considerable potential for the conservation and management of other easily identifiable species.

AB  - Estimates of narrow sense heritability derived from genomic data that contain related individuals may be biased due to the within-family effects such as dominance, epistasis and common environmental factors. However, for many wild populations, removal of related individuals from the data would result in small sample sizes. In 2013, Zaitlen et al. proposed a method to estimate heritability in populations that include close relatives by simultaneously fitting an identity-by-state (IBS) genomic relatedness matrix (GRM) and an identity-by-descent (IBD) GRM. The IBD GRM is identical to the IBS GRM, except relatedness estimates below a specified threshold are set to 0. We applied this method to a sample of 8557 wild Soay sheep from St. Kilda, with genotypic information for 419,281 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We aimed to see how this method would partition heritability into population-level (IBS) and family-associated (IBD) variance for a range of genetic architectures, and so we focused on a mixture of polygenic and monogenic traits. We also implemented a variant of the model in which the IBD GRM was replaced by a GRM constructed from SNPs with low minor allele frequency to examine whether any additive genetic variance is captured by rare alleles. Whilst the inclusion of the IBD GRM did not significantly improve the fit of the model for the monogenic traits, it improved the fit for some of the polygenic traits, suggesting that dominance, epistasis and/or common environment not already captured by the non-genetic random effects fitted in our models may influence these traits.

AB  - (1) Background: Cashmere goats, as one of the characteristic species, are rich in genetic resources. Protecting and rationally utilizing these genetic resources is of great significance for the genetic improvement of cashmere goats. (2) Methods: In this study, tissue samples were collected from Inner Mongolia white cashmere goats, which included the Arbas type (ARBS); Erlangshan type (ELS); Alashan type (ALS), Hanshan white cashmere goats (HS), and Ujimqin white cashmere goats (WZMQ). Genomic DNA was extracted and subjected to high-depth genome resequencing. GenoBait technology was used for probe design and site optimization, followed by the synthesis of a low-density liquid phase chip. Finally, a total of 281 individuals from five cashmere goat populations in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were randomly selected to verify the chip. (3) Results: The results showed that a total of 5002 SNP sites were finally screened and retained for the synthesis of the low-density liquid chip for identifying cashmere goats in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Principal component analysis and phylogenetic tree construction indicated that the ARBS, ELS, and ALS populations were clustered into one category. (4) Conclusions: This chip can accurately identify the three breeds: Inner Mongolia white cashmere goats, Hanshan white cashmere goats, and Ujimqin white cashmere goats.

AB  - Meiotic recombination is key to the repair of DNA double-strand break damage, provide a link between homologs for proper chromosome segregation as well as ensure genetic diversity in organisms. Defects in recombination often lead to sterility. The ubiquitously expressed Rad51 and the meiosis-specific DMC1 are two closely related recombinases that catalyze the key strand invasion and exchange step of meiotic recombination. This study cloned and sequenced the coding region of cattle-yak Rad51 and determined its mRNA and protein expression levels, evaluated its molecular and evolutionary relationship as well as evaluated the histo-morphological structure of testes in the yellow cattle, yak and the sterile cattle-yak hybrid. The Rad51 gene was amplified using PCR, cloned and sequenced using testicular cDNA from yak and cattle-yak. Real-time PCR was used to examine the expression levels of Rad51/DMC1 mRNA in the cattle, yak and cattle-yak testis while western blotting, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry were used to assess the protein expression and localization of Rad51/DMC1 protein in the testicular tissue sections. The results revealed that the mRNA and protein expression of Rad51 and DMC1 are extremely low in the male cattle-yak testis with a corresponding higher incidence of germ cell apoptosis. There was also thinning of the germinal epithelium possibly due to the depletion of the germ cells leading to the widening of the lumen area of the cattle-yak seminiferous tubule. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that the low expression of Rad51 and DMC1 may contribute to the male hybrid sterility in the cattle-yak. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although there are many hypothesized ecological functions of plant coloration, they have been only partly resolved by examining ecological hypotheses in isolation. Multiple ecological interactions may act in concert or in opposition to fix or maintain variation in plant coloration, that is, via ecological pleiotropy. To investigate the adaptive value of red plant pigment (anthocyanin) in a carnivorous plant, we compared insect prey capture, herbivore damage, and recruitment of specialist insect larvae in naturally occurring sympatric red and green color morphs of the pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. We integrated field and laboratory bioassays, visual modeling, chemical analysis of anthocyanins, and a long-term demographic study to investigate multiple ways anthocyanins mediate plant-insect interactions. In support of ecological pleiotropy, each morph performed better in one or more ecological contexts, providing evidence for ecological interactions exerting opposing selection on plant color and thus maintaining variation. The mixture of both ecological benefits and costs to anthocyanin production is further supported by stable color polymorphism and seed set data consistent with balancing selection. More broadly, this work reveals the impacts of a single anthocyanin compound on multiple key plant-insect interactions, demonstrating evidence for ecological pleiotropy maintaining intraspecific diversity in plant color.

AB  - There has been a drastic decline in the number of eastern black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis michaeli) across Africa, leaving individuals restricted to small, isolated populations that are vulnerable to extinction. Focusing on highly threatened populations in Tanzania, this study investigated the genetic impacts of past management interventions on mitochondrial control region diversity in extant subpopulations, assessed whether there has been evidence of dispersal of females between populations based on haplotype sharing, and related current haplotype diversity to historical patterns. Across extant subpopulations in Tanzania, six maternal haplotypes were identified, with an overall haplotype diversity of h = 0.72 but lower overall nucleotide diversity within populations (& pi; = 0.017) compared to historical populations (& pi; = 0.021). Translocated populations did not share haplotypes with native populations, even though all haplotypes from translocated individuals had been found among historic samples from Kenya. This suggests that translocations have been successful at restoring previous diversity to the region but that the current Intensive Protection Zone (IPZ) management practices have restricted the movement of females between subpopulations. Extant haplotypes were distributed among three East African haplogroups described in previous studies, suggesting that multiple lineages have been preserved despite the loss of historical haplotypes. Our recommendation is to enhance the utilisation of previous translocations by enabling the natural movements of individuals between subpopulations. Such a change in management strategy could be less costly both economically and in terms of animal welfare than the alternative of using genetic data to target specific animals for translocation in order to supplement diversity.

AB  - This study investigates the nectar characteristics of the tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima L.), an introduced dominant fall-flowering herb in Japan. We found that the nectar volume of S. altissima peaked at approximately 13:00 before decreasing. Glucose and fructose were identified as the primary sugar components, followed by sucrose. The average sugar amount per panicle of naturally growing plants was estimated as 229.0 mg. Herbivory by the exotic lacebug (Corythucha marmorata) reduced the nectar volume per floret but did not affect the total sugar amount per floret. However, the sugar amount per panicle decreased substantially because C. marmorata reduced both the number of disc florets (i.e., nectar-secreting florets) per head and the number of heads per panicle. Plant genotypes also influenced some nectar traits, interacting with the effects of herbivory. As the distribution of C. marmorata continues to expand across Japan, the nectar resources provided by S. altissima may be diminishing nationwide.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from livestock manure management have a significant impact on air quality and climate change. There is an increasing urgency to improve our understanding of drivers influencing these emissions. We analysed the DATAMAN ("DATAbase for MANaging greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions factors") database to identify key factors influencing (i) NH3 emission factors (EFs) for cattle and swine manure applied to land and (ii) N2O EFs for cattle and swine manure applied to land, and (iii) cattle urine, dung and sheep urine deposited during grazing. Slurry dry matter (DM) content, total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) concentration and method of application were significant drivers of NH3 EFs from cattle and swine slurry. Mixed effect models explained 14-59 % of the variance in NH3 EFs. Apart from the method of application, the significant influence of manure DM, manure TAN concentration or pH on NH3 EFs suggests mitigation strategies should focus on these. Identifying key factors influencing N2O EFs from manures and livestock grazing was more challenging, likely because of the complexities associated with microbial processes and soil physical properties impacting N2O production and emissions. Generally, significant factors were soil-related e.g. soil water content, pH, clay content, suggesting mitigations may need to consider the conditions of the receiving environment for manure spreading and grazing deposition. Total variability explained by terms in mixed effect model was on average 66 %, with the random effect 'experiment identification number' explaining, on average, 41 % of the total variability in the models. We suspect this term captured the effect of non-measured manure, soil and climate factors and any biases in application and measurement technique effects associated with individual experiments. This analysis has helped to improve our understanding of key factors of NH3 and N2O EFs for inclusion within models. With more studies over time, insights into the underlying processes influencing emissions will be fur-ther improved.

AB  - Sandy beach invertebrates depend largely upon allochthonous inputs of macrophytes and the oceanographic processes that deliver them as wrack. While part of this wrack is returned to the sea by the tides, a large portion remains, ages, and decomposes on the supralittoral, becoming colonized and used by macrofaunal organisms. This study quantified faunal colonization in relation to change in wrack nutritional quality, measured here as protein content. We prepared, deployed, and followed for 29 days a series of experimental wrack patches of two of the most common species in the wrack of Atlantic Canada sandy beaches: the rockweed Fucus serratus and the eelgrass Zostera marina. On a weekly basis, we measured the density of the macrofauna with a focus on the most abundant species, the talitroid amphipod Americorchestia longicornis, in both types of wrack and in bare sediments, while simultaneously measuring macrophyte protein contents. Our results show that rockweed patches concentrated higher densities of amphipods compared to eelgrass and bare sediments, a result that was matched by protein differences (higher concentrations in rockweed than eelgrass). However, while protein contents gradually declined over time in both macrophytes, the abundance of amphipods increased. Hence, while nutritional quality may explain between-wrack and wrack-bare sediment differences in faunal colonization, it cannot explain the counterintuitive temporal pattern recorded here. The latter result points to the often-ignored role played by the physical characteristics of the wrack and the conditions they create while decomposing over sandy beaches.

AB  - Interspecific variation in body size is one of the most popular topics in comparative studies. Despite recent advances, little is known about the patterns and processes behind the evolution of body size in insects. Here, we used a robust data set comprising all geometrid moth species occurring in Northern Europe to examine the evolutionary associations involving body size and several life-history traits under an explicitly phylogenetic framework. We provided new insights into the interactive effects of life-history traits on body size and evidence of correlated evolution. We further established the sequence of trait evolution linking body size with the life-history traits correlated with it. We found that most (but not all) of the studied life-history traits, to some extent, influenced interspecific variation in body size, but interactive effects were uncommon. Both bi- and multivariate phylogenetic analyses indicated that larger species tend to be nocturnal flyers, overwinter in the larval stage, feed on the foliage of trees rather than herbs, and have a generalist feeding behaviour. We found evidence of correlated evolution involving body size with overwintering stage, host-plant growth form, and dietary specialization. The examination of evolutionary transitions within the correlated evolution models signalled that overwintering as larvae commonly preceded the evolution of large sizes, as did feeding on tree foliage and the generalist feeding behaviour. By showing that both body size and all life-history traits correlated with it evolve at very slow rates, we caution against uncritical attempts to propose causal explanations for respective associations based on contemporary ecological settings.

AB  - A negative human-animal relationship from the farm animal's perspective can, mainly through fear and stress, compromise the animal's welfare, health and productivity. Studies particularly in the dairy and pig industries demonstrate a causal link between stockperson attitudes, stockperson behaviour, animal fear and stress and animal welfare. Equally, a positive relationship can improve these outcomes for the animal. Furthermore, since stockperson attitudes and behaviour are amenable to change, they can be improved by appropriate training. Indeed, cognitive behavioural training has been shown to improve stockperson attitudes and behaviour towards animals, with consequent reductions in animal fear and improvements in animal productivity. While our understanding of the implications of the human-animal relationship in other livestock industries is relatively poor, there is limited evidence of relationships between stockperson attitudes, stockperson behaviour and animal fear responses in other livestock industries, such as the goat, poultry and sheep industries. There is a clear need for the livestock industries to train their personnel to care for and handle their animals effectively and humanely.

AB  - The conservation of marine megafauna presents numerous difficulties owing to their high mobility over difficult-to-access oceanic areas that impairs the collection of basic, but essential, biological information. The Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni) is one of the most elusive species of baleen whales, and although it is known to be a seasonal visitor to several archipelagos in Macaronesia (the Azores, Madeira, and Canaries), there are no studies regarding its occurrence or geographical connectivity in this area of the Atlantic. A 14-year photographic database was used to determine short-term (intra-seasonal) and long-term (inter-annual) Bryde's whale site fidelity and to estimate individual residency times in Madeira, whereas photographic catalogues from Madeira and the Canaries were compared in order to assess large-scale movements (i.e. on the scale of hundreds of kilometres). In Madeira, 59 individuals were identified, 27 (45.8%) of which were recaptured. Of these, 10 individuals (37.0%) presented short-term site fidelity and 17 individuals (63.0%) presented long-term site fidelity, with a maximum recapture interval of 12 years. Lagged identification rates showed that five individuals (SE = 2) remained in the area for 32 days (SE = 108 days) before leaving and not returning during the same year. Seven individuals were seen both in Madeira and the Canaries (catalogue comprising 51 individuals), three of which were identified multiple times in both archipelagos, with a minimum of 43 days between consecutive sightings. This information combined with the fact that this species is commonly sighted accompanied by calves and feeding in both archipelagos highlights the ecological importance of this area for Bryde's whales. This should be taken into consideration by policymakers when implementing conservation measures, where coordination of effort among countries is needed. This study also reinforces the value of using data from platforms of opportunity and of making photographic data open access.

AB  - The effect of gravitational unloading (antiorthostatic hindlimb suspension) and subsequent recovery on the mineral density and mechanical properties of the femoral and tibial bones in Wistar rats was studied during oral administration of a human lactoferrin (LF) biotechnological analog (200 mg/kg) derived from the milk of producer goats. Bone mineral density was determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, while bone strength and stiffness were assessed via the three-point bending test. It was shown that 21-day gravitational unloading led to a decrease in the mineral density of the tibia and femur. Oral LF administration had no significant effect on the mineral density and projected area of the bones. There were no statistically significant differences in mechanical stiffness between the experimental groups, although after readaptation, the ultimate strength was significantly higher in LF-administered groups. Thus, the results may indicate the potential of LF preparations as prophylactic agents for maintaining bone strength. At the same time, the maintaining of bone mineral density under deficit-stimulating conditions requires a consideration of alternative dosages and drug delivery methods.

AB  - Stakeholder dialogue is considered a key component of companies' corporate social responsibility strategy with the aim to discover stakeholders' demands, expectations, and their view of the firms. Based on the stakeholder theory, this paper aims to deepen the knowledge about stakeholder dialogue by analyzing how firms conduct the dialogue with five key stakeholder groups (i.e., employees, customers, suppliers, investors and shareholders, and the community). Using a sample of 35 leading Spanish companies and, after the collection and processing of the information available in their corporate websites and reports, we have determined the channels that are used, the pursued objectives, and the main commitments achieved. The results indicate that firms are engaged in several forms of dialogue with stakeholders and use various channels which differ depending on the targeted stakeholder group. We gain insight into the initiatives with which companies engage with stakeholders, the underlying interactions, and how each stakeholder group views and assesses the firm. Practical implications for policy makers and managers, as well as future lines of research are proposed.

AB  - Understanding feed formulation impacts and regional carbon transfer is crucial for sustainable pork supply chains. Currently, secondary greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the pork supply chain are often overlooked, and regional carbon transfer inequality impedes food sustainability. This study combines spatial equilibrium modeling with life cycle assessment to quantify China's 2021 pork supply emissions. Increasing pig feed crude fiber from 4 % to 10 % raised annual lifecycle GHG emissions from 275.7 to 300.8 Mt CO2eq, driven by 45 % and 13 % emission increases in farming and transportation, respectively. Additionally, carbon transfer among provinces is imbalanced, primarily flowing from southern pig farming regions to northern agricultural provinces. Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi were the top three benefiting provinces, accounting for nearly 27.5 % of the total carbon transfer. Emission burden shifts through interprovincial transfers undermine reduction targets, necessitating strategies like integrating transfer responsibilities into carbon quota systems or compensation mechanisms to ensure equitable mitigation.

AB  - The Punjab urial (Ovis vignei punjabiensis) is endemic to Northern Punjab, Pakistan, and is categorized as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. The urial population has declined by 30% over the last 3 generations. We used non-invasive fecal samples to identify individuals and estimate population size of Punjab urial in the Kalabagh Game Reserve, Pakistan. We genotyped samples using 12 microsatellite markers to assess genetic variation, population structure, and demographic changes. Microsatellite analysis revealed high levels of genetic variation in urials in terms of expected and observed heterozygosity and allelic diversity. The population structure of the Punjab urial in the Kalabagh Game Reserve, based solely on microsatellite variation using Bayesian clustering, indicated 3 different clusters in the reserve. Results revealed that the urial population may be facing inbreeding pressure because its ancestral effective population size has declined from between 20,000 and 50,000 to <= 1,000 animals today. This reduction has partly occurred because of a bottleneck that occurred about 10,000 years ago. Results also indicate that 1 urial population cluster has the signature of a bottleneck, which may be due to population isolation. The 3 urial clusters are small and broadly dispersed in a large territory, meaning they could be extirpated without any opportunity for natural re-population through dispersion. The results of our study support a management strategy that encourages maintaining connectivity between urial localities within the Kalabagh Game Reserve, increased diversity so the effective population size may recover from the historical decline, and the use of data generated here as a baseline of urial genetic diversity in the reserve for monitoring diversity over the long term.

AB  - Carabids have long been beloved by collectors and have recently gained much attention in research as beneficial natural enemies of pests and weeds. With agricultural transformation towards lower herbicide use, carabids are expected to help carry the burden of weed regulation. While there is good evidence to found these expectations on, relying on seed-consuming carabids for natural weed regulation also has clear limitations. One of these is the fact that many carabids can be crop pests themselves, often in addition to their beneficial roles as natural enemies of pests or weeds. In a qualitative review, we gathered the available evidence for 72 carabid species acting as crop pests in 27 crops by damaging crops or consuming their seeds. Based on selected examples from different crops, we portray the historical impact and current state of carabids as crop pests. Due to the scarcity of recent reports, we expect that most carabids acting as crop pests are not a currently relevant economic problem across regions and crops, with beneficial ecosystem services provided by carabids outweighing possible damages. Yet, given the abundance of historical evidence and the current trajectory of agriculture towards a more sustainable management that aims to decrease chemical crop protection and increase carabid populations, we see a need to consider that carabids can, under certain conditions, act as crop pests. In this context, it will be crucial to get a better understanding of potential carabid crop pests around the globe, to identify under which conditions carabids switch roles from ecosystem service provides to ecosystem disservice providers and to understand how this role switching will be affected by climate change and agricultural transformation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the diversity of physiological stress responses elicited by tethering versus loose holding in the Swedish domestic goat (Capra hircus). Eight goats were randomly divided into two groups and the experiment was performed in a crossover design. Six goats had implanted transmitters that registered heart rate and arterial blood pressure telemetrically and blood samples were taken on separate days. Heart rate increased around feeding both when the goats were held loose in pairs, and when they were tied up. When the goats were tethered, the heart rates and blood pressures were higher, and the concentrations of beta-endorphin and oxytocin lower, compared to when held loose in pairs. In conclusion, housing and the company of another animal affect arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and the concentrations of beta-endorphin and oxytocin in goats, but the cortisol and vasopressin concentrations did not differ between the treatments. The higher arterial blood pressure and heart rate, and lower concentrations of beta-endorphin and oxytocin in tethered goats indicate that being tied up may be more stressful for the goats compared to being held loose. The use of single measures, eg cortisol concentrations, was not sufficient to give an accurate picture of the animals' response to the management system. This study demonstrates the importance of using a wide variety of physiological measures when evaluating stress in animal welfare research.

AB  - Purpose Optimization of phosphorus (P) fertilization from livestock manure can maximize crop production while protecting water quality. We assessed the effects of different forms (liquid, solid, and liquid composted with wheat straw) of swine manure application on yield and seed composition (N: P ratio) under corn-soybean rotation in a clay loam soil, Ontario, Canada. Methods Under an unified available nitrogen (N) rate (200 kg N ha(-1)), P in each of liquid, solid and composted swine manures was applied to corn (Zea mays L.) in a 4-year corn-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation at 0, 50 and 100 kg P ha(-1) (P-based), respectively, plus another P rate treatment from N-based application at 200 kg available N ha(-1), forming a series of four P rates. Chemical P fertilizer was also applied at 0, 50 and 100 kg P ha(-1), respectively, with the same unified N rate. Results The parabolic corn yield response to P rate was observed in liquid swine manure, but not in solid and composted swine manures. Corn seed N concentration and seed N: P ratio in alternative years were highly related to the yield, with optimum N: P ratio at 4.75. Soybean yields in both subsequent years responded to P rate of manure addition in a parabolic pattern with optimized P rate applied to preceding corn at 70 kg P ha(-1). Soybean yield with swine manure application was related to seed N: P ratio but varied from the year of crop rotation, suggesting the temporal changes in soil P availability with manure addition. Conclusions The relationship between corn yield and seed N: P ratio with manure application suggests that adjusting N: P ratio in manure might lead a way to optimizing corn yield and provide a new approach for manure application recommendation.

AB  - Although low-protein diets can improve the nitrogen utilization efficiency and alleviate economic pressures in ruminants, they may also negatively impact dairy performance. Rumen-protected lysine (RPL) supplementation can improve the health status and growth performance of ruminants without compromising nitrogen utilization efficiency and feed intake. In this study, a total of thirty-three multiparous dairy goats in the late-lactation period were randomly divided into three groups that were separately fed the control diet (namely the protein-adequacy group), the low-protein diet (namely the protein-deficient group), and the RPL-supplemented protein-deficient diet (namely RPL-supplementation group) for five weeks. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms regarding how low-protein diets with RPL supplementation compromise lactation phenotypes in dairy goats through cross-tissue transcriptomic analyses. Dietary protein deficiency caused an imbalance in amino acid (AA) intake, disrupted hepatic function, and impaired milk synthesis. Transcriptomic analyses further showed that RPL supplementation exhibited some beneficial effects, like mitigating abnormal lipid and energy metabolism in the liver, elevating hepatic resistance to oxidative stress, improving the mammary absorption of AAs, as well as activating mammary lipid and protein anabolism primarily through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and janus kinase-signal transducer (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling, respectively. RPL supplementation of a low-protein diet contributes to maintaining late lactation in dairy goats primarily through mitigating hepatic energy disturbances and activating both lipid and protein metabolism in the mammary glands. Since RPL supplementation initiated a series of comprised events on mammary protein and lipid metabolism as well as the hepatic function and energy generation in dairy goats under protein deficiency during late lactation, these findings thus provide some insights into how RPL supplementation helps maintain milk production and health in dairy mammals especially at late lactation.

AB  - Limited sampling for imperiled taxa inhibits effective management by obscuring windows into ecological and evolutionary processes and ultimately thwarting thoughtful conservation efforts. We report eight new locations for the endangered New Mexico Meadow Jumping Mouse (Zapus luteus luteus) detected across three states that expand their known distribution. When combined with existing curated museum records, we develop an ensemble species distribution model to evaluate persistence of populations over the next 50 years. Predicted distributions indicate complex future changes, including regional expansion and the likelihood that half of the designated critical habitat areas will be unsuitable by 2070. Three of the newly discovered populations occur where predicted climate conditions suggest extirpation is likely. Importantly, indices of historical sampling efforts show that recognized and potential distributions are mismatched, highlighting vast areas that have been insufficiently surveyed. Ongoing habitat degradation and climate disruption are projected to synergistically erode genetic diversity across four of the five divergent phylogroups. Considering these combined results, a holistic sampling strategy is needed to more completely document the distribution of jumping mice and facilitate genomic analyses aimed at establishing a roadmap for improving our understanding of geographic variation and adaptive potential. Current management efforts are not only costly, but they are lacking key biological insights, essentially wagering actions with an incomplete deck of cards.

AB  - The quantification of bioaerosols and particulate matter within zoo enclosures is a critical yet underexplored area, particularly given the global role of zoological environments in wildlife conservation, research, and public education. Zoos, which host a diverse array of wildlife and attract millions of visitors annually, are complex ecosystems where multiple sources of air pollution converge. This study aimed to systematically assess the prevalence of bacterial aerosols within various animal enclosures, including those of Tigers, Lions, Leopards, Rheas, Deer, Hippos, Ostriches, Crocodiles, and Owls. Utilizing a six-stage Andersen impactor, bioaerosol samples were collected to determine the concentration and dispersion of airborne microorganisms, while the DustTrak Aerosol Monitor was employed to measure levels of particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, and PM1), carbon dioxide (CO2), and formaldehyde (HCHO). The findings revealed distinct bacterial population peaks across different locations and animal species, highlighting significant variations in airborne bacterial levels within the sampled enclosures. Gram staining identified a predominance of Gram-negative bacteria, which poses broader implications for understanding the transmission of pathogens and antibiotic resistance in confined environments. Notably, this study provides a foundational framework for evaluating bacterial resistance to antibiotics in zoological settings, contributing to the global discourse on antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The insights gained underscore the necessity of judicious antibiotic use to safeguard both animal health and broader public health. Given that animals are substantial generators of bioaerosols, this research emphasizes the importance of stringent maintenance of enclosures and their surroundings, alongside the optimization of microclimatic conditions to mitigate health risks. By shedding light on the microbial dynamics in zoo environments, this study calls for proactive, globally informed measures to ensure the welfare of animals and the health of visitors, thus advancing the broader understanding of bioaerosol management in complex, human-animal interaction spaces.

AB  - Relatively little is known about the nutritional ecology of omnivorous Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) in Pakistan. The species is categorized as "Vulnerable" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and its population is reportedly declining in its range, mainly as a result of conflict with humans. Although the black bear is reported from different parts of the country including high-elevation hilly areas, data on its ecology are so far poorly documented. In the present study, we investigated diet composition of the species by using a non-invasive technique of scat analysis and determined distribution by surveying potential habitats and recording direct and indirect field signs (such as scats, tracks, prey remains, hairs) in the Bajaur Agency area, Pakistan, from September 2017 to July 2018. Results showed black bear were distributed at elevations of 790 m to 2,286 m above sea level. Analysis of the scat samples (n H 34) indicated different food components including plant materials, with a major contribution from maize crop and animal matter consisting of invertebrates (insects), wild prey (hare [Lepus spp.]), and domestic prey (goat [Capra hircus], sheep [Ovis aries], and cow [Bos taurus]). Most frequently consumed food items (on a % volume basis) were 72.5% plant matter, and 27.5% animal matter. Consumption of maize crops and domestic goats and sheep by Asiatic black bears indicates its conflict with humans in the study area, which needs to be addressed for successful conservation of the black bear species. We recommend awareness campaigns pertaining to different mitigating interventions, and training that consequently reduces the risk of negative interactions, which will assist in future conservation of Asiatic black bears in the area.

AB  - Background: Everyday, humans are exposed to a mixture of environmental chemicals some of which have endocrine and/or metabolism disrupting actions which may contribute to non-communicable diseases. The adverse health impacts of real-world chemical exposure, characterized by chronic low doses of a mixture of chemicals, are only recently emerging. Biosolids derived from human waste represent the environmental chemical mixtures humans are exposed to in real life. Prior studies in sheep have shown aberrant reproductive and metabolic phenotypes in offspring after maternal biosolids exposure.Objective: To determine if exposure to biosolids perturbs the maternal metabolic milieu of pregnant ewes, in a fetal sex specific manner.Methods: Ewes were grazed on inorganic fertilizer (Control) or biosolids-treated pastures (BTP) from before mating and throughout gestation. Plasma from pregnant ewes (Control n = 15, BTP n = 15) obtained mid-gestation were analyzed by untargeted metabolomics. Metabolites were identified using Agilent MassHunter. Multivariate analyses were done using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 and confirmed using SIMCA.Results: Univariate and multivariate analysis of 2301 annotated metabolites identified 193 differentially abundant metabolites (DM) between control and BTP sheep. The DM primarily belonged to the super-class of lipids and organic acids. 15-HeTrE, oleamide, methionine, CAR(3:0(OH)) and pyroglutamic acid were the top DM and have been implicated in the regulation of fetal growth and development. Fetal sex further exacerbated differences in metabolite profiles in the BTP group. The organic acids class of metabolites was abundant in animals with male fetuses. Prenol lipid, sphingolipid, glycerolipid, alkaloid, polyketide and benzenoid classes showed fetal sex-specific responses to biosolids.Discussion: Our study illustrates that exposure to biosolids significantly alters the maternal metabolome in a fetal sex specific manner. The altered metabolite profile indicates perturbations to fatty acid, arginine, branched chain amino acid and one-carbon metabolism. These factors are consistent with, and likely contribute to, the adverse phenotypic outcomes reported in the offspring.

AB  - Manure amendments to agricultural soils is an excellent opportunity for sustainable utilization of agricultural waste while providing multiple benefits to improve soil quality and increase the availability of nutrients to plants, including phosphorus (P). In this study, a meta-analysis of published data from 411 independent ob-servations based on 133 peer-reviewed papers was performed for an in depth understanding of various factors affecting the transformation of soil P pools with manure application. Manure application increased all soil inorganic P (Pi) by 58.0%-282% and organic P (Po) by 65.0%-105%, while decreasing Po/total P (TP), compared to those in unamended soils. Manure types, soil TP, and manure application rates were the important factors that influenced soil P fractions. Elevation of soil labile Pi was more pronounced with compost application, while poultry and pig manure were more beneficial for promoting soil Pi fractions and stable Po contents compared with other manure types. The manure application rate had pronounced effect on increasing the stable Po frac-tions. The effects of manure application on increasing soil P fractions were greater in soils with lower TP contents as compared to that in high TP soils. Manure effects on enhancing soil labile Pi and moderately labile Pi were greater in acidic soil than that in neutral and alkaline soils. In addition, soil P fractions showed significant correlation with latitude and mean annual precipitation (MAP). By integrating the impacts of manure types, soil properties, and climate, this meta-analysis would help to develop the management of manure application in a specific region of agriculture as well as promote the interpretation of the interfering factors on the soil P fractions changes in the manure-amended soils.

AB  - Sidi Bouzid basin knows for several decades a fast-growing anthropogenic activity and, consequently, an increase in groundwater pollution which attracted researcher attention. For this task, we performed an exhaustive study to evaluate groundwater geochemical evolution. Our research begins with analyzing the geochemical process, then determining the water quality indices and their impact on the ecosystem, and after that correlating between different compartments, and ends with the assessment of the human health risk toward NO3-, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cd, and Pb. The dominant facies of the groundwater in the study area are Ca-Mg-SO4 and Ca-Mg-HCO3 and are mainly influenced by evaporite deposits (CaSO4, CaSO4 & BULL;2H(2)O, and NaCl). The pollution index of groundwater (PIG) displays values ranging between 0.5 and 4.5 indicating four classes of pollution (insignificant, low, moderate, and high). More than half of the samples (55%) belong to the low and moderate PIG classes. However, the results show elevated values of NO3- concentration; 76% of samples exceed 30 mg/L. Among the studied contaminants, the highest carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks in study areas were related to NO3-. For all water samples, the risk levels for children were greater than those for adults. Lastly, the partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) shows that the chemical elements do not have a short-term potential impact of pollutants on ecosystems.

This study focuses on saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica), an endangered species which has received international concern. Based on an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behavior and a sample of 536 Chinese residents aged 16-40 collected through an online survey, we applied Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling to explore the predictors of the behavioral intention to participate in saiga antelope conservation. The results show that perceived behavioral control is the most influential predictor that contributes to the value of the behavioral intention, followed by injunctive norm, attitude to participation, knowledge of saiga antelope, experience of wildlife conservation, and attitude to saiga antelope, altogether explaining 48.4% of the variance of the behavioral intention. To promote public participation in saiga antelope conservation, strengthening science popularization and broadening the channels of participation are suggested.

AB  - Though the genomes of many rice herbivorous pests have recently been well characterized, little is known about the genome of their natural enemies. Here, by using the Illumina and PacBio platforms, we sequenced and assembled the whole genome of the mirid species Cyrtorhinus lividipennis Reuter (Hemiptera: Miridae), which is an economically and ecologically important natural enemy in the rice ecosystem acting as a dominant predator for planthoppers and leafhoppers in the field. Through Hi-C scaffolding, 1615 scaffolds with a total size of 338.08 Mb were successfully anchored onto 13 chromosomes. The assembled genome size was 345.75 Mb with a final scaffold N50 of 27.58 Mb. Approximately 107.51 Mb of sequences accounting for 31.10% of the genome were identified as repeat elements, and 14,644 protein-coding genes were annotated. Phylogenetic analysis showed that C. lividipennis clustered with other Hemipteran species and diverged from Apolygus lucorum about 66.7 million years ago. Gene families related to detoxification, environmental adaptation and digestion were analysed comparatively with other Hemipteran species, but no significant expansion or contraction was found in C. lividipennis. We also observed male meiosis in C. lividipennis, which showed a typical post-reduction of sex chromosomes and a karyotype of 2n = 22 + XY. As the first natural-enemy genome in the rice ecosystem, the genomic resource of C. lividipennis not only expands our understanding of the multitrophic interactions (host plant-prey-predator), but also provides a genomic basis for better understanding this dominant predator and therefore promotes sustainable rice pest management and food grain production.

AB  - Previous studies of the morphology of the humerus in kangaroos showed that the shape of the proximal humerus could distinguish between arboreal and terrestrial taxa among living mammals, and that the extinct "giant" kangaroos (members of the extinct subfamily Sthenurinae and the extinct macropodine genus Protemnodon) had divergent humeral anatomies from extant kangaroos. Here, we use 2D geometric morphometrics to capture the shape of the distal humerus in a range of extant and extinct marsupials and obtain similar results: sthenurines have humeral morphologies more similar to arboreal mammals, while large Protemnodon species (P. brehus and P. anak) have humeral morphologies more similar to terrestrial quadrupedal mammals. Our results provide further evidence for prior hypotheses: that sthenurines did not employ a locomotor mode that involved loading the forelimbs (likely employing bipedal striding as an alternative to quadrupedal or pentapedal locomotion at slow gaits), and that large Protemnodon species were more reliant on quadrupedal locomotion than their extant relatives. This greater diversity of locomotor modes among large Pleistocene kangaroos echoes studies that show a greater diversity in other aspects of ecology, such as diet and habitat occupancy.

AB  - As a flagship species in tropical forest ecosystems, the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) plays an indispensable role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem stability. Yunnan Province, serving as the sole distribution range of Asian elephants in China, is currently confronting increasingly severe human-elephant conflicts (HEC). Extensive foraging and damage to crops, as well as human casualties, constitute the primary manifestations of elephant depredation. The primary objective of study is to precisely identify the characteristics of HEC, uncover the spatial drivers of elephant depredation, and provide a theoretical basis for mitigating HEC risks in the future. Based on Asian elephant-triggered incident data collected between 2019 and 2023, this study quantitatively defines human-elephant conflict intensity using conflict frequency; employing generalized additive models (GAMs) evaluated the impacts of environmental covariates and anthropogenic disturbances on human-elephant conflict dynamics, while identifying the principal drivers propelling Asian elephants to encroach into human-dominated landscapes. The study results indicate that during the dry season (November-April), the risk of Asian elephant depredation was higher in areas near secondary roads, crops, forest edges, and at lower elevations. In the rainy season (May-October), the risk increased in regions close to crops, settlements, secondary roads, and areas with higher crop coverage. Across both seasons' patterns, food resources served as the primary driver of elephant depredation. This study furnishes critical empirical datasets and theoretical foundations essential for advancing the scientific management of Asian elephant populations, mitigating human-elephant conflicts through risk-reduction strategies, and ultimately operationalizing the paradigm of harmonious human-elephant coexistence.

AB  - Herbivorous macroinvertebrates make up a large fraction of secondary production in wetlands, but little is known about how water flow affects herbivorous macroinvertebrate production. Reintroducing measurable water flow (1-5 cm/s) to the oligotrophic (phosphorus-limited) Everglades has the potential to improve herbivorous macroinvertebrate production by providing a constant low supply of phosphorus (P) to periphyton and improving food quality. This study investigated potential effects of flow-mediated nutrient loading on growth rates of herbivorous grazers, juvenile apple snails (Pomacea maculata). Periphyton was grown on standard substrates, within a landscape-scale flow addition experiment, in two sloughs that received elevated velocities (3-5 cm/s) and two control sloughs. The flowing sloughs produced periphyton with greater biomass, higher concentrations of nutrients, and lower C:P ratios. Snails, in a laboratory setting, gained more than 3.7-fold greater total mass when fed periphyton from flowing sloughs than snails fed periphyton from control sloughs. Water column nutrients were slightly elevated in flowing sloughs, but the amount could not fully explain differences in periphyton nutrients or snail growth. Increasing flow above background conditions improved food quality, which subsequently increased growth rates. Restoring flow has the potential to increase nutrient accessibility that could enhance food webs, but additional study will be needed to determine whether increased growth rates translate into increased standing stocks.

AB  - Simple Summary The prohibition on the use of antibiotics in animal nutrition has resulted in the more frequent use of phytobiotics, which are natural medical preparations made from herbs. When used in the nutrition of ruminants, phytobiotic preparations affect the motility of the gastrointestinal tract and the secretion of digestive juices, and also stimulate the development of the intestinal microbiota. Their effect on the development of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), with subsequent effects on the degree of microbial homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract, is particularly important. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of herbal supplements on lactic acid bacteria (LAB) count in the faeces of lactating dairy goats. It was assumed that the specific chemical composition of herbal supplements would positively affect the digestive processes of does, and thus the growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) colonies. The research was conducted on dairy goats assigned to five nutrition groups of twelve animals each. The animals in the experimental groups received a supplement made of (seven or nine) herbs at a rate of 20 g or 40 g per animal per day. A statistically significant effect of lactation stage on the intestinal Lactobacillus bacteria count was found. The highest concentration of LAB was found in the group receiving a feed supplement consisting of nine herbs at 20 g per animal per day. A probiotic strain of Lactobacillus fermentum absent from the control goats was identified in the faecal samples of goats that receiving the herbal supplement. Sixty dairy goats of the Polish white improved breed were randomly assigned to five feeding groups of twelve animals each. The animals received a supplement containing seven herbs at 20 or 40 g/animal/day (experimental groups 1 and 2) and a supplement containing nine herbs at 20 or 40 g/animal/day (experimental groups 3 and 4)m, along with pelleted concentrate feed. Group 5 (the control group) received pelleted feed without any herbal supplements. A significant effect of herbal feed additive on lactic acid bacteria (LAB) count was observed (p < 0.001). The highest number density of LAB was found in the goats receiving the feed additive with nine herbs at 20 g/animal per day (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant effect of lactation stage on intestinal LAB count (p < 0.001). Regardless of the feeding group, the highest number density of LAB was found in animals at the peak of lactation. The LAB count was also affected by the interaction of diet group x lactation stage (p < 0.0001). A probiotic strain of Lactobacillus fermentum was identified in the faecal samples of goats receiving the herbal additive, but not in the controls. Genetic identification of the microorganisms isolated from the faeces of the experimental goats did not reveal the presence of harmful mould spores, although spores of the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus were detected in the controls.

AB  - The timing of metamorphosis has recently been referred as a more suitable proxy to evaluate postlarval quality than size. Indeed, while displaying a larger size at settlement, late settlers that originate from larvae that have delayed metamorphosis commonly display poorer growth performances This delay in metamorphosis is possibly at the expenses of larval endogenous energetic reserves that, once allocated to facilitate the delayed transition to benthic life, will no longer be available to help fuelling early juvenile somatic growth. To further advance our knowledge on this topic, we evaluated the physiological status (energy reserves and allocation, aerobic and anaerobic energy consumption), along with biochemical responses related with detoxification processes, antioxidant defences, oxidative damage, neuromotor activity in early settlers (ES), middle settlers (MS) and late settlers (LS) of postlarvae of the marine ornamental shrimp Lysmata seticaudata. Our results revealed that LS postlarvae presented a higher weight compared to MS and ES, likely related with a lower metabolism and neuromotor activity. Yet, the low metabolism allied with diminished detoxification and antioxidant capacities seemed to result in an increased oxidative stress condition that may negatively condition the growth performance of LS postlarvae. Conversely, ES postlarvae presented a lower weight, likely because of high metabolic costs associated with increased neuromotor activity, detoxification, and antioxidant capacities to avoid oxidative damage. The present study highlights how the physiological, metabolic and biochemical status of L. seticaudata postlarvae is shaped by the timing of their metamorphosis, as well as how this event will shape their early benthic life and confirms that a larger size or weight at metamorphosis may not be good proxies to select premium seedlings for grow-out. Overall, metamorphosis is not a new beginning and does not reset larval history. Crustacean farmers should avoid decoupling larviculture history from grow-out, as only by knowing larval performance to metamorphosis will it be possible to enhance survival and growth performances to commercial size.

AB  - Despite decades of research resulting in a comprehensive understanding of epicuticular wax metabolism, the function of these almost ubiquitous metabolites in plant-herbivore interactions remains unresolved. In this study, we examined the effects of CRISPR-induced knockout mutations in four Nicotiana glauca (tree tobacco) wax metabolism genes. These mutations cause a wide range of changes in epicuticular wax composition, leading to altered interactions with insects and snails. Three interaction classes were examined: chewing herbivory by seven caterpillars and one snail species, phloem feeding by Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) and oviposition by Bemisia tabaci (whitefly). Although total wax load and alkane abundance did not affect caterpillar growth, a correlation across species, showed that fatty alcohols, a minor component of N. glauca surface waxes, negatively affected the growth of both a generalist caterpillar (Spodoptera littoralis) and a tobacco-feeding specialist (Manduca sexta). This negative correlation was overshadowed by the stronger effect of anabasine, a nicotine isomer, and was apparent when fatty alcohols were added to an artificial lepidopteran diet. By contrast, snails fed more on waxy leaves. Aphid reproduction and feeding activity were unaffected by wax composition but were potentially affected by altered cutin composition. Wax crystal morphology could explain the preference of B. tabaci to lay eggs on waxy wild-type plants relative to both alkane and fatty alcohol-deficient mutants. Together, our results suggest that the varied responses among herbivore classes and species are likely to be a consequence of the co-evolution that shaped the specific effects of different surface wax components in plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Bycatch of trawl fishery is a global concern and batoid fishes, including skates, rays and guitar fishes, are caught frequently as non-targeted species in commercial trawl fishery of India. While the commercial batoid species are documented separately in fishery data, a large number of non-commercial species do not form part of fishery data, even though many such species are listed as 'Data Deficient' in IUCN red list. A survey was conducted from July 2018 to June 2019 in the major harbours and landing centres of the south coasts of India to monitor the non-commercial batoid species in the trawl bycatch. Massive landings of non-commercial batoid species such as Torpedo sinuspersici, Narcine cf maculata, Orbiraja powelli Acroteriobatus variegatus and the occasional occurrence of Dipturus johannisdavisi, Benthobatis moresbyi, Narcine timlei and Plesiobatis daviesi have been recorded, besides the juveniles, sub-adults and few adults of commercial species Rhinobatos annandalei, Brevitrygon imbricata and Neotrygon indica from south India. The non-commercial batoids mainly inhabit continental shelf and slope regions of Indian coast where fishing pressure and efforts are high. When these k-selected species live in fishing zones with intense fishing pressure, data deficient species of batoids should be considered as threatened, and this paper discuss challenges in the sector, and forwards strategies for conserving non-targeted batoids.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the in-situ nutrient degradation and degradation kinetics of some starch-rich cereal and legume grains in sheep consuming diet containing high (32%) level of starch. Three cannulated Akkaraman sheep, 5-6 years old, were utilized in the study. Sheep with rumen cannula were fed with diets containing 32% starch 10 days before and throughout the trial. The study used barley, and corn as starch-rich cereal grains, Hungarian vetch, and forage pea grains as pulse grains to determine nutrient degradations. The feed samples used in the in-situ study were incubated for 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours in the rumen for 3 sheep as 6 replicates for each incubation time. Dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP) and starch degradation rate of feeds were calculated. The water-soluble fraction, the potentially degradable fraction, and the non-degradable nutrient fraction were also calculated. Degradation kinetics of nutrients were determined. By-pass CP contents of feedstuffs were calculated using 12 h incubation values. Except for starch, all degradation values for all incubation times, degradation rates, and nutrient fractions for all nutrients were significantly different among feedstuffs (P < 0.05). It can be concluded from this study that DM, OM and CP degradations of corn and forage peas and Hungarian vetch (HV) were higher after 48 hours of incubation, while starch degradations of barley were higher than corn. From the point of view of acidosis, it was concluded that the degradation rates of corn and HV were significantly slower than barley and forage pea and that these feedstuffs can be preferred at higher rates, especially in high starch rations, which may reduce the risk of acidosis.

AB  - When foraging, making appropriate food choices is crucial to an animal's fitness. Classic foraging ecology theories assume animals choose food of greatest benefit based on their absolute value across multiple dimensions. Consequently, poorer options are considered irrelevant alternatives that should not influence decision-making among better options. But heuristic studies demonstrate that irrelevant alternatives (termed decoys) can influence the decisions of some animals, indicating they use a relative rather than absolute evaluation system. Our aim was to test whether a decoy influenced the decision-making process-that is, information-gathering and food choice-of a free-ranging mammalian herbivore. We tested swamp wallabies, Wallabia bicolor, comparing their behavior toward, and choice of, two available food options over time in the absence or presence of the decoy. We used a phantom decoy-unavailable option-and ran two trials in different locations and seasons. Binary preferences (decoy absent) for the two available food options differed between trials. Irrespective of this difference, across both trials the presence of the decoy resulted in animals more likely to overtly investigate available food options. But, the decoy only shifted food choice, weakly, in one trial. Our results indicate that the decoy influenced the information-gathering behavior during decision-making, providing the first evidence that decoys can affect decision-making process of free-ranging mammalian herbivores in an ecologically realistic context. It is premature to say these findings confirm the use of relative evaluation systems. Whether the foraging outcome is more strongly affected by other decoys, food dimensions, or ecological contexts, is yet to be determined.
   Lay Summary Classic foraging models assume that poorer food options are irrelevant when animals make decisions about better food options. However, we found wild foraging wallabies increase information-gathering behaviors by investigating available food options more in the presence of a "phantom decoy"- unavailable option-that was desirable. Our finding-that an irrelevant option affects behaviors during decision-making-brings us closer to understanding cognitive processes behind food selection and may improve predictive capacity of ecological foraging models.

AB  - Altered precipitation patterns due to climate change are likely to impose water-deficit stress in plants resulting in changes to specific leaf mass, leaf water content and chemical defences that may impact herbivorous arthropods. Grasses, in particular, accumulate large concentrations of silicon (Si) which provides physical defence against herbivores. Although Si uptake by plants may be affected by water availability, very few studies have investigated the combined effect of water-deficit stress and Si on insect herbivore performance.
   We grew tall fescue Festuca arundinacea Schreb. hydroponically, with and without Si, and half of the plants were treated with 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) to impose osmotic stress. In all, 11 leaf traits (physiological, chemical and structural) were measured, silicified phytoliths on the leaf surface were visualised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in conjunction with X-ray mapping, and plants were exposed to a chewing insect herbivore [Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)].
   Although osmotic stress was associated with changes to leaf physiological and chemical traits, including increased specific leaf mass, decreased leaf relative water content and increased leaf nitrogen (N), there was no significant effect on H. armigera relative growth rate (RGR). However, Si reduced RGR of H. armigera by 80%-98% while generating few changes to physiological and chemical leaf traits. Instead, the decline in RGR with Si was associated with changes to leaf structural traits, in particular, a greater density of silicified phytoliths on the leaf surface.
   Comparison of effect sizes indicated that leaf traits were primarily affected by osmotic stress but not Si, and that herbivore RGR was strongly negatively affected by Si but not osmotic stress. There was no interactive effect between the osmotic stress and Si treatments on H. armigera RGR or plant traits except for leaf nitrogen and phenolic concentrations. This study provides further support that Si may prove to be beneficial to plants against chewing insect pests and remains robust regardless of water-deficit stress conditions.

AB  - Nepal's lowland regions provide a rich habitat for greater one-horned rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis) populations. However, rhinos are facing human-caused and natural threats such as habitat loss and several other forms of anthropogenic pressure that cause mortality of greater one-horned rhinos (hereafter rhino) in Nepal. Understanding these patterns of mortality can provide important information for rhino conservation. In this study, we answered three important questions to aid in rhino conservation in Nepal:1)what was the pattern of rhino mortality (increased, decreased, or no change) during 2008-2018 in Nepal? 2) Does the pattern of rhino mortality vary by season, age, and gender? And, 3) what are the major causes of rhino mortality in Nepal? We collected rhino mortality data along with age, gender, and cause of death in the period between 2008 and 2018 in Nepal from secondary sources. We found that a total of 232 cases of rhino mortalities were observed during the 11-year period. Mortality of the rhino was associated with age and cause but not with gender and season. Among the nine categories of the causes of mortality, self-fighting, natural, tiger attacks, and poaching contributed about 80 % of total mortality. Mortality due to poaching of rhinos has decreased in recent years, while mortality due to self-fighting and tiger attacks have increased. We concluded that mortality causes associated with limited space and food, and tiger population growth are increasing in recent years. Therefore, habitat expansion, translocation to new suitable habitats, and multispecies conservation policy would contribute to long-term rhino conservation in Nepal.

AB  - Tail breakage is an important anti-predator mechanism in snake populations, which can be used as a proxy for predation intensity as natural observations of predator-prey interactions are scarce. Frequency of tail breakage was calculated for two Iberian colubrids recently introduced in the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean, Spain): the Horseshoe Whip Snake (Hemorrhois hippocrepis (Linnaeus, 1758)) in Eivissa and the Ladder Snake (Zamenis scalar's (Schinz, 1812)) in Formentera. The effect of sex, life stage, dorsal coloration pattern, body length, and body condition on frequency of tail breakage and on remaining subcaudal scale pairs were analyzed and compared between the indigenous range and the invaded islands. An increase of the frequency of tail breakage with body size was found, supporting a size-related effect, which also occurs in the indigenous range. Frequency of tail breakage of H. hippocrepis was lower in Eivissa when compared with the original area, whereas in Formentera, Z. scalaris showed a higher frequency, which could be related to the different predator community on each island compared with the mainland. The study of the main ecological aspects of these recently introduced species may allow one to assess their potential impact on insular ecosystems and their indigenous biodiversity, as well as to promote future control actions in these areas previously free of snakes.

AB  - Inorganic fertilizers have been widely used to achieve high apple yields throughout China, especially in Northwest China. This approach has adverse effects on apple orchard soil environments and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, we investigated the effects of combined organic and inorganic fertilizers on GHG emissions, soil properties, and apple yield to assess the greenhouse gas inventory and to determine which fertilization manner is good for the sustainable development of apple orchards. A split plot design was used, with main treatment of fertilizer ditch (FD) site and a bare soil (BS) site, each with four subtreatments: organic fertilizer-goat manure (M), chemical fertilizer (NPK), chemical fertilizer combined with organic fertilizer-goat manure (MNPK), and control (CK). The cumulative N2O emissions at the FD site were higher than those at the BS site (by 105.72%). The N2O emissions ranged from approximately 0.95-5.91 kg ha(-1) and were higher in the MNPK treatment than in the other treatments. The cumulative CH4 uptake from each treatment was generally negative (1.06-7.67 kg ha(-1)). Compared to the other treatments, the MNPK treatment applied at the FD site led to an increased global warming potential. At both the FD and BS sites, the MNPK treatment led to a lower greenhouse gas intensity than the NPK treatment. Nitrates nitrogen (NO3--N), water-filled pore space, and temperature all influenced GHG emissions. These results showed that the MNPK treatment was more conducive than the other treatments to the sustainable development of apple orchards in the Loess Plateau region of China.

AB  - The pervasive use of plastic in modern society has led to plastic litter becoming ubiquitous within the ocean. Land-based sources of plastic litter are thought to account for the majority of plastic pollution in the marine environment, with plastic bags, bottles, wrappers, food containers and cutlery among the most common items found. In the marine environment, plastic is a transboundary pollutant, with the potential to cause damage far beyond the political borders from where it originated, making the management of this global pollutant particularly complex. In this study, the risks of land-derived plastic litter (LDPL) to major groups of marine megafauna - seabirds, cetaceans, pinnipeds, elasmobranchs, turtles, sirenians, tuna and billfish - and a selection of productive and biodiverse biogenic habitats - coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass, saltmarsh and kelp beds - were analysed using a Spatial Risk Assessment approach. The approach combines metrics for vulnerability (mechanism of harm for megafauna group or habitat), hazard (plastic abundance) and exposure (distribution of group or habitat). Several potential high-risk zones (HRZs) across the North Atlantic were highlighted, including the Azores, the UK, the French and US Atlantic coasts, and the US Gulf of Mexico. Whilst much of the modelled LDPL driving risk in the UK originated from domestic sources, in other HRZs, such as the Azores archipelago and the US Gulf of Mexico, plastic originated almost exclusively from external (non -domestic) sources. LDPL from Caribbean islands - some of the largest generators of marine plastic pollution in the dataset of river plastic emissions used in the study - was noted as a significant input to HRZs across both sides of the Atlantic. These findings highlight the potential of Spatial Risk Assessment analyses to determine the location of HRZs and understand where plastic debris monitoring and management should be prioritised, enabling more efficient deployment of interventions and mitigation measures.

AB  - Plants minimize fitness losses through grazing by three fundamental strategies: tolerance, avoidance and escape. Annual species have been traditionally assumed to escape grazing through their short life cycle and seed dormancy; however, their grazing response strategies remain almost unexplored. How traits and their coordination affect species' grazing responses, and whether the generalized grazing model, which posits convergent filtering by grazing and drought, is applicable to this ecologically and economically important species group thus remain unclear. We used a trait-based approach to evaluate grazing response strategies of winter annuals from the Middle East. Across 23 species, we examined the coordination of 16 traits hypothesized to be relevant for grazing responses, and linked them to species' fecundity responses, as proxy for fitness responses, to simulated grazing in controlled conditions, to species' abundance responses to grazing in the field and to species' distribution along a large-scale rainfall gradient. Winter annuals exhibited both grazing escape and to a lesser extent tolerance indicated by (a) independent coordination of escape and tolerance traits, and (b) maintenance of higher fecundity in species with more pronounced escape or tolerance traits under simulated grazing. In the natural habitat, species with a more pronounced escape but not tolerance strategy maintained higher abundance under grazing in dry habitats, indicating convergent favouring of escape by both grazing and drought. However, this finding at the local scale was not mirrored by a strategy shift along a large-scale rainfall gradient. Synthesis. The convergent favouring of escape traits by grazing and drought in annuals is consistent with the generalized grazing model. This model, which has been developed for perennials based on the avoidance strategy, can thus be extended to annuals based on escape, a finding that should facilitate projecting consequences of global change in drylands dominated by annuals.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Insects are frequently attracted to animal and human cadavers, usually in large numbers. The practice of forensic entomology can utilize information regarding the identity and characteristics of insect assemblages on dead organisms to determine the time elapsed since death occurred. However, for insects to be used for forensic applications it is essential that species are identified correctly. Imprecise identification not only affects the forensic utility of insects but also results in an incomplete image of necrophagous entomofauna in general. The present state of knowledge on morphological diversity and taxonomy of necrophagous insects is still incomplete and identification of immature and female forms can be extremely difficult. In this study, we utilized molecular identification methods to link conspecific sexes and developmental stages of forensically important flies. We identified larvae and females of flies collected from animal and human cadavers which otherwise were morphologically unidentifiable. The present study fills a gap in taxonomy of flies and provides data facilitating application of new species as forensic indicators.
   Application of available keys to European Fanniidae did not facilitate unequivocal species identification for third instar larvae and females of Fannia Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830 collected during a study of arthropod succession on pig carrion. To link these samples to known species, we took the advantage of molecular identification methods and compared newly obtained cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) barcode sequences against sequences deposited in reference databases. As an outcome of the results obtained, we describe for the first time a third instar larva of Fannia nigra Malloch, 1910 and Fannia pallitibia (Rondani, 1866) and a female of Fannia collini d'Assis-Fonseca, 1966. We provide combinations of characters allowing for discrimination of described insects from other Fanniidae. We provide an update for the key by Rozkosny et al. 1997, which allows differentiation between females of F. collini and other species of Fanniidae. Additionally, we provide a case of a human cadaver discovered in Southern Poland and insect fauna associated with it as the first report of F. nigra larvae developing on a human body.

AB  - Pig production contributes considerably to land use and greenhouse gas (GHG) and reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions. Land use strategies were widely proposed, but the spillover effects on biological flow are rarely explored. Here, we simultaneously assessed the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and cropland footprints of China's pig production at the provincial scale in 2017. The environmental impacts of land use strategies were further evaluated. Results show that one kg live-weight pig production generated an average of 1.9 kg CO2-equiv and 59 g Nr emissions, occupying 3.5 m(2) cropland, with large regional variations. A large reduction in GHG (58-64%) and Nr (12-14%) losses and occupied cropland (10-11%) could be achieved simultaneously if combined strategies of intensive crop production, improved feed-protein utilization efficiency, and feeding co-products were implemented. However, adopting a single strategy may have environmental side-effects. Reallocating cropland that pigs used for feed to plant food alternatives would enhance human-edible energy (3-20 times) and protein delivery (1-5 times) and reduce C and N footprints, except for rice and vegetables. Reallocating cropland to beef and milk production would decrease energy and protein supply. Therefore, a proper combination of land use strategies is essential to alleviate land use changes and nutrient emissions without sacrificing food supply.

AB  - The Neptune Islands Group and Western Kangaroo Island Marine Parks were declared as part of South Australia's representative system of Marine protected areas (MPAs) in 2009. Sanctuary zones, located within these MPAs, prohibited commercial fishing in the state's Northern Zone Rock Lobster Fishery from 2014. In 2022, dedicated surveys were undertaken both inside and outside two of the sanctuary zones to estimate the relative abundance (catch per unit effort; CPUE) and size of southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii). Survey results were then compared to estimates of abundance obtained from long-term commercial fishery-dependent data within each area. The legal-size CPUE by weight of lobsters was 389% and 411% higher inside sanctuary zones of the Neptune Islands Group and Western Kangaroo Island, respectively, compared to outside, based on survey data. Survey catch rates inside the two sanctuary zones were also considerably higher than historical catch rates estimated from commercial fishing data. Lobsters inside both sanctuary zones were larger than those outside in terms of mean weight compared to historical estimates. However, surveys recorded similar mean size in lobsters both inside and outside the Neptune Islands Group sanctuary zone, indicating a possible spillover effect of MPA protection. The Northern Zone Rock Lobster Fishery is currently in a biomass rebuilding phase. The results highlight the productivity potential of temperate reef ecosystems within South Australia in terms of southern rock lobster abundances.

AB  - In China, the population of wild musk deer, belonging to the family Moschidae, has drastically decreased in recent years owing to human activities and environmental changes. During the 1990s, artificial breeding of Alpine musk deer was conducted in Xinglong Mountain, Gansu Province, China, and their ex situ conservation was explored for over a decade. Ex situ protection is beneficial for expanding the population of animals and maintaining their genetic diversity; however, it can also induce metabolic diseases and parasitic infections and reduce reproductive capacity. The gut microbiota of animals has a considerable impact on host energy metabolism and immune regulation, thereby playing a crucial role in the overall health and reproductive success of the host. In this study, by comparing the differences in the intestinal microbiome of the musk deer according to their place of origin and migration, the changes in their gut microbiota and the influencing factors were explored to provide a theoretical basis for monitoring the health status of the musk deer. We used 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze the structure and diversity of the gut microbiota of Alpine musk deer in Gansu (G, place of origin) and Sichuan (S, place of migration). The results showed that the dominant bacteria and genera in the intestinal microbiome of captive musk deer were similar in the places of origin and migration, but significant differences were observed in their relative abundance (p < 0.05). Regarding Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, which are related to plant cellulose digestion, the relative abundance in group G was higher than that in group S; regarding Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, which are related to fat and starch intake, the relative abundance in group S was higher than that in group G; the relative abundance of Bacillus and Clostridium sensu stricto, which are related to fiber digestibility, was higher in group G than in group S; the relative abundance of conditional pathogens Acinetobacter and Escherichia-Shigella was higher in group S than in group G. The results of alpha and beta diversity analysis also showed significant differences between the two groups (p < 0.05). The ACE and Shannon indices of musk deer in group G were considerably higher than those in group S, and the Simpson index of musk deer in group S was greater than that in group G, indicating that the abundance and diversity of intestinal microbiome were higher in musk deer of Gansu than those of Sichuan. Comparison of the changes in the intestinal microbiome of the musk deer according to the place of origin and migration showed that the plant cellulose content in the food of the musk deer, the fat content in the concentrated feed, and changes in the feeding environment have an impact on the intestinal microbiome. Effective monitoring of the health and immunity of the musk deer is crucial for ensuring their overall health, which in turn will aid in formulating a scientific and reasonable management plan for their conservation.

AB  - The Sandwich Plate is known as one of the tectonically most active regions in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica, characterised by a subsurface chain of active volcanic islands (the South Sandwich Arc), submarine volcanic features, an earthquake rich area along the South Sandwich Trench and hydrothermal vents on segments of the East Scotia Ridge. In 2013 and 2019 we investigated eight potential hydrothermally active sites in the forearc, island arc and back arc of the Sandwich Plate from shallow (60 m) to abyssal (3886 m) depths. All Protector Seamounts sites, Protector Shoal, Quest Caldera, and an unnamed submarine volcano, showed thermal anomalies, as did the East Scotia Ridge segment E5 back arc site. At Quest Caldera, chimney structures, bacterial mats and mineral precipitates were observed in a depression on the caldera rim. The investigated forearc sites showed hydroacoustic, but not temperature anomalies. None of the sites showed evidence of megafauna associated with hydrothermal venting or hydrocarbon seep sites, but did have evidence of both unexpectedly dense and sparse communities of Southern Ocean taxa in the vicinities of the anomalies. Overall, our investigations showed that the benthic habitats and communities of the Sandwich Plate are still barely known.

AB  - Accurate information on the spatial distribution and area of pig farms is essential for pig breeding monitoring, pork production estimation, and environmental governance of pig breeding. Governmental regulatory departments mostly rely on field surveys to obtain pig farm information, and there are few studies that focus on the extraction of pig farm information using remote sensing data. As the buildings on pig farms are small-scale and have scattered distributions, pig farm identification using high-resolution data and deep learning algorithms is worth exploring. In this article, a method of identifying pig farms with a deep learning algorithm and multiple sources of GaoFen (GF) image data was proposed. The experiments were conducted with different combinations of multiple sources of GaoFen satellite images (GF-2, GF-5, and GF-7) to determine the suitability of these images for pig farm extraction. The results illustrated that the average overall accuracy of the pig farm identification was above 80% using all of the different combinations of GaoFen sourced images. The spatial detail information provided by the GF-2 satellite improved the pig farm identification accuracy more than did the spectral detail information provided by the hyperspectral data from the GF-5 satellite and the digital surface model from the GF-7 satellite. The deep learning algorithm performed well in identifying pig farms with a greater number of patches and a higher aggregation index, and had lower accuracy in extracting pig farms distribution with a high edge density and patch density.

AB  - Simple Summary Wild boars are widely distributed in the northern and southern wooded regions of Switzerland and are popular for their meat. Wild boars can carry a variety of parasites, bacteria, and viruses that could infect humans and domestic animals. In this study, we focused on two important pathogens, the parasite Toxoplasma gondii and the bacterium Salmonella. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests to detect antibodies to these pathogens in diaphragm tissue samples from hunted wild boars from two different regions of Switzerland. While the seroprevalence of T. gondii antibodies was similar for animals from the northern and southern region (29% and 37%, respectively), Salmonella seropositivity was very much higher in wild boars from the northern area (52%) than among animals from the south (5%). This may be related to the wild boar density, which may in turn be a risk factor for domestic animals and humans living in the same area. Pathogens in wild boars are of public health significance as a potential source of meat-borne diseases in humans. Toxoplasma gondii and Salmonella are zoonotic foodborne pathogens that may be transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw or undercooked meat, including game. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of T. gondii and Salmonella antibodies in wild boars in two different regions in Switzerland. During the hunting season of 2020, a total of 126 diaphragm muscle samples of hunted wild boars were collected and the meat juice of these samples was analysed for pathogen-specific IgG antibodies using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The overall seroprevalences were 35% for T. gondii and 17% for Salmonella, respectively. In general, seropositivity increased with the age of the animals. Seroprevalences of T. gondii were similar for animals from the northern region (29%) to those from the southern region (36.8%), indicating that T. gondii is widespread in the sylvestrian environment. By contrast, Salmonella seropositivity was remarkably higher in wild boars from the north (52%) compared with those from the south (5.3%). The high occurrence of Salmonella may represent a risk of transmission to compatriot domestic animals such free-range farmed pigs as well as to humans. Further, meat of hunted wild boars may present a source of human toxoplasmosis or salmonellosis.

AB  - Genes involved in plant defences against herbivores and pathogens are often highly polymorphic. This is a putative sign that balancing selection may have operated reciprocally on the hosts and their herbivores. Spatial and temporal variations (for example, in soil nutrients and the plants' ontogenetic development) may also modulate resistance traits, and thus selection pressures, but have been largely overlooked in theories of plant defences. Important elements of defences in Populus tremula (hereafter aspen) are phenolic compounds, including condensed tannins (CTs). Concentrations of CTs vary considerably with both variations in external factors and time, but they are also believed to provide genotype-dependent resistance, mainly against chewing herbivores and pathogens. However, evidence of their contributions to resistance is sparse. Detailed studies of co-evolved plant-herbivore associations could provide valuable insights into these contributions. Therefore, we examined correlations between CT levels in aspen leaves and both the feeding behavior and reproduction of the specialist aspen leaf aphid (Chaitophorus tremulae) in varied conditions. We found that xylem sap intake and probing difficulties were higher on genotypes with high-CT concentrations. However, aphids engaged in more nonprobing activities on low-CT genotypes, indicating that CTs were not the only defence traits involved. Thus, high-CT genotypes were not necessarily more resistant than low-CT genotypes, but aphid reproduction was generally negatively correlated with local CT accumulation. Genotype-specific resistance ranking also depended on the experimental conditions. These results support the hypothesis that growth conditions may affect selection pressures mediated by aphids in accordance with balancing selection theory.

AB  - Grassland management practices vary in stocking rates and plant removal strategies (grazing versus mowing). They influence organic matter (OM) inputs, which were postulated as main controls of soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and might therefore control SOC stabilization. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by investigating the impacts of grassland harvesting regimes on parameters related to soil microbial functioning and soil organic matter (SOM) formation processes. We used a thirteen-year experiment in Central France under contrasting management (unmanaged, grazing with two intensities, mowing, bare fallow) to establish a carbon input gradient based on biomass leftovers after harvest. We investigated microbial biomass, basal respiration and enzyme activities as indicators of microbial functioning, and amino sugar content and composition as indicator of persistent SOM formation and origin through necromass accumulation. Responses of these parameters to carbon input along the gradient were contrasting and in most cases unrelated. Only the microbial C/N ratio and amino sugar contents showed a linear response indicating that they are influenced by plant-derived OM input. Other parameters were most probably more influenced by root activity, presence of herbivores, and/or physicochemical changes following management activities impacting soil

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine if gold-mining activities could impact the mercury (Hg) concentrations and isotopic signatures in freshwater fish consumed by riparian people in French Guiana. Total Hg, MeHg concentrations, and Hg stable isotopes ratios were analyzed in fish muscles from different species belonging to three feeding patterns (herbivorous, periphytophagous, and piscivorous). We compared tributaries impacted by gold-mining activities (Camopi, CR) with a pristine area upstream (Trois-Sauts, TS), along the Oyapock River. We measured delta N-15 and delta C-13 to examine whether Hg patterns are due to differences in trophic level. Differences in delta N-15 and delta C-13 values between both studied sites were only observed for periphytophagous fish, due to difference of CN baselines, with enriched values at TS. Total Hg concentrations and Hg stable isotope signatures showed that Hg accumulated in fish from both areas has undergone different biogeochemical processes. Delta Hg-199 variation in fish (-0.5 to 0.2 parts per thousand) was higher than the ecosystem baseline defined by a Delta Hg-199 of -0.66 parts per thousand in sediments, and suggested limited aqueous photochemical MeHg degradation. Photochemistry-corrected delta Hg-202 in fish was 0.7 parts per thousand higher than the baseline, consistent with biophysical and chemical isotope fractionation in the aquatic environment. While THg concentrations in periphytophagous fish were higher in the gold-mining area, disturbed by inputs of suspended particles, than in TS, the ensemble of Hg isotope shifts in fish is affected by the difference of biotic (methylation/demethylation) and abiotic (photochemistry) processes between both areas and did therefore not allow to resolve the contribution of gold-mining-related liquid Hg(0) in fish tissues. Mercury isotopes of MeHg in fish and lower trophic level organisms can be complementary to light stable isotope tracers.

AB  - Estimating animal abundance has a key role to play in ecology and conservation, but survey methods are always challenged by imperfect detection. Among the techniques applied to deal with this issue, Double Observer (DO) is increasing in popularity due to its cost-effectiveness. However, the effort of using DO for surveying large territories can be significant. A DO-based survey method that allows accurate abundance estimations with reduced effort would increase the applicability of the method. This would have positive effects on the conservation of species which are challenging to survey such as mountain ungulates. We used computer simulations based on real data and a field test to assess the reliability of the DO and of a new proposed survey procedure, the Double Observer Adjusted Survey (DOAS). DOAS is based on total block counts adjusted with some DO surveys conducted in a proportion of the total area only. Such DO surveys are then used to estimate detection probability with a mark-recapture-derived approach. We found that full DO is much more accurate than simple block counts for abundance estimations. DOAS is a less demanding alternative to full DO and can produce comparable abundance estimates, at the cost of a slightly lower precision. However, in the DOAS overall detectability has to be estimated within a sufficient number of sites (around a quarter of the total) to obtain a higher precision and avoid large overestimations. Practical implications. DO methods could increase the reliability of abundance estimations in mountain ungulates and other gregarious species. Full DO in particular could allow researchers to obtain unbiased estimations with high precision and its usage is therefore suggested instead of block counts in wildlife monitoring. Given the high costs of full DO, the DOAS procedure could be a viable and cost-effective survey strategy to improve abundance estimates when resources are scarce.
   Le stime di abbondanza degli animali hanno un ruolo cruciale in ecologia e conservazione, ma conteggi accurati sono sempre ostacolati dall'impossibilit & agrave; di osservare tutti gli individui presenti. Tra i metodi utilizzati per affrontare questo problema, il Doppio Osservatore (DO) sta guadagnando sempre pi & ugrave; popolarit & agrave; grazie ad un ottimo rapporto costi-benefici. Tuttavia, l'impiego del DO per monitorare zone estese pu & ograve; richiedere un notevole sforzo di campionamento. Pertanto, un protocollo di monitoraggio basato sul DO che mantenga l'accuratezza delle stime, riducendo al contempo lo sforzo richiesto, renderebbe il metodo pi & ugrave; pratico e applicabile. Ci & ograve; sarebbe particolarmente vantaggioso per la conservazione di specie difficili da monitorare, come gli ungulati di montagna. In questo studio, abbiamo utilizzato simulazioni al computer basate su dati reali e un test sul campo nel Parco Nazionale Gran Paradiso per valutare l'affidabilit & agrave; del Doppio Osservatore (DO) e di una nuova procedura di monitoraggio: il conteggio corretto con Doppio Osservatore, o Double Obsever Adjusted Survey (DOAS). Il DOAS combina conteggi totali eseguiti tramite il metodo dei block counts con alcune ripetizioni del DO su una porzione dell'area complessiva. Questi rilievi vengono utilizzati per stimare la contattabilit & agrave; attraverso un approccio derivato dai metodi di marcatura-ricattura e per correggere i risultati dei conteggi totali. I risultati dello studio evidenziano come i conteggi condotti interamente con il metodo DO forniscono stime di abbondanza decisamente pi & ugrave; accurate rispetto ai block counts. Il DOAS rappresenta un'alternativa che richiede meno sforzo di campionamento rispetto al DO, fornendo stime di abbondanza comparabili ma con una precisione leggermente inferiore. Tuttavia, nel DOAS & egrave; fondamentale effettuare ripetizioni con DO in un numero sufficiente di siti (circa un quarto del totale) per ottenere una maggiore precisione ed evitare grosse sovrastime. I metodi basati sul Doppio Osservatore hanno il potenziale di migliorare notevolmente l'affidabilit & agrave; delle stime di abbondanza, sia per gli ungulati di montagna che per altre specie gregarie. In particolare, l'applicazione del DO sull'intera area di studio consentirebbe di ottenere stime altamente accurate e precise, motivo per cui se ne raccomanda l'uso nel monitoraggio della fauna selvatica in alternativa ai censimenti esaustivi (block counts). Tuttavia, considerando i costi elevati associati al DO, il protocollo DOAS rappresenta una soluzione di monitoraggio valida ed economicamente sostenibile, particolarmente utile in contesti di risorse limitate.

AB  - . Maintaining the integrity of Indigenous ways of knowing in research is impossible without transforming research governance and practice, which is most often controlled and bound by Western scientific modes of inquiry. Scientists and practitioners are seeking practical advice on how they can be a part of this transformation. To help serve this need, we identified 26 Action Items for bridging Indigenous and Western knowledge systems and put them together into a conceptually cohesive framework. Our metasynthesis examines research practices pertaining to nine exemplar case studies in relation to shared values of Indigenous research frameworks, and settings for bridging knowledge systems. We provide context-specific examples of how each Action Item is operationalized by the exemplar case studies. The 26 Action Items can be used to set accountability metrics and guide scholars and practitioners as they conceive, design, and implement biodiversity research and monitoring. We offer A Growing Tree metaphor, and graphic, to unite the 26 Action Items into a holistic narrative that can function as a guiding framework and aesthetic reflective tool. The framework and Action Items can help scholars and practitioners as they embark on bridging knowledge systems; yet, listening to the unique perspectives of Indigenous research partners in a specific research context is paramount to ethical bridging of Indigenous and Western knowledge systems.

AB  - Olive mill wastes (OMW) management by composting allows to obtain valuable fertilizing products, but also implies significant fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHG). For a proper OMW composting, high C- and N co-substrates are necessary, but little is known concerning their effect on GHG emissions in OMW-industrial scale composting. In this study, different co-composting agents (cattle manure (CM), poultry manure (PM), sheep manure (SM) and pig slurry solid fraction (PSSF) as N sources and olive leaves (OLW) and urban pruning residues (UPR) as bulking agents and C sources) were used for OMW composting at industrial scale. Physico-chemical and chemical properties in the composting samples, and GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) fluxes were monitored in 12 industrial-scale windrows. GHG emissions were firstly influenced by N source, with the highest accumulated global warming potential (GWP) associated with PM (512 kg CO2eq pile-1), since PM composts were associated with the greatest N2O (0.33 kg pile-1) and CH4 emissions (15.67 kg pile-1). Meanwhile, PSSF was associated with the highest CO2 emissions (1113 kg pile-1). UPR as a bulking agent facilitated 10 % greater mineralization of the biomass than OLW, however this C-source was not associated with higher GHG emissions. The results showed that while mineralization dynamics may be impacted by C sources, GHG emissions were mainly conditioned by the characteristics of nutrient-heavy feedstocks (PM and SM). Moreover, manures as nitrogen-laden co-substrates had widely differing effects on total GWP, and that of individual gases, but further research is necessary to understand the mechanisms explaining such differences.

AB  - Synthetic estrogens are emerging environmental contaminants with great estrogenic activities and stable structures that are widespread in various ecological systems and significantly threaten the health of organisms. Pseudomonas citronellolis SJTE-3 is reported to degrade the synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) effi-ciently in laboratory conditions. In this work, the environmental adaptability, the EE2-degrading properties, and the ecological effects of P. citronellolis SJTE-3 under different hostile conditions (heavy metals and surfactants) and various natural environment samples (solid soil, lake water, and pig manure) were studied. Strain SJTE-3 can tolerate high concentrations of Zn2+ and Cr3+, but is relatively sensitive to Cu2+. Tween 80 of low concentration can significantly promote EE2 degradation by strain SJTE-3, different from the repressing effect of Triton X-100. High concentration of Tween 80 prolonged the lagging phase of EE2-degrading process, while the final EE2 removal efficiency was improved. More importantly, strain SJTE-3 can grow normally and degrade estrogen stably in various environmental samples. Inoculation of strain SJTE-3 removed the intrinsic synthetic and natural estrogens (EE2 and estrone) in lake water samples in 4 days, and eliminated over 90% of the amended 1 mg/L EE2 in 2 days. Bioaugmentation of strain SJTE-3 in EE2-supplied solid soil and pig manure samples achieved a removal rate of over 55% and 70% of 1 mg/kg EE2 within 2 weeks. Notably, the bioaugmentation of extrinsic strain SJTE-3 had a slight influence on indigenous bacterial community in pig manure samples, and its relative abundance decreased significantly after EE2 removal. Amendment of EE2 or strain SJTE-3 in manure samples enhanced the abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, implying their potential in utilizing EE2 or its metabolites. These findings not only shed a light on the environment adaptability and degradation efficiency of strain SJTE-3, but also provide insights for bioremediation application in complex and synthetic estrogen polluted environments.

AB  - This study finds that the livestock environmental regulation (LER) imposed by China has promoted the spatial agglomeration of hog production in the administrative border areas, thereby posing a threat to ecological sustainability. We apply the difference-in-differences-in-differences (DDD) method to a unique dataset in counties along the main stem and 38 important tributaries of the Yangtze River basin in China from 2008 to 2019. Specifically, the slaughter volume and density of hogs in the most downstream border counties of a city are 7.87% and 9.56% higher, respectively, than those of otherwise identical counties within the same municipal jurisdiction. Conversely, in the most upstream border counties, these figures decreased by 12.02% and 15.35%, respectively. Moreover, we find that the fixed capital investment in the most downstream border counties is 22.54% less than that in otherwise identical counties. These findings imply that LER has driven the agglomeration of hog production in downstream administrative border areas, inadvertently shifting the pollution burden to these regions and posing potential challenges to the effectiveness of environmental policies.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is a synthetic compound utilized in industry for the production of various plastics. BPA penetrates into the environment and adversely affects living organisms. Therefore, the influence of various BPA dosages on the neurochemical characteristics of nerve fibers located in the aortic branch wall was investigated in this study utilizing a double immunofluorescence method. It was found that BPA in concentration of 0.5 mg/kg body weight/day causes a clear increase in the density of nerves within aortic branch walls immunoreactive to cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Nerves containing galanin (GAL) and/or somatostatin (SOM) did not change when BPA was introduced into the system. Changes noted after administration of BPA at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg body weight/day were less visible and concerned fibers immunoreactive to CART, CGRP, and/or PACAP. The obtained results show that BPA affects the neurochemical coding of nerves in the aortic branch wall. These fluctuations may be the first signs of the influence of this substance on blood vessels and may also be at the root of the disturbances in the cardiovascular system.

KW  - WILDLIFE TRADE
AB  - Illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is a persistent and extensive threat to global biodiversity. Hundreds of marine fish species are subject to regulation under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), but it is unclear how much protection species gain from CITES because information on marine fish IWT is limited. We used online reports of seized shipments of seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) to investigate their illegal trade. Seahorses were the first genus of marine fishes to be listed under CITES. We compiled 297 unique seizure records from 192 online outlets posted from January 2010 to April 2021 and analyzed the number of seahorses seized, the value of the seized items, trade routes, and other seizure details. Dried seahorses accounted for nearly all seizures, which totaled around 5 million individuals valued at over US$28 million. The reported number of seizures and the number of seahorses seized increased over time. Reported illegal trade involved 62 countries and other jurisdictions. Seized seahorses predominantly originated in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. China was the primary destination. Seahorses were mostly intercepted in transit and in destination countries rather than source countries. Airports were the most common location for seizures, and passenger baggage represented the primary transportation method by number of seizures, but sea cargo facilitated the largest seizures. Seahorses were most commonly seized by customs, often in conjunction with other regulated wildlife products. Although seizures led to detention of actors, information on subsequent legal actions was limited. Addressing the illegal trade in seahorses requires greater enforcement in source countries and increasing the realized risks associated with smuggling. Our findings can inform intelligence-led enforcement efforts to curb seahorse trafficking and highlight data biases and gaps that should be addressed to facilitate enhanced deterrence measures.

AB  - Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is a common morphological trait in ungulates, with polygyny considered the leading driver of larger male body mass and weapon size. However, not all polygynous species exhibit SSD, while molecular evidence has revealed a more complex relationship between paternity and mating system than originally predicted. SSD is, therefore, likely to be shaped by a range of social, ecological and physiological factors. We present the first definitive analysis of SSD in the common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) using a unique morphological dataset collected from 2994 aged individuals. The results confirm that hippos exhibit SSD, but the mean body mass differed by only 5% between the sexes, which is rather limited compared with many other polygynous ungulates. However, jaw and canine mass are significantly greater in males than females (44% and 81% heavier, respectively), highlighting the considerable selection pressure for acquiring larger weapons. A predominantly aquatic lifestyle coupled with the physiological limitations of their foregut fermenting morphology likely restricts body size differences between the sexes. Indeed, hippos appear to be a rare example among ungulates whereby sexual selection favours increased weapon size over body mass, underlining the important role that species-specific ecology and physiology have in shaping SSD.

KW  - IDENTIFICATION
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined in raw milk from Northwest Nigerian cattle (cow, goat and sheep) as indicators in assessing the current pollution status of the region. In Northwest Nigeria, most animals are free rangers with the likelihood that PAHs have been taken up by these animals on the process of drinking PAHs contaminated surface waters, eating road-side grasses, and soils. A total of 42 composite milk samples were collected by milking 3-5 animals. PAHs were extracted after saponification of the milk fats through sonication using dichloromethane/hexane mixture and the five ascertained most abundant PAHs are: Phe > BaP > Chr > Fla. > Pyr using gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The diagnostic ratios showed that combustion is the major pathway of PAHs emission in the study area which judging from the economic level of the area, could be attributed to vehicular exhaust emission, use of firewood, industrial fumes, waste incineration and bush burning at the beginning of the farming season. The values of PAHs showed no significant variations (p > 0.05), either between the milk types (cow, goat and sheep) or between the seven states' milk samples, indicating a similar source of the PAHs. The European Food Safety Authority set 2 mu g/kg w/w BaP as a marker for the occurrence of PAHs contamination and assessment of likely effect of carcinogenic PAH in foodstuffs, the value of BaP obtained was however much higher even though raw milk is about 80% water. Most PAHs have carcinogenic effects on humans and induce various cancers. Therefore there should be a reduction in the bush burning at the beginning of the farming season, use of firewood and other pronounced sources of PAHs in the region.

AB  - Wolves in Europe are expanding their range and significantly impacting farming livelihoods and landscapes. Damage prevention measures such as livestock guarding dogs and night-time enclosures have proven successful in mitigating losses. However, they are often implemented as top-down measures without a proper understanding of the farming dynamics they are meant to alter, making them unappealing and difficult to implement for farmers. Semi-extensive, small scale livestock farming systems are particularly vulnerable and diverse, requiring specific care and catered support when addressing issues related to wildlife management. In these contexts, it is crucial to employ adaptive management approaches that enable solutions to be collaboratively designed at the grassroots level. Here we propose a method for centring the experiences and knowledge of local farmers to co-produce damage prevention practices that better address their needs. We developed this approach in the course of the LIFE MEDWOLF project, which was implemented in the province of Grosseto, Italy, between 2012 and 2017. The project brought together local authorities, environmental associations, farming unions and individual farmers to develop tailor-made damage prevention measures and assess their technical and economic impact, through a stepwise process. Collaboration with 86 local farmers resulted in >50 modifications to the original project plan, and an overall 50% reduction of preyed livestock in farms that participated in the project. Our findings highlight the benefits of collaboratively designing, implementing, and monitoring damage prevention measures with farmers. Based on these results, we reflect on the importance of integrating local and scientific knowledge, on the implications this has had on stakeholder relations, and on the challenges that we faced in upscaling this management approach.

AB  - Defense against natural enemies constitutes an important driver of herbivore host range evolution in the wild. Populations of the Baltimore checkerspot butterfly, Euphydryas phaeton (Nymphalidae), have recently incorporated an exotic plant, Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae), into their dietary range. To understand the tritrophic consequences of utilizing this exotic host plant, we examined immune performance, chemical defense, and interactions with a natural entomopathogen (Junonia coenia densovirus, Parvoviridae) across wild populations of this specialist herbivore. We measured three immune parameters, sequestration of defensive iridoid glycosides (IGs), and viral infection load in field-collected caterpillars using either P. lanceolata or a native plant, Chelone glabra (Plantaginaceae). We found that larvae using the exotic plant exhibited reduced immunocompetence, compositional differences in IG sequestration, and higher in situ viral burdens compared to those using the native plant. On both host plants, high IG sequestration was associated with reduced hemocyte concentration in the larval hemolymph, providing the first evidence of incompatibility between sequestered chemical defenses and the immune response (i.e., the "vulnerable host" hypothesis) from a field-based study. However, despite this negative relationship between IG sequestration and cellular immunity, caterpillars with greater sequestration harbored lower viral loads. While survival of virus-infected individuals decreased with increasing viral burden, it ultimately did not differ between the exotic and native plants. These results provide evidence that: (1) phytochemical sequestration may contribute to defense against pathogens even when immunity is compromised and (2) herbivore persistence on exotic plant species may be facilitated by sequestration and its role in defense against natural enemies.

AB  - The conservation and management of mobile species, populations and dynamic habitats, presents significant challenges since such species face diverse threats during various stages of their life cycle. Protected areas (PAs) are essential tools in conservation efforts, aiming to preserve native species and their habitats. However, larger mobile animals, such as the Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata), may require much larger areas outside PAs for essential life moments, including foraging, resting, and wintering. As a result, the efficacy of PAs in conserving such species may be questionable. We designed an experiment in an eastern Spain PA that is home to nesting Bonelli's eagles to determine if increasing food availability through experimental feeding within the PA could result in an effective reduction of space use outside the protected area by the eagles and lead to reduce death risk. Over the period of 2016 to 2021, we tracked 10 Bonelli's eagles from six different territories using GPS-GSM transmitters. We evaluated their space use before, during, and after the feeding experiment. Our results indicate that the availability of food within PAs restricted the eagles' movement, resulting in a higher concentration of locations inside the PAs. The eagles spent less time outside the PAs when they were fed and less time in highly human-dominated habitats. Consequently, this reduced mortality risks that were higher outside the PAs. Our findings suggest that management decisions aimed at increasing food availability within PAs, could be critical in conserving endangered species populations such as the Bonelli's eagle in Mediterranean landscapes.

AB  - Microbial communities are important for high composting efficiency and good quality composts. This study was conducted to compare the changes of physicochemical and bacterial characteristics in composting from different raw materials, including chicken manure (CM), duck manure (DM), sheep manure (SM), food waste (FW), and vegetable waste (VW). The role and interactions of core bacteria and their contribution to maturity in diverse composts were analyzed by advanced bioinformatics methods combined sequencing with co-occurrence network and structural equation modeling (SEM). Results indicated that there were obviously different bacterial composition and diversity in composting from diverse sources. FW had a low pH and different physiochemical characteristics compared to other composts but they all achieved similar maturity products. Redundancy analysis suggested total organic carbon, phosphorus, and temperature governed the composition of microbial species but key factors were different in diverse composts. Network analysis showed completely different interactions of core bacterial community from diverse composts but Thermobifida was the ubiquitous core bacteria in composting bacterial network. Sphaerobacter and Lactobacillus as core genus were presented in the starting mesophilic and thermophilic phases of composting from manure (CM, DM, SM) and municipal solid waste (FW, VW), respectively. SEM indicated core bacteria had the positive, direct, and the biggest (> 80%) effects on composting maturity. Therefore, this study presents theoretical basis to identify and enhance the core bacteria for improving full-scale composting efficiency facing more and more organic wastes.

AB  - ContextSeascape connectivity refers to how the spatial configuration of marine habitats facilitates or hinders the movement of organisms, nutrients, materials or energy. Predicting and ranking potential connectivity among habitat patches for coral reef fishes helps to understand how reef fishes could utilize and connect multiple habitat types through the flow of nutrients, energy and biomass across the wider seascape during foraging movements.ObjectivesTo advance a spatially explicit understanding of connectivity linkages within a tropical atoll system by modeling, mapping and quantifying potential seascape connectivity for two locally abundant herbivorous reef fish species, the parrotfish, Chlorurus spilurus (pahoro hohoni or pa'ati pa'apa'a auahi), and the surgeonfish, Acanthurus triostegus (manini).MethodsWe applied a two-step modeling approach by first mapping habitat suitability for the focal species. A graph-theoretic modeling technique was then applied to model and measure the contribution of benthic habitat patches to species-specific potential connectivity within the seascape.ResultsHabitat suitability was higher and less fragmented for C. spilurus than for A. triostegus. Potential ecological connectivity estimates for C. spilurus were higher across the entire seascape, with differences between species likely driven by local-scale benthic habitat patch configuration and species home ranges. Hotspots of ecological connectivity across the atoll were mapped for both species.ConclusionsDespite advances in the application of graph-theoretic techniques in the coastal environment, few marine conservation and restoration measures currently integrate spatial information on ecological connectivity. This two-step spatial modeling approach holds great potential for rapid application of connectivity modeling at multiple spatial scales, which may predict ecological responses to conservation actions including active habitat restoration.

AB  - This paper is focused on decomposing chemically dehaired sheep wool with tannery hair-burning liming sludge and associated materials in windrow composting. Composting materials were mixed and placed onto a horizontal bamboo frame indicating pile 1, pile 2, and pile 3; each pile amounted to 800 kg and lasted 120 days. The highest thermophilic temperature was recorded at 67.2 degrees C (pile 2), which stabilized after 84th day indicating maturation of compost. Self-heating capacity of composting materials confirmed the stability of compost. Nutrients in final compost were within Bangladesh standards. Elements chromium, zinc, copper, and iron were 2.03-4.03, 143.41-144.85, 11.94-22.89, and 20.73-21.62 mg/kg, respectively and lead, nickel; cadmium were below detection limits. FTIR spectrum indicates breakdown of keratin (sheep wool). SEM micrographs demonstrate wool-to-compost transformation. Seed germination validates compost quality; cost comparison affirms its fieldapplication viability. This simple technique breaks the highly cross-linked keratinous sheep wool through composting to reduce pollution from tannery.

AB  - Heat stress poses a great challenge to livestock health, productivity, and adaptability, especially in tropical climates. Under the scenario of climate change and rising global temperatures, understanding the physiological, hematological, biochemical, and molecular responses to heat stress in livestock is crucial. The present study was designed to assess the physiological, hematological, biochemical, and molecular responses to heat stress in the Malabari goat breed, which originated in South India. The gene expression patterns of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) HSP27, HSP70, and HSP90 were also assessed. Twelve adult does were divided into grazing and nongrazing groups, and the study was conducted for 2 months during winter and summer seasons. Higher ambient temperature and solar radiation were recorded in summer, with a higher temperature-humidity index indicating heat stress (77.50 +/- 0.27). Significant increases in respiratory rate, rectal temperature, and surface body temperature were detected in goats, indicating that the animals were under physiological stress, especially during the summer season. The seasonal changes in these parameters differed between grazing and nongrazing goats. The pulse rate was significantly influenced by both season and grazing patterns. The hematological parameters like monocyte count, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration in Malabari goats were mainly influenced by seasonal variations. However, the seasonal shift in hematocrit levels was not uniform across the grazing strategies. Biochemical parameters, including aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, exhibited significant seasonal variations. Additionally, ALT and total protein concentrations differed between the grazing groups. The impact of seasonal variations on glucose concentration varied between grazing and nongrazing goats. HSP70 and HSP90 gene expression increased over the summer, but HSP27 gene expression did not show any difference in our study. As a stress response mechanism, these results show that Malabari goats experience physiological, hematological, biochemical, and molecular changes in response to heat stress, including the upregulation of important HSPs.

AB  - This study aimed to reveal mechanisms of nitrogen changes in a mixed compost of diseased pig carcasses and sawdust after adding exogenous microbial agents. It was found that adding exogenous microbial agents signifcicantly increased the content of various types of nitrogen and the germination index of plants. Microbial dominance of phyla was significantly correlated with indicators of physicochemical properties and copy number of nitrogen-functional genes, with simultaneous nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, ammonification, and glutamate synthesis during composting. At the end of composting, TKN, NH4+-N, and NO3-N contents were increased by 1.914-3.082 mg/g, 0.047-0.42 mg/g, and 0.247-0.303 mg/g, respectively, in the experimental groups compared to the control group. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes were the five predominant phyla, while Sphingobacterium, and Paenalcaligenes were the two special genera in this experiment. After inoculation with exogenous microbial agents, the levels of nitrate nitrogen were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.05) with the number of Bacteroidetes, the glnA gene was positively related (p < 0.01) with Planctomycetes, and the amoA, GDH2, and GLUD1-2 genes were positively related (p < 0.05) with Paenalcaligenes. The combined analysis has shown that amoA gene was positively related (p < 0.001) with genes such as nxrA, GDH2 and GLUD1-2, as well as indicators of physicochemical properties such as temperature, organic nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen, while the correlation was negative with genes such as nirB and nirS. Inoculation with exogenous microbial agents can significantly prolong the high-temperature period, which was extended by 5, 6, and 5 days in each experimental group, and the roles of nitrogen-functional genes can also be changed. Meanwhile, we found that the addition of exogenous microbial agents could promote the growth and alteration of microorganisms, which regulated the stability and symbiosis of the nitrogen transformation process.

AB  - Simple Summary Yak is an indigenous ruminant on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and its meat is known as the "beef crown". Traditionally, yak graze on the rangeland all year round and without any supplementation, and weight loss would occur in the cold season, which leads to rather low productive performance. In recent years, the strategy of intensive feedlot fattening was introduced to the yak raising industry. However, the results were not as encouraging as in the cattle steers, a fact that can be attributed to yak malnutrition due to differences in feed varieties supply and nutrients requirement between yaks and cattle. Consequently, this study was conducted to examine the effect of the first two limiting amino acids on growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality in feedlot yaks. The animals were offered total mixed ration with supplementary four levels of rumen-protected lysine and methionine throughout the whole experiment. The results showed that the average daily gain, feed to gain ratio, meat color, drip loss, and shear force were improved when yaks were supplemented with rumen-protected amino acid while the medium level was most promising. These results indicated that supplementary rumen-protected amino acid improved the growth performance and meat quality characteristics of fattening yaks in feedlot. Yak, a unique bovine species on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, has provided pastoralists with the basic materials of production and life for thousands of years. Existing literature showed that yak meat is of high nutritional value for humans whereas the growth performance is relatively low. As it has been demonstrated, lysine and methionine are the two key limiting amino acids in ruminants. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effect of supplementary levels of rumen-protected lysine (RPL) and methionine (RPM) on growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality in feedlot yaks. Thirty-two male yaks, with initial body weight (IBW) of 237.5 +/- 13.99 kg were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments (n = 8), including control group (CON; basal diet without adding rumen-protected amino acid (RPAA)), low RPAA supplementation group (Group Low; basal diet supplemented with RPL (30.0 g/animal/day) and RPM (7.5 g/animal/day)), medium RPAA supplementation group (Group Medium; basal diet supplemented with RPL (50.0 g/animal/day) and RPM (12.5 g/animal/day)), and high RPAA supplementation group (Group High; basal diet supplemented with RPL (70.0 g/animal/day) and RPM (17.5 g/animal/day)). The average daily gain was increased linearly (p < 0.001) and quadratically (p < 0.01) while feed to gain ratio was decreased linearly (p < 0.001) and quadratically (p < 0.001) with the increasing RPAA supplementation, and the average daily gain was higher while feed to gain ratio was lower in RPAA than CON (p < 0.001). Meat color L* values and b* were decreased linearly (p < 0.01) with the increase of RPAA supplementation, and b* was lower in RPAA than CON (p < 0.05). Meat color a* value was increased linearly (p < 0.05) with the increasing RPAA supplementation, and a* was higher in RPAA than CON (p < 0.05). The 24 h drip loss and shear force were decreased quadratically (p < 0.01) with the increasing RPAA supplementation, and drip loss and shear force values were lower in RPAA than CON (p < 0.05). The glycine concentration in longissimus dorsi (LD) increased linearly (p < 0.05) with the increasing RPAA supplementation.
   These results demonstrated that both the growth performance and meat quality characteristics were improved in feedlot yaks as an effect of the dietary supplementation with RPL and RPM, and the medium supplementary level is recommended, since it showed the most promising results.

AB  - Geographical isolation facilitates the emergence of distinct phenotypes within a single species, but reproductive barriers or selection are needed to maintain the polymorphism after secondary contact. Here, we explore the processes that maintain intraspecific variation of C-4 photosynthesis, a complex trait that results from the combined action of multiple genes. The grass Alloteropsis semialata includes C-4 and non-C-4 populations, which have coexisted as a polyploid series for more than 1 million years in the miombo woodlands of Africa. Using population genomics, we show that there is genome-wide divergence for the photosynthetic types, but the current geographical distribution does not reflect a simple habitat displacement scenario as the genetic clusters overlap, being occasionally mixed within a given habitat. Despite evidence of recurrent introgression between non-C-4 and C-4 groups, in both diploids and polyploids, the distinct genetic lineages retain their identity, potentially because of selection against hybrids. Coupled with strong isolation by distance within each genetic group, this selection created a geographical mosaic of photosynthetic types. Diploid C-4 and non-C-4 types never grew together, and the C-4 type from mixed populations constantly belonged to the hexaploid lineage. By limiting reproductive interactions between photosynthetic types, the ploidy difference probably allows their co-occurrence, reinforcing the functional diversity within this species. Together, these factors enabled the persistence of divergent physiological traits of ecological importance within a single species despite gene flow and habitat overlap.

AB  - Integrated farm management (IFM) is promoted as a whole farm approach toward Agriculture 4.0, incorporating smart farming technologies for attempting to limit livestock production's negative impacts on the environment while increasing productivity with regard to the economic viability of rural communities. The Internet of Things (IoT) may serve as an enabler to ensure key properties-such as interconnectivity, scalability, agility, and interoperability-in IFM systems so that they could provide object-based services while adapting to dynamic changes. This paper focuses on the problem of facilitating the management, processing, and sharing of the vast and heterogeneous data points generated in livestock facilities by introducing distributed IoT middleware as the core of a responsive and adaptive service-oriented IFM system, specifically targeted to enable smart livestock farming in view of its unique requirements. The proposed IoT middleware encompasses the context-awareness approach via the integration of a flexible ontology-based structure for modeling and reasoning. The IoT middleware was assessed in actual conditions on the grounds of a case study for smart control of the thermal environment in a medium-sized pig farming facility. As derived from the obtained evaluation results, the system appears to perform quite satisfactorily in terms of computational performance as well as ontology coherence, consistency, and efficiency.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has emerged as a wildlife management challenge. Human dimensions of CWD management are critical because hunters impact disease transmission and influence management viability. We expanded recent research by evaluating how political identity contributed to perceived risk, concern, intended behavior, and management preferences for CWD among deer hunters in North Carolina and South Carolina (n = 1430) during 2022. Political identity was among the most influential predictors of responses to CWD. Compared to moderates and liberals, conservative hunters reported lower risk perceptions, lower concern about risk to themselves and people that they know, greater likelihoods of hunting in an area with detections, and lower acceptances of management actions to limit the spread of CWD. To garner support for management, CWD communications may need to emphasize the necessity of agency intervention or the disease's low risk toward human health, depending on the political identity of the audience receiving the information.

AB  - While phytoplasma infections in plants are known to affect their interactions with aboveground herbivores, the impact of different genotypes on these infections and their effects on belowground herbivores remains largely unexplored. In cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon), infection by the phytoplasma Candidatus Phytoplasma sp. subgroup 16SrIII-Y leads to false blossom disease. This study investigates whether cranberry infection by this phytoplasma affects the performance and feeding behavior of a foliar feeder (spongy moth, Lymantria dispar) and a root feeder (oriental beetle, Anomala orientalis). Using phytoplasma-infected and uninfected cranberries of two genotypes ("Ben Lear" and "Crimson Queen"), the survival, growth and consumption of L. dispar and A. orientalis larvae were measured. To assess the effects on plant morphological and chemical traits, we also examined the impact of phytoplasma infection on shoot and root growth, carbon and nitrogen content, and the levels of defensive compounds such as proanthocyanidins (PACs). Results indicate that larvae of L. dispar and A. orientalis generally showed larger size and more efficient tissue consumption on infected plants, with these effects varying by cranberry genotype, possibly due to differences in phytoplasma titer. Phytoplasma infection was associated with stunted growth, elevated nitrogen content, and lower PAC levels in both shoots and roots of infected cranberry plants compared to uninfected ones. These findings indicate that phytoplasma infection potentially manipulates plant chemical composition by increasing nutrient levels and decreasing defensive compounds, enhancing herbivore performance both above and belowground. This study sheds light on the intricate interplay among plants, phytoplasma infection, and insect herbivore communities.

AB  - The impacts of altered biogeochemical cycles on ecological systems are likely to vary with trophic level. Predicting how these changes will affect ecological food webs is further complicated by human activities, which are simultaneously altering the availability of macronutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and micronutrients such as sodium (Na). Here we contrast three hypotheses that predict how increasing nutrient availability will shape grassland food webs. We conducted a distributed factorial fertilization experiment (N and P crossed with NaCl) across four North American grasslands, quantifying the responses of aboveground plant biomass and volume, plant tissue and soil elemental concentrations, as well as the abundance of five arthropod functional groups. Fertilization with N and P increased plant biomass and foliar N and P concentrations in grasses but not forbs. Fertilization with Na had no effect on plant biomass but increased foliar Na concentrations. Consistent with the nutrient limitation hypothesis, we found strong evidence of nutrient limitation for insect herbivores across the four sites with sucking (phloem and xylem feeding) herbivores increasing in abundance with NP fertilization and chewing herbivores increasing in response to both Na and NP fertilization, and a trend for increased response of arthropods to lower plant nutrient availability. We found no evidence for an interaction of NaCl and NP on arthropod abundance as predicted by the serial colimitation hypothesis. Finally, consistent with the ecosystem size hypothesis, predator and parasitoid abundances increased with plant volume, but not fertilization. Our results suggest these functional group-specific responses to changes in plant nutrients and structure are key to predicting the future of grassland food webs in an era with increasing use of N and P fertilizers, and increasing terrestrial inputs of Na from road salt, saline irrigation water, and aerosols due to rising sea levels.

AB  - Simple Summary: Agonistic behavioural interactions play a decisive role in the competition for food, space, mating opportunities, and establishing social rank. We propose the use of the number of bites on the pelt of red deer as an index of agonistic interactions between group members. Using behavioural data from a 14-year time series of a captive population of Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus), we found that deer that were of higher social rank, heavier, living in smaller groups, or under no heat stress conditions suffer less pelt bites than those of lower social rank, lighter, living in bigger groups, or under heat stressing conditions. Hinds that gave birth earlier in the parturition period suffered less pelt biting than those that gave birth around the peak of the parturition season. Pelt biting is useful to identify management situations in which deer welfare could be at stake.Agonistic behavioural interactions play a decisive role in the competition for food, space, mating opportunities, and establishing social rank. We used pelt biting (number of bites on an animal's body) as a proxy for assessing the intensity of agonistic animal interactions and how it responded to social, population, and heat stress factors. We modelled a 14-year time series of pelt biting records and observational data of agonistic interactions on a population of captive Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus). We found that (i) the higher the social rank of deer, the lower the number of pelt bites received; (ii) increasing heat stress conditions caused deer to suffer more pelt bites; (iii) males received more bites than females; (iv) the heavier the deer, the lower the number of bites on their bodies; (v) the bigger the group, the more bites exhibited on its members; (vi) deer 5-6 years old suffered greater rate of pelt biting than younger or older deer; and (vii) hinds that gave birth earlier in the parturition period suffered less pelt biting than those that gave birth around the peak of the parturition season (p < 0.01 for all effects). Pelt biting is useful to predict management situations in which deer welfare could be at stake.

AB  - The development of trait-based approaches has accelerated our understanding of how communities assemble, respond to environmental change and may best be managed in the Anthropocene. Understanding the magnitude and pattern of interspecific variability forms a critical underpinning of trait-based approaches while exploring intraspecific variability can identify the potential of species to adapt to changing environmental drivers. Our work is motivated by the critical need for a novel conceptual framework for understanding the functional ecology of macroalgae, as the current paradigm is still mired in functional group models developed in the 1980s. Our objective was to quantify interspecific and intraspecific functional trait variability in three common and morphologically diverse species of tropical marine macroalgae by exploring traits relating to the ecological functions of resource acquisition, resistance to herbivory, and resistance to physical disturbance and the trade-offs between them. We quantified intraspecific and interspecific variability of 11 functional traits for three common and morphologically diverse species of tropical macroalgae from five fringing reefs of Mo'orea, French Polynesia that were likely to capture a wide range of environmental variability. Differences in traits among species and sites were determined with PERMANOVA, visualised with non-metric multidimensional scaling, and trade-offs between pairs of traits explored with correlation. Finally, spatial patterns among select traits across all species were quantified. Species clustered together in distinctly different trait spaces driven by trade-offs among suites of functional traits. Two of three species had considerable intraspecific variability, though this variability occurred at different scales, while one clustered tightly. Exploration of individual traits across species and sites revealed trade-offs between two strategies for resource acquisition, growing tall and strong versus investing in large surface area. Synthesis. We captured novel patterns of interspecific and intraspecific variability for tropical marine macroalgae. We found fundamental differences in traits between species that may represent ecological strategies while considerable intraspecific variability demonstrates a wide range in abilities to respond to environmental drivers. Overall, our work provides novel insights into intra and interspecific trait variation that form an essential underpinning for using a trait-based framework in a taxon that is increasingly dominant on tropical reefs.

AB  - Silicon (Si) is a beneficial element for many plant species, conferring resistance to drought and herbivory, but its effects on trees are less known. We studied responses of silver birch (Betula pendula), grown in peat, to liquid Si supplementation (Si concentration 0.65 mmol/L) on (1) growth, (2) water economy, and (3) element accumulation plus (4) feeding preference of an insect, Epirrita autumnata, and a mammalian herbivore, Microtus agrestis. Plant growth was not affected but control (Si-) plants shed their old leaves earlier. Detached Si+ leaves lost water 11% units less than Si-, and the integrated water-use efficiency based on 13C analysis was higher in Si+. Foliar Se was higher and Mn and S lower in Si+. Root Mg concentrations were higher and Pb lower in Si+. Epirrita autumnata did not prefer either treatment, but M. agrestis preferred Si- stems. Silicon improved birch water relations as indicated by the leaf drying resistance and increased water-use efficiency. The changes in metal accumulation were probably beneficial, but the lower S/Se ratio requires attention. Furthermore, Si decreased palatability to a mammalian herbivore. Using Si as fertilizer in nurseries could be possible to increase birch tolerance to water stress and herbivory.

AB  - Previous studies conducted in the Sahara desert have reported the consumption of wild native pastoral plants by camels. To test the hypothesis that camels may effectively break seed dormancy, we collected fresh faeces from different Saharan rangelands frequented by camels.Seeds were extracted from camel faeces and were quantified. Germination of extracted seeds was compared with that of freshly collected seeds under controlled conditions. Sixteen native pastoral species in 8 families and two unidentified species were quantified, with a high proportion of Fabaceae seeds recovered especially Astragalus ghysensis. The Digestive system of camels, effectively (1) broke seed physical dormancy exceptionally for Argyrolobium uniflorum, Astragalus cruciatus and Astragalus ghysensis there by promoting seed germination; (2) enhanced the percentage of germination of non-dormant seeds in Bassia muricata, Erodium glaucophyllum, Fagonia glutinosa and Plantago ciliata and (3) maintained viability but did not contribute to a prompt germination of Cornulaca monacantha seeds. Therefore, camels act as effective dispersers of these Fabaceae species by scattering seeds and promoting germination. We conclude that it is necessary to better understand the role of camels in the maintenance and conservation of the studied species by endozoochory.

AB  - Global warming is altering the composition and functioning of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Most research has focussed on direct effects of warming on species and their population dynamics, while less is known about indirect effects through species interactions. Trophic cascades are especially likely to influence the effects of warming given that trophic levels differ in their response to warming because of differences in metabolism and vital rates such as growth and reproduction. We investigated if the top-down effect of a common mesopredator, the threespine stickleback, alters the impact of warming on a Baltic Sea food web. We manipulated both temperature and the presence of stickleback in mesocosms, and found the stickleback to alter the impact of warming on lower trophic levels. This was through increased consumption of herbivores that exceeded the rate at which the herbivore population could grow under higher temperature, which in turn increased algae biomass compared to a scenario without stickleback, but not compared to conditions under normal temperature. Thus, the mesopredator increased the transfer of biomass to higher trophic levels of the food web when temperature was increased. This stresses the importance of considering the impact of warming on multiple trophic levels and their interactions. Failing to consider differences in responses among trophic levels and the impact this has on their interactions can result in faulty conclusions about the impact of warming on ecosystems.

AB  - This study investigated the association between sediment contamination, PCB accumulation in adult nesting males and the occurrence of embryonic abnormalities in the damselfish, Abudefduf sordidus, from two sites with high PCB contamination and three "reference" sites (contaminants very low or not measurable) within Johnston Atoll, Central Pacific Ocean. Developmental abnormalities were assessed in damselfish embryos collected in the field during four natural spawning seasons (1996, 1998, 1999, and 2001). Laboratory incubations of abnormal embryos demonstrated that the observed abnormalities were lethal. PCBs were measured in fish collected in three years. Mean whole-body concentrations of total PCBs ranged from 364.6 to 138,032.5 ng/g lipid. A significant residue-effect relationship was found between total PCB concentration and embryo abnormalities. The occurrence of embryo abnormalities was positively related to fish PCB concentration (other contaminants were also evaluated including metals and dioxins). This study demonstrates the utility of using damselfish embryos as a bioindicator tool for monitoring coral reefs. It also provides baseline-monitoring criteria and evaluates sediment quality benchmarks used for ecological risk assessments on coral reefs.

AB  - Controlling the growth of fouling organisms in coral aquaculture is a recognised approach to enhance survival during grow-out of recruits. Herbivorous fish can reduce algae growth, though indiscriminate grazing by the fish pose a risk to the early life stages of corals. To identify a suitable age or size to introduce fish to coral recruit culture, settlement tiles with 1-week-old, single-polyp and 1-month-old, multi-polyp Acropora millepora, Acropora kenti and Goniastrea retiformis were exposed to "brusher", "cropper" and "concealed cropper" fish grazers for 24 h, in addition to a manual aquarist cleaned treatment and a control uncleaned treatment for comparison. In general, acroporid recruits displayed lower mortality than Goniastrea recruits across all types of grazing, and younger, smaller recruits were more vulnerable to grazing, with the "brusher" fish functional group more likely to cause mortality. Morality was low in the uncleaned controls for all corals, whilst single-polyp recruits generally saw slightly elevated mortality under manual aquarist cleaning. Grazing by the "brusher" Ctenochaetus binotatus resulted in the highest mortality across all treatments with week old, single-polyp recruits experiencing 2.5% and 8.6% mortality for A. millepora and A. kenti, respectively, and as high as 88.9% mortality for G. retiformis. In contrast, month old acroporids that were 2-7 polyps in size displayed < 1% probability of mortality when exposed to the same C. binotatus grazing. Grazing intensity of the fish also played a role, as fish belonging to the same functional group with higher bite rates caused higher recruit mortality. Overall, "cropper" Acanthurus nigrofuscus represented the best trade-off between minimising recruit mortality whilst reducing algae coverage on the settlement tiles. Based on our results and knowledge of coral recruit growth, coral grow-out operations would gain the most benefit by introducing fish grazers once corals reach the multi-polyp stage at > 1 month old for acroporids and other fast growing species, and later for smaller, slower growing species such as G. retiformis.

AB  - We undertake a comparative mammalian zoogeographic analysis with the aim of revealing the extent to which the Dmanisi Early Pleistocene large mammal assemblage resembles, at the genus level, African, Arabian, and Eurasian localities of similar age. The inclusion of Old World Pliocene and Pleistocene mammalian faunas provides us with insights into the provincial origins of specific mammalian taxa and permits us to assess the relative affiliation of the Dmanisi mammalian faunas to other faunas in the Old World. Our analysis also allows us to consider hypotheses about the timing and direction of zoogeographic connections between western Eurasia and Africa during the Early Pleistocene. We utilize multiple zoogeographic analytical tools as a cross-comparison of Dmanisi with 42 other Eurasian and African mammalian-bearing localities between 2.7 and 0.7 Ma. Overall, we find that Dmanisi compares most closely with a subgroup of Greek, Italian, and Spanish localities that are slightly younger than Dmanisi itself. This could suggest a progressive dispersal from East to West of the large mammal communities during the late Early Pleistocene and the first occurrence at Dmanisi, and then later in Western Europe, of some taxa such as Stephanorhinus ex gr. etruscus-hundsheimensis, Equus altidens, Bison georgicus, Soergelia minor, Megantereon whitei, Canis borjgali, Canis (Xenocyon) lycaonoides. Dmanisi's habitats included drier areas, probably of open wooded savannah and grassland and by mountainous to semiarid rocky terrain. There is evidence that Dmanisi records short intervals of increased aridity in the middle part of the succession contemporaneous with the occurrence of Homo.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ash (Fraxinus spp.) is in rapid decline across the northeastern USA due to the invasive emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire). Three recently co-occurring confamilial species may serve as alternative larval host plants for ash-reliant Lepidoptera. These prospective hosts are nonnative shrubs often planted in managed suburban landscapes and are sometimes invasive or naturalized in North America. Given the imminent decline of ash trees, we considered potential downstream effects on insect herbivores historically specialized on ash foliage. We measured the performance of three ash-specialist hawkmoths (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) on native white ash (Fraxinus americana L.) and alternative host plants: common lilac (Syringa vulgaris L.), weeping forsythia [Forsythia suspensa (Thunb.) Vahl], and European privet (Ligustrum vulgare L.). We found the nonnative host plants provided varied support for larval survival to pupation, with biomass and growth rate affected differently by both plant and insect identity. Nearly all caterpillars reared on one alternative host, European privet, exhibited distinct malformations of the wing buds at pupation. Given caterpillar presence on privet in the field, privet may constitute an ecological trap (i.e., when female moths select a sub-optimal host, offspring survival and fitness are reduced). This work demonstrates how performance testing can reveal species-specific effects of host plant loss on mono- or oligophagous insects. For some ash specialists, alternative nonnative host plants may be suboptimal, but some cultivated host plants may be able to support certain specialist insects during native host decline. We suggest that landscaping decisions can be tailored to support threatened insect species.

AB  - Accurate identification of species is key to understanding their ecological roles and evolutionary history. It is also essential in cataloging biodiversity for comparisons among habitat types, responses to climate change, effective management practices, and more. The paucity of taxonomic expertise is increasing and with it the ability to competently identify species, this is particularly true for small taxa including rotifers. In an effort to improve this situation, we collated information on morphological characters from the literature on all valid species of sessile Gnesiotrocha (phylum Rotifera) currently assigned to two orders and four families. We review Order Collothecaceae, which comprises families Atrochidae (3 spp.) and Collothecidae (50 spp.) and Order Flosculariaceae, which includes families Conochilidae (7 spp.) and Flosculariidae (71 species). Based on that information, we provide dichotomous keys to the Families, monospecific species in Flosculariidae, and species of Atrochidae, Conochilidae, and Limnias. These keys will aid researchers to identify species in these families and lead to a better understanding of freshwater biodiversity and eco-evolutionary processes.

AB  - In species where conflict is costly, individuals adopt alternative movement tactics to minimise the risk of competitive interactions. Dominant males often maintain defined territories, while less competitive males may be forced to adopt alternative tactics to maximise fitness and reduce conflict. However, the extent to which males switch tactics according to current social or physiological status is poorly understood. Using implanted acoustic tags and a fixed array of tracking receivers, we investigated how the behaviour of 78 male estuarine crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) shifted over an 11-year period in relation to ontogeny, body condition, and the extent of physical injuries. We discovered that male crocodiles sorted into three common movement classes, with 51% of males maintaining the same movement class across consecutive years (max = 9 years). Males > 4 m in total length maintained confined territories both within and across years and had the greatest extent of injuries and the highest condition score, indicative of territory holders. In contrast, smaller males sorted into high movement roamer or low movement site-philopatric tactics, where the tactic an individual adopted was less stable between years and did not correlate with condition or external injuries. Our study reveals the socio-biological mechanisms by which estuarine crocodiles coexist within a restricted habitat.Significance statementIdentifying individual-level differences in movement helps us predict which individuals are more likely to be involved in human-wildlife interactions. However, studying long-term shifts in movement is challenging, as large datasets of co-occurring individuals tracked in their natural environment over multiple years are required. We tracked a population of 78 male estuarine crocodiles (1030-4687 mm total length) in a shared environment over 11 years and assessed how eight movement traits were linked to body size and physical condition. At the population level, males sorted into different movement tactics according to ontogeny, with large territorial males having better body condition yet a greater incidence of injury. However, 49% of males showed variability across years, suggesting that tactics were conditional relative to environmental variability and a male's own status. Our study provides insights into the mechanisms and costs of movement tactics in wild crocodile populations.

AB  - The classification of tree species in urban contexts is pivotal in assessing ecosystem services and fostering sustainable urban development. This paper explores using graph neural networks (GNNs) on graph structure data derived from quantitative structure models (QSMs) and tree structural measurement for appropriate species classification. The study addresses gaps in existing methods by integrating relationships between tree components, such as branches and cylinders, and considering the entire tree structure in a novel graph data format. The results demonstrate the efficacy of GNNs, particularly the Gated Graph Convolutional Network (GatedGCN), inappropriately classifying urban tree species. It gained an overall classification accuracy and weighted F1 score of 0.84. An analysis of confusion matrices revealed similarities in visual characteristics among several species, including A. platanoides and T. cordata, which pose significant challenges inaccurately distinguishing between them. However, certain species, such as A. hippocastanum and P. nigra var. italica, have proved easier to classify than others. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of relationships between different tree components in species recognition, such as the ratio between branch radius and parent branch radius, the factors often overlooked by previous methods. This underscores the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach in this study. Future research could explore integrating additional data sources, such as Leaf Area Density (LAD) calculated from LiDAR and hyperspectral data, to enhance classification accuracy. In conclusion, the evaluation results of the GatedGCN model demonstrated its effectiveness in classifying tree species using a novel data structure format derived from QSM tree characteristics. Advancing urban tree species classification through such methods can enhance future urban tree management using automated AI and robotics solutions.

AB  - Telomere length (TL), typically measured across a sample of blood cells, has emerged as an exciting potential marker of physiological state and of the costs of investment in growth and reproduction within evolutionary ecology. While there is mounting evidence from studies of wild vertebrates that short TL predicts raised subsequent mortality risk, the relationship between reproductive investment and TL is less clear cut, and previous studies report both negative and positive associations. In this study, we examined the relationship between TL and different aspects of maternal reproductive performance in a free-living population of Soay sheep. We find evidence for shorter TL in females that bred, and thus paid any costs of gestation, compared to females that did not breed. However, we found no evidence for any association between TL and litter size. Furthermore, females that invested in gestation and lactation actually had longer TL than females who only invested in gestation because their offspring died shortly after birth. We used multivariate models to decompose these associations into among- and within-individual effects, and discovered that within-individual effects were driving both the negative association between TL and gestation, and the positive association between TL and lactation. This suggests that telomere dynamics may reflect recent physiologically costly investment or variation in physiological condition, depending on the aspect of reproduction being investigated. Our results highlight the physiological complexity of vertebrate reproduction, and the need to better understand how and why different aspects of physiological variation underpinning life histories impact blood cell TL.

AB  - Palynological analysis on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), the cradle of Chinese civilization, is essential for exploring the complex relationships between human activities and ecological change during the Holocene. However, high resolution palynological analysis of loess deposits in this region remains limited. This study analyzed 98 fossil pollen and charcoal assemblages from the Linxia section in the western part of the CLP. The results show that from the Middle Holocene onwards, an increase in charcoal concentration and the presence of Hippophae and Brassicaceae marks the initial appearance of human activities, suggesting early settlers' engagement in agriculture and fire use. During the late Holocene, particularly around 2000 years ago, the sequential peaks of charcoal, Hippophae, and Brassicaceae concentrations indicate a significant intensification of human activities. This intensification is further supported by other records, such as grain size and fungal spore data. By integrating palynological data with other environmental proxies, this study provides a new perspective on the long-term ecological history of the CLP, shaped by the ongoing interaction between natural environments and human activities during the Holocene. The consistent timing of human impacts on vegetation across the CLP, especially the significant enhancement at least two millennia, provide key evidence for understanding the patterns and extent of human activities' influence on ecosystems.

AB  - Yaks are an important livestock species on the Tibetan Plateau, but traditional grazing practices cause a sharp drop in their weight during winter, leading to grassland degradation due to overgrazing. Although off-site fattening can improve performance and protect ecology, it often leads to a negative energy balance, liver metabolism disorders, and immune impairment due to stress. However, the effects of rumen-protected glucose (RPG) and rumen-protected taurine (RPT) on yak liver health are not yet clear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary RPG and RPT levels on the growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, liver antioxidant capacity, and immunity of yaks. Twenty-eight healthy yaks weighing 170 +/- 10.4 kg were randomly divided into four treatments: LGLT (RPG: 1%-low RPG [LG]; RPT: 5 g/d-low RPT [LT]), LGHT (RPG: 1%-low RPG [LG]; RPT: 20 g/d-high RPT [HT]), HGLT (RPG: 3%-high RPG [HG]; RPT: 5 g/d-low RPT [LT]), and HGHT (RPG: 3%-high RPG [HG]; RPT: 20 g/d-high RPT [HT]). The results showed that compared with the LTHT treatment group, the HGHT group upregulated the serum concentrations of glucose (p = 0.004) and Interleukin-10 (p = 0.03), the relative mRNA expression of small heterodimer partners (p = 0.01), and the sterol 12-alpha-hydroxylase (p < 0.001), while reducing the serum concentration of gamma-glutamyl transferase (p = 0.048). The serum concentration of hepatic protein carbonyl (p = 0.005) and malondialdehyde (p = 0.03) was lower in the LGHT and HGHT treatment groups than in the LGLT and HGLT groups. The relative mRNA expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (p = 0.02), Interleukin-8 (p < 0.01), and Interleukin-1 beta (p < 0.01) was lower in the LGHT and HGHT groups than in the LGLT and HGLT groups. Tumor necrosis factor expression was lower (p = 0.04) and glucose transporter 2 expression was higher (p < 0.01) in the HGHT group compared to other treatment groups. The expression of glucokinase, glycogen synthase, pyruvate kinase, and farnesoid X receptor was higher in the HGLT treatment group than in other treatments (p < 0.01). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 3% PRG and 5 g/d PRT can enhance liver antioxidant capacity and immune function, reduce lipid peroxidation, and promote glucose and bile acid metabolism in yaks.

AB  - Vespula shidai, a yellowjacket species, has long been reared for edible larvae and pupae in central Japan; however, limited scientific knowledge exists regarding dietary differences between wild and reared nests. In this study, DNA metabarcoding was applied to larval gut contents from 12 nests (five wild, seven reared) in central Japan to examine their dietary composition. Additionally, a questionnaire survey (n = 58) was conducted on taste perceptions of "hachinoko" (edible wasp brood) and on awareness of V. shidai's feeding habits. DNA metabarcoding identified 324 prey species, including insects, arachnids, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Compared with reared nests, wild nests presented significantly greater diversity of wild vertebrate prey, suggesting that provisioning with human-supplied meats (e.g., chickens and deer) can partially replace natural foraging. Respondents who had wasp-rearing experience more frequently perceived taste differences between wild and reared hachinoko, often attributing these differences to the feed provided. They also recognised V. shidai's predation on vertebrates, implying that practical engagement shapes ecological understanding and consumer preferences. These findings highlight V. shidai's broad dietary flexibility under varying conditions of rearing and foraging. Future research could refine feeding strategies and cultural practices to sustain hachinoko as a valuable food resource while minimising its ecological impacts.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal diseases have increasingly become an important external impact that restricts the healthy development of the pig industry. African swine fever has seriously threatened the stable development of the pig industry in China and caused huge economic losses for farmers. The control behaviour by farmers is particularly important in the front line of epidemic prevention. To explore the factors that affect epidemic prevention and control behaviour by farmers, field survey data was empirically analysed. The results show that gender, education level, technical training, breeding years, breeding scale, specialisation, and risk awareness have significant effects on the biosecurity measures taken by farmers. Animal diseases are a serious threat to animal husbandry production and diet health, and effective prevention and control measures need to be explored. This study investigates the factors influencing the adoption of biosecurity prevention and the control behaviours of hog farmers towards African swine fever and provides appropriate recommendations. Using research data from Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Tianjin, Liaoning, Jilin, and Hebei, we employed a binary logistic model to empirically analyse these factors. Regarding individual farmer characteristics, male farmers emphasised biosecurity prevention and control in farms, with higher education actively influencing the adoption of prevention and control measures. Farmers who received technical training were actively inclined to adopt such behaviours. Furthermore, the longer the duration of farming, the more probable the farmers were to neglect biosecurity prevention and control. However, the bigger and more specialised the farm, the more inclined they were to adopt prevention and control behaviours. With respect to disease prevention and control awareness, the more risk-averse the farmers were, the more they actively adopted epidemic prevention behaviours. As the awareness of epidemic risk increased, the farmers tended to adopt active epidemic prevention behaviours by reporting suspected outbreaks. The following policy recommendations were made: learning about epidemic prevention and improving professional skills; large-scale farming, specialised farming; and timely dissemination of information to raise risk awareness.

AB  - Biologging and biotelemetry are essential tools to better understand marine species and consequently contribute to increasing our knowledge of marine ecosystems as a whole. Assessing marine megafauna trajectories is traditionally performed with significantly high cost and labor, without guaranteeing the equipment recapture, where quick georeferencing techniques remain proprietary and power intensive. The Internet of Things (IoT) and open radio communication protocols, such as long range (LoRa), provide opportunities for the creation of robust and low-cost sensor networks, which still need to be further tested in the harsh oceanic environment and on marine species. With a vision on having their real-life application on marine species, this study provides a fourfold contribution with LoRa and IoT. First, we review current biotelemetry and biologging, outlining opportunities. Second, we present TRITON, an open telemetry sensor for marine megafauna monitoring. Third, we provide a novel location estimation pipeline based on assisted GPS and simplified pseudorange multilateration using raw satellite data. Fourth, we validate the location estimation pipeline with four in-the-wild studies, mimicking the behavior of marine species, obtaining 500 m grand average error, using seven satellites. We discuss how the TRITON system may be leveraged for long- and short-term marine megafauna monitoring, paving the road for more LoRa and IoT biotelemetry applications.

AB  - Simple Summary: Buffalo breeding in Italy has significantly increased in the new century because of mozzarella cheese, but also because of a growing interest in meat production. The nutritional factors that significantly affect animal performance are the forage/concentrate ratio, diet energy and protein content, supplementations (i.e., vitamins, minerals, additives), and the feeding system used. Since antibiotics were banned for auxinic purposes (Reg. 1831/2003/EC), the interest in the potential ability of feed additives to enhance nutrient utilization and animal performance by acting on rumen metabolism has increased. Among such additives, yeast cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) have found great interest for application in ruminant nutrition. Therefore, the growth performances of buffalo calves that were fed diets characterized by different forage/concentrate ratio, with or without Saccharomyces cerevisiae supplementation, were evaluated in this study. The aim of the present trial was to evaluate the growth performance of buffalo calves fed on diets characterized by different forage/concentrate ratios, with or without Saccharomyces cerevisiae supplementation (CBS 493.94, Yea-Sacc (R)). Twenty-four male buffalo calves (mean age of 145.1 +/- 16.1 days; mean weight of 108.0 +/- 18.7 kg) were assigned randomly to 4 groups, homogeneous in age, that were fed four different diets: diet 1, F:C ratio 50:50; diet 2, F:C ratio 30:70; diet 3, F:C ratio 50:50 + Yea-Sacc (R); and diet 4, F:C ratio 30:70 + Yea-Sacc (R). Buffalo calves were individually weighted before the start of the experiment and the data were used as a covariate, being taken monthly until the end of the trial. Dry matter intake (DMI), daily weight gain (DWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated. The differences in diets composition significantly (p < 0.01) affected all these parameters. In particular, the animals fed diet 1 and diet 3 showed higher values of DWG (0.91 and 0.88 g/d vs. 0.68 and 0.66 for group 2 and 4) and DMI (5.8 and 5.3 kg/d, respectively) compared to the other groups (4.3 and 4.4 kg/d for group 2 and 4), as well as a higher final body weight (370.5 and 334.1 kg for group 1 and 3 vs. 272.8 and 273.1 kg of group 2 and 4, respectively). Indeed, the supplementation with Yea-Sacc (R) at the dosage of 1 x 10E8 did not affect buffaloes' growth performance.

AB  - Droughts are predicted to increase in severity in many regions due to climate change and there is strong evidence that such events can lead to increased insect attack and consequent widespread tree mortality in temperate forests. Much less is known about the impact of increased drought on tropical rainforests but in the few largescale drought manipulation experiments in tropical rainforests, larger trees had higher mortality rates than smaller trees although the cause of death is often uncertain. Previously, we modelled what the impact of drought might be on different types of herbivorous insects and suggested that in rainforests severe drought conditions might lead to increased attack from wood-boring insects. We tested this in a drought manipulation experiment, in Australian tropical rainforest, where we excluded more than 30% of rainfall for two years prior to our study and during it. We compared wood-boring damage of small and large trees between the experiment and a nearby control site. We hypothesized that larger trees would experience greater wood boring whereas smaller trees would present more surface damage. We surveyed 1,778 trees in total across both plots and found that the proportion of trees with termites, hole boring, and surface damage caused by borers (lateral tracks, frass, resin, latex or kino exudation) was significantly higher at the drought plot than at the control plot. There was a significant difference in the proportion of trees with fresh wood-boring damage at the drought site (35%) than at the control site (23%). While all size classes of trees had a higher percentage of fresh wood-boring damage at the drought site compared to control site this was only significant for small trees (dbh 10 cm). The lack of significant difference for medium sized trees (dbh 20 cm) and large trees (dbh 20 cm) may be due to small sample size. Recent termite activity and termite damage was also significantly more frequent in the drought site compared to the control. We conclude that increased severity of drought appears to drive fundamental changes in borer and termite infestation levels with potentially important consequences for long-term tree health and mortality. Increases in tree mortality elevates the risk of forest fires, which are normally rare events in rainforests. Determining which wood boring beetles are responsible for the increased infestation requires further investigation since more than 100 wood-boring beetle species have been collected previously at the study site, including species of Platypodinae, Scolytinae, Anobiidae and Cerambycidae.

AB  - Sexually selected weapons, such as the antlers of deer, claws of crabs, and tusks of beaked whales, are strikingly diverse across taxa and even within groups of closely related species. Phylogenetic comparative studies have typically taken a simplified approach to investigate the evolution of weapon diversity, examining the gains and losses of entire weapons, major shifts in size or type, or changes in location. Less understood is how individual weapon components evolve and assemble into a complete weapon. We addressed this question by examining weapon evolution in the diverse, multi-component hind-leg and body weapons of leaf-footed bugs, superfamily Coreoidea (Hemiptera: Heteroptera). Male leaf-footed bugs use their morphological weapons to fight for access to mating territories. We used a large multilocus dataset comprised of ultraconserved element loci for 248 species and inferred evolutionary transitions among component states using ancestral state estimation. Our results suggest that weapons added components over time with some evidence of a cyclical evolutionary pattern-gains of components followed by losses and then gains again. Furthermore, our best estimate indicated that certain trait combinations evolved repeatedly across the phylogeny, suggesting that they function together in battle or that they are genetically correlated. This work reveals the remarkable and dynamic evolution of weapon form in the leaf-footed bugs and provides insights into weapon assembly and disassembly over evolutionary time.
   For centuries, humans have been fascinated by the morphological weapons animals use to engage in battle. The diversity of sexually selected weapons is surprising, with considerable variation even across closely related species. Studies are needed that take a detailed view of the components that comprise weapons and the evolutionary assembly of these components into a complete structure. Here, we reconstruct the evolution of a multi-component weapon in a superfamily of insects. Male leaf-footed bugs use spiky, enlarged hind legs to wrestle over mating territories. We measured 15 putative weapon components across 248 species, using phylogenetic comparative analyses. Our best estimates indicate that the number of weapon components generally increased over time, with many gains and losses of components along the way. Our results also suggest that certain components were more likely to evolve with others. Studies of complex, multi-component weapons may be useful for understanding the evolution of form and function broadly, across the animal body.

AB  - Simple Summary Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) can severely harm human and animal health because it can carry many harmful microorganisms and enter the deep respiratory tract. Due to the high breeding density and poor ventilation in large-scale pig farms, the concentration of PM2.5 is higher indoors than outdoors. Therefore, it is very important to understand the composition of harmful microorganisms carried by PM2.5 in pig houses and trace their sources and interactions with the environment. This study first monitored the environment of a piggery, identified the species and abundance of pathogenic bacteria and allergens on the collected PM2.5 samples using high-throughput sequencing, then analyzed the interactions between microbial communities and between communities and environmental factors using network analysis, and finally, used the SourceTracker tool to predict the microbial traceability of PM2.5. The results showed that the contribution of feces to producing airborne microorganisms was much higher than that of feed. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can carry numerous substances and penetrate deep into the respiratory tract due to its small particle size; associated harmful microorganisms are suspected to increase health risks for humans and animals. To find out the microbial compositions of PM2.5 in piggeries, their interaction and traceability, we collected PM2.5 samples from a piggery while continuously monitoring the environmental indicators. We also identified pathogenic bacteria and allergens in the samples using high-throughput sequencing technology. We analyzed the microbial differences of PM2.5 samples at different heights and during different times of day and investigated the microbial dynamics among the PM2.5 samples. To better understand the interaction between microorganisms and environmental factors among different microbial communities, we applied the network analysis method to identify the correlation among various variables. Finally, SourceTracker, a commonly used microbial traceability tool, was used to predict the source of airborne microorganisms in the pig house. We identified 14 potential pathogenic bacteria and 5 allergens from PM2.5 in the pig houses, of which Acinetobacter was the dominant bacterium in all samples (relative abundance > 1%), which warrants attention. We found that bacteria and fungi directly affected the the microbial community. The bacterial community mainly played a positive role in the microbial community. Environmental variables mainly indirectly and positively affected microbial abundance. In the SourceTracker analysis using fecal matter and feed as sources and PM2.5 sample as sink, we found that fecal matter made the greatest contribution to both bacterial and fungal components of PM2.5. Our findings provide important insights into the potential risks of pathogens in PM2.5 to human and animal health and their main sources.

AB  - Mountaintop removal coal mining leaves a legacy of disturbed landscapes and abandoned infrastructure with clear impacts on water resources; however, the intensity and persistence of this water pollution remains poorly characterized. Here we examined the downstream impacts of over a century of coal mining in the Crowsnest Pass (Alberta, Canada). Water samples were collected downstream of two historical coal mines: Tent Mountain and Grassy Mountain. Tent Mountain hosts a partially reclaimed surface mine that closed in 1983. Selenium concentrations downstream of Tent Mountain reached 185 mu g/L in a lake below the mine spoil pile, and up to 23 mu g/ L in Crowsnest Creek, which drains the lake and the mine property. Further downstream, a well-dated sediment core from Crowsnest Lake records increases in sediment, selenium, lead, carbon, nitrogen, and polycyclic aromatic compounds that closely tracked the history of mining at Tent Mountain. In contrast, episodic discharge of mine water from abandoned underground adits at Grassy Mountain drive periodic (but short-term) increases in iron, various metals, and suspended sediment. These results underscore the lasting downstream impacts of abandoned and even reclaimed coal mines.

AB  - Preslaughter management of goats can affect their welfare and productivity, as well as the resultant product quality. Inclusion of high-condensed tannin ingredients in the diet and minimizing stress can improve meat quality and safety in goats. This study was conducted to determine the effects of transportation stress and sericea lespedeza hay diet on physiological responses, gastrointestinal microbial populations, and meat quality in Spanish goats. Although transportation stress influenced physiological responses, it did not influence muscle pH, which is an important variable that affects the eating quality of meat. Sericea improved anti-inflammatory property and decreased microbial counts in the rumen and rectum of goats. There is evidence that feeding high-condensed tannin diet could be beneficial in meat goat production.
   Feeding condensed tannin (CT)-containing diets such as sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) and reducing stress have been reported to improve meat quality and food safety in goats. In a completely randomized design with split-plot, thirty-six uncastrated male Spanish goats were assigned to 3 dietary treatments (n = 12/treatment): ground 'Serala' sericea lespedeza hay (SER), bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) hay (BG), or bermudagrass hay-dewormed goats (BG-DW; Control) at 75% of intake, with a corn-based supplementation (25%) for 8 weeks. Prior to slaughter, goats were either transported for 90 min to impose stress or held in pens. Basophil counts were lower (p < 0.01) in the SER group compared to BG or BG-DW groups suggesting a better anti-inflammatory capacity due to polyphenols in the SER diet. Compared to BG-DW group, cortisol level was higher (p < 0.05) and norepinephrine was lower (p < 0.05) in the SER group. The SER group had the lowest aerobic plate counts (APC) in both rumen and rectum (p < 0.01). Longissimus dorsi muscle initial pH was not affected by diet or stress. Feeding sericea hay to goats may have beneficial effects, such as enhanced antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties during stress and reduced gut microbial counts, without changing meat quality characteristics.

AB  - Home range size of consumers varies with food quality, but the many ways of defining food quality hamper comparisons across studies. Ecological stoichiometry studies the elemental balance of ecological processes and offers a uniquely quantitative, transferrable way to assess food quality using elemental ratios, e.g., carbon (C):nitrogen (N). Here, we test whether snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) vary their home range size in response to spatial patterns of C:N, C:phosphorus (P), and N:P ratios of two preferred boreal forage species, lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) and red maple (Acer rubrum), in summer months. Boreal forests are N- and P-limited ecosystems and access to N- and P-rich forage is paramount to snowshoe hares' survival. Accordingly, we consider forage with higher C content relative to N and P to be lower quality than forage with lower relative C content. We combine elemental distribution models with summer home range size estimates to test the hypothesis that home range size will be smaller in areas with access to high, homogeneous food quality compared to areas of low, heterogeneous food quality. Our results show snowshoe hares had smaller home ranges in areas where lowbush blueberry foliage quality was higher or more spatially homogenous than in areas of lower, more heterogeneous food quality. By responding to spatial patterns of food quality, consumers may influence community and ecosystem processes by, for example, varying nutrient recycling rates. Our reductionist biogeochemical approach to viewing resources leads us to holistic insights into consumer spatial ecology.

AB  - Simple Summary Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), as well as ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B), could act as key factors affecting plant-insect interactions. The stress related to one of these two factors could be balanced by the positive effects of the other. In the present work, the feeding preferences of Myzus persicae aphids for lettuce plants exposed to two abiotic factors, i.e., AMF and UV-B, singly or in combination, was evaluated. Results showed that lettuce plants treated with UV-B increased in callose and oxidative stress indicators, signalling an alteration in the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted. On the other hand, the negative effects of UV-B were partially mitigated in lettuces inoculated with AMF. Differently treated lettuces did not affect the feeding preferences of the M. persicae aphid population. Overall, this study shed light on how UV-B and AMF impact lettuce VOCs emission and defence mechanisms, but not the feeding behaviour of a polyphagous aphid species. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) play important roles in plant-insect interactions by altering plant physiology and histology. We hypothesized that UV-B-induced oxidative stress was mitigated by AMF symbiosis. In this study, we conducted a multifactorial experiment to explore lettuce plant response to AMF inoculation and UV-B exposure (0.4 W m(-2); 16 h d(-1); 2 weeks), either together or individually, as well as the interaction with the polyphagous insect pest Myzus persicae (Sulzer). Lettuce plants subjected to UV-B radiation showed an increase in callose and oxidative stress indicators, as well as a decrease in stomatal density. Mycorrhizal colonization cancelled out the effect of UV-B on stomatal density, while the symbiosis was not affected by UV-B treatment. The plant volatile emission was significantly altered by UV-B treatment. Specifically, the non-terpene 1-undecene abundance (+M/+UVB: 48.0 +/- 7.78%; -M/+UVB: 56.6 +/- 14.90%) was increased, whereas the content of the non-terpene aldehydes decanal (+M/+UVB: 8.50 +/- 3.90%; -M/+UVB: 8.0 +/- 4.87%) and undecanal (+M/+UVB: 2.1 +/- 0.65%; -M/+UVB: 1.20 +/- 1.18%) and the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (+M/+UVB: 18.0 +/- 9.62 %; -M/+UVB: 19.2 +/- 5.90%) was decreased. Mycorrhization, on the other hand, had no significant effect on the plant volatilome, regardless of UV-B treatment. Aphid population was unaffected by any of the treatments, implying a neutral plant response. Overall, this study provides new insights about the interactions among plants, UV-B, and AMF, outlining their limited impact on a polyphagous insect pest.

AB  - Plant-endophyte symbioses are widespread in grasslands. While symbiotic interactions often provide hosts with major fitness enhancements, the role of the endophyte Alternaria oxytropis, which produces swainsonine in locoweeds (Oxytropis and Astragalus spp.), remains enigmatic. We compared endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) plants of three main Chinese locoweed species (O. kansuensis, O. glabra, and O. ochrocephala) under controlled conditions, and analyzed environmental factors at locoweed poisoning hotspots for herbivores. The results demonstrated significant species-specific effects: E+ plants of O. glabra and O. ochrocephala exhibited 26-39% reductions in biomass, net photosynthetic rate, and stomatal conductance, with elevated CO2 levels, while O. kansuensis showed no measurable impacts. Swainsonine concentrations were 16-20 times higher in E+ plants (122.6-151.7 mg/kg) than in E- plants. Geospatial analysis revealed that poisoning hotspots for herbivores consistently occurred in regions with extreme winter conditions (minimum temperatures <= -17 degrees C and precipitation <= 1 mm during the driest month), suggesting context-dependent benefits under abiotic stress. These findings suggest that the ecological role of A. oxytropis may vary depending on both host species and environmental context, highlighting a trade-off between growth costs and potential stress tolerance conferred by A. oxytropis. The study underscores the need for field validation to elucidate the adaptive mechanisms maintaining this symbiosis in harsh environments.

AB  - The availability of surface water is assumed by many wildlife managers to be important to desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni). Yet scientific evidence suggests bighorn sheep populations can sometimes fulfill their water requirements from forage alone. To investigate how water use changes with environmental conditions, we analyzed the surface water use and movement patterns of 4 desert bighorn populations across a range of meteorological conditions in the Mojave Desert in California, USA. We compared ground-based weather data to the daily use of surface water sources for 65 known individuals, and examined the movement patterns of 18 of these individuals with global positioning system collars in relation to visitation to surface water sources. Maximum daily temperature most closely predicted the percent of bighorn visiting water daily, with visitation increasing approximately 30% between 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Individual animals switched from a tortuous foraging movement to directed movement when accessing surface water. Day length, maximum daily temperature, minimum daily temperature, solar radiation, and the interaction between day length and minimum temperature explained the distance desert bighorn were located from the nearest water source. Our results indicate that local meteorological conditions are important determinants of desert bighorn surface water use, and that managers should monitor water sources when the maximum daily temperature exceeds 35 degrees C. Individual animals meet their water requirements with surface water under hot and dry conditions, likely because it is temporally or energetically efficient given their other resource needs.

AB  - Plants inhabiting open landscapes are often dispersed by ungulates and are expected to be adapted to this type of dispersal through their seed traits. To find which traits help seeds survive the passage through digestion of wild ungulates, we conducted a comprehensive feeding experiment with almost forty species of plants and three species of ungulates. We fed specified numbers of seeds to the animals, collected the dung, and germinated the dung content. We explored whether seed morphological traits and seed nutrient contents are good predictors of seed survival after passage through the ungulate digestive system. We also tested how the seed survival differed after the passage through different ungulate species. To find answers, we used GLMM with beta-binomial distribution and animal and plant species as random factor, respectively. We found that species survival and germination success were negatively correlated to seed elongation and the thickness of the seed coat. Even though phylogenetically correct GLMM did not yield significant results, when we tested species from commonly represented families, separately (legumes and grasses compared to all other species) different traits had statistically significant effects. In the case of seed elongation, the effect changed direction from negative to positive when legumes and grasses were left out. Our results suggest that seed traits enabling species survival after passage through the digestive tract are strongly phylogenetically conserved and different groups of plants evolved different ways of adapting to grazing pressure and utilize it for dispersal.

AB  - In the United States, the management of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) has typically focused on improvinghunting opportunities and mitigating human-deer conflicts. Yet the expansion and diversification of human communities and activitiesimplies that human-deer interactions may also be diversifying. Approaches based on complex adaptive systems theories have beenposited as a way to better attend to the diversity of these interactions between humans and wildlife. Using Indiana as a case, this studydraws from the Integrated Adaptive Behavior Model (IABM) to understand human-deer interactions as a complex system. We useempirical social science to understand how citizens across Indiana perceive deer populations, what outcomes they desire, and how theseperceptions could be integrated into Indiana's deer management plan. In Indiana, neither wildlife managers nor researchers haveassessed public perceptions of deer beyond hunting and farming stakeholders. From May to September 2019, we collected 59 semi-structured interviews and two focus groups (n = 14) with deer stakeholders including woodland owners, farmers, deer hunters, andurban area residents. Through mixed inductive-deductive coding, we found that Indiana citizens hold complex emotions toward deerregardless of their stakeholder identity. Factors influencing these emotions include past experiences, current livelihood and behavioralcontexts, beliefs about responsibilities and ethics in deer management, and beliefs about other social groups. Our results suggest thatthe IABM, despite adding in much-needed complexity and realism to the analysis of human-wildlife interactions, still lacks explanatorypower over several important dynamics that emerged from our interviews. Here, we discuss how mixed emotions, situational context,and power dynamics challenge conventional management approaches that focus narrowly on mitigating human-deer conflicts, and thatreduce public interests to demographic categorizations. To better inform social-ecological governance, models of complex humanbehavior should account for power within management institutions and across management scales. Our work contributes a refinedunderstanding of how multidimensional emotions and experiences influence public (dis)interest in natural resource management, andwhat this implies for managers who aim to balance competing social interests with ecological conditions.

AB  - BackgroundWildlife species adapted to the Afro-alpine highlands are vulnerable to loss of habitat due to global warming accompanying potential upward shifts and elevational range contractions of their preferred habitats. Understanding the trends in the shift of suitable habitats of endemic taxa is key to planning the conservation and management of species. Therefore, this study aimed to model the distribution of Menelik's bushbuck, a spiral-horned antelope endemic to Ethiopian highlands across the past (Last Glacial Maximum, and Mid-Holocene), present, and future.MethodsWe performed the ensemble modelling implemented in the "sdm" R package using 6 modelling techniques (MaxEnt, Generalized Linear Model, Generalized Additive Model, Random Forest, Boosted Regression Tree, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines). We combined 248 occurrence points of Menelik's bushbuck with 12 climatic, topographic, and anthropogenic variables. We selected these variables from originally 24 variables using the VIF step procedure to avoid highly correlated predictor variables for the final model run.ResultsThe performance of the ensemble model was excellent having AUC = 0.97 and TSS = 0.88 values. Bio6 (minimum temperature of the coldest month) contributed most to the distribution of Menelik's bushbuck followed by bio12 (annual precipitation) and elevation. The model projection estimated the suitable habitat of Menelik's bushbuck steadily decreases with increasing representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios and projection years. The current suitable habitat of this species is estimated to be 25,546 km2 whereas the Mid-Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum potential habitats was about 60,282.24 km2 and 33,652 km2 respectively. The magnitude of the loss of suitable habitats of Menelik's bushbuck will be highest in 2050 and 2070 under RCP 8.5 climate scenarios showing the loss in the currently suitable habitats of this species is over 95.1% and 99.8% respectively.ConclusionMelelik's bushbuck has lost suitable habitat since the LGM and the loss will be greatest in the future due to climate change and land use change. The sharp decline of the suitable habitat will greatly threaten the future survival of the species. Our modelling can assist in identifying potential refuge areas for the species to assist in its preservation.

AB  - Indigenous pig populations, including Bamei pigs (BM), Hezuo pigs (HZ), Huixian Qingni Black pigs (HX), and Minxian Black pigs (MX) in Gansu Province, live in a particular climate and a relatively closed geographical environment. These local pig breeds are characterized by excellent characteristics (e.g., cold tolerance, robust disease resistance, and superior meat quality). In the past few years, pig populations in Gansu Province have decreased significantly because of their poor lean meat percentage, high fat content, and slow growth rate. Maintaining the diversity of these four breeds can act as a source of new alleles to be incorporated into commercial breeds which are more susceptible to disease and less adaptable to changing conditions because of inbreeding. Genomic data analysis is adequate for determining the genetic diversity and livestock breeding population structure, even in local pig populations. However, the genetic diversity and population structure of the four native pig populations in Gansu Province are still unknown. Thus, we used "Zhongxin-I" porcine chip for the SNP detection of 102 individuals living on four pig conservation farms. A total of 57,466 SNPs were identified among the four pig breeds. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) plot showed that MX had the highest level of LD, followed by BM, HZ, and HX. The observed heterozygosity (Ho) in all four populations was higher than the expected heterozygosity (He). A principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that the four local pig populations were isolated. The identity displayed by the state matrix and G matrix heat map results indicated that small numbers of individuals among the four pig breeds had a high genetic distance and weak genetic relationships. The results of the population genetic structure of BM, HZ, HX, and MX pigs showed a slight genetic diversity loss. Our findings enabled us to better understand the genome characteristics of these four indigenous pig populations, which will provide novel insights for the future germplasm conservation and utilization of these indigenous pig populations.

AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, characterized by its extreme environmental conditions, presents significant challenges to life, making it an ideal region for studying adaptation and evolution. Tibetan pigs, known for their high genetic diversity and exceptional adaptability to high altitudes, serve as excellent models for investigating high-altitude adaptation. While previous studies have extensively identified genetic determinants associated with high-altitude adaptation, the molecular mechanisms, particularly cis-regulatory patterns, remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted a selective sweep analysis using 484 genomes from Chinese and Western pig breeds across various altitudes, revealing 38.56 Mb of genomic regions under selection in Tibetan pigs. Enrichment analysis identified the lung as the primary functional tissue involved in high-altitude adaptation, supported by tissue-specific transcriptional and regulatory patterns observed between Tibetan and Meishan pigs (low altitude). By integrating genomic, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and H3K27ac HiChIP data, we constructed comprehensive enhancer-promoter regulatory maps of candidate genes and pinpointed promising genetic determinants associated with high-altitude adaptation, including SNPs in EPAS1, KLF13, SPRED1, and CFD. These loci were predicted to influence chromatin accessibility and the interactions of regulatory elements, with altered binding strength of relevant transcription factors. Further in vitro experiments confirmed that these loci function as allele-specific enhancers, modulating the expression of target genes. Our findings elucidate the regulatory basis of high-altitude adaptation in Tibetan pigs and provide valuable insights for exploring hypoxia-related diseases in livestock and humans.

AB  - Somatostatin (SS) plays crucial regulatory roles in animal growth and reproduction by affecting the synthesis and secretion of growth hormone (GH). However, the mechanism by which SS regulates growth and development in goats is still unclear. In order to investigate the regulatory networks of the hypothalamus and pituitary in goats affected by SS DNA vaccines, in this study, we used a previously established oral attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SS DNA vaccine, X9241 (ptCS/2SS-asd), to treat wethers. We analyzed the protein changes in hypothalamic and pituitary tissues using a TMT-based proteomics approach. Additionally, we examined the metabolic profiles of the serum of control and immunized wethers through untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Key signaling pathways were identified based on differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Furthermore, the effect of critical DEPs on signaling pathways was confirmed through Western blotting (WB) experiments, which elucidated the mechanism of active SS immunization in wethers. A proteomics analysis revealed that the expression of 58 proteins in the hypothalamus and 124 in the pituitary gland was significantly altered following SS vaccine treatment (fold change > 1.2 or < 0.83, p < 0.05). In the hypothalamus, many DEPs were associated with gene ontology (GO) terms related to neuronal signaling. In contrast, most DEPs were associated with metabolic pathways. In the pituitary gland, the DEPs were largely related to immune and nutrient metabolism functions, with significant enrichment in KEGG pathways, particularly those involving the metabolic pathway, sphingolipid signaling, and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. A metabolomic analysis further showed that active SS immunization in wethers led to significant alterations in seven serum metabolites. Notably, the sphingolipid signaling pathway, secondary bile acid synthesis, sphingolipid metabolism, and lysine synthesis were significantly disrupted. SS vaccines induced marked changes in hypothalamic-pituitary proteins in wethers, facilitating alterations in their growth processes. This study not only provides insights into the mechanism of the SS gene in regulating GH secretion in wethers but also establishes a basis for hormone immunoregulation technology to enhance livestock production performance.<br />

AB  - Displacements from developmental-related projects such as dams, conservancies, and geothermals displace 15-20 million people annually, necessitating the relocation of project-affected persons (PAPs). Most resettlement action plans (RAPs) fail in resettling the PAPs fully, causing loss of livelihoods and impoverishment. In 2014, Kenya Electricity Generating Company Limited (KenGen) displaced 155 Maasai pastoral households to create space for the expansion of existing geothermal electricity generation plants at Olkaria. The PAPs were relocated into a newly created area called RAPland village. The study aimed at answering the question: how did displacement and relocation affect livestock production and performance of the resettled pastoralists. Data on livestock population structures and cattle herd structures and performance (age at first calving, calving interval, lactation length, and milk yields) before and after the relocation were collected by a survey of 105 household heads of the intended census of 155. Data collected were summarised using Excel and analysed with Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Results showed that daily milk yield per cow decreased from a mean of 3.8 +/- 0.19 to 2.38 +/- 0.19 l, while total livestock populations reduced from 8383 to 3124 tropical livestock units (TLU) after the relocation. The mean livestock holding per household (TLU) before the relocation was 75.7 +/- 8.83, 15.5 +/- 1.78, 5.83 +/- 0.67, 1.46 +/- 0.22, and 0.14 +/- 0.02; this decreased after the relocation to 26.4 +/- 8.3, 4.62 +/- 1.7, 2.5 +/- 0.63, 0.34 +/- 0.21, and 0.3 +/- 0.02 for cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and poultry, respectively. Young cattle proportions reduced from 27.6 to 20%, while that of cows increased from 51.7 to 60% after resettlement. Relocation affected livestock production and performances through reduced daily milk yield and livestock populations, thus reducing pastoralists' resilience for food, nutritional security, and coping with catastrophes. As such, future displacement and resettlement programmes involving pastoral communities should address grazing needs and pastoral resilience to avoid impoverishment.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities such as mining, industry, urban waste production, and the overuse of agricultural inputs may result in the contamination of the environment by heavy metals, which are toxic to organisms mainly due to their potential to accumulate in tissues. This contamination causes the simplification of aquatic and edaphic food webs, which show impaired structure and function. We investigated whether soil contamination with heavy metal at the permitted concentrations affects the structural or functional properties of a terrestrial food web of insects living in the aboveground parts of a plant. As study models we used lead (Pb) and kale-associated insects. Kale plants (Brassica oleracea var. acephala) were grown in soil experimentally contaminated with four lead nitrate concentrations: 0 (control), 144 (T1), 360 (T2), and 600 (T3) mg/kg of soil. The experiment was conducted in an open greenhouse for natural insect colonization. The insects were collected twice in the field using trap bags attached to the plant leaf and by direct removal. In general, we observed a simplification of the food web as the Pb concentrations increased, resulting in visually smaller food webs. The food web metrics decreased from the T2 treatment (the Pb limit for agricultural soils). Structurally, the Number of Species (whose values were highly positively correlated to the Number of Links and Link Density values) decreased with increasing contamination, while Connectance increased. Functionally, the Predator/Prey Ratio and Trophic Vulnerability and Generality became lower. This study shows that soil contamination by Pb can simplify insect food webs in the aboveground parts of plants, negatively affecting the structure and function of the webs, even at permitted concentrations.

AB  - Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) supports several important species such as the tiger (Panthera tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), elephant (Elephas maximus), and sambar (Cervus unicolor). Some of the species are involved in crop damage, livestock depredation, and human injuries or causalities, causing economic and social losses. Ti-gers and leopards are perceived as the major threat, causing economic losses to the people living around the protected areas (PAs), because of livestock depredation. Alternatively, the local community also draws benefits from the forest, which are seldom considered part of their economy. Here, we assessed the economic losses and benefits to the people at the northern periphery of the CTR based on semi-structured questionnaire survey of 301 respondents in 26 villages, between January and June 2018. We also determined the socio-economic fac-tors associated with forest dependency using Ordinary Least Square regression (OLS). Most respondents (98%) reported reliance on the forest for fuelwood, fodder, and cattle grazing. Income from forest resources (US$ 1102.2 +/- 63.6/hh/yr)2 contributed significantly to the livelihood of the people (26.5 +/- 1.3%). The income from fuelwood (US$ 188.1 +/- 2.2/hh/yr), fodder (US$ 335.0 +/- 10.0/hh/yr) and livestock grazing (US$ 618.1 +/- 59.9/ hh/yr) contributed 5.6 +/- 0.3%, 9.3 +/- 0.6%, and 11.6 +/- 1%, respectively, to the household's total income. Reliance on forest resources was positively associated with the number of livestock and female participation in resource extraction, and negatively with the employment, age, education of respondents, and use of modern source of en-ergy-Liquid Petroleum Gas. People incurred a cost of US$ 110.5 +/- 4.7/hh/yr due to livestock depredation. It was estimated that benefits drawn from the forest exceed the losses incurred due to livestock depredation. Therefore, we recommend that a cost-benefit analysis is essential before designing conflict mitigation strategies. Since the compensatory schemes in India have largely struggled to achieve their objectives, it is, therefore, emphasised to find other measures, such as payment of ecosystem services (PES), to reduce conflict for maintaining a peaceful co-existence of human and carnivores.(c) 2021 Ecological Society of China.

AB  - Background Ethnozoological knowledge is less documented than ethnobotanical. With this field study, we aim to record and analyze the Riffian Berber knowledge about the use of animals in traditional human and veterinary medicine. Our research question is what is their knowledge of ethnozoological practices? Methods We performed semi-structured interviews with local inhabitants in Riffian vernacular language. The reliability of the sampling effort was assessed by a rarefaction curve. Data were compared with previous studies in order to determine the geographical and historical extensions of described uses and possible conservation implications for the species used. Results We obtained information regarding 107 ethnozoological uses based on 197 use reports. Among the 31 species used, mammals were most frequently cited. Diseases related to the traditional medicinal system were most frequently treated with these resources, as well as those of the respiratory, digestive, and musculoskeletal systems. Thirty percent of uses are associated with magico-religious practices. Only three of the species used are threatened at the global level, two of them extinct in the study area, indicating low potential damage to regional biodiversity from current practices utilizing native animals. Within modern Morocco, Riffians have continued practicing ethnozoological uses anathema to Islam, like the consumption of animals considered impure (dogs, jackals, wild boars, and hyenas). Conclusions The use of primarily mammalian species and of many animal body parts is likely related to the Berber belief in homology between the area of the human body in which the ailment occurs and the corresponding animal body part. These findings unveil the nature of ethnozoological practices, highly linked to folklore and culture-bound conditions, and lacking in the Western empirical rationale for nearly one third of reported uses. The consumption of animals considered impure according to Islam was probably initiated before the conquering of the Maghreb by Arabs in the seventh century and was maintained through the secular isolation of Riffians in mountain areas. This can reflect traditional healing habits being maintained over thousands of years.

AB  - While there is growing recognition of the importance of traditional knowledge in science, these perspectives remain underrepresented in research publications. However, the synthesis of these approaches has tremendous potential to improve our understanding of wildlife and ecosystems. Toward realizing this aim, we combined local traditional knowledge with molecular classification techniques to investigate "soil scratching" behavior in western lowland gorillas in two localities in Republic of Congo, the Goualougo Triangle and the Dj & eacute;k & eacute; Triangle. Daily observations of four gorilla groups for nearly a decade revealed that soil scratching is a foraging strategy to access a deer truffle species, identified here as Elaphomyces labyrinthinus. We also conducted group scans to calculate the time gorillas spent foraging for deer truffles and video focal observations to assess foraging efficiency. There was considerable variation in soil scratching across groups. It was most common in Buka's group, followed by Kingo's group and M & eacute;t & eacute;t & eacute;l & eacute;'s group. Truffle foraging was rarely observed in the Loya-Makassa group. While the overall distribution of deer truffles seemingly determines the occurrence of this behavior across populations, we found indications of social influences on soil scratching within populations. For example, an adult female transferred from a group in which the behavior was rare to another group where it is common and adjusted her frequencies of soil scratching to that of her new group. Finally, these findings were included in an ecological impact assessment of the Dj & eacute;k & eacute; Triangle that prompted conservation managers to shift the location of tourism-associated construction to safeguard this putative cultural behavior.

AB  - Animal populations must be able to acquire an adequate amount of nutrients to persist regardless of what environment they are in. In highly variable environments, such as drylands where food sources are limited, this potential mismatch between physiological demands and what is available in the environment is accentuated. For herbivores, the balance of macronutrients (protein and carbohydrate) is particularly important and both nutrients are highly variable in plants both spatially and temporally. Whereas it is known that many herbivores will forage multiple plants to achieve an optimal nutritional ratio (termed the intake target), it is less known how herbivores with different life history strategies address this in variable environments. In this study, we measured the intake targets of three grasshopper species with differing life history strategies, two migratory and one non-migratory, at three locations in New South Wales, Australia. We measured nutrient variation in plants spatially and temporally by sampling three different locations and repeated the measurement twice for one of these locations. At all three locations and both times, host plant protein differed substantially but carbohydrate content remained constant. The non-migratory grasshopper species shifted their intake target, presumably to redress nutrient imbalances. On the other hand, the two migratory grasshopper species largely maintained the same intake target, even when in a nutritionally suboptimal environment. These results suggest that non-migratory species are likely more limited in their capacity to forage for optimal diets and may rely more on digestion to survive in nutritionally suboptimal locations. In contrast, migratory grasshoppers may migrate to obtain the nutrients they need instead of redressing imbalances locally. Therefore, a strong metapopulation structure may aid in the persistence of migratory species at larger spatial scales. Since herbivores, especially insects, are important from nutrient cycling to food chains, understanding how populations persist in nutritionally variable environments is important to the overall ecosystem functioning. Further research should consider how nutritional demands drive population dynamics and how it changes with life history strategies.

AB  - Accurate assessments of the patterns and drivers of livestock depredation by wild carnivores are vital for designing effective mitigation strategies to reduce human-wildlife conflict. Snow leopard's (Panthera uncia) range extensively overlaps pastoralist land-use and livestock predation there is widely reported, but the ecological determinants of livestock consumption by snow leopards remain obscure. We investigated snow leopard dietary habits at seven sites across the Sanjiangyuan region of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), an area central to the species' global range. Snow leopard abundance, wild prey composition, and livestock density varied among those sites, thus allowing us to test the effects of various factors on snow leopard diet and livestock predation. Using DNA metabarcoding, we obtained highly resolved dietary data from 351 genetically verified snow leopard fecal samples. We then analyzed the prey preferences of snow leopards and examined ecological factors related to their livestock consumption. Across the sites, snow leopard prey was composed mainly of wild ungulates (mean = 81.5% of dietary sequences), particularly bharal (Pseudois nayaur), and supplemented with livestock (7.62%) and smaller mammals (marmots, pikas, mice; 10.7%). Snow leopards showed a strong preference for bharal, relative to livestock, based on their densities. Interestingly, both proportional and total livestock consumption by snow leopards increased linearly with local livestock biomass, but not with livestock density. That, together with a slight negative relationship with bharal density, supports apparent facilitation between wild and domestic prey. We also found a significant positive correlation between population densities of snow leopard and bharal, yet those densities showed slight negative relationships with livestock density. Our results highlight the importance of sufficient wild ungulate abundance to the conservation of viable snow leopard populations. Additionally, livestock protection is critically needed to reduce losses to snow leopard depredation, especially where local livestock abundances are high.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation due to human activities creates threats to wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and increases human-elephant conflicts (HEC). This study analyzed connectivity maps among the core habitats of wild elephants in the eastern part of Thailand. Resistance surfaces, associated with geographic and land use features, were used to estimate the dispersal of wild elephants. An increase in roads, reservoirs, and agricultural areas in 2020 was noted. In addition, the increase of artificial water sources and roads has increased HEC. To reduce HEC, the study of suitable landscape corridors for wild Asian elephants can guide the development of effective connectivity among the habitat patches. The scattered locations of reserved forests induce wild elephants to enter agricultural areas. In 2020, during the dry season, wild elephants used 3552 habitat patches, 253 population patches (4875 km(2)), 8 breeding patches (68.1 km(2)), and 253 other patches (193.9 km(2)). However, habitat patches were reduced to 1961 patches (3850.9 km(2)) in the wet season. The 16 suitable corridors were recommended for connecting the finest wild Asian elephants. These suitable corridors can be used as a guideline to construct effective landscape corridors for wild Asian elephants' movement among the habitat patches. This finding can help the local managers and villagers incorporate and design restoration areas for the movement and survival of wild Asian elephants and develop suitable areas for agricultural purposes.

AB  - Simple Summary Post-weaning diarrhea is a critical health and welfare issue in swine production systems as the transition from sow milk to solid feed is a stressful event that is accompanied by microbiome community disturbances that can require antimicrobial treatment or other individualized dietary interventions. This study investigated how feeding sows live yeast during gestation and lactation affects the growth and microbiomes of their offspring in the post-weaning period, without directly feeding live yeast to offspring. The offspring of yeast-fed sows displayed altered growth performance and gut microbiome composition when compared to offspring born to sows fed a control diet. The microbiomes of offspring born to yeast-fed sows contained more taxa associated with beneficial fermentative processes, indicating that the manipulation of offspring microbiomes through maternal diet is a viable method for conferring beneficial microbiome characteristics to offspring in swine systems.Abstract The supplementation of live yeast in pig diets is common in the post-weaning phase due to its prebiotic and probiotic effects, but little is known regarding the potential of feeding live yeast to gestating or lactating sows for transferring such benefits to their offspring through maternal programming. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of live yeast supplementation in sow diets during late gestation and lactation on their reproductive performance and its impact on offspring performance and gut microbiomes in the post-weaning period. Three dietary treatments were imposed on 92 mixed-parity sows during late gestation and lactation based upon the inclusion level of live yeast in corn/soybean meal-based diets: Control (0% yeast), Low (0.1% yeast), and High (0.5% yeast). Nursery pigs in the Low group displayed the highest feed intake in the post-weaning period and greater total gain and average daily gain in comparison to pigs in the High group. The gut microbiomes of nursery pigs differed in composition according to maternal dietary treatment groups at days 4 and 28 post weaning, highlighting higher abundances of bacterial genera typically associated with fermentation roles in the gut microbiomes of offspring of yeast-fed sows. These results indicate that the supplementation of live yeast in sow diets, depending on the inclusion level, may result in beneficial performance and specific microbiome traits for their offspring in the post-weaning period.

AB  - In contrast to the abundance of research on marine debris, terrestrial anthropogenic litter and its impacts are largely lacking scientific attention. Therefore, the main objective of the present study is to find out whether ingested litter produces pathological consequences to the health of domestic ruminants, as it does in their rel-atives in the ocean, the cetaceans. For this purpose, five meadows (49 degrees 18 ' N, 10 degrees 24 ' E) with a total survey area of 139,050 m2 as well as the gastric content of 100 slaughtered cattle and 50 slaughtered sheep have been examined for persistent man-made debris in Northern Bavaria, Germany. All the five meadows contained garbage, and plastics were always part of it. Including glass and metal, 521 persistent anthropogenic objects were detected altogether, equalling a litter density of 3747 items per km2. Of the examined animals, 30.0% of the cattle and 6.0% of the sheep harboured anthropogenic foreign bodies in their gastric tract. As in the case of cetaceans, plastics were the most dominant litter material. Bezoars had formed around plastic fibres of agricultural origin in two young bulls, whereas pointed metal objects were associated in cattle with traumatic lesions in the reticulum and the tongue. Of all the ingested anthropogenic debris, 24 items (26.4%) had direct equivalents in the studied meadows. Comparing with marine litter, 28 items (30.8%) were also present in marine environments and 27 items (29.7%) were previously reported as foreign bodies in marine animals. At least in this study region, waste pollution affected terrestrial environments and domestic animals, with clear equivalents in the marine world. Ingested foreign bodies produced lesions that may have reduced the animals' welfare and, regarding commercial purposes, their productivity.

AB  - Introduction The European large carnivore community is recently showing positive trends. Beyond those, other species are expanding in Europe. In recent decades, the golden jackal (Canis aureus), a medium-sized canid, has rapidly expanded to western and northern Europe, after being historically confined to the Balkans. The Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), an apex predator once widely distributed throughout Europe, was nearly eradicated in the 19th century. Recent reintroductions, legal protection, and its natural expansion brought the lynx to recover, though some populations still face extinction. As the carnivores' community across Europe is rearranging, ecological interactions are changing as well. Indeed, recent observations reported the golden jackal to kleptoparasitize the lynx. Our research aims to predict the potentially suitable habitats for the golden jackal and the Eurasian lynx, detailing the areas where those are expected to coexist soon.Methods We model their distribution in Europe for current and future scenarios, using both citizen-science and literature data, using the latter to buffer the possible biases of the former. For this aim, we included not only climatic variables, but also several biotic and abiotic predictors relevant to both species. Moreover, given his strong influence on the golden jackal, we compare our results with the predicted distribution of the grey wolf (Canis lupus).Results Our predictions show an increase in habitat suitability for the golden jackal, while an opposite trend is predicted for the Eurasian lynx. Also, we predict the target species to share a large portion of their range in the future, with most of these areas suitable for wolves, too.Discussion Our results may have several impacts in the context of large-scale management, helping to predict further expansion of the golden jackal, and to identify critical areas for lynx conservation, supporting the management of possible reintroductions, also shedding light on the large carnivores' changing community

AB  - The partially substitution of chemical fertilizers with organic materials can improve soil phosphorus (P) availability; however, the response of aggregate-associated P species and the microbial community remains unclear. We investigated P speciation transformation and the related microbial community of aggregates in a 10-year field trial containing chemical fertilizer (CC), 50 % chemical N replaced by pig manure, corn straw, and manure combined with straw. Compared to CC, the organic substitute pattern increased soil aggregate stability indices, which were positively correlated with labile and moderately labile P. The organic substitution pattern improved labile and moderately labile P in > 2 mm large macroaggregates (LM) and 0.25-2 mm macroaggregates (MA), and decreased labile P in 0.053-0.25 mm microaggregates (MI) and < 0.053 mm silt + clay (SC). CaHPO4 and MgHPO4 of labile P were the primary components in MA, while Ca(H2PO4)(2) was the primary component in MI. Straw addition enhanced the relative abundance of P-solubilizing microorganisms, primarily Bacillus, in different aggregates. The labile P content was higher, and the microbial network displayed higher complexity and connectivity in MI than in aggregates of other sizes. pH was the most critical factor influencing the distribution of P species in the LM. Organic carbon and aggregate stability index were the primary factors in MA, whereas phosphatase activity was the primary factor in MI and SC. Overall, the organic substitution pattern improved aggregate stability and labile P content in LM and MA and reduced labile P in MI and SC, thereby promoting P retention. These insights advance our understanding the effects of organic fertilization on P transformation in soil aggregates, with implications for developing eco-friendly P management strategies.

AB  - The carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from pig barns are increasing persistently as a result of increasing pig farming due to the growing demand of pork, which is a great concern for rising greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. Therefore, the objective of this study was to measure the CO2 emissions with respect to the diurnal activities among different growing stages of pigs. Two experiments were conducted in an experimental pig barn in 2020 and 2021 to estimate the CO2 emissions in response to their activities and growing stages. A livestock environment management system (LEMS) was used to measure the concentration of CO2 inside the barn. A camera with a network video recorder was used to record the activities of pigs on a diurnal basis. Our results showed that the lowest CO2 emissions were found in the fattening stage 1 (age 61-81 days) while the highest CO2 emissions were resulted from the fattening stage 4 (age 124-144 days). Moreover, among the four fattening stages, CO2 emissions levels were significantly different from each other (p < 0.05). The CO2 emissions were maximum during sleeping at midday (1-2 PM) and minimum during feeding at the evening (5-6 PM). In conclusion, this study recommends the need of additional research to be conducted to estimate the CO2 emissions concerning diurnal activities and different growing stages of pigs by providing different ingredients of diets.

AB  - This study analyzed the chemical composition and contents of beta-carotene, tocopherols and retinol in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles and livers of fallow deer (Dama dama L.) fed diets based on hay containing different concentrates (hay and oats-HO; hay, oats and protein concentrate-HOP; hay and pellets-HP). The provitamin and lipophilic vitamin contents in the samples of feed and animal tissues were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The contents of retinol were nearly two-fold higher (p < 0.002) in the livers and many-fold higher in the LD muscles of fallow deer fed the HOP and HP diets. beta-carotene was not identified in the livers or LD muscles of fallow deer. The concentrations of alpha-tocopherol and total tocopherols were higher in the livers and LD muscles of the animals that received the HO and HP diets, but the noted differences were not significant. The inclusion of various concentrates in the feed rations had no influence on the proximate chemical compositions of the livers or LD muscles of fallow deer.

AB  - Agricultural ecosystem formation and evolution depend on interactions and communication between multiple organisms. Within this context, communication occurs between microbes, plants, and insects, often involving the release and perception of a wide range of chemical cues. Unraveling how this information is coded and interpreted is critical to expanding our understanding of how agricultural ecosystems function in terms of competition and cooperation. Investigations examining dual interactions (e.g. plant-microbe, insect-microbe, and insect-plant) have resolved some basic components of this communication. However, there is a need for systematically examining multitrophic interactions that occur simultaneously between microorganisms, insects, and plants. A more thorough understanding of these multitrophic interactions has been made possible by recent advancements in the study of such ecological interactions, which are based on a variety of contemporary technologies such as artificial intelligence sensors, multi-omics, metabarcoding, and others. Frequently, these developments have led to the discovery of startling examples of each member manipulating the other. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of bottom-up chemical communication between microorganisms, plants, and insects, and their consequences. We discuss the components of these "chemo-languages" and how they modify outcomes of multi-species interactions across trophic levels. Further, we suggest prospects for translating the current basic understanding of multitrophic interactions into strategies that could be applied in agricultural ecosystems to increase food safety and security.

AB  - Tools are required for quick and easy preliminary evaluation of functional feeds efficiency on fisheries. The analysis of skin mucus biomarkers is a recent alternative approach providing a faster feed-back from the laboratory which is characterized by being less invasive, more rapid and with reduced costs. The effect of replacing fishmeal and fish protein hydrolysates by means of two porcine by-products, the porcine spray-dried plasma (SDPP) and pig protein hydrolysate (PPH), in compound diets (50.4% crude protein, 16.2% crude protein, 22.1 MJ/kg feed) was evaluated in juvenile meagre (Argyrosomus regius) during a two-months period. To determine the impact of these dietary replacements, growth and food performance were measured together with digestive enzymes activities and filet proximal composition. Additionally, skin mucus was collected and characterized by determining main mucus biomarkers (protein, glucose, lactate, cortisol, and antioxidant capacity) and its antibacterial properties, measured by the quick in vitro co-culture challenges. In comparison to the control group, the inclusion of PPH and SDPP, in meagre diets reduced growth (7.4-8.8% in body weight), increased feed conversion ratios (9.0-10.0%), results that were attributed to a reduction in feed intake values (24.2-33.0%) (P < 0.05). Porcine blood by-products did not modify the activity of gastric and pancreatic digestive enzymes as well as those involved in nutrient absorption (alkaline phosphatase) nor liver oxidative stress condition (P > 0.05). In contrast, a reduction in fillet lipid content associated to an increase in fillet protein levels were found in fish fed SDPP and PPH diets (P < 0.05). As compared to the control diet, the dietary replacement did not alter the levels of the skin mucus biomarkers related to stress (cortisol and antioxidant capacity) or nutritional status (soluble protein, glucose and lactate) (P > 0.05). Interestingly, regardless of the worst performance in somatic growth, meagre fed diets containing both tested porcine by-products showed a significantly improved antibacterial capacity of their skin mucus. This enhancement was more prominent for fish fed with the PPH diet, which may be attributed to a higher content of immunomodulatory bioactive compounds in PPH. Further research will be necessary to provide insights on how the inclusion of SDPP and PPH, at the expense of dietary fishmeal and fish protein hydrolysates, affects feed intake and growth performance in meagre. However, the use of skin mucus biomarkers has been demonstrated to be an excellent methodology for a preliminary characterization of the functional feeds, in particular for their prophylactic properties by the study of mucus antibacterial activity.

AB  - Herbivorous insects such as whiteflies, planthoppers, and aphids secrete abundant orphan proteins to facilitate feeding. Yet, how these genes are recruited and evolve to mediate plant-insect interaction remains unknown. In this study, we report a horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event from fungi to an ancestor of Aleyrodidae insects approximately 42 to 190 million years ago. BtFTSP1 is a salivary protein that is secreted into host plants during Bemisia tabaci feeding. It targets a defensive ferredoxin 1 in Nicotiana tabacum (NtFD1) and disrupts the NtFD1-NtFD1 interaction in plant cytosol, leading to the degradation of NtFD1 in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. Silencing BtFTSP1 has negative effects on B. tabaci feeding while overexpressing BtFTSP1 in N. tabacum benefits insects and rescues the adverse effect caused by NtFD1 overexpression. The association between BtFTSP1 and NtFD1 is newly evolved after HGT, with the homologous FTSP in its fungal donor failing to interact and destabilize NtFD1. Our study illustrates the important roles of horizontally transferred genes in plant-insect interactions and suggests the potential origin of orphan salivary genes.

AB  - Babitonga Bay, the largest estuary of Santa Catarina state, Brazil, is under intense environmental degradation, and the ecosystems (e.g., mangrove) and biodiversity (e.g., fish) are at risk. The longsnout seahorse Hippocampus reidi is a vulnerable fish species found along the estuary, and this study aimed to compare the density and habitat use of longsnout seahorse in two different ecosystem structures along the Linguado Channel (southern mouth): one area with natural mangroves and another where mangroves were replaced by man-made structures. Data sampling was conducted biweekly for six months, from December 2021 to May 2022, during periods of ebb tide and low tide. Samples were collected by freediving along fixed transects, counting seahorses and recording pregnancy stage, behavior, and abiotic factors (salinity, temperature, precipitation, and pH). Salinity, temperature, precipitation and pH did not vary significantly over the months. Precipitation appeared to influence density in March. The results showed that both sampling areas had similarly low seahorse densities, but the sex ratio and number of pregnant males differed between the two sites. A male- biased sex ratio was observed throughout the study. Longsnout seahorses were frequently observed resting (anchored). These results offer valuable baseline data for future seahorse population assessments in Babitonga Bay.

AB  - Simple Summary Paratuberculosis is a chronic disease of ruminants and many non-ruminant animals caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Affected animals show diarrhoea, loss of weight, and decreased production performance with consequent economic losses. This bacterium has been detected in some humans suffering from a chronic intestinal disease known as Crohn's disease (CD) and, therefore, some scientists believe that CD is the human form of paratuberculosis. The disease in small ruminants has been reported in all continents, with goats being more susceptible than sheep. The clinical signs of the disease in goats are not so obvious as often do not show signs of diarrhoea, and the animal may die before being finally diagnosed. In Africa and many developing countries, paratuberculosis is described as a "neglected disease" particularly in small ruminants, which play a vital role in the livelihood of poor communities. This overview attempts to highlight the current research and gaps on this disease in small ruminants to draw more attention for further studies on diagnosis, prevention and control. Paratuberculosis (PTB) is a contagious and chronic enteric disease of ruminants and many non-ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), and is characterised by diarrhoea and progressive emaciation with consequent serious economic losses due to death, early culling, and reduced productivity. In addition, indirect economic losses may arise from trade restrictions. Besides being a production limiting disease, PTB is a potential zoonosis; MAP has been isolated from Crohn's disease patients and was associated with other human diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Type 1 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. Paratuberculosis in sheep and goats may be globally distributed though information on the prevalence and economic impact in many developing countries seem to be scanty. Goats are more susceptible to infection than sheep and both species are likely to develop the clinical disease. Ingestion of feed and water contaminated with faeces of MAP-positive animals is the common route of infection, which then spreads horizontally and vertically. In African countries, PTB has been described as a "neglected disease", and in small ruminants, which support the livelihood of people in rural areas and poor communities, the disease was rarely reported. Prevention and control of small ruminants' PTB is difficult because diagnostic assays demonstrate poor sensitivity early in the disease process, in addition to the difficulties in identifying subclinically infected animals. Further studies are needed to provide more insight on molecular epidemiology, transmission, and impact on other animals or humans, socio-economic aspects, prevention and control of small ruminant PTB.

AB  - Over about 10 million years, the ancestors of whales transformed from herbivorous, deer-like, terrestrial mammals into carnivorous and fully aquatic cetaceans. Protocetids are Eocene whales that represent a unique semiaquatic stage in that dramatic evolutionary transformation. Here, we report on a new medium-sized protocetid, Phiomicetus anubis gen. et sp. nov., consisting of a partial skeleton from the middle Eocene (Lutetian) of the Fayum Depression in Egypt. The new species differs from other protocetids in having large, elongated temporal fossae, anteriorly placed pterygoids, elongated parietals, an unfused mandibular symphysis that terminates at the level of P-3, and a relatively enlarged I-3. Unique features of the skull and mandible suggest a capacity for more efficient oral mechanical processing than the typical protocetid condition, thereby allowing for a strong raptorial feeding style. Phylogenetic analysis nests Phiomicetus within the paraphyletic Protocetidae, as the most basal protocetid known from Africa. Recovery of Phiomicetus from the same bed that yielded the remingtonocetid Rayanistes afer provides the first clear evidence for the co-occurrence of the basal cetacean families Remingtonocetidae and Protocetidae in Africa. The discovery of Phiomicetus further augments our understanding of the biogeography and feeding ecology of early whales.

AB  - Microbial symbionts enable many phytophagous insects to specialize on plant-based diets through a range of metabolic services. Pollen comprises one-plant tissue consumed by such herbivores. While rich in lipids and proteins, its nutrient content is often imbalanced and difficult-to-access due to a digestibly recalcitrant cell wall. Pollen quality can be further degraded by harmful allelochemicals. To identify microbes that may aid in palynivory, we performed cDNA-based 16S rRNA metabarcoding on three related pollen beetles (Nitidulidae: Meligethinae) exhibiting different dietary breadths: Brassicogethes aeneus, B. matronalis, and Meligethes atratus. Nine bacterial symbionts (i.e., 97% OTUs) exhibited high metabolic activity during active feeding. Subsequent PCR surveys revealed varying prevalence of those from three Rickettsialles genera-Lariskella, Rickettsia, and Wolbachia-within beetle populations. Our findings lay the groundwork for future studies on the influence of phylogeny and diet on palynivorous insect microbiomes, and roles of symbionts in the use of challenging diets.

AB  - The aim of the research is to study the parasitic invasion of small ruminants in the mountainous zone of Armenia during summer and autumn, in this case to determine the invasiveness of parasites of the digestive tract of sheep. The material was feces collected from sheep on pastures in the coastal zone of the Getik River during 2022. The work was carried out at the Scientific Centre of Zoology and Hydroecology, National Academy of Sciences, Republic of Armenia. The material researched also included mollusks and oribatid mites - intermediate hosts of biohelminths. As a result of the study of parasitic invasion of small ruminants in the mountain zone of Armenia, the taxonomic composition of parasites was determined. Helminths found in sheep belong to the classes Trematoda, Nematoda, and Cestoda, protozoa - to the class Protozoa. In the autumn season, representatives of seven genera of parasites of the gastrointestinal tract were found - Moniezia, , Dicrocoelium, , Fasciola, , Nematodirus, , Strongylus, , Trichuris, , Eimeria, , while in the summer season, only representatives of five genera were found - Moniezia, , Dicrocoelium, , Nematodirus, , Strongylus, , Eimeria. . As a result of these studies, it can be concluded that natural and climatic factors of the environment have a significant impact on the structure of the helminth complex of sheep in the mountain region of Armenia. All parasites found can have a detrimental effect on the sheep's body. However, the severity of the invasion in the samples taken is not at the level that could lead to serious diseases in sheep. This suggests that the treatment methods used on farms are at a fairly high level.

AB  - For many benthic marine organisms, metamorphosis of larvae into juveniles is accompanied by a shift from the plankton into the benthos. This pelagobenthic transition must be precisely regulated and integrated with external environmental cues to allow the larva to settle at the right place, time, and conditions. Though the molecular mechanisms of the metamorphic processes in marine invertebrates remain relatively understudied, increasing evidence highlights the significant role played by neuroendocrine signaling in the modulation of this process. In this study, we examined the effect of the neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid, serotonin, epinephrine, and L-DOPA on the settlement and metamorphosis of the giant clam, Hippopus hippopus. We then determined the expression of genes encoding neurotransmitter-related enzymes and receptors during early development using transcriptomes of H. hippopus and a related species, Tridacna gigas. Epinephrine emerged as a promising candidate for inducing settlement and metamorphosis, while serotonin and L-DOPA may be involved in other settlement-related functions such as larval swimming and seeking behavior. This is supported by the upregulation of transcripts encoding enzymes involved in neurotransmitter biosynthesis during the competent pediveliger stage. The likely involvement of neurotransmitters in the regulation of the metamorphic process suggests their potential to boost spat yield in giant clam aquaculture. Beyond its applications in mariculture, these results provide insights into the complexity of the giant clam larval neuroendocrine system.

AB  - Like many African countries, balancing conservation goals with the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities remains a persistent challenge in Ghana's Bia Biosphere Reserve (BBR). Usually, conservation policies sideline local knowledge, creating tensions between ecological preservation and economic survival. This study examines how integrating local perspectives into forest governance can bridge these gaps, fostering policies that support biodiversity and community well-being. The study gathered insights from 100 participants across five forestdependent communities using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. Thematic analysis uncovered three critical challenges in aligning conservation goals with forest livelihood needs. First is the erosion of traditional ecological practices that have historically sustained biodiversity and local livelihoods. Second, the deepening of economic hardship due to restrictive conservation measures and inadequate access to viable alternative income sources. Third, persistent governance failures are marked by inequitable policy enforcement and the systematic exclusion of marginalized voices from decision-making processes. Given the government of Ghana's formal recognition of traditional knowledge, this study recommends that these commitments be deepened. Specifically, efforts must be directed toward a more robust integration of traditional ecological knowledge, strengthening local governance structures, and expanding genuinely participatory decision-making mechanisms to ensure inclusive and adaptive conservation outcomes. The study underscores the urgent need to redefine conservation as a collaborative pursuit that balances ecological sustainability with human well-being. This calls for inclusive policies integrating local knowledge, promoting sustainable livelihoods, and safeguarding economic security. Future research should explore the long-term viability and scalability of such integrative conservation models through cross-regional, mixed-methods, and longitudinal studies, thereby deepening our understanding of how localized strategies can inform broader policy frameworks that are both ecologically sound and socially just.

TI  - A Non-Invasive Video-Based Method for Tracking Marine Megafauna Movement: A Pilot Study Using a 24-Second Whale Shark Video from the Persian Gulf
T2  - INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - RHINCODON-TYPUS
AB  - Non-invasive video tracking offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative to invasive tagging for studying marine megafauna movement. However, its potential with brief footage remains underexplored. This pilot study presents a preliminary application of the method using a 24-s video of a whale shark (Rhincodon typus) near Abu Musa Island in the Persian Gulf on October 10, 2023. Due to the short duration and single-individual observation, findings are exploratory and intended to demonstrate feasibility rather than establish generalizable conclusions. Using VideoTracker software and Python tools (OpenCV, NumPy), we tracked a 4-m-long shark swimming at 5 m depth, covering 19.25 m over 24 s with speeds ranging from 0.51 to 1.16 m/s (mean 0.78 +/- 0.19 m/s) and an energy expenditure of 0.66 units. The near-linear trajectory (sinuosity 1.07) suggests steady cruising, consistent with efficient locomotion and prior speed-based movement analyses. This proof-of-concept highlights the potential of video-based tracking in resource-limited contexts and encourages its further refinement for broader ecological applications.

AB  - The application of molecular genetic markers in breeding programs is the basis for the future improvement of existing sheep breeds and preservation of genetic diversity in this animal species. This review aims to survey the literature on genetic markers suitable for inclusion in reproductive control in sheep and in particular to enhance the prolificacy of ewes. In different breeds of sheep, prolificacy can be regulated polygenically or by the action of a major segregating gene from the so-called fecundity genes (Fec). In this review, we focus on the main genes BMP15, GDF9 and BMPR1B belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, as well as the gene B4GALNT2 affecting reproduction and in which polymorphisms associated with the emergence of the more prolific phenotype.

AB  - Aim This study aims to propose a conservation network that contains suitable habitat and connectivity corridors for mitigation due to habitat transformation and fragmentation of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti). Further, we also aim to understand the effects of land-use changes on the conservation network of R. bieti from 1990 to 2020. Location Three Parallel Rivers Region (TPRR) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) of China. Methods We used a GIS-based niche model to predict habitat suitability and extracted highly suitable habitats with an area above 30 km(2) as potential core habitats (PCH patches). We designed a normalized importance value index (NIVI) to select PCH patches with the top 5 NIVI values designated as priority protection habitats (PPHs), and we selected a circuit model to build connectivity corridors among PPHs and five protected areas (PAs) from 1990 to 2020. Results Unsuitable areas and lowly suitable habitats increased 69.3 and 46.8 km(2), respectively, from 1990 to 2020. In particular, the area of PPHs dramatically decreased from 212.1 km(2) in 1990 to 101.6 km(2) in 2020. Average length of connectivity corridors among PCH patches and PPHs decreased from 75.9 km in 1990 to 56.8 km in 2020. Main conclusion Habitat loss and fragmentation are common phenomena as evidenced by decreasing in highly and moderately suitable habitats of R. bieti and increasing in lowly suitable habitats and unsuitable areas. Five PAs are central to build a conservation network and to protect populations and wild groups of R. bieti. Land use changes the conservation network of R. bieti in the past 30 years. Based on re-planning boundaries of PAs to incorporate all protection network of R. bieti, it has practical significance to re-adjust the system of PAs that conservation network of R. bieti should be as fundamental management unit for PA development.

AB  - Determining animal abundance is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of management measures against pest animals. Meanwhile, investigating animal movements has become important for conducting abundance estimations of unmarked animals since the random encounter model (REM) was published. REM is a camera trapping method that derives animal density by using contact ratio between camera traps and targeted animals that randomly move at a certain speed in a given area. However, it requires an independent value, which is animal speed. For investigating animal speed, camera traps with video recording and GPS tagging are the commonly used tools. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are currently used in wildlife monitoring to investigate the abundance of target species. It is evaluated as a tool that is non-invasive and suitable for surveys in inaccessible landscapes. Considering these characteristics, we regarded a distant survey using this technology as suitable for investigating animal movements. Therefore, we proposed a method for estimating animal movements using UAVs and conducted a case study that aimed to investigate wild boars' movements. We collected 11 video samples that successfully followed the movements of wild boars from 26 UAV flights in total, and the average speed of their movements derived from all the samples was 1.54 km/24 hr. We found that issues can be improved, including species identification, video sample length, and animal behaviours or activity patterns. On the other hand, our method showed potential for applying to species with specific characteristics in their body size, shape or activity patterns. With improvements in the issues mentioned above, UAVs would become an alternative tool for investigating animal movements.

AB  - Macrophage presence and location were evaluated in juvenile boar testes at the end of the first wave of Sertoli cell proliferation. Macrophage presence was compared in littermate boars treated with letrozole, a treatment which extended this first wave of proliferation beyond the sampling timepoint. Macrophages were identified as the CD68 positive cells following immunohistochemical labelling of paraffin sections and parenchymal macrophages enumerated. Macrophages present in a layer beneath the tunica albuginea received a score based on density and thickness of this layer. Density within the testicular parenchyma was highly variable in vehicle-treated boars (>100-fold) and did not differ from that observed in the letrozole-treated littermates. However, the macrophage layer beneath the tunica albuginea was denser and thicker in the letrozole-treated animals than in their vehicle-treated littermates. This suggests that macrophages might be involved in the letrozole-induced prolongation of Sertoli cell proliferation.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyze the total breeding stock market in 2021/2022, an estimate of the value of the stock of this type of game, the culling value and income per 100 ha of total hunting areas of all hunting grounds in Central Serbia. This research covered the roe deer breeding stock in the hunting grounds of central Serbia. Based on the analysis, the directions and possibilities for increasing the income in all hunting areas of Serbia has been considered. The assessment of the value of the roe deer breeding stock was determined according to the Rulebook (Official Gazette, No. 18/19), while the income from roe deer culling was calculated using the market price list given by the Hunting Association of Serbia for 2021/2022. It was determined that the value of the male roe deer stock is 6.506.000  pound, while the value of the female and offspring stock is approximately 3.615.000  pound. Total income of culled game in 2017/2018 was 480.626  pound, while the income per 100 ha of the total area of all hunting areas is 9  pound. The highest total income is generated by the Central Hunting ground and it amounts to 191.785  pound. In order to achieve a higher profit from the management of roe deer at the hunting grounds of central Serbia, it is necessary to completely fulfill the planned culling with an increased inclusion of roebucks that have higher trophy mass.

AB  - Marine pollution poses a critical threat to biodiversity. The synergistic effects of microplastics, specifically high-density polyethylene (HDPE), combined with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and heavy metals, on the physiology and feeding behavior of the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus were studied. The growth parameters, pollutant bioaccumulation, enzymatic response, and feeding dynamics were extensively analyzed. Seahorses exposed to microplastics-borne B[a]P and heavy metals exhibited notable reductions in body length and weight, as well as in survival rates, indicating severe stress from these contaminants. The accumulation of pollutant particularly B[a]P in seahorse exceeded China's national regulatory limit of 5 mu g/kg, and the B[a]P accumulation in seahorses was obviously aided by HDPE microplastics, posing a risk to marine organisms and human health via the food chain. The adaptive response of the seahorses was evident shown in the elevation of antioxidant enzyme activities, which is a biological mechanism to mitigate oxidative stress induced by the pollutants. However, this physiological adaptation comes at a cost, as evidenced by marked changes in the feeding behavior. Results show that the efficiency and frequency of feeding were greatly reduced, indicating a heavy impact on the ecological role and survival of this marine creature in polluted habitats. This research offers a crucial perspective on the compound threats of microplastics and associated pollutants in marine ecosystems. It highlights the urgent need develop comprehensive strategies to address these environmental issues. The findings are an important contribution to ecotoxicology, providing a deeper understanding of how microplastics act as vectors for other contaminants and their profound effects on marine life, especially species like seahorses. This study calls for action to strengthen environmental policies and practices aimed at mitigating the impact of marine pollution.

AB  - A new record of Hippocampus mohnikei Bleeker, 1853 was confirmed in Hong Kong through morphological and molecular identification. It is highly possible that there is an established population of H. mohnikei in Hong Kong due to continuous sightings by citizen scientists in the past nine years. The record is significant from a biogeographical perspective as it connects the distributions of known populations in northern China and Japan to those spanning Thailand to India. This further affirms the status of Hong Kong as a hotspot for seahorse biodiversity and conservation in China.

AB  - Bats are known to occur all over the world except in the Arctic and Antarctic regions and a few isolated oceanic islands. Bats have been on Earth for more than 50 million years. Currently, there are more than 1,400 species on the globe. They are the second-largest order of mammals and are widely dispersed across six continents. According to the South Asian Chiroptera Conservation Assessment and Management Plan Workshop report, India has 114 species of bats of which 13 species are under the suborder Megachiroptera. The species Latidens salimalii (Salim Ali' s fruit bat) found in Madurai district of Tamil Nadu and Otomops wroughtonii (Wroughton' s free-tailed bat) found in Belgaum of Karnataka are the two only Indian bat species that are listed on Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act of India, 1972 amended up-to-date. Bats or chiropteran studies at Assam along with other northeast Indian counterparts are very meager and there is no continuous study data from any places of Assam. Besides some detailed studies on the Indian flying fox (Pteropus giganteus giganteus) most of the other studies are based on opportunistic random catches. On the basis of the available research publications of a few bat researchers of Assam, it can become to the conclusion that currently, Assam's counterpart of Northeast India has about a total of 39 different bat species under 16 genera. Out of those 39 species, five species are recorded as Megachiropteran species (fruit bats) along with 34 numbers of Microchiropteran species. Most of the microchiropteran species are insectivorous in nature with a few being carnivorous. All the recorded species of the Suborder-Megachiroptera were found to be included under a single family called Pteropodidae. However, microchiroptera species recorded from Assam were found to be spread into five different families such as Emballonuridae, Megadermatidae, Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, and Vespertilionidae. The highest numbers of species were recorded under the family Vespertilionidae which is commonly known as "Evening bats". To date, 19 species are recorded under this family followed by Rhinolophidae with six species. The rest of the recorded families shared 2-4 species.

AB  - Iota n this study, we evaluated the genetic resources of nine Greek sheep breeds. The genotyping data of 292 animals were acquired from Illumina's OvineSNP50 Genotyping BeadChip. The genetic diversity and inbreeding levels were evaluated using the observed and expected heterozygosity indices, the FIS inbreeding coefficient, and runs of homozygosity (ROH). The genetic differentiation of breeds was assessed using the FST index, whereas their population structure was analyzed using admixture and principal components analysis (PCA). Historical recombination patterns and genetic drift were evaluated based on linkage disequilibrium, effective population sizes, and gene flow analysis to reveal migration patterns. PCA revealed distinct clusters mostly separating mountainous, insular, and lowland breeds. The FST value was the lowest between Serres and Karagouniko breeds (0.050). Admixture analysis revealed a genetic substructure for Serres and Kalarritiko breeds, while Chios, followed by Katsika, demonstrated the highest within-breed genetic uniformity. ROH analysis revealed low levels of inbreeding for all breeds. Genetic introgression from both Anatolia and Eastern Europe has been evidenced for Greek sheep breeds. The results also revealed that Greek sheep breeds maintain adequate levels of genetic diversity, without signs of excessive inbreeding, and can serve as valuable resources for the conservation of local biodiversity.

AB  - A detailed understanding of the precise regulatory mechanisms governing buffalo skeletal muscle is crucial for improving meat quality and yield. Proper skeletal muscle fate decisions necessitate the accurate regulation of key enhancers. This study screened nine potential enhancers linked to muscle development by analysing ATAC-seq data from buffalo myoblasts during the proliferative and differentiative phases. The enhancer activity of these candidates was confirmed in buffalo myoblasts, C2C12, and human skeletal muscle myoblasts using a dual-luciferase reporter system. The CRISPRi system and RT-qPCR were used to test the effects of 9 candidate enhancers on buffalo myoblasts. The active enhancer, Enh483, was selected based on its significant impact. Upon successful inhibition of Enh483 using CRISPRi, decreases in the expression of buffalo myogenic proliferation marker genes (PCNA, CyclinD1, and CDK2) were observed via RT-qPCR and Western blot. Subsequent proliferation assays using CCK-8 and EdU confirmed the promotive effect of Enh483 on buffalo myogenic cell proliferation. Following a 5-day differentiation induction period, changes in the expression of differentiation marker genes (MyoD1, MyoG, and MyHC) were analysed using RT-qPCR and Western blot. Additionally, fused myotube numbers were quantified, and the impact of Enh483 on buffalo myogenic cell differentiation was assessed through immunofluorescence. Our findings indicate that Enh483 facilitates buffalo myogenic cell differentiation. Further interaction analysis utilising 3C-PCR revealed a direct association between Enh483 and the FAXC promoter. In summary, the results from this study lay a foundational framework for deciphering the intricate regulatory mechanisms underpinning buffalo muscle development.

AB  - Achieving the UN SD Goals requires the conservation of keystone marine species. As top predators, many sharks play a crucial role in balancing marine ecosystems; yet, they have been experiencing severe population declines. Overfishing is indisputably the main threat to shark populations, but little is known about the impact of nonextractive human pressure. This study tests the effect of varied human presence on shark behavior at an insular marine reserve. In 2020, humans were virtually absent from Fernando de Noronha (FEN), Brazil, during a 211-days lockdown period prompted by the COVID-19 pandemics. A local shark tracking program rendered nearly 280000 acoustic detections in coastal waters from 2016 through 2021. Lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris, showed a 43% increase in detection rate during the lockdown which was ascribed to the concomitant decrease in human presence. In contrast, the detection rate of tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, decreased by 67% during the lockdown, but this trend was likely related to seasonality in tiger shark behavior. After the lockdown, both species' detection rates tended to return to previous levels. Further, lemon sharks increased diurnal coastal residency and made more use of areas less restrictive to human use during the lockdown, whilst tiger sharks increased nocturnal coastal residency during and after the lockdown period. Contrasting trends might relate with lemon sharks completing their life cycle in FEN and tiger sharks being migrants arriving to FEN at older ages and being less exposed to local anthropogenic stimuli across ontogeny. This study demonstrates that non-extractive human disturbance can induce significant changes in the way marine predators explore crucial habitats for accomplishing trophic, reproductive, and ontogenetic functions. Ascertaining the ecological impacts of marinebased human development should thus consider cryptic responses by keystone megafauna to the anthropogenic landscape produced by an ever-growing coastal population. The designation of human exclusion marine areas could emerge as the single solution to endow shark populations with suitable habitats for optimizing their resilience to human pressure.

AB  - Many small specialist herbivores utilize their food resources both for nutrition and as a structural refuge or resource. Trophic linkage cannot solely be inferred from physical association of herbivores with a potential food item, because herbivores may temporarily inhabit algae or plants on which they do not feed. Elysia papillosa, a small sacoglossan sea slug, consumes and sequesters chloroplasts from the siphonaceous, chlorophytic alga Penicillus capitatus; it also maintains moderate densities on this alga. Recently, E. papillosa was also infrequently found in association with the alga Penicillus lamourouxii, which displays density similar to that of P. capitatus. After collecting E. papillosa from each of the two algal species from a shallow-water site along the west central coast of Florida, we used DNA barcoding of the rbcL gene sequences in order to determine whether the slug was consuming both algal species. The molecular data indicated that E. papillosa consumed and sequestered chloroplasts from the same algal species from which they were collected. A laboratory feeding experiment tested whether algal diet (P. capitatus or P. lamourouxii) had an impact on slug growth rate as measured by change in body size (mm). After 3 weeks E. papillosa fed P. lamourouxii achieved a mean body length that was 1.5-2 times that recorded for slugs fed P. capitatus, but maximum growth depended on the original field host. Thus, while the highest densities of E. papillosa in the field occurred on P. capitatus, slugs grew much faster on P. lamourouxii in the laboratory. The observed association of E. papillosa with P. capitatus must be related to other factors, such as foraging efficiency, algal morphology, algal biochemistry, or algal suitability as a refuge.

AB  - Emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from the terrestrial biosphere play a significant role in major atmospheric processes. BVOCs are highly reactive compounds that influence the atmosphere's oxidation capacity and also serve as precursors for the formation of aerosols that influence global radiation budgets. Emissions depend on the response of vegetation to atmospheric conditions (primarily temperature and light), as well as other stresses, e.g. from droughts and herbivory. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a naturally occurring cycle arising from anomalies in the sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical Pacific. ENSO perturbs the natural seasonality of weather systems on both global and regional scales and is considered the most significant driver of climate variability. Several studies have evaluated the sensitivity of BVOC fluxes during ENSO events using historical transient simulations. While this approach employs realistic scenarios, it is difficult to assess the impact of ENSO alone given the multiple types of climate forcing, e.g. from anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and aerosol. In this study, a global atmospheric chemistry-climate model with enabled interactive vegetation was used to conduct two sets of simulations: (1) isolated ENSO event simulations, in which a single ENSO event is used to perturb otherwise baseline conditions, and (2) sustained ENSO simulations, in which the same ENSO conditions are reproduced for an extended period of time. From the isolated ENSO events, we present global and regional BVOC emission changes resulting from the immediate response of vegetation to atmospheric states. More focus is given to the sustained ENSO simulations, which have the benefit of reducing the internal variability for more robust statistics when linking atmospheric and vegetation variables with BVOC flux anomalies. Additionally, these simulations explore long-term changes in the biosphere with potential shifts in vegetation in this possible climate mode, accounting for the prospect of increased intensity and frequency of ENSO with climate change. Our results show that strong El Nino events increase global isoprene emission fluxes by 2.9 % and that one single ENSO event perturbs the Earth system so markedly that BVOC emission fluxes do not return to baseline emissions within several years after the event. We show that persistent ENSO conditions shift the vegetation to a new quasi-equilibrium state, leading to an amplification of BVOC emission changes with up to a 19 % increase in isoprene fluxes over the Amazon. We provide evidence that BVOC-induced changes in plant phenology, such as the leaf area index (LAI), have a significant influence on BVOC emissions in the sustained ENSO climate mode.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to capture some factors affecting wool fineness (WF) in Karacabey Merino. For this goal, CHAID (Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detector) tree-based algorithm implemented to construct a regression tree diagram was specified based on Bonferroni adjustment within the scope of the prediction of wool fineness as a response variable. Also, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) was implemented for the WF prediction. In the prediction of wool fineness (WF), sex, dam age (DA), birth weight (BW), birth type (BT), live body weight (LBW), greasy fleece weight (GFW), staple length (SL), number of fibers (F) and average number of crimps over a length of 5 cm (ANC) were considered as possible predictors. To guarantee the highest predictive accuracy of the CHAID algorithm, minimum animal numbers in parent and child nodes were thought as 4 and 2. Model fit statistics showed the powerful predictive performance of the CHAID and MARS algorithms, but MARS outperformed CHAID. Considering the regression tree diagram generated by CHAID algorithm, the most influential predictor affecting WF was F, followed by BW, ANC and DA at the 2nd significance degree, and SL at the 3rd significance degree, respectively. MARS predictive model with the selected 5 terms captured only F as a significant predictor. In conclusion, CHAID and MARS data mining algorithms reflected that F predictor may be considered as an indirect selection criterion in the characterization of the breed standards of the Karacabey Merino in wool characteristics for breeding goals.

AB  - Simple Summary The article studies the research output on sheep and goats from Greece; a country where small ruminant farming is the most important terrestrial animal farming business. Milk production from sheep and goats exceeds that from cattle and over 90% of total milk produced from sheep and goats is used for dairy products. Research output on sheep and goats have increased significantly from 1997 to 2022. The bulk of publications, 87.5% of relevant papers, has originated from four establishments: Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; University of Thessaly; Agricultural University of Athens and Hellenic Agricultural Organization-Dimitra. Papers were published most frequently in the journals Small Ruminant Research and Journal of the Hellenic Veterinary Medical Society. The most frequent general topics of study were animal health-welfare and animal products. The findings have indicated that research has focused on milk production and diseases of the udder of small ruminants; moreover, there was accumulation of relevant research in Greece in some establishments only. The findings of the study can be used by researchers; stakeholders and Government entities to improve relevant research and to better allocate resources in the country. The study is a scientometrics evaluation of published articles performed in Greece on sheep and goats during the last 25 years, a period coinciding with implementation of reforms to shape and consolidate tertiary education and research establishments in the country. Objectives were: evaluation of the relevant publications and presentation of quantitative characteristics regarding scientific content and bibliometric details. The Web of Science platform was used (search terms: [[sheep OR goat*] OR [Ovis aries OR Capra hircus]] (1997-2022)) and 1080 papers were considered in detail. Throughout the study period, there was a clear progressive increase in numbers of papers published. The papers originated from 39 different entities, most from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (34.0%), University of Thessaly (28.0%), Agricultural University of Athens (21.2%) and Hellenic Agricultural Organization-Dimitra (13.6%). Papers were published in 318 different journals. Journals with more published papers were Small Ruminant Research and Journal of the Hellenic Veterinary Medical Society. The most frequent general topic of study in the papers was health and welfare (46.7% of papers); second most frequent topic was animal products (18.6%). The papers have received 16,558 citations, i.e., omicron n average 15.4 citations per paper; the h-index was 56, the i(10)-index was 518 and the yearly citations per paper were 1.71. Papers on goats had higher impact than papers on sheep. There were 1711 individual authors, of which 728 were first or last authors. In total, 24 authors have each co-authored >= 2.5% of all papers; five authors were each first or last in that proportion of all papers. The findings have indicated that relevant research has focused on milk production and diseases of the udder of small ruminants; moreover, there was accumulation of relevant research in Greece in some establishments only. The findings of the study can be employed to initiate improved relevant research approaches in the country.

AB  - Knowledge of the mineralisation and nutrient release of organic fertilisers is essential to ensure plant nutrient demand and availability, to increase N use efficiency and to minimise environmental risks. In 2018-2020, two similar field experiments were carried out on clay loam Cambisol with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown without N application and applying liquid anaerobic digestate (LD), pig slurry (PS) and ammonium nitrate (AN) fertilizer with and without additional fertilization (N-120 and N120+50). The aim of the research was to compare the effect of organic and mineral fertilizers on the variation of soil mineral nitrogen forms in the 0-30, 30-60 cm soil layers and N accumulation in wheat yield. Fertilizers applied during the previous growing season increased the nitrate and ammonium nitrogen (N-NO3 and N-NH4) content after the resumption of winter wheat vegetation. The dry period in spring (2019) had a negative impact on winter wheat N uptake. In a year of normal moisture content (2020), PS and LD fertilizers and the fertilizer application of the previous year (2019) significantly increased the N-NO3 content in the topsoil, while all applied fertilizers increased it in the deeper soil layer (by a factor of between 3.6 and 12.3), compared to unfertilized soil.

AB  - Phytochemical diversity is an effective plant defensive attribute, but much more research has focused on genetic and environmental controls of specific defensive compounds than phytochemical diversity per se. Documenting plasticity in phytochemical richness and plant chemical composition as opposed to individual compounds is important for understanding plant defense. This study outlines a multi-site transplant experiment in Cerrado gallery forests in central Brazil, utilizing Piper arboreum (Piperaceae), a prevalent and widespread neotropical shrub. Clones from four distinct populations were planted either at their origin site or in a different forest. Secondary metabolite composition varied between populations initially and then changed after transplanting. Interestingly, clones with chemical profiles that were distinct from the populations where they were introduced experienced reduced specialist chrysomelid herbivory compared to clones that were more chemically similar to the existing P. arboreum populations where they were planted. Specialist Lepidoptera herbivory also declined in clones transplanted to a new forest, but this change could not be ascribed to chemical profiles. In contrast, generalist herbivory was unaffected by chemical dissimilarity and transplanting. This research adds to the expanding body of evidence suggesting that phytochemical diversity is a dynamic trait exerting unique effects on different herbivore guilds.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of altitude on the fatty acid composition of pasture grass, yak milk, and yak ghee on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, aiming to understand how environmental factors influence the nutritional quality of these products. Samples were collected from four different altitudes and analyzed for fatty acid profiles using gas chromatography. The analysis reveals that higher altitudes are associated with an increased prevalence of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid (C18:1) and linoleic acid (C18:2n6c). These findings highlight the significant influence of altitude on yak lipid metabolism, ultimately enhancing the nutritional value of dairy products. This adaptation not only supports the health and resilience of yaks, but also provides vital nutritional benefits to residents in high-altitude regions. The research underscores the importance of further investigations to optimize dairy production practices, ensuring improved food security and health outcomes for residents of the plateau.

AB  - Effective conservation and land management require robust understanding of how landscape features spatially and temporally affect population distribution, abundance and connectivity. This is especially important for keystone species known to shape ecosystems, such as the African elephant (Loxodonta africana). This work investigates monthly patterns of elephant movement and connectivity in Kruger National Park (KNP; South Africa), and their temporal relationship with landscape features over a 12-month period associated with the occurrence of a severe drought. Based on elephant locations from GPS collars with a short acquisition interval, we explored the monthly patterns of spatial-autocorrelation of elephant movement using Mantel correlograms, and we developed scale-optimized monthly path-selection movement and resistant kernel connectivity models. Our results showed high variability in patterns of autocorrelation in elephant movements across individuals and months, with a preponderance of directional movement, which we believe is related to drought induced range shifts. We also found high non-stationarity of monthly movement and connectivity models; most models exhibited qualitative similarity in the general nature of the predicted ecological relationships, but large quantitative differences in predicted landscape resistance and connectivity across the year. This suggests high variation in space-utilization and temporal shifts of core habitat areas for elephants in KNP. Even during extreme drought, rainfall itself was not a strong driver of elephant movement; elephant movements, instead, were strongly driven by selection for green vegetation and areas near waterholes and small rivers. Our findings highlight a potentially serious problem in using movement models from a particular temporal snapshot to infer general landscape effects on movement. Conservation and management strategies focusing only on certain areas identified by temporarily idiosyncratic models might not be appropriate or efficient as a guide for allocating scarce resources for management or for understanding general ecological relationships.

AB  - This paper reviews evidence demonstrating a bidirectional relationship between memory and eating in humans and rodents. In humans, amnesia is associated with impaired processing of hunger and satiety cues, disrupted memory of recent meals, and overconsumption. In healthy participants, meal-related memory limits subsequent ingestive behavior and obesity is associated with impaired memory and disturbances in the hippocampus. Evidence from rodents suggests that dorsal hippocampal neural activity contributes to the ability of meal-related memory to control future intake, that endocrine and neuropeptide systems act in the ventral hippocampus to provide cues regarding energy status and regulate learned aspects of eating, and that consumption of hypercaloric diets and obesity disrupt these processes. Collectively, this evidence indicates that diet-induced obesity may be caused and/or maintained, at least in part, by a vicious cycle wherein excess intake disrupts hippocampal functioning, which further increases intake. This perspective may advance our understanding of how the brain controls eating, the neural mechanisms that contribute to eating-related disorders, and identify how to treat diet-induced obesity.

AB  - Competing objectives are common in the management of wildlife diseases. However, the extent to which disease mitigation conflicts with other goals has rarely been quantified. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a lethal cervid disease widely distributed in North America and recently detected in Europe. After the detection of CWD among reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in Norway in 2016, intensified and male-biased harvesting was used to manage CWD, but this may have adverse side effects. Based on extensive surveillance data (2001-2022) gathered by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA) and local management in addition to harvest statistics, we quantified how CWD management in Hardangervidda, Norway, changed harvest rates and affected population size, operational sex ratio, and age structure, and, in turn, whether recruitment, sex ratio of calves, and calving dates were affected. We used a formal reindeer quality standard to define adverse management. The estimated harvest rate of adult males reached >40% annually; however, the population size was only moderately reduced because the harvest of adult females was similar or decreased. The sex ratio changed from approximately 1:2.2 to 1:6.5 (males >= 3 years: females >= 1 year), which brought the population from good to poor quality according to the reindeer quality standard. The proportion of prime-aged (>= 5 years) males among adult males (>= 2 years) in the harvest decreased from >60% to approximately 30%. Demographic changes led to limited side effects in the short-term, with a delay of 4-5 days in calving dates and a slightly more female-biased sex ratio among the harvested calves but without a marked change in early recruitment. Wildlife populations are increasingly threatened by severe disease outbreaks that may require intensive management. Our study highlights the importance of extensive surveillance to document the potential adverse effects on population abundance, demography, and demographic side effects. The fairly limited short-term adverse impacts can be traded against a higher likelihood of future sustainability without severe diseases; however, this may become an issue of concern if the disease becomes endemic. Balancing these trade-offs would benefit from good communication between veterinary sciences and wildlife ecology experts.

AB  - Animal vocalizations encode rich biological information-such as age, sex, behavioural context and emotional state-making bioacoustic analysis a promising non-invasive method for assessing welfare and population demography. However, traditional bioacoustic approaches, which rely on manually defined acoustic features, are time-consuming, require specialized expertise and may introduce subjective bias. These constraints reduce the feasibility of analysing increasingly large datasets generated by passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). Transfer learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offers a scalable alternative by enabling automatic acoustic feature extraction without predefined criteria. Here, we applied four pre-trained CNNs-two general purpose models (VGGish and YAMNet) and two avian bioacoustic models (Perch and BirdNET)-to African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) recordings. We used a dimensionality reduction algorithm (UMAP) to represent the extracted acoustic features in two dimensions and evaluated these representations across three key tasks: (1) call-type classification (rumble, roar and trumpet), (2) rumble sub-type identification and (3) behavioural and demographic analysis. A Random Forest classifier trained on these features achieved near-perfect accuracy for rumbles, with Perch attaining the highest average accuracy (0.85) across all call types. Clustering the reduced features identified biologically meaningful rumble sub-types-such as adult female calls linked to logistics-and provided clearer groupings than manual classification. Statistical analyses showed that factors including age and behavioural context significantly influenced call variation (P < 0.001), with additional comparisons revealing clear differences among contexts (e.g. nursing, competition, separation), sexes and multiple age classes. Perch and BirdNET consistently outperformed general purpose models when dealing with complex or ambiguous calls. These findings demonstrate that transfer learning enables scalable, reproducible bioacoustic workflows capable of detecting biologically meaningful acoustic variation. Integrating this approach into PAM pipelines can enhance the non-invasive assessment of population dynamics, behaviour and welfare in acoustically active species.

AB  - Myotonia congenita is a hereditary, non-dystrophic skeletal muscle disorder associated with muscle stiffness due to delayed muscle relaxation after contraction. We review myotonia congenita in domesticated animals and humans and investigated suspected myotonia congenita in a flock of Merino sheep in Australia. In 2020, a property in New South Wales reported a four-year history of lambs that would fall on disturbance before rapidly recovering, with 13 affected sheep identified in 2020. Episodes were associated with a short period of tetanic spasms and a stiff gait upon rising. Lambs were otherwise normal between episodes, although over time, lost body condition and occasionally died from misadventure. An inherited condition was considered from limited pedigree information and a preliminary diagnosis of myotonia congenita was made based on clinical presentation. Biochemistry from four sheep found variable, but typically mild increases in creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Modified electromyography on six affected sheep found irregular electrical activity within the muscle. For four sheep, there were no consistent significant abnormalities on post mortem examination and histopathology-typical for this condition. A review of the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA) databases was conducted to summarise information about myotonia congenita in humans and eight non-human species of animals. Comparing the characteristic clinical presentation, pathology and electromyography data of affected Merino sheep to similar conditions in other species assisted the identification of likely candidate genes. Whole genome sequencing of two affected lambs detected a missense variant in CLCN1 (NC_056057.1:g.107930611C>T; XM_004008136.5:c.844C>T; XP_004008185.4:p.(P282S)), with a predicted deleterious effect on protein function. An SNP genotyping assay was developed, and the variant segregated with the disease in 12 affected sheep and obligate carrier rams under an assumed recessive mode of inheritance. Identifying a likely causal variant and developing a diagnostic test allows screening of suspected affected or carrier Merino sheep for early intervention to reduce propagation of the variant within flocks.

AB  - The transition from the post-settlement herbivorous juvenile to the coral-eating stage of crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) is a fundamental step to seed population outbreaks that decimate tropical coral reefs. How the highly cryptic juveniles fare during this transition is poorly understood. We show that the juveniles are vulnerable to attack by coral during this ontogenetic diet shift to coral prey. We monitored the condition, growth, and survival of juvenile COTS during the first 3.5 mo on a diet of Acropora sp. In initial encounters, juveniles often withdrew their arms to avoid the defensive nematocysts of the corals. Within the first 67 d of being offered coral, 37.8% of the juveniles experienced various levels of sublethal and lethal damage. Damaged arms were reduced to similar to 65.4% of the length of an intact arm, but most injured juveniles were able to regenerate their arms with an average predicted recovery time of similar to 4 mo. Although sublethal damage slowed the growth of injured juveniles, their capacity to regenerate is likely to contribute to the success of this highly prolific species. Despite being the prey of COTS, coral can influence the survival of juveniles, and potentially reduce their ecological impact by prolonging their growth to reproductive maturity, delaying their transition into a coral predator, and thereby hindering recruitment into the adult population.

AB  - Changes in socio-economics, demography, politics, and climate in arid and semi-arid regions in recent decades have led to profound transformations in livestock practices, particularly in the management of local animal resources. The dromedary Camelus dromedarius has always played an important role in human life history in Algeria; it provides a substantial contribution in protein production such as milk and meat, and it is used as means of transportation by local populations. It is well-adapted to arid environments and has a satisfactory potential for food production that enables economic security to locals, especially in the context of climate change. This paper adds supplementary yet valuable information to the current knowledge on camel genetic diversity related to different management practices. Genetic and phenotypic variations and the underlying management practices are studied to understand differences between breeds, for a better resource management. The survey of 277 camel breeders across the Algerian desert revealed a genetic diversity in terms of breeds driven by four pastoral practices. According to coat colour and morphological aspect, the camel population "Tergui" corresponds to three breeds, namely Mahri with 53.13% of the population, Marouki (43.22%), and the single-ecotype Azerghaf (3.65%). Mahri is a mixture of Amelal and Abahou ecotypes that are being outnumbered by Marouki's ecotypes (Atelagh and Alemlagh). This biodiversity is under real threat because of the behaviour of pastoral societies that pushes breeders to turn to breeds with a high market value. Several useful conservation methods, including the use of modern farming systems, could be positively used and/or improved, in order to protect the genetic variety and help breeders realize a good living out of rearing camels.

AB  - The current and future consequences of anthropogenic impacts such as climate change and habitat loss on ecosystems will be better understood and therefore addressed if diverse ecological data from multiple environmental contexts are more effectively shared. Re-use requires that data are readily available to the scientific scrutiny of the research community. A number of repositories to store shared data have emerged in different ecological domains and developments are underway to define common data and metadata standards. Nevertheless, the goal is far from being achieved and many challenges still need to be addressed. The definition of best practices for data sharing and re-use can benefit from the experience accumulated by pilot collaborative projects. The Euromammals bottom-up initiative has pioneered collaborative science in spatial animal ecology since 2007. It involves more than 150 institutes to address scientific, management and conservation questions regarding terrestrial mammal species in Europe using data stored in a shared database. In this manuscript we present some key lessons that we have learnt from the process of making shared data and knowledge accessible to researchers and we stress the importance of data management for data quality assurance. We suggest putting in place a pro-active data review before data are made available in shared repositories via robust technical support and users' training in data management and standards. We recommend pursuing the definition of common data collection protocols, data and metadata standards, and shared vocabularies with direct involvement of the community to boost their implementation. We stress the importance of knowledge sharing, in addition to data sharing. We show the crucial relevance of collaborative networking with pro-active involvement of data providers in all stages of the scientific process. Our main message is that for data-sharing collaborative efforts to obtain substantial and durable scientific returns, the goals should not only consist in the creation of e-infrastructures and software tools but primarily in the establishment of a network and community trust. This requires moderate investment, but over long-term horizons.

AB  - Soil quality is one of the main factors that affect the growth and quality of tea (Camellia sinensis L.) plantations. The formation of the organo-mineral complex is one of the critical factors that influence the evolution of soil fertility. This study used chemical analyses and spectroscopy to study the effects of inorganic and organic fertilizer on the soil nutrients and organo-mineral complex in tea garden soil. SR-FTIR analysis revealed that clay minerals were connected as nuclei with the capacity to bind carbon, and that this interaction was aided by organic fertilization. Specifically, the O-H has the quickest reaction to aliphatic-C, next by Si-O, Fe-O, and Al-O in OM70. The soil pH of organic and inorganic fertilization treatments are obviously lower than the no fertilization (CK) treatment. Furthermore, OM70 and OM100 had notably higher pH values in fertilized soil. Organic fertilization (OM70) treatment significantly increased Soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorous, potassium (AP, AK), as well as the concentration of total and exchangeable Ca2+ and Mg2+ in soils when compared to no fertilization (CK) and inorganic fertilization (NPK). Together, these results can provide the scientific theoretical basis for the study on the understanding of the sequestration of SOM and confirmed the feasibility of organic fertilization in improving soil fertility and supporting organo-mineral interactions, thereby making a contribution to carbon storage in tea plantation ecosystems.

AB  - Semen cryopreservation is a crucial technology in the artificial insemination of livestock and poultry. It not only contributes to the conservation of germplasm resources but also facilitates the cross-regional exchange of high-quality breeding stock. In this study, 165 Duroc boars were selected for genome-wide genotyping, and the sperm freezing/thawing motility ratio (sperm recovery rate) was used as phenotypic data for genome-wide association analysis (GWAS). Considerable individual variations in sperm recovery rates (SRRs) were detected, and the sperm structure after cyropreservation was significantly better in highly freeze-tolerant individuals compared to non-freeze-tolerant ones. The heritability of the SRR was calculated and found to be 0.199 +/- 0.158, representing low heritability. Through GWAS, eight single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci and four candidate genes (SLC10A6, MYRF, GGA1, and UTRN) were identified as being significantly associated with sperm freezing tolerance. Moreover, the dominant genotypes of four SNPs were finally determined to be valuable for identifying individuals with high sperm freezing tolerance. This study reveals the heritability of the sperm recovery rate and identifies molecular markers associated with sperm freezing tolerance in Duroc boars, which is of great significance for accelerating boar genetic improvement and enhancing the economic efficiency of pig breeding industry.

AB  - Kisspeptin, a neuropeptide encoded by the Kiss1 gene, combines with its receptor Kiss1R to regulate the onset of puberty and male fertility by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. However, little is known regarding the expression signatures and molecular functions of Kiss1 in the testis. H&E staining revealed that well-arranged spermatogonia, spermatocytes, round and elongated spermatids, and spermatozoa, were observed in 4-, 6-, and 8-month-old testes compared to 1- and 3-month-old testes of Hezuo pigs; however, these were not observed in Landrance until 6 months. The diameter, perimeter, and cross-sectional area of seminiferous tubules and the perimeter and area of the tubular lumen increased gradually with age in both pigs. Still, Hezuo pigs grew faster than Landrance. The cloning results suggested that the Hezuo pigs' Kiss1 CDS region is 417 bp in length, encodes 138 amino acids, and is highly conserved in the kisspeptin-10 region. qRT-PCR and Western blot indicated that the expression trends of Kiss1 mRNA and protein were essentially identical, with higher expression levels at post-pubertal stages. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the Kiss1 protein was mainly located in Leydig cells and post-pubertal spermatogenic cells, ranging from round spermatids to spermatozoa. These studies suggest that Kiss1 is an essential regulator in the onset of puberty and spermatogenesis of boars.

AB  - Lungworms of the genus Metastrongylus are parasitic nematodes in the respiratory tract of swine. Although they infect both wild boars and domestic pigs, studies on Metastrongylus infections in wild boars in Europe, the Americas and Africa are numerous, while those in domestic pigs are few. There are several studies analysing the molecular phylogenetic relationships of few individual Metastrongylus species with other nematode taxa, but there are no studies on the phylogenetic relationships of species within the genus Metastrongylus. In Southeast Asia, reports on swine lungworms are extremely scarce and do not include any nucleotide sequence data. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to survey Metastrongylus infection in domestic pigs raised in Dien Bien Province, Northern Vietnam, and to analyse the molecular phylogenetic relationships of Metastrongylus species. Based on morphological and molecular data, we identified two species: Metastrongylus apri and Metastrongylus pudendotectus. The prevalence of the former species was found to be significantly higher than the latter one (24.1% vs. 2.3%). We observed pigs exhibiting a coinfection with the two lungworm species or a single infection with only M. apri. However, we did not observe any pigs being infected with just M. pudendotectus. Vietnamese Metastrongylus specimens showed slight morphological and molecular differences compared to those from other countries. The molecular analyses revealed a close genetic relationship between M. apri and Metastrongylus salmi, while both these species were far distant from M. pudendotectus. The present study highlights the needs for further studies to clarify the morphological features and ecological and phylogenetic relationships of Metastrongylus species at the global scale.

AB  - Erythropoietin (EPO), a central protein of erythropoiesis, plays an important role during hypoxia adaptation and is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). However, there is no report on EPO-producing cells and their regulatory mechanisms in yak (Bos grunniens). To understand EPO production and regulation of yak, kidneys from different age of yak were collected and expression of EPO, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), and hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2 alpha) were detected. Then renal tubule epithelial cells (RTECs) and peritubular interstitial fibroblast-like (RIFs) cells were isolated and cultured to determine their EPO production abilities. Subsequently, the cells were treated with dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) and Geldanamycin (GA), which are inhibitors of prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) respectively, and siRNAs of HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha to explore their effect on EPO production and regulation. The results showed that expressions of EPO, HIF-1 alpha, and HIF-2 alpha were different in the different age groups of yak. High DMOG concentration caused a corresponding increase in the levels of HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha in RIFs and RTECs, however, EPO levels increased in RIFs only and was not detected at any concentration in RTECs; suggesting that EPO was produced in RIFs. Upon treating RIFs with siRNAs of HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha, we found that EPO was regulated by PHD through HIF-2 alpha. In addition, increasing GA concentration caused a decrease in expression of HSP90, HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha, and EPO in RIFs. In conclusion, these findings support our proposition that PHD regulates EPO via HIF-2 alpha in yak RIFs, while HSP90 impelled EPO expression.

AB  - Brown Skua (Stercorarius antarcticus-lonnbergi) and South Polar Skua (Stercorarius maccormicki) occur throughout the Antarctic Peninsula and are sympatric in distribution over 500 km. In this region, hybridization between a male South Polar Skua and a female Brown Skua producing viable and fertile offspring. The present study aims to review the evolutionary history of South Polar Skua and Brown Skua to understand the hybridization process between these species better. To assess the evolutionary history between these species, 67 DNA samples were sequenced for AK1 locus, 70 samples for RAG1 locus, and 96 samples for Cytb locus, from individuals sampled at King George Island and Elephant Island. Cytb and RAG1 loci showed greater genetic diversity in samples from hybrid birds than those of non-hybrid individuals and may reflect the outcome of the heterosis. Overall, Brown Skua had higher genetic diversity than South Polar Skua. In addition, South Polar Skua showed probable populational expansion signals, in contrast to Brown Skua which showed population stability through time. However, our phylogenetic analysis did not corroborate the reciprocal monophyly between these species. Thus, South Polar Skua and Brown Skua show incomplete lineage sorting, indicating these species are a single taxonomic group.

AB  - Coat color is a factor affecting heat tolerance in tropical ruminant and a particular coat color can determine which is more resilient to environmental changes. The aim of this study was to measure the level of adaptation of Morada Nova sheep with different coat color by using an Adaptability Index (AI). Adult ewes were used, including two different coat colors of Morada Nova sheep (red and white) with mean of body weight of 28.02 +/- 5.70 kg and 31.47 +/- 3.41 kg, respectively. Physiology parameters, hematology, electrolytes, acid-base status, mineral, renal functions, metabolites, enzymes, and proteins were measured. AI was designed using a multivariate approach (principal component analysis) to "weigh" the influence of each variable in the animal responses. The variables more important for adaptive aspects of Red Morada Nova were: haematology, electrolytes and acid-base status. The hemoglobin (HG), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), sodium (Na+), oxygen pressure (PO2), glucose (GLU) and albumin (ALB) were significantly higher in Red Morada Nova sheep and hydrogen carbonate (HCO3), base excess (BE), total carbon dioxide concentration (TCO2) and URE were significantly higher in the white phenotype. The variables more important for adaptive aspects of White Morada Nova sheep were: (K+), total protein (TP), PO2, HG, cholesterol (CHO), rectal temperature (RT) and glucose (GLU). Both phenotypes showed a high adaptation level, however, a higher value was generated for the Red Morada Nova sheep (81.97). This study concludes that both phenotypes of the Morada Nova sheep breed are well adapted to the climatic condition of the Brazilian tropical region using different adaptive mechanisms.

An important missing topic has been the variation of ecological parameters because of climate change and the relevant effects on leopard food resources. Also, prey information from camera-traps set for leopards requires caution: carnivores and herbivores use the habitat differently. Questionnaire methodology deserves attention, too.

AB  - The genomic architecture underlying the origins and maintenance of biodiversity is an increasingly accessible feature of species, due in large part to third-generation sequencing and novel analytical toolsets. Applying these techniques to woodrats (Neotoma spp.) provides a unique opportunity to study how herbivores respond to environmental change. Neotoma bryanti and N. lepida independently achieved a major dietary feat in the aftermath of a natural climate change event: switching to the novel, toxic food source creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). To better understand the genetic mechanisms underlying this ability, we employed a trio binning sequencing approach with a N. bryanti x N. lepida F-1 hybrid, allowing the simultaneous assembly of genomes representing each parental species. The resulting phased, chromosome-level, highly complete haploid references enabled us to explore the genomic architecture of several gene families-cytochromes P450, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters-known to play key roles in the metabolism of naturally occurring toxic dietary compounds. In addition to duplication events in the ABCG and UGT2B subfamilies, we found expansions in three P450 gene families (2A, 2B, 3A), including the evolution of multiple novel gene islands within the 2B and 3A subfamilies, which may have provided the crucial substrate for dietary adaptation. Our assemblies demonstrate that trio binning from an F-1 hybrid rodent effectively recovers parental genomes from species that diverged more than a million years ago.

AB  - Here, we document major seabird breeding recovery on a satellite island of Curacao in the southern Caribbean following the removal of goats in 1997, significant reforestation from 2000-2005, and the extermination of cats in 2001. The only seabird to have been confirmed to breed on the island since the 1960s and until recently has been the Least Tern (Sternula antillarum). However, we now confirm nesting for an additional eight sea-and shorebird species on the island for the first time based on field observations in 2021 and 2022. The total number of documented nesting pairs annually has increased from a maximum of 140 pairs (of a single species in 2002), to > 430 pairs (of all species combined) in 2021 and 650 pairs in 2022. The dominant species are the Cayenne Tern (Thalassaeus sandviscensis), Laughing Gull (Larus atricilla), Sooty Tern (Onychoprion fuscatus), and Least Tern, in that order. Breeding by the Sooty Tern and Bridled Tern (Onychoprion anatheus) are new national records for Curacao. Klein Curacao is now the island group's most diverse and active seabird breeding location. Major threats to the nascent recovery of seabird breeding in this Ramsar-designated wetland area are the growing and uncontrolled human recreation, the repeated threat of reintroduction of feral cats, and predation by rats. Recommendations are made on measures needed to address these threats. The case study of Klein Curacao demonstrates the potential for seabird recovery when deleterious invasive mammals are eradicated from islands.

AB  - As native ranges are often geographically structured, invasive species originating from a single source population only carry a fraction of the genetic diversity present in their native range. The invasion process is thus often associated with a drastic loss of genetic diversity resulting from a founder event. However, the fraction of diversity brought to the invasive range may vary under different invasion histories, increasing with the size of the propagule, the number of reintroduction events, and/or the total genetic diversity represented by the various source populations in a multiple-introduction scenario. In this study, we generated a SNP data set for the invasive termite Reticulitermes flavipes from 23 native populations in the eastern United States and six introduced populations throughout the world. Using population genetic analyses and approximate Bayesian computation random forest, we investigated its worldwide invasion history. We found a complex invasion pathway with multiple events out of the native range and bridgehead introductions from the introduced population in France. Our data suggest that extensive long-distance jump dispersal appears common in both the native and introduced ranges of this species, probably through human transportation. Overall, our results show that similar to multiple introduction events into the invasive range, admixture in the native range prior to invasion can potentially favour invasion success by increasing the genetic diversity that is later transferred to the introduced range.

AB  - Long-term monitoring of natural resources is imperative for increasing the understanding of ecosystem processes, services, and how to manage those ecosystems to maintain or improve function. Challenges with using these data may occur because methods of monitoring changed over time, multiple organizations collect and manage data differently, and monetary resources fluctuate, affecting many aspects of data. Because many species respond to changes in habitat conditions and predator-prey relationships across different spatial scales that span management boundaries, greater efforts for collaborating are essential. We demonstrate the challenges and methods for standardizing greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) long-term monitoring data across the species range in the western United States to inform population modeling needs identified by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. We used automated and repeatable methods of standardizing data via custom open-source software (grsg_lekdb) to improve the scientific integrity of future sage-grouse population assessments within and among states. Data standardization included reconciling uses of different terminology and expunging unusable data, resulting in the removal of 26% of data records due to database insertion errors and modifications to >1 million values to correct formatting and typing errors. Our approaches maximized the inclusion of usable data and identified data that could inform detection probabilities, population trends, and monitoring guidelines. Using sage-grouse databases as an example, we identified the importance of data management and how quality assurance and quality control measures can improve the usefulness of these data for future research needs. Our methods of using informatics and concluding recommendations can support similar endeavors of flora and fauna monitoring programs, whether those efforts are to use existing data or support new monitoring programs.

AB  - The application of livestock manure increases the dissemination risk of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in farmland soil environment. However, the vertical migration behavior and driving factor of ARGs in manured soil under swine manure application remains undefined. Here, the dynamics of ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and bacterial communities in different soil depths (0 - 80 cm) with long-term swine manure application were tracked and conducted using real-time qPCR. Results showed that long-term application of swine manure remarkably facilitated the vertical accumulation of ARGs and MGEs, in particular that the relative abundance of blaampC showed significant enrichment with increasing depth. ARGs abundance was similar in the three fields with long-term application of swine manure. (p > 0.05). Procrustes analysis indicated that microbial communities were the dominant drivers of ARGs variation in topsoil, and the changes of environmental factors played a vital role in vertical migration ARGs in cropland soils. Additionally, the variation patterns of high-risk ARGs (i.e., bla(ampC), bla(TEM-1)) were influenced by the dominant bacteria (Actinomycetes) and pH. This study illustrated that the swine manure application promoted the vertical migration of ARGs, including multidrug resistance determinants, highlighting the ecological risk caused by long-term manure application.

AB  - Plant stress caused by aphid foraging can cause a number of disturbances in its vital functions. The degree of disturbance depends on the duration of the stress factor and its intensity. The aim of this study has been to evaluate the impact of aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris, Rhopalosiphum padi L., Myzus persicae Sulzer) foraging on plants and the intensity of photosynthesis and transpiration in several crops (Pisum sativum L., Triticum aestivum L., Brassica napus L.). The laboratory experiment conducted for this purpose revealed that aphids feeding on plants affect the course of photosynthesis and transpiration in crops. Statistically significant correlations were determined between the efficiency of these processes and the number of aphids as well as the duration of their foraging. The average values of the intensity of photosynthesis and transpiration in the test crops were found to increase with the increasing number of aphids in a short feeding period (day 5). A longer foraging time (10, 15 days) coincided with a decrease in the intensity of photosynthesis and transpiration. A detailed analysis of the three species of crops demonstrated that the effect of the biotic stressors on the course of the analysed processes could vary, depending on the host plant.

AB  - Associational effects-in which the vulnerability of a plant to herbivores is influenced by its neighbors-have been widely implicated in mediating plant-herbivore interactions. Studies of associational effects typically focus on interspecific interactions or pest-crop dynamics. However, associational effects may also be important for species with intraspecific variation in defensive traits. In this study, we observed hundreds of Datura wrightii-which exhibits dimorphism in its trichome phenotype-from over 30 dimorphic populations across California. Our aim was to determine whether a relationship existed between the trichome phenotype of neighboring conspecifics and the likelihood of being damaged by four species of herbivorous insects. We visited plants at three timepoints to assess how these effects vary both within and between growing seasons. We hypothesized that the pattern of associational effects would provide rare morphs (i.e., focal plants that are a different morph than their neighbors) with an advantage in the form of reduced herbivory, thereby contributing to the negative frequency-dependent selection previously documented in this system. We found the best predictor of herbivory/herbivore presence on focal plants was the phenotype of the focal plant. However, we also found some important neighborhood effects. The total number of plants near a focal individual predicted the likelihood and/or magnitude of herbivory by Tupiochoris notatus, Lema daturaphila, and Manduca sexta. We also found that velvety focal plants with primarily sticky neighbors are more susceptible to infestation by Tupiochoris notatus and Lema daturaphila. This does not align with the hypothesis that associational effects at the near-neighbor scale contribute to a rare-morph advantage in this system. Overall, the results of our study show that the number and trichome-morph composition of neighboring conspecifics impact interactions between D. wrightii and insect herbivores.

AB  - Marine herbivores may alter their behavior regarding habitat and food source choice according to the presence or absence of chemical cues from predators. To assess whether an amphipod species can detect and react to different water-soluble cues, individuals of Ampithoe marcuzzii were tested through a 2-current choice flume. Dual-response choice experiments were conducted in which the animals selected water flowing from one of 2 different sources. Comparisons among sources were tested using seawater (control), water with cues from different seaweeds (Dictyopteris delicatula, Gracilaria cervicornis or Gelidium coarctatum), water with cues from potential predators (Abudefduf saxatilis, Sparisoma sp., Haemulon plumieri, H. aurolineatum and Holocentrus adscensionis) and water mixtures with seaweed and predator cues. The amphipods were able to avoid predator cues and to distinguish and actively choose between the water-soluble cues of different seaweeds. The animals preferred D. delicatula cues over those of G. cervicornis and G. coarctatum. The amphipods also selected more G. cervicornis cues than those of G. coarctatum. When predator cues were mixed with D. delicatula cues, amphipods changed their initial choice for G. cervicornis. However, when predator cues were added to G. cervicornis, the animals maintained their preference for this seaweed's cues over those of G. coarctatum. Our findings demonstrate that A. marcuzzii exhibits a preference for brown seaweeds that draw fewer predators. The choice of seaweed changes according to predation risk perception based on water-soluble chemical cues. This ability to distinguish water-soluble chemical cues and base their habitat decisions on them is a fundamental adaptive behavior for this group.

AB  - Applied research involves interactions between different organisations-academia, industry, government. Breakdowns in communication can occur during these interactions which alter a project's outcome. We omit how we encounter and overcome these problems from scientific manuscripts which mask the social and cultural considerations that are critical to a project's success. Autoethnography is a form of structured reflection whereby researchers use personal experience to contribute to understanding collaborative processes. We propose an applied form of autoethnography as a repeatable protocol to describe inter-organisational interactions during the research process in ecology and environmental research. We demonstrate the use of this protocol with five case studies from a diversity of wildlife research across a wide variety of experience levels and scales from small mammals, large herbivores and predators to digital ecology. Our applied autoethnography protocol would ensure that specific biases and context are adequately described and that problems encountered and lessons learned from the experience are reflected upon. These reports can be presented as stand-alone publications where appropriate, that is, to communicate an effective solution for a novel problem, or within the methods or supplementary material of manuscripts to further explain how the project developed from initial idea to final publication. Furthermore, this protocol can be used by practitioners to evaluate the trajectory of management decisions and policy implications in their jurisdiction to promote transparency and improve communication with stakeholders. Synthesis and Applications: Applied science will continue to intersect with organisations that help or hinder research efforts depending on cultural contexts and biases. Using adequate reflection on case studies to record these experiences and disseminate lessons to the wider community will improve how we approach problems in research, help us to avoid repeating mistakes and ultimately save time and resources. Outside of research, case studies derived from this protocol allow practitioners to holistically understand the methods, biases and challenges of the research from a new perspective, thus providing a novel knowledge brokering function between academia and practitioners in applied ecology.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: A combination of Trachyspermum ammi L., Curcuma longa L., Cuminum cyminum L., Trigonella foenum-graecum L., Foeniculum vulgare Mill., Anethum graveolens L and Zingiber officinale Roscoe is used as immunity booster and reproductive efficiency enhancing agents in folklore medicine.
   Aim of the study: The present study aimed to assess the immunomodulatory, uterine cleansing and reproduction enhancing effects of polyherbal mixture in post-partum buffaloes.
   Materials and methods: Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to investigate the effects of polyherbal mixture feeding on for quantification of neutrophil functions and blood progesterone hormone estimation. Ultrasonography was used to assess the status of uterine involution, fluid in uterus and ovarian follicular status. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of chemokine genes CXCR1, CXCR2 AND IL-8. Artificial insemination with cryopreserved semen was used to breed the animals. Reproductive efficiency parameters were assessed using standard calculation methods.
   Results: Neutrophil functions and transcriptional abundance of chemokine genes were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in buffaloes supplemented with polyherbal mixture compared to buffaloes in control group. The rate of cervical and uterine involution was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in treatment group compared to control group. The service period was shorter, days to first insemination was earlier and the number of services per conception was lower in buffaloes supplemented with polyherbal mixture compared to the buffaloes in control group. The proportion of buffaloes with large ovarian follicles within 28 days of post-partum was also significantly (P < 0.05) higher in treatment group compared to the control group.
   Conclusions: The polyherbal mixture used in the study improved the immunity of the buffaloes, facilitated early involution of cervix and uterus, efficient cleansing of lochia and improved subsequent fertility. It has the potential to be used in dairy animals for improving post-partum reproductive efficiency.

AB  - Lowering dietary protein content is one of the effective ways to reduce nitrogen (N) emissions and conserve protein feed resources. However, it is unclear how reducing dietary protein levels affects milk quality and the efficiency of N utilization in lactating goats. It is therefore difficult to determine exactly how much reduction in dietary protein levels is optimal. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of low-protein diets on milk quality, N balance and rumen microbiota in lactating goats. A total of 50 lactating goats were enrolled in a completely randomized design and maintained on either a diet with 15.82% protein level as the control group (CON) or reduced protein levels with 13.85% (R2 group), 11.86% (R4 group), 9.84% (R6 group) and 7.85% (R8 group), respectively. The results showed that the dry matter intake, milk yield, fecal and urinary N excretion and utilization efficiency of N of lactating goats decreased linearly with reduced dietary protein levels. Specifically, the milk yield was reduced by the R8 group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the R8 group reduced the contents of protein, fat and lactose (p < 0.05), but R2 and R4 have no influence (p > 0.05). The R6 group decreased protein content only at the 4th week. Fecal and urinary N excretion and utilization efficiency of N reduced linearly with decreasing dietary protein levels (p < 0.05). The R8 group affected the relative abundance of rumen microbiota including Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, NK4A214_group and UCG-005 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, lowering dietary protein levels decreased milk quality and N excretion by altering rumen microbiota in goats during lactation. This phenomenon was most pronounced when the dietary protein level was reduced by 8 percentage points. Nevertheless, dietary protein levels should not be reduced by more than 6 percentage points to ensure normal performance of the goat during lactation.

AB  - Copepods dominate the zooplankton community on the broad Agulhas Bank off southern Africa, where they provide an important food resource for pelagic fish and other biota. Previous studies have shown the dominant copepod Calanus agulhensis, which may comprise up to 80% of copepod biomass, to be strongly associated with the productive cold ridge of upwelled water on the central (CAB) and eastern (EAB) Agulhas Bank. However, there is little information available on other copepod taxa, and whether the Agulhas Bank community has changed over time in response to environmental variability or other ecosystem changes, such as the recent eastward shift in pelagic fish distribution. We use in situ temperature, chlorophyll a (chl a), and zooplankton data collected annually in late spring to explore spatio-temporal variability in copepod biomass and species composition on the Agulhas Bank over a 24-year period, from 1988 to 2011. Functional traits were used to interpret the observed patterns. Total copepod abundance and biomass were concentrated on the outer central and eastern shelf (>100 m), coincident with the region of elevated chl a at 30 m, and largely downstream from cooler subsurface water linked to the cold ridge and coastal upwelling. Current and cruise-feeding herbivores C. agulhensis and the smaller Para- and Clausocalanidae collectively accounted for 73% and 54% of total copepod biomass and abundance respectively, driving the main patterns for total biomass. C. agulhensis copepodites showed an ontogenetic shift in distribution with distance offshore and downstream from the cold ridge, and accumulation of older stages near the southern tip of the bank. The upwelling specialist Calanoides natalis was closely associated with shelf-edge upwelling, particularly near the Agulhas Bight, but was low in biomass compared to the Benguela upwelling system. The current/cruise-feeding detritivores Metridia lucens and the Oncaeidae were largely associated with the western sector of the bank but showed different niche preferences. M. lucens inhabited the chl-rich outer bank of the western Agulhas Bank (WAB), likely a continuation of the southern Benguela upwelling system community, while oncaeid biomass was associated with deeper thermoclines across the WAB and western part of the CAB that often feature accumulations of the gelatinous zooplankton they feed on. Centropages spp. and the Oithonidae, mainly omnivorous ambush feeders, were associated with the inner to mid-shelf region of the WAB and CAB, away from the main influence of the Agulhas Current. Centropages biomass aligned well with elevated chl a on the inner WAB, likely an extension of the Benguela community (C. brachiatus), and with the cold ridge over the inner CAB shelf, matching earlier patterns linked to C. chierchiae. Oithonidae were widespread but low in biomass, and scarce over the Agulhas Currentinfluenced outer shelf, suggesting a suboptimal environment overall for this group compared to the cooler Benguela upwelling region. Current-feeding and omnivorous Pleuromamma spp., known to be deep vertical migrators, were concentrated beyond the WAB shelf edge. Total copepod biomass showed a significant decline over the entire Agulhas Bank during the 24-year time series, as did all stages of C. agulhensis, including large nauplii, and the small calanoids (Paracalanidae and Clausocalanidae). No long-term trends were observed for the other copepod taxa. We found no trends in temperature, but a significant but weak (1.5% yr(-1)) increase in chl a at 30 m.
   Although there was no obvious shift in copepod biomass in response to the eastward shift in pelagic fish in ca. 1996, there were significant negative relationships between copepod biomass (for total copepods and C. agulhensis) and pelagic fish biomass (total, anchovy and redeye) from 1988 to 2011, with significantly lower copepod biomass after 1998 compared to before. This suggests predation pressure has an important top-down influence on copepod biomass on the Agulhas Bank. Bottom-up forcing from environmental drivers cannot be ruled out, however, despite ambiguous results from in situ and remote data series, and long-term warming due to climate change is expected to negatively impact ecosystem productivity at the large scale.

AB  - The present study 813C, 815N and fatty acid compositions of two dominant mangrove crabs, Tubuca arcuata and Parasesarma plicatum were compared between a mangrove site frequently receiving dredged wastewater from mariculture ponds and an adjacent reference site, to investigate the impact of wastewater discharge on their diets. A laboratory experiment was also conducted to further test how their diets changed with the wastewater input. The result showed no significant change in the 813C while clear 15N enrichment of crabs in association with the wastewater discharge. Changes in 15N signature and fatty acid composition of the crabs due to the wastewater discharge indicated that the impact of wastewater discharge was related to crab species, being more apparent on the deposit feeder (T. arcuata) than the herbivorous P. plicatum. The results suggested that the discharge of dredged wastewater into mangroves resulted in the uptake of wastewater-derived materials and nutrients by mangrove crabs.

AB  - Field experiments were conducted using "Zhengdan 958" as the experimental material to study the effects of two different organic materials to the field on the dry matter accumulation, yield, and economic benefits of corn cultivation. Results indicate that straw and pig manure as organic materials both contribute to increasing the accumulation of dry matter and yield of corn. Comparatively, the effect of pig manure found to be more significant. At maturity, returning pig manure to the field can increase the accumulation of mature corn dry matter by 15.85%, yield by 21.93%, and economic benefits by 23.41%.

AB  - Simple Summary The present study searched for the presence and abundance of porcine spermatozoa small RNA sequences (microRNAs) that have the potential to alter gene expression patterns. Four different sperm sources were compared: spermatozoa from three different sections of the ejaculate and from the caudal epididymis, also classed as spermatozoa from higher (HF) or lower (LF) fertility boars. Sperm miRNAs were compared using high-output small RNA sequencing. We identified five sperm miRNAs not previously reported in pigs. Differences in abundance of four miRNAs known to affect the expression of genes with key roles in fertility were related to boar fertility. These miRNAs could be used as fertility markers in artificial insemination programs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs (20-25 nucleotides in length) capable of regulating gene expression by binding -fully or partially- to the 3'-UTR of target messenger RNA (mRNA). To date, several studies have investigated the role of sperm miRNAs in spermatogenesis and their remaining presence toward fertilization and early embryo development. However, little is known about the miRNA cargo in the different sperm sources and their possible implications in boar fertility. Here, we characterized the differential abundance of miRNAs in spermatozoa from the terminal segment of the epididymis and three different fractions of the pig ejaculate (sperm-peak, sperm-rich, and post-sperm rich) comparing breeding boars with higher (HF) and lower (LF) fertility after artificial insemination (AI) using high-output small RNA sequencing. We identified five sperm miRNAs that, to our knowledge, have not been previously reported in pigs (mir-10386, mir-10390, mir-6516, mir-9788-1, and mir-9788-2). Additionally, four miRNAs (mir-1285, mir-92a, mir-34c, mir-30), were differentially expressed among spermatozoa sourced from ejaculate fractions and the cauda epididymis, and also different abundance was found between HF and LF groups in mir-182, mir-1285, mir-191, and mir-96. These miRNAs target genes with key roles in fertility, sperm survival, immune tolerance, or cell cycle regulation, among others. Linking the current findings with the expression of specific sperm proteins would help predict fertility in future AI-sires.

AB  - Modelling life history trait variation at appropriate spatial and temporal scales is crucial for understanding population dynamics and developing effective fisheries management strategies. However, most efforts to model life history traits ignore spatial correlations and make a priori assumptions about the spatial structuring of populations, potentially clouding the ability to recognize true spatial structure. Here we develop spatiotemporal maturation models for Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) in the Northwest Atlantic, a species with large-scale movement patterns that can lead to uncertainty regarding effective stock boundaries. Our analysis using data from three Fisheries and Oceans Canada survey regions, Baffin Bay and Davis Strait in the eastern Canadian Arctic, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), and the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL), is the first at such a large spatial scale. We also extend the traditional binary maturity status to a multinomial one that accounts for seasonal changes in maturation. Results show a decreasing temporal trend in size at maturity across the entire area. Spatial results regarding size at maturity provide new insight linking Greenland halibut south of Newfoundland (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Subdivision 3Ps) to the GSL stock rather than the NL stock. Results also highlight parts of the Davis Strait area, where size at maturity is smaller than in waters both north and south. Multinomial model results identify areas in GSL and Davis Strait that may be important for reproductive development in the summer and fall. Our analyses also reveal constraints on size at maturity that correspond with the well-known positive association between fish length and bottom depth. Broad-scale analyses of high resolution spatial patterns in life history traits, such as those performed here for Greenland halibut maturation, may identify recurrent patterns of association with environmental or habitat characteristics that might not otherwise be evident on a stock- or survey-specific basis.

AB  - Biodynamics is a holistic, and ecological approach in organic farming which emphasizes building up the soil. The present experiment studied effect of biodynamics enriched organic amendments on yield attributing characters and yield, leaf and soil nutrition of Khasi mandarin. The experiment comprised of eleven treatments viz. T-1: Farm yard manure (FYM), T-2: vermicompost (VC), T-3: Pig manure (PIM), T-4: Poultry manure (POM), T-5: Neem cake (NC), T-6: FYM + Cow Pat Pit (CPP) + Bio Dynamic (BD) 500 + BD 501, T-7: VC + CPP + BD 500 + BD 501, T-8: PIM + CPP + BD 500 + BD 501, T-9: POM + CPP + BD 500 + BD 501, T-10: NC + CPP + BD 500 + BD 501 and T-11: control (RDF). Results revealed that the highest increment in N-S, E-W spread (0.28 and 0.29 m), canopy volume (4.79 m(3)), leaf total N (2.43%), K (1.96%), Fe (274.97 ppm), Mn (26.84 ppm), Cu (11.08 ppm) chlorophyll a (1.52 mg/g), chrolophyll b (0.60 mg/g), total chlorophyll (2.12 mg/g), soil organic carbon (7.29 g kg(-1)), inorganic carbon (2.23 g kg(-1)), total carbon (9.52 g kg(-1)), total N (0.681 g kg(-1)), available N (643.86 kg ha(-1)), P (87.06 kg ha(-1)), K (206.34 kg ha(-1)), Fe (62.12 ppm), Mn (28.95 ppm), Cu (2.66 ppm), Zn (2.20 ppm), bacteria (53.92 x 10(4) CFU/g) and fungi (44.79 x 10(4) CFU/g) was recorded with T-7. Hence, T-7 is most effective biodynamics enriched organic amendment in leaf and soil nutrition of Khasi mandarin.

AB  - The high extinction risk of Australian marsupials has been attributed to their failure to recognise novel predators, the application of inappropriate antipredator responses, and advanced hunting strategies of novel predators. This study is a preliminary attempt to explore whether the Lumholtz' tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) (a) is able to recognise odour cues from different predators as threats, and (b) possesses predator-archetype specific antipredator responses. A small number of available captive tree-kangaroos were exposed to faecal odours from two extant predators of different archetypes (python, dingo), a regionally extinct predator which closely matches past terrestrial predators (Tasmanian devil), and a novel predator (domestic dog). Lavender oil was used as non-predator novel odour and water as control. Results suggest that all subjects associated the presented odours with a threat, albeit to different degrees, but did not display predator-archetype specific responses. It appears that this species applies an ancestral antipredator response of flight-on-the ground when encountering predators, including novel predators. Although the results need to be confirmed with more animals, further studies on the vulnerability of Australian prey to novel predators should take the ancestral history of Australian prey species into account.

AB  - Lake-effect snow (LES) storms, characterized by heavy convective precipitation downwind of large lakes, pose significant coastal hazards with severe socioeconomic consequences in vulnerable areas. In this study, we investigate how devastating LES storms could evolve in the future by employing a storyline approach, using the LES storm that occurred over Buffalo, New York, in November 2022 as an example. Using a Pseudo-Global Warming method with a fully three-dimensional two-way coupled lake-land-atmosphere modeling system at a cloud-resolving 4 km resolution, we show a 14% increase in storm precipitation under the end-century warming. This increase in precipitation is accompanied by a transition in the precipitation form from predominantly snowfall to nearly equal parts snowfall and rainfall. Through additional simulations with isolated atmospheric and lake warming, we discerned that the warmer lake contributes to increased storm precipitation through enhanced evaporation while the warmer atmosphere contributes to the increase in the storm's rainfall, at the expense of snowfall. More importantly, this shift from snowfall to rainfall was found to nearly double the area experiencing another winter hazard, Rain-on-Snow. Our study provides a plausible future storyline for the Buffalo LES storm, focusing on understanding the intricate interplay between atmospheric and lake warming in shaping the future dynamics of LES storms. It emphasizes the importance of accurately capturing the changing lake-atmosphere dynamics during LES storms under future warming.
   A lake-effect snow (LES) storm is a heavy snowfall that occurs when a cold dry air mass travels over a relatively warm lake. LES storms have been particularly known to decimate regions downwind of the North American Great Lakes with several meters of snow and millions of dollars in damages. In this study, we use a fully 3D comprehensive lake-land-atmosphere modeling system, along with the Pseudo-Global Warming technique that incorporates large-scale climate changes into our simulation, to investigate how such devastating LES storms could unfold in a warming climate. We used the LES storm that hit Buffalo, New York in November 2022 as a case study. Our results revealed that under a warmer future climate, LES storms can produce a higher precipitation amount by up to 14%. More notably, our results showed a transition in the form of storm precipitation from mostly snowfall to nearly equal parts snowfall and rainfall. The warmer lake in the future was found to be the primary reason behind the increase in precipitation through enhanced evaporation from the lake. The warmer atmosphere in the future explained why rainfall replaced snowfall in the LES storm.
   Future of lake-effect snow storms is explored using Pseudo-Global Warming with a 3D two-way coupled lake-land-atmosphere modeling system Future climate amplifies storm precipitation via higher lake evaporation and boosts rainfall at snowfall's expense via a warmer atmosphere Lake evaporation plays a critical role in storm precipitation amount and accurately resolving the future lake-atmosphere dynamics is vital

AB  - Movements of male musk deer in coniferous forests of the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve were studied in 2014-2015 to identify relationships between the home range use and environmental factors and the social environment. The methodology included multiple-day snow tracking, visual observations of musk deer individuals accustomed to humans, radiotracking, and habitat analysis. GIS technologies and mathematical data processing were used as well. The following home range usage variant was identified: the musk deer male maintains the size (1.02-1.1 km(2)) and shape of its home range for a long time by redistributing its activity within the general activity center of the home range (39% of its size). The home ranges of male musk deer neighbors overlap with the home range of the resident by 64.7-65.5%; and the activity center is overlapped by 53.5%. The amount of main forages (epiphytic lichens) in the home ranges exceeded the needs of the musk deer by 60-300 times in various periods; food is available throughout the entire study area. In such conditions, the distribution of male musk deer activities and scent marks, as well as its movement patterns, are primarily determined by the social environment, including the distribution of females and visits of male neighbors to activity cores. Contacts between males are mostly remote. The distribution of musk deer trajectoryes includes wide 'patrolling belts' and a central system that connects local activity cores. This structure is consistent both with relief forms and the boundaries of plant communities. The musk deer male spends more than 84% of the time in the activity center of its home range due to frequent visits of male neighbors. As a result, the resident male forms modules as functional elements of the structure; within these modules, the studied musk deer maintains its life activities and ensures the territorial protection of its home range in the form of a "watch," thus creating barriers against incursions of male neighbors.

AB  - Experiments were designed to investigate the effect of extrusion on the available energy and nutrient digestibility of wheat, and to further evaluate the effects of incorporating extruded wheat into the diet on growth performance, diarrhea rates, health status, and fecal microbiota of weaned piglets. In Exp. 1, twelve crossbred barrows, with an initial body weight (BW) of 12.0 +/- 0.73 kg, were randomly assigned to two treatment groups (wheat and extruded wheat) to determine the digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME). Additionally, nine crossbred barrows (initial BW, 13.73 +/- 0.59 kg) fitted with ileal cannulas, were arranged in a 9 x 2 Youden square design, including three diets (N-free diet, wheat, and extruded wheat), aiming to measure the standard ileal digestibility of amino acids (AAs). In Exp. 2, 96 pigs (initial BW, 8.58 +/- 0.52 kg) were randomly divided into two treatments (CON and 35% extruded wheat) based on BW, with each treatment having six pens, each pen containing four boars and four sows. The results indicated that extrusion significantly increased the DE and ME of wheat and the standard ileal digestibility of most AAs (p < 0.05). Incorporating 35% extruded wheat did not affect the growth performance, diarrhea rates, nutrient digestibility, or health status of the weaned piglets (p > 0.05). However, it tended to enhance the alpha-diversity of fecal microbiota (p = 0.07) and increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria (p < 0.05). In conclusion, extrusion increased the feeding value of wheat, and the inclusion of 35% extruded wheat in the diet increased the relative abundance of beneficial microbes in feces.

AB  - Monitoring is critical for conservation, to track the status of threatened species, assess the relative impacts of threats, inform management responses and prioritise them according to their efficacy. Globally, freshwater fish are impacted by a range of threats including deterioration in water quality, climate change, habitat loss and degradation, introduced predators and herbivores, and wildfire. Monitoring of freshwater fish can be challenging because aquatic conditions can make detecting and identifying population trends difficult for many species. Galaxiidae is the most speciose family of Gondwanan-distributed freshwater fishes, and over 75% of species assessed by the IUCN Red List have been classified as threatened. Many Australian galaxiids are highly imperilled and monitoring effort and adequacy is low. We prepared a detailed monitoring plan for the Stocky Galaxias (Galaxias tantangara) that is representative of the conservation status and level of threat facing many congeneric and other similar species. Our protocol provides details of species biology, pertinent threats, and management options with sampling methods to gather these data, and options to link with management actions for maximum benefit. Improved monitoring linked with threat management should improve the conservation status of Stocky Galaxias. By providing this example, we have sought to improve monitoring for range-restricted freshwater fishes more generally.

AB  - An extended hot summer is a major constraint in animal production in the semi-arid tropical region. However, the adult native sheep is well-adapted to this climatic condition. Nonetheless, the adaptability of growing lambs in summer conditions is yet to be explored for sustainable sheep production. Therefore, the present study was carried out to assess the effect of simulated summer environment on the growing lambs in hot, semi-arid regions. For this purpose, 16 Malpura weaner lambs of 3-4 months of age were selected and equally distributed into two groups, control (C) and thermal exposure (T). The lambs of T groups (n = 8) were kept inside the psychometric chamber in different temperature and humidity schedules simulated with the summer average temperature and humidity of the last 10-year of the semi-arid tropics. The lambs of C groups (n = 8) were kept inside the pen in a thermocomfort environment with the same space availability of T group lambs. The lambs of both the groups were provided with ad libitum feed and water. The general linear model procedure was applied to analyze the data. The water intake, respiration rate, pulse rate, rectal temperature, and skin temperature of T group lamb were significantly (P < 0.05) higher as compared to C group lambs. The summer exposure (T) reduced (P < 0.01) the feeding and rumination time whereas increased (P < 0.01) the panting in lambs as compared to C group. The endocrine profile did not vary (P > 0.05) with the simulated summer exposure of semi-arid region in lambs. The present study reflected that the native Malpura growing lamb modifies their behavior and thermoregulatory responses to counter the extreme summer of the semi-arid region. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To devise effective measures for reducing hazardous wildlife-vehicle collisions, it is necessary to know when during the year accidents occur most frequently, and what factors cause the seasonal patterns. Daylight Saving Time (DST) 1-h clock-shifts around the spring and fall equinoxes at temperate zone latitudes are associated with increased vehicle accidents, attributed to driver error caused by disrupted sleep patterns and changes in visibility during peak driving times. Collision with deer is a significant cause of motor vehicle accidents in North America; in New York State alone, 65,000 vehicle accidents annually are caused by collision with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We asked whether white-tailed deer-vehicle collisions (DVC) increased in frequency after DST clock shifts in New York State, by analyzing 35,167 New York State DVC reports from 2005 to 2007. For the spring, when the clock is shifted an hour forward relative to sunrise (i.e. later sunrise and sunset), there was either no change or possibly a small decrease in workweek evening DVC after the clock shift. For fall, when the clock is shifted an hour back relative to sunrise (i.e. earlier sunrise and sunset), the DVC rate was far higher than spring. The DVC rate was higher after the clock shift than before, caused in part by an ongoing seasonal trend for increasing DVC associated with deer behavior around the time of rut, peaking about two weeks after the clock shift. However, there was also a reduction in workweek morning DVC after clock-shift, but an even greater increase in DVC in the evening. DVC rates are highest around dusk and during the fall, and the fall DST clockshift caused more workweek commuter traffic to coincide with the annual hourly period of peak risk of DVC. We conclude that in New York State, DST clock-shift results in an increase in the number of DVC, and therefore injuries and property damage associated with such accidents. The justification for DST clock-shifts is controversial; when evaluating the benefits and costs, one should include the consequences for risk of wildlife-vehicle collisions, especially in regions where ungulate-vehicle accidents are frequent, and clock-shifts coincide with the rut or other periods of peak accident risk.

AB  - Understanding the genetic differentiation among populations of most marine fish requires investigating the differences among spawning grounds. However, this can be challenging as spawning grounds for some species are not well known, or spawning fish are difficult to collect. An alternative is to collect juvenile fish in nursery habitats closely associated with potential spawning grounds. Greenland halibut is a deep-dwelling, commercially important species with at least two identified major offshore spawning grounds in the North Atlantic and weak genetic differentiation across the Atlantic. In this study, we sampled juveniles from three sites representing the Davis Strait spawning area in the northwest Atlantic and one site in the northeast Atlantic representing the primary spawning area along the western slope of the Barents Sea. We applied genotype by sequencing and discovered 90 genetic markers that could be used to assess genetic differentiation among the four sites. The northeast and northwest Atlantic showed major genetic differentiation, supporting the existence of the two primary spawning clusters. Additionally, we found genetic differentiation between the three northwest Atlantic samples implying the existence of more than one spawning area in the northwest.

AB  - Large volumes of bauxite residue are generated when alumina is leached from bauxite ore, within 2-3 metric tons of bauxite residue per metric ton final aluminum. The large volumes make bauxite residue an interesting source for secondary materials, for instance iron. This paper assesses environmental impacts associated with extraction of pig iron from bauxite residue in Europe. The life cycle assessment is based on thermodynamic process simulation and compares pig iron from bauxite residue with conventional pig iron production. The results indicate that the iron extraction reduces impacts on mineral scarcity and offers an overall lower waste volume. However, it also increases the energy use and thereby the life cycle impacts associated with energy production. The bauxite residue process is operated in an electric arc furnace. Decarbonizing the electricity supply, or placing the process in primarily renewable electricity markets, changes the relative competitiveness of pig iron from bauxite residue, to a level where it offers lower endpoint impacts to ecosystems, human health, and resources, as well as improvements in policy-relevant midpoint impacts such as climate change. Comparing several bauxite residue mineralogies, the results show significant variation in the environmental performance between typical bauxite residues, yet a larger difference is observed when comparing with conventional pig iron production than among the bauxite residues.

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify factors more commonly observed on farms with poor livestock welfare compared to farms with good welfare. Potentially, these factors may be used to develop an animal welfare risk assessment tool (AWRAT) that could be used to identify livestock at risk of poor welfare. Identifying livestock at risk of poor welfare would facilitate early intervention and improve strategies to promptly resolve welfare issues. This study focuses on cattle, sheep and goats in non-dairy extensive farming systems in Australia. To assist with identifying potential risk factors, a survey was developed presenting 99 factors about the farm, farmers, animals and various aspects of management. Based on their experience, key stakeholders, including veterinarians, stock agents, consultants, extension and animal welfare officers were asked to consider a farm where the welfare of the livestock was either high or low and rate the likelihood of observing these factors. Of the 141 responses, 65% were for farms with low welfare. Only 6% of factors had ratings that were not significantly different between high and low welfare surveys, and these were not considered further. Factors from poor welfare surveys with median ratings in the lowest 25% were considered potential risks (n = 49). Considering correlation, ease of verification and the different livestock farming systems in Australia, 18 risk factors relating to farm infrastructure, nutrition, treatment and husbandry were selected. The AWRAT requires validation in future studies.

AB  - The semen of boar is characterized by ejaculation in well-differentiated fractions with specific concentration, composition, and volume. The 'sperm-rich fraction' (SRF), the most concentrated seminal fraction, is habitually collected in insemination centers to make artificial insemination (AI) doses. The absence of the other fractions in AI doses could alter the uterine reaction to AI and not trigger essential responses that could maximize fertility. Thus, there is an urge to ascertain the impact of different ejaculate fractions on the uterus after AI to optimize the semen doses. This work analyzed specific parameters related to fertility in pregnant artificially inseminated sows (n = 15) with ac-cumulative fractions of the semen of boars (n = 6): F1, composed of the sperm-rich fraction (SRF); F2, composed of F1 plus the intermediate fraction; F3, composed of F2 plus the post-SRF. Non-inseminated sows (n = 5) were included as control (C). The different types of seminal dose did not affect the number of ovulated follicles (CL; corpora lutea, p > 0.05) but did affect the embryo development (p < 0.05). The proportion of embryos in morula stages was significantly higher in AI-F1 sows (84.4%, p < 0.05). Morulas and blastocysts were balanced in AI-F2 or AI-F3 (p > 0.05). Independently of the type of seminal dose (F1, F2, or F3), we observed by immunohistochemistry that AI significantly increased uterine vascularization, although with some anatomical differences. The cranial region of the uterine horns was significantly more vascularized in AI-F1 or AI-F2 sows (26.7 +/- 2.3 and 28.6 +/- 2.0%, respectively), and AI-F3 showed significantly less vascularization at that point (17.8 +/- 1.6%, p < 0.05). To summarize, the synergistic effect of all ejaculate fractions accelerates embryo development, at least during the preimplantation period, and increases the uterine reaction to AI in certain parts of the uterus.

AB  - Purpose The environmental and economic impacts of livestock production systems are typically assessed using global characterisation factors and data, even though several impact categories call for site-specific assessments. Here, we account for spatial variability by addressing potential interactions between geographic locality and the cost-effectiveness of farm investments that aim to reduce system environmental impact, using Danish pig production as a case-in-point. Methods An LCA-based, spatially explicit environmental abatement cost framework was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of potential environmental abatement strategies. The framework was tested for Danish pig production in a "4 manure management x 4 geographic location" scenario analysis design. In addition to the baseline, the alternative manure management strategies were on-farm anaerobic digestion, slurry acidification and screw press slurry separation, implemented in an integrated pig farming system. The geographic locations differed in their proximity to Natura 2000 areas and in pig farming density. Eight different impact categories were assessed through an LCA using spatially explicit characterisation factors whenever possible, and annualised abatement potential was estimated for each manure management scenario and in each geographic location. We also estimated the financial performance for each scenario, through a discounted cash flow analysis at a whole-farm level. Results and discussion We observed significant interactions between geographic location and system environmental and economic performance under baseline conditions. Significant location effects were also observed for the cost-effectiveness of all manure management strategies tested. Anaerobic digestion was the only "win-win" strategy that increased farm profits while reducing system environmental impact in two of the geographic cases: when implemented in a region of high pig farming density located near Natura 2000 and when implemented in a region of high pig farming density located far from Natura 2000 areas. Slurry acidification and slurry separation achieved sizeable abatement potential for impacts on ecosystem quality but incurred large additional costs in all geographic case studies considered, particularly when arable land was limited near the pig farm. Conclusions Accounting for basic spatial characteristics within an environmental abatement cost framework had significant impact on the cost-effectiveness of on-farm investments for mitigation of system environmental impact. To the best of our knowledge, no studies to date have utilised such spatial characteristics within environmental abatement cost modelling of livestock farming systems. The presented framework has the potential to be further expanded using more detailed spatial, economic and geophysical data, which could ultimately improve decision-making regarding cost-effective investments that aim to improve the sustainability of livestock farming operations.

AB  - Drone developments, especially small-sized drones, usher in novel trends and possibilities in various domains. Drones offer navigational inter-location services with the involvement of the Internet of Things (IoT). On the other hand, drone networks are highly prone to privacy and security risks owing to their strategy flaws. In order to achieve the desired efficiency, it is essential to create a secure network. The purpose of the current study is to have an overview of the privacy and security problems that recently impacted the Internet of Drones (IoD). An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an effective approach to determine the presence of intrusions in the IoD environment. The current study focuses on the design of Crystal Structure Optimization with Deep-Autoencoder-based Intrusion Detection (CSODAE-ID) for a secure IoD environment. The aim of the presented CSODAE-ID model is to identify the occurrences of intrusions in IoD environment. In the proposed CSODAE-ID model, a new Modified Deer Hunting Optimization-based Feature Selection (MDHO-FS) technique is applied to choose the feature subsets. At the same time, the Autoencoder (AE) method is employed for the classification of intrusions in the IoD environment. The CSO algorithm, inspired by the formation of crystal structures based on the lattice points, is employed at last for the hyperparameter-tuning process. To validate the enhanced performance of the proposed CSODAE-ID model, multiple simulation analyses were performed and the outcomes were assessed under distinct aspects. The comparative study outcomes demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CSODAE-ID model over the existing techniques.

Previous studies suggest that silicon (Si) is a highly inducible defence in grasses (Poaceae) following herbivory, so could mediate such temporally separated insect herbivore interactions. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO(2)), in contrast, often reduce Si accumulation, which potentially weakens this interaction. We examined the effects of prior feeding by Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on the performance of crickets, Acheta domesticus (L.) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), subsequently feeding on the same plant. We used Brachypodium distachyon (L.) P. Beauv. grass supplemented or non-supplemented with Si and grown in the glasshouse maintained at ambient (aCO(2)) or eCO(2) concentrations. As hypothesized, prior feeding by caterpillars induced Si accumulation. Despite eCO(2) reducing Si accumulation, initial herbivore induction of Si negated the effects of eCO(2). Both, previous caterpillar herbivory and Si supplementation reduced cricket performance. Si induction by successive herbivory was additive. Plant biomass was similar in plants attacked by caterpillars alone or both herbivores, suggesting that initial Si induction by caterpillars deterred feeding by crickets. Our results demonstrate that Si induction by one herbivore negatively impacts successive herbivores, as has been demonstrated for secondary metabolite-mediated interactions. Uniquely, however, Si induction is an irreversible defence and potentially a stronger, or perhaps longer-lasting mediator of such herbivore interactions in some plant taxa.

AB  - Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5A), also called mammary gland factor (MGF), is a key mediator of signal transduction within mammary gland and uterine epithelial cells. It is a member of placental lactogen (PL) and interferon-tau (IFN-tau) signal pathway. It is also the main mediator of growth hormone. When cells encounter growth hormones and cytokines, STAT5A is activated to regulate gene transcription. STA5A has an important role in fertilization, embryonic survival and milk production traits in farm animals. The genomic characterization of STAT5A gene has not been assessed before in Nili Ravi Buffalo. In present research work, the sequence of the bovine STAT5A gene was analyzed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms and its effect on evolutionary divergence. Nine polymorphisms, six in intronic and three in exonic regions, were identified in STAT5A gene. One exonic polymorphism G -> A, in exon 5, was significant that causes a non-synonymous amino acid change from Serine (S) to Asparagine (N). Further, 64 genetic variants were also identified in STAT5A gene and these variants were due to cattle and buffalo differences. Phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary divergence were also estimated. The sequence was submitted to GenBank (NCBI) with accession number MN712202. Our results represent a preliminary step towards the identification of polymorphisms in STAT5A gene of Nili Ravi Buffalo. Further studies are required for the association of genetic polymorphisms of STAT5A gene with fertility related traits.

AB  - White storks (Ciconia ciconia), an emblematic bird of high conservation interest, build massive nests which are also important breeding sites for other birds. However, their role as a potential source of food for foraging birds and bats is unexplored. In this study, we counted insectivorous aerially foraging birds (swallows, martins, and swifts), sparrows, and bats foraging around 51 pairs of white storks' nest and control sites in Poland. The number of birds was significantly higher near active white stork nests than control sites, but this effect was invisible for bats. White storks provide important benefits to the conservation of co-occurring species.

AB  - Plants have to allocate their resources in both growth and defense under different environmental challenges. Several plant species have become invasive particularly in disturbed fertile habitats, which may influence their resource allocation. We studied the effects of nitrate fertilization (low versus high) on various plant responses towards a pathogenic fungus, Alternaria brassicae, and a herbivorous insect species, Mamestra brassicae, in a population of Bunias orientalis, which is invasive in parts of central Europe. Aboveground biomass and leaf trichome density were enhanced in plants under high fertilization. In contrast, the short-term fungal infection and herbivory had no effect on aboveground biomass. Leaf water, nitrogen content and glucosinolate concentrations were neither affected by fertilization nor in response to antagonist attack. The total soluble sugar content, especially fructose, as well as leaf peroxidase activity increased significantly in leaves upon fungal infection, but independent of fertilization. Larval biomass gain and herbivore survival were likewise unaffected by fertilization. Our findings highlight that under conditions of high fertilization, B. orientalis plants allocate more resources into growth and morphological defenses than chemical defenses. In contrast, induced responses to short-term antagonist attack seem independent of nitrate availability in this population.

AB  - Inoculation is widely used in composting to improve the mineralization process, however, the link of fungal inoculant to humification is rarely proposed. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of compound fungal inoculation on humification process and fungal community dynamics in corn straw composting with two different kinds of nitrogen sources [pig manure (PM) and urea (UR)]. Structural equation modeling and random forest analysis were conducted to identify key fungi and explore the fungi-mediated humification mechanism. Results showed that fungal inoculation increased the content of humic acids in PM and UR by 71.76 % and 53.01 % compared to control, respectively. High-throughput sequencing indicated that there were more key fungal genera for lignin degradation in PM especially in the later stage of composting, but a more complex fungal (genera) connections with lower humification degree was found in UR. Network analysis and random forest suggested that inoculation promoted dominant genus such as Coprinus , affecting lignocellulose degradation. Structural equation modeling indicated that fungal inoculation could promote humification by direct pathway based on lignin degradation and indirect pathway based on stimulating the indigenous microbes such as Scedosporiu and Coprinus for the accumulation of carboxyl and polyphenol hydroxyl groups. In summary, fungal inoculation is suitable to be used combining with complex nitrogen source such as pig manure in straw composting.

AB  - The implementation of phytoremediation strategies under arid and semiarid climates requires the use of appropriate plant species capable of withstanding multiple abiotic stresses. In this study, we assessed the combined effects of organo-mineral amendments and microbial inoculants on the chemical and biological properties of mine tailings, as well as on the growth of native plant species under drought stress conditions. Plants were cultivated in pots containing 1 kg of a mixture of mine tailings and topsoil (i.e., pre-mined superficial soil) in a 60:40 ratio, 6% marble sludge, and 10% sheep manure. Moreover, a consortium of four drought-resistant plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) was inoculated. Three irrigation levels were applied: well-watered, moderate water deficit, and severe water deficit, corresponding to 80%, 45%, and 30% of field capacity, respectively. The addition of topsoil and organo-mineral amendments to mine tailings significantly improved their chemical and biological properties, which were further enhanced by bacterial inoculation and plants' establishment. Water stress negatively impacted enzymatic activities in amended tailings, resulting in a significant decrease in acid and alkaline phosphatases, urease, and dehydrogenase activities. Similar results were obtained for bacteria, fungi, and actinomycete abundance. PGPR inoculation positively influenced the availability of phosphorus, total nitrogen, and organic carbon, while it increased alkaline phosphatase, urease (by about 10%), and dehydrogenase activity (by 50%). The rhizosphere of Peganum harmala showed the highest enzymatic activity and number of culturable microorganisms, especially in inoculated treatments. Severe water deficit negatively affected plant growth, leading to a 40% reduction in the shoot biomass of both Atriplex halimus and Pennisetum setaceum compared to well-watered plants. P. harmala showed greater tolerance to water stress, evidenced by lower decreases observed in root and shoot length and dry weight compared to well-watered plants. The use of bioinoculants mitigated the negative effects of drought on P. harmala shoot biomass, resulting in an increase of up to 75% in the aerial biomass in plants exposed to severe water deficit. In conclusion, the results suggest that the combination of organo-mineral amendments, PGPR inoculation, and P. harmala represents a promising approach to enhance the phytoremediation of metal-polluted soils under semiarid conditions.

AB  - Marine fisheries are often allocated to stocks that reflect pragmatic considerations and may not represent the species' spatial population structure, increasing the risk of mismanagement and unsustainable harvesting. Here we compile mark-recapture data collected across the North Atlantic to gain insight into the spatial population structure of Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), an issue that has been unresolved for decades. The dataset contains 168130 fish tagged from 1952 to 2021, with 5466 (3.3%) recaptured individuals. Our results indicate that fish tagged at <50 cm body length migrate at higher rates, suggesting that mark-recapture studies on adult individuals underestimate population-level migration rates. We find evidence for migrations across management units in the North Atlantic indicating two regional offshore populations: one in the Northeast Atlantic, where the West Nordic and Northeast Arctic stocks, currently managed separately, likely belong to a single population that spans from the Kara Sea to Southeast Greenland; and one in the Northwest Atlantic where migration was observed between the Newfoundland and Labrador stock and the Northwest Arctic stock in Davis Strait and Baffin Bay. Our findings indicate complex population structure with implications for international and domestic fisheries management of this long-lived species.

AB  - Migratory animals can bring parasites into resident animal (i.e., non-migratory) home ranges (transport effects) and exert trophic effects that either promote or reduce parasite exposure to resident hosts. Here, we examine the importance of these transport and trophic effects and their interactions for resident parasite dynamics. We propose that migrant transport and trophic effects are impacted by the number of migratory animals entering a resident's home range (migration intensity), the amount of time that migrants spend within a resident's home range (migration duration), and the timing of migrant-resident interactions. We then incorporate migration intensity, duration, and timing into a framework for exploring the net impact of migrant trophic and transport effects on resident animal parasite prevalence.

However, progressive motility is usually not considered during IVEP. The aim of this study was to assess fertilization with a 500:1 and 250:1 'progressively motile sperm to oocyte' ratio on IVEP outcomes using semen from three Duroc and three Landrace boars. Frozen-thawed sperm was centrifuged through a 45/90% Percoll (R) density gradient and sperm quality parameters were assessed. In vitro matured oocytes were fertilized at the two ratios, a portion was stained 10-12 h after start of fertilization to analyze fertilization and polyspermy, while the remaining zygotes were cultured up to day 7. The 500:1 ratio resulted in a higher fertilization and blastocyst yield on day 6 compared with the 250:1 ratio, but no effect of ratio was observed for polyspermy, cleavage rate or blastocyst cell number. Individual differences between boars were observed for fertilization, cleavage and blastocyst rates, but not for the other IVEP outcomes. In conclusion, a higher fertilization and blastocyst yield was obtained with the 500:1 ratio compared with the 250:1 ratio, while polyspermy level was consistent across ratios. Differences in IVEP outcomes were still observed between the individual boars although adjusted for progressive motility. Promising blastocyst yields and high total blastocyst cell counts were obtained with sperm from both breeds.

AB  - In recent years, enormous amounts of spent mushroom substrate (SMS) have been generated because of the rapid development of mushroom production. Since the conventional disposal methods of these residues can cause serious environmental problems, alternative waste management techniques are required to ensure sustainable agriculture. However, SMS might be not suitable for vermicomposting when used alone. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Azolla microphylla (Azolla) biomass, eggshells, fruit peels, and cassava pulp on the biodegradation process of SMS. The results showed the treatments supplemented with cassava pulp and fruit peel waste improved the growth of earthworms, while the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of these vermicomposts decreased significantly (p < 0.05) due to the improved total nitrogen contents (7.64 g kg(-1) and 6.71 g kg(-1)). Concerning the degradation process and the vermicompost quality, the addition of these agro-residues facilitated the enzyme activities (cellulase, urease, and alkaline phosphatase) and increased the total macronutrient (P, K, Mg, and Ca) and phytohormone (fruit peel waste: AA, GA3, and cytokinin; cassava pulp: cytokinin) contents of the final products compared to the control treatment. On the other hand, Azolla had no additional effect on the fecundity and growth of Eudrilus eugenia. Meanwhile, the treatment supplemented with eggshells was high in Mg (7.15 g kg(-1)) and Ca (305.6 g kg(-1)). Overall, the combined decomposition of SMS-based bedding material with Azolla, eggshells, fruit peel waste, and cassava pulp resulted in mature organic fertilizers with improved chemical properties.

AB  - Black Box (Eucalyptus largiflorens F. Muell) is a dominant floodplain tree across the Murray-Darling Basin. At Hattah-Kulkyne National Park (northwest Victoria), historical changes in the hydrological regime and land use have degraded Black Box populations, with the majority of trees in poor health and with limited recruitment. To mitigate this threat, environmental watering has been implemented to improve condition, but successful regeneration has been limited. A 17-month trial (April 2021 to September 2022) was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of different management techniques in promoting Black Box regeneration (natural regeneration, seed-scattering, tube stock and browsing control: guarded and unguarded tube stock). At the end of the trial, only four of the initial 63 seedlings remained alive (two guarded tube stock and two natural regeneration). Most seedling death was attributed to browsing (likely kangaroos), which was evident in the first three months, with unguarded plants heavily impacted. No germinants were recorded in the seed-scattering plots. Our findings of high browsing impacts on Black Box seedling survival, corroborates existing data on browsers (abundance levels and management thresholds) and emphasises the importance of incorporating herbivore browsing management in floodplain vegetation management strategies that aim to promote regeneration within Hattah-Kulkyne National Park.

AB  - The long exposure to heat negatively changes performance and productivity of animals, particularly when heat stress is associated with gestation. Indeed, little is known about the negative effects of long-term heat stress on the final gestation of dairy goats. In this context, the physiological and cellular responses of Saanen goats submitted to heat stress (37 degrees C from 10:00 to 16:00 h) were investigated from day 60th pre-partum to day 60th post-partum. At final gestation, 46 pregnant Saanen goats were randomly assigned to the treatments: control (CT; thermal neutral conditions) and heat stress (HS; climatic chamber). After partum, all experimental goats were maintained in thermal neutral conditions. The rectal, dorsal, mammary temperatures and respiratory frequency, cortisol release, milk yield, milk quality, and the genes HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, Glucocorticoid receptor and ACTHR. Goats subjected to HS showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher rectal, dorsal, and mammary temperatures and significantly mobilized the increase of respiratory frequency to lose heat as compared to CT goats. The HS challenge significantly increased cortisol release from day 15th pre-partum to day 15th post-partum. CT goats produced more milk than HS from weeks 4 to 10 of lactation (P <0.001), with no difference in milk quality. However, on day 15th post-partum, there was a significant effect of HS treatment on the expression of HSP70 and ACTHR genes as compared to CT treatment, confirming the long-term effect of HS on Saanen goats. In conclusion, the physiological parameters studied increased pre-partum in the hottest hour, and cortisol peaked on day 15 pre-partum for heat-stressed goats. Although on the 15th day post-partum, all goats were in thermal comfort, and the physiological parameters were within the normal range, the concentration of cortisol continued to be significantly higher for goats submitted to thermal stress. Indeed, milk yield was greater for goats subjected to pre-partum thermal comfort. Furthermore, the expression of HSP70 and ACTHR genes on peripheral blood mononuclear cells are interesting biomarkers for studying the long-term effect of heat stress on Saanen goats.

AB  - Conservation of large carnivore populations requires effective management strategies that promote landscape-scale protection and genetic connectivity. Pivotal to the success of these strategies is sufficient evidence, including quantifying the processes that govern species distribution. We used telemetry data from 63 lions from the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA) in southern Africa to analyze inter-demographic differences in habitat relationships using a mixed-effects resource selection analysis approach. In this semi-arid landscape, some of the most important drivers of habitat selection are surface water and precipitation, which in turn regulate prey abundance. Predicted relative probability of habitat selection was highest near water irrespective of age and sex; however, the effect of precipitation varied depending on the demographic class. Adult lions and subadult females preferred habitat with above average rainfall; however, the opposite was true for subadult males which showed a strong aversion to precipitation. Across all four demographic classes, relative probability of habitat selection was generally positively associated with higher levels of prey abundance with the exception of gemsbok which was negatively correlated with adult female, subadult male, and subadult female habitat use. The predicted distributions for all four demographic classes were widespread across multiple different land-use types, highlighting the need to extend the traditional concept of formally protected areas to include multi-use landscapes and support large-scale transboundary conservation initiatives.

AB  - Background and Aims Changes in kelp abundances on regional scales have been highly variable over the past half-century owing to strong effects of local and regional drivers. Here, we assess patterns and dominant environmental variables causing spatial and interspecific variability in kelp persistence and resilience to change in Nova Scotia over the past 40 years.Methods We conducted a survey of macrophyte abundance at 251 sites spanning the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia from 2019 to 2022. We use this dataset to describe spatial variability in kelp species abundances, compare species occurrences to surveys conducted in 1982 and assess changes in kelp abundance over the past 22 years. We then relate spatial and temporal patterns in abundance and resilience to environmental metrics.Key Results Our results show losses of sea urchins and the cold-tolerant kelp species Alaria esculenta, Saccorhiza dermatodea and Agarum clathratum in Nova Scotia since 1982 in favour of the more warm-tolerant kelps Saccharina latissima and Laminaria digitata. Kelp abundances have increased slightly since 2000, and Saccharina latissima and L. digitata are widely abundant in the region today. The highest kelp cover occurs on wave-exposed shores and at sites where temperatures have remained below thresholds for growth (21 degrees C) and mortality (23 degrees C). Moreover, kelp has recovered from turf dominance following losses at some sites during a warm period from 2010 to 2012.Conclusions Our results indicate that dramatic changes in kelp community composition and a loss of sea urchin herbivory as a dominant driver of change in the system have occurred in Nova Scotia over the past 40 years. However, a broad-scale shift to turf-dominance has not occurred, as predicted, and our results suggest that resilience and persistence are still a feature of kelp forests in the region despite rapid warming over the past several decades.

AB  - Local breeds represent a precious reservoir of genetic diversity, crucial to adapting to environmental and climate changes and reacting to evolving diseases. In Sicily, four native dairy breeds, namely Valle del Belice, Comisana, Barbaresca, and Pinzirita, have adapted to low-input farming systems and semiarid environments, having an essential role in producing high-quality milk and typical dairy products. Maedi-visna (MV) is one of the most important chronic diseases affecting the sheep sector worldwide, causing production losses. Different target genes play an important role in immunity and in genetic resilience to MV, such as TMEM154, TLR9, MYD88, and CCR5. A major host genetic component to sheep MV susceptibility was identified in the ovine TMEM154 gene. Animals with either of TMEM154 haplotypes that encode glutamate at position 35 (E35) of the protein are at higher risk of MV infection than those homozygous with lysine at position 35 (K35). In the tested Sicilian breeds, animals carrying the allele E35 showed a greater risk of being serologically positive. Comisana, Barbaresca, and Pinzirita breeds showed a good frequency of the protective allele K35, whilst a high frequency of risk allele was found in the Valle del Belice breed, related to the selection strategies addressed to obtain a productive dairy sheep. Our results highlight the importance of the preservation of autochthonous breeds as a reservoir of natural resistance against infectious disease.
   Maedi-visna (MV) is a disease caused by small ruminant lentiviruses. It is included in the list of notifiable terrestrial animal diseases due to economic losses and animal welfare harm in the sheep sector. To date, control programs remain the onliest approach to avoiding infection. The allelic variant p.Glu35Lys (E35K) of the TMEM154 gene has been strongly associated with host vulnerability to MV illness. The present study aimed to investigate the association of TMEM154 E35K allele frequencies with MV susceptibility in native Sicilian sheep breeds. More than 400 animals from 14 local sheep were serologically tested and genotyped for the TMEM154 E35K polymorphism. The local breeds displayed different values of MV seroprevalence, with the lowest antibody prevalence in Barbaresca and Pinzirita breeds. TMEM154 protective allele (K35) was less frequent than the risk allele (E35) in Valle del Belice breed, whereas the other three breeds showed a more balanced alleles distribution. A positive association between seroprevalence and genotype was found in the entire sample set. The risk of infection resulted in more than 3-fold times as high in sheep with EK and EE genotype compared to the KK genotype. Our data could be helpful in establishing selection breeding programs aimed at reducing MV infection in Sicilian sheep farming and encouraging the breeding of native breeds.

AB  - Mycorrhiza is a symbiotic association between the roots of plants with fungi. Among the various types of mycorrhizal fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are the most prominent as they are obligate symbionts with a wide host range, and they play a major role in shaping ecosystems and associated productivity. Approximately 71% of vascular plant species are able to form symbiotic association with AMF. AMF primarily rely on the host for photosynthates but give much more in return for the well-being of the host plant. Most importantly they are able to improve tolerance of host plants against various biotic stresses, such as-bacterial, fungal, viral, nematode phytopathogens and herbivores. The underlying mechanism includes-competition for nutrients, space, and host photosynthates, rhizosphere alteration and host defense induction. The effectiveness of an AM association in conferring biotic stress tolerance is context dependent, affected by various biotic and abiotic factors. This review describes various mechanisms involved in AMF mediated biotic stress tolerance in plant and the biotic and abiotic factors which influences the performance of AM association.

AB  - Pollen analysis is increasingly being used to investigate the landscape context of the end of Roman Britain, and specifically the extent to which there was continuity or change in land use and farming practices. Approaches vary from the use of single off-site pollen sequences to the assessment of databases of large numbers of sites, but all are faced with the necessity of considering key interpretative issues such as pollen source areas and chronological precision. This paper presents an overview and critique of pollen-based approaches to the question of post-Roman landscape continuity and change, highlighting the need for caution in site selection, inter-site comparison, and in extrapolation to the landscape scale. Consideration is given to what is meant by continuity in palaeoenvironmental terms, based on ecological studies of vegetation responses to grazing exclusion and land abandonment. The implications of these studies for future approaches to detection of post-Roman landscape continuity and change in palaeoenvironmental sequences are discussed.

AB  - Particle-size classes (7 fractions from 0.8 to 2000 mu m) were collected in the deep chlorophyll maximum along a Mediterranean transect including the northern coastal zone (bays of Toulon and Marseilles, France), the offshore zone (near the North Balearic Thermal Front), and the southern coastal zone (Gulf of Gabe`s, Tunisia). Con-centrations of biotic metals and metalloids (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Sb, V, Zn) bound to living or dead or-ganisms and faecal pellets were assessed by phosphorus normalisation. Biotic metals and metalloids concentrations (except Cr, Mn, and V) were higher in the offshore zone than in the coastal zones. In addition, biotic Sb and V concentrations appeared to be affected by atmospheric deposition, and biotic Cr concentrations appeared to be affected by local anthropogenic inputs. Essential elements (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, V, Zn) were very likely controlled both by the metabolic activity of certain organisms (nanoeukaryotes, copepods) and trophic structure. In the northern coastal zone, biomagnification of essential elements was controlled by copepods ac-tivities. In the offshore zone, metals and metalloids were not biomagnified probably due to homeostasis regu-latory processes in organisms. In the southern coastal zone, biomagnification of As, Cu, Cr, Sb could probably induce specific effects within the planktonic network.

AB  - Population-level shifts in reproductive phenology in response to environmental change are common, but whether individual-level responses are modified by demographic and genetic factors remains less well understood. We used mixed models to quantify how reproductive timing varied across 1772 female southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) breeding at Marion Island in the Southern Ocean (1989-2019), and to identify the factors that correlate with phenological shifts within and between individuals. We found strong support for covariation in the timing of breeding arrival dates and the timing of the preceding moult. Breeding arrival dates were more repeatable at the individual level, as compared with the population level, even after accounting for individual traits (wean date as a pup, age and breeding experience) associated with phenological variability. Mother-daughter similarities in breeding phenology were also evident, indicating that additive genetic effects may contribute to between-individual variation in breeding phenology. Over 30 years, elephant seal phenology did not change towards earlier or later dates, and we found no correlation between annual fluctuations in phenology and indices of environmental variation. Our results show how maternal genetic (or non-genetic) effects, individual traits and linkages between cyclical life-history events can drive within- and between-individual variation in reproductive phenology.

AB  - This study tested the utility of a rope bridge across a road that traversed restored rainforest habitat (5-8 years old) to assess the use of these new habitats by arboreal mammals. Camera-trapping revealed common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), green ringtail possums (Pseudochirops archeri) and Herbert River ringtail possums (Pseudochirulus herbertensis) used the rope bridge regularly while striped possums (Dactylopsila trivirgata), fawn-footed melomys (Melomys cervinipes), long-tailed pygmy-possums (Cercartetus caudatus) and Lumholtz's tree-kangaroos (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) were recorded at the bridge accesses, but no crossings could be proven. No Lemuroid ringtail possums (Hemibelideus lemuroides) were recorded near the rope bridge. Differences in the use of the restored rainforest habitat and the crossing structure are likely to be caused by differences in the species' reliance on features in mature forests, and their responses to rainforest edges. The results support the utility of canopy crossing structures to facilitate the use of restored habitat by arboreal mammals.

AB  - In humans, hepatitis E virus (HEV) is responsible for an acute enterically transmitted hepatitis, which can become chronic in immune-compromised patients. Genotypes 3 and 4 (HEV-3 and HEV-4) are zoonotic, and domestic pigs and wild boar are the main reservoirs. The occurrence of autochthonous cases in Europe, which have been increasing over the last 10 years, has been associated with food-borne zoonotic transmission of HEV-3, mainly linked to consumption of undercooked or raw pork products (sausages containing liver) and wild boar meat. Zoonotic HEV-3 strains are widespread on pig farms, but little information is available on the dynamic of HEV-3 infection within farms, among pigs. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of the infection among pigs of different ages along the production chain by the zoonotic HEVs, and to evaluate how long the virus may persist in the farm environment. The presence of HEV-RNA was investigated by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in 281 test faecal pools over 19 months (2017-2019) on a two-site farrow-to-finish farm (about 1,000 sows), in Northern Italy. A total of 67/281 test faecal pools (23.8%) resulted positive for the presence of HEV-RNA (site 1: 59/221, 26.7%; site 2: 8/60, 13.3%). Nucleotide sequencing revealed a unique HEV-3 viral variant circulating during 19 months of surveillance. The same HEV-3 strain was detected in the same farm on 2012, indicating the persistence of the same virus over 7 years, and highlighting the role of the environment as a continuous source of infection on pig farms. The results confirmed the circulation of the zoonotic genotype HEV-3 in pigs before slaughtering.

AB  - As the global climate changes, high temperatures will cause heat stress, which significantly affects the productive efficiency of livestock. Currently, there is a lack of efficient methods to use in targeting this issue. In this study, we report that melatonin supplementation may represent an alternative method to reduce the negative impact of heat stress on livestock, particularly in Hainan black goats. Our results show that melatonin treatment increased the average daily gain of Hainan black goats that were exposed to constantly high temperatures for two months compared to controls. Our mechanistic exploration revealed that melatonin treatment not only reduced the oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction caused by heat stress but also improved goats' metabolic capacity, promoting their growth and development. More importantly, for the first time, we observed that melatonin treatment modified the abundance of the intestinal microflora, altering the metabolism of the goats, which further improved their tolerance to constant heat stress.

AB  - The resource-availability hypothesis (RAH) and the intraspecific RAH (RAH(intra)), posit that resources, (i.e. nutrients) control plant antiherbivore defenses. Both hypotheses predict that in low-resource environments, plant growth is slow, and constitutive defense is high. In high-resource environments, however, the RAH predicts that plant growth is fast, and constitutive defense is low, whereas the RAH(intra) predicts that increased resources attract more herbivores, and this intensified grazing pressure leads to high constitutive defense. Salt marshes are nutrient-limited ecosystems threatened by eutrophication and chronic herbivory, yet we know little about how these stressors shape saltmarsh plant antiherbivore defenses, which influence trophic interactions and ecosystem resilience. We manipulated resource availability via nutrient addition and herbivory via the marsh periwinkle Littoraria irrorata, on the saltmarsh foundation species Spartina alterniflora, in mesocosms. Because plant age can also influence trait variation, we measured traits in both original and clonally-grown new stems. Feeding assays then evaluated how treatments and plant age affected subsequent Littoraria consumption of Spartina. Nutrient addition stimulated growth, while decreasing defensive traits (e.g. fiber and silica content), following the RAH. Herbivory enhanced belowground production and increased stem diameter, yet did not induce defensive traits, contrary to our expectations. Herbivory plus nutrients increased Spartina biomass and reduced phenolics, a defensive trait, further supporting the RAH. Regardless of treatment, clonally-grown new stems had greater variation in measured traits. Despite altered traits, however, treatments and plant age did not affect Littoraria consumption. Our results support the RAH and part of the RAH(intra) and suggest: 1) nutrient availability is a primary driver of plant trait change and 2) plant age controls the magnitude of trait variation in Spartina. Further, our findings indicate that eutrophic conditions may not always increase top-down control by herbivores, and in some instances can enhance saltmarsh resilience against sea-level rise via stimulated Spartina biomass production.

AB  - Reducing dependency on dietary fish meal (FM) and fish oil (FO) is extremely important for the sustainable development of the aquaculture industry. However, the metabolic consequences and mechanisms underlying the replacement of dietary FM and FO by terrestrial proteins (TPs) and lipids remain unclear. To reveal the effects of replacing dietary FM and/or FO on the metabolic changes, the integrated analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics were employed to evaluate the changes in metabolites and genes of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) feeding different experimental diets. Four diets were formulated for the 84-day duration of the experiment: control group (FMFO), FM and vegetable oil (FMVO), terrestrial protein and FO (TPFO), and terrestrial protein and vegetable oil (TPVO). Integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed the significant difference in the metabolic pathways of O. mykiss among the three replacement schemes, i.e., single replacement of dietary FM by TP, single replacement of dietary FO by VO, and combined replacement of FM by TP and FO by VO. The combined replacement of FM and FO by TP and VO, respectively, disturbed immune function, energy metabolism, cellular protein biosynthesis capacity, and lipid metabolism of O. mykiss. The reduction of antioxidant capacity was only observed in individuals feeding diets with replacement of FM by TP. Furthermore, as soon as the dietary FM and/or FO were reduced, cellular protein biosynthesis ability was suppressed and accompanied by higher energy consumption in response to fluctuations of dietary quality, resulting in reduced growth performance. Interestingly, adenylosuccinate and adenosine monophosphate involved in purine metabolism were induced by both individual and combined replacement of FM and FO by TPs and lipids, respectively. It suggested that these two metabolites might be potential biomarkers for O. mykiss fed diets with reduction of FM and/or FO. This study constitutes a new understanding of the molecular and metabolic mechanisms of O. mykiss in response to the replacement of dietary FM and/or FO by TP and/or VO, respectively, and built a theoretical basis for further improvement of aquafeed formulation and sustainable development of aquaculture.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of species on added lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) content in cow, buffalo, and goat milk and their distribution in fat, casein, and whey fractions. In addition, the oxidative stability of the milk was evaluated. Most of the Pb and Cd were recovered in the skimmed milk (96.74 and 94.21%, respectively). The distribution of Cd and Pb in casein and whey fractions, obtained by enzymatic coagulation, highlighted that they were mainly associated with casein (on average 94.77 and 90.54% of Pb and Cd, respectively). The species significantly affected the distribution of Cd and Pb in the casein and fat fractions (p < 0.01). In particular, Cd and Pb levels in fat fraction were the highest in the buffalo milk, whereas casein fraction was the highest in bovine milk. Furthermore, the presence of metals negatively influenced the oxidative stability of the milk and the species influenced its response. The results showed that in the presence of Cd and Pb, bovine milk increased the content of Malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and dithyrosines compared to other species. In addition, there was a significant decrease in the thiol content, highlighting a reduction in the antioxidant capacity of the contaminated milk.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the effects of the dietary inclusion of different proportions of whole-plant corn silage on growth performance, serum biochemical indexes, and intestinal microorganisms in Hezuo pigs. Thirty-two two-month-old Hezuo pigs (body weight: 7.88 +/- 0.81 kg) were randomly divided into four groups of eight pigs (half male, half female) each. The control (CON) group received a basal diet, while the three experimental groups were fed the basal diet, part of which had been replaced with 5%, 10%, and 15% whole-plant corn silage, respectively. The experiment lasted for 127 days, including 7 days of pre-testing and 120 days of formal testing. At the end of the experiment, blood and fecal samples were collected. Compared with the CON group, the feed-to-gain ratio was significantly lower in the 10% test group (p < 0.05), whereas the total protein, albumin, triglyceride, and glucose contents were significantly higher (p < 0.05). No significant differences in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, creatinine, urea, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were observed among the groups (p > 0.05). The addition of whole-plant corn silage to the diet significantly increased alpha diversity in the pig gut based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The principal coordinate analysis results showed significant clustering of the different groups (p < 0.05). At the phylum level, the addition of whole-plant corn silage to the diet significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the relative abundance of Firmicutes and significantly increased (p < 0.05) that of Bacteroidetes. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Streptococcus significantly decreased (p < 0.05) with increasing silage supplementation levels, whereas species diversity significantly increased (p < 0.05). In conclusion, 10% is the recommended inclusion ratio for whole-plant corn silage in the diets of pigs.

AB  - A passive composting method of municipal solid waste was investigated by utilizing a hybrid Bacillus commune and cow dung slurry. Four Bacillus strains B. subtilis, B. tequilensis, B. venezuelans, and B. nakamura were mixed with cow dung in varied ratios. Furthermore, the temperature (ambient and pile) triggered physico-chemical changes in the compost mix and finished compost quality after two seasons (summer and winter) was tested. Adding Bacillus commune and cow dung slurry to municipal waste during the peak summer season accelerated the degradation and resulted in an enriched final compost product. Variations in color, pH, C/N ratio, total organic carbon, electrical conductivity, bulk density, available NPK (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium), and phytotoxicity assays rationalized it. Conclusively, the efficacy of the waste degradation process and compost maturity is exclusively governed by microbial diversity, may be accelerated by fortification with a 4 microbial syndicate and suitable seasonal conditions.

AB  - Pest infestation is one of the critical biotic threats to mangrove ecosystem stability. Early observations of infestation-induced damage and plant resistance could reveal the initial status of insect attacks. However, the differences between the pest resistance of native and exotic mangrove species remain poorly addressed. Here, we collected leaf photosynthetic, nutritional, morphological, and optical traits from four native and two exotic mangrove species in a subtropical mangrove ecosystem under healthy and infested conditions. Interspecific differences in resistance to pest infestation were assessed based on trait and spectral susceptibility. The results showed that photosynthetic pigments and anthocyanin correlated significantly with the health status of mangrove species. Chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll contents in native species decreased significantly after infestation compared to those in exotic species, which led to consequent decreases in red-edge range reflectivity. Our findings demonstrate that both exotic species, Sonneratia apetala, and Sonneratia caseolaris, have much higher resistance to pest infestation than native species.

AB  - Echinococcus spp. are zoonotic cestode parasites with a worldwide distribution and a complex, two-host life cycle involving carnivore definitive hosts and small mammal or ungulate intermediate hosts. Surveillance for Echinococcus spp. in the Midwestern United States (USA) is rare. Using a mixed-methods approach, we examined Echinococcus infection risks in wildlife and domestic dogs in four Minnesota Tribal Nations. We hypothesized that the spillover of Echinococcus spp. into domestic dogs would vary with the presence or absence of suspected wildlife host species and certain behaviors associated with domestic dog ownership, like feeding wildlife host carcasses or frequency of veterinary care. Among 83 dogs tested, three (3.6%) were positive for Echinococcus spp. Despite low prevalence, pet owner survey and focus group findings indicated that dogs encounter peri-domestic wildlife most often when they roam freely or consume wildlife carcasses. This study demonstrates a need for further research into spillover potential of endemic zoonotic Echinococcus spp. in the Midwest USA.

AB  - Haemadipsa japonica is a Japanese land leech that feeds on the blood of host animals, mainly the sika deer (Cervus nippon). The distribution of H. japonica has expanded since the 1990s, possibly due to sika deer population increases. Haemadipsa japonica populations were found in the northern and southern regions of Tochigi Prefecture, central Japan. Previous investigations reported that these populations are genetically differentiated between the north and south, although the sika deer distribution extends throughout the northern and southern regions. We hypothesized that the migration of sika deer might be limited, thus maintaining the two H. japonica genetic groups and restricting its range expansion. We evaluated this hypothesis by investigating the genetic structure of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear microsatellites (nSSR) of sika deer samples collected from Tochigi Prefecture and from H. japonica bloodmeal samples (invertebrate-derived DNA; iDNA). The sika deer mtDNA presented two haplotypes (G- and A-haplotypes) without a clear genetic structure. Conversely, the sika deer nSSR analysis indicated clear genetic differentiation between deer in the northern and southern regions, corresponding to the two H. japonica genetic groups. This indicates that sika deer movement is restricted to narrow regions in Tochigi Prefecture. Therefore, we conclude that the current H. japonica expansion in the prefecture likely depends on the migration of sika deer, only occurring within the northern and southern regions, even though this is driven by sika deer migration.

AB  - The rumen undergoes developmental changes during maturation. To characterize this understudied dynamic process, we profiled single-cell transcriptomes of about 308,000 cells from the rumen tissues of sheep and goats at 17 time points. We built comprehensive transcriptome and metagenome atlases from early embryonic to rumination stages, and recapitulated histomorphometric and transcriptional features of the rumen, revealing key transitional signatures associated with the development of ruminal cells, microbiota, and core transcriptional regulatory networks. In addition, we identified and validated potential cross-talk between host cells and microbiomes and revealed their roles in modulating the spatiotemporal expression of key genes in ruminal cells. Cross-species analyses revealed convergent developmental patterns of cellular heterogeneity, gene expression, and cell-cell and microbiome-cell interactions. Finally, we uncovered how the interactions can act upon the symbiotic rumen system to modify the processes of fermentation, fiber digestion, and immune defense. These results significantly enhance understanding of the genetic basis of the unique roles of rumen.

AB  - The viewing of free-ranging wildlife (especially those that are charismatic among the global public) remains popular as tourism, and it is important to monitor the impact of tourist activities on sustainability and animal welfare. It can be difficult to evaluate the impact of tourism on a broader scale, but a conservation culturomics approach may gather relatively large datasets consisting of user-generated content (e.g., social media) that reflect human-nature interactions. We utilized a sample of YouTube videos (n = 479) to characterize patterns in content and engagement of content representing human-elephant interactions in Sri Lanka. Beginning in 2009, we found a growing number of YouTube videos related to wild elephant tourism in Sri Lanka, with most videos (90 %) containing footage from protected areas. However, the prevalence of videos depicting stress behavior by elephants also increased over time. Stress behavior was more commonly observed in non-protected areas, and along with human-directed aggression, it was associated with proximity to people and human-initiated interactions. Video engagement was associated with several factors, including the number of channel subscribers, location, and human visibility and proximity. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of, and challenges associated with, wild elephant tourism in Sri Lanka serving conservation purposes, which may be representative of nature-based tourism that involves free-ranging populations of charismatic, flagship species around the world. Further studies utilizing a diversity of methodologies and involving a range of stakeholders will elucidate the impact of tourism on the sustainability of natural landscapes and the wellbeing of individual animals.

AB  - Jaguars and pumas are top-predator species in the Neotropics that are threatened by habitat destruction, illegal poaching of their body parts and their favored prey, and by the human-wildlife conflicts that arise when predators attack livestock. Much of the remaining felid habitat in the Americas is in protected nature reserves that are too small and isolated to support local populations. Surrounding forests therefore play a vital role in felid conservation. Successful long-term conservation of these two felids requires evidence-based knowledge of their biological and ecological requirements. We studied population distributions of jaguars and pumas and their prey in and between two small, private reserves of the Northern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, with areas of 25 and 43 km(2). During 2 years of camera trapping (2015 and 2016), we detected 21 jaguars, from which we estimated an average space requirement of 28-45 km(2)/individual. Dietary niche overlap exceeded random expectation. The most frequently occurring prey items in jaguar and puma diets were collared peccary and deer. Jaguar also favored nine-banded armadillos and white-nosed coati, while puma favored canids. Both felids avoided ocellated turkey. Overall, diet of jaguars was less species-rich, but similar in niche breadth, to that of pumas. A fluid use of space by both species, in 2015 tending toward mutual attraction and in 2016 toward partial exclusion of pumas by jaguars, combined with the high dietary overlap, is consistent with a dominance hierarchy facilitating coexistence. Jaguars and pumas favor the same prey as the people in local communities who hunt, which likely will intensify human-wildlife impacts when prey become scarce. We conclude that even small reserves play an important role in increasing the continuity of habitat for prey and large felids, whose generalist habits suppress interspecific competition for increasingly limiting prey that are largely shared between them and humans.

AB  - Simple Summary Biodiversity conservation is one of the most relevant current issues. The safeguarding of genetic resources of autochthon farm animals at risk of extinction, such as the Teramana goat, reflects the enhancement of the relative animal productions, in order to highlight the peculiarities that can induce breeders to devote themselves to a specific type of breeding and that can attract the interests of potential consumers. Recent advances in proteomics and bioinformatics tools offer the potential to investigate breed differences at the level of proteins (proteome) and consequently in terms of the biological processes and molecular functions of the specific breed under study. However, there is a lack of information on the potentiality of autochthonous breeds such as the Teramana goat. Therefore, in this study, a global differential proteomic experiment was carried out with the purpose of identifying variations in the expression of muscle proteins between the autochthon Teramana goat and the breed commonly used by the industry, Saanen. The results showed a difference in the expression pattern of 41 proteins that clearly separate the two breeds (underlying genetic differences), highlighting biological features that could influence the productivity, resilience and other traits of these animals. The intensification and standardization of livestock farming are causing a decline in the number of animal breeds in many species, such as the goat. The availability of more studies on the potentiality of goat breeds could raise awareness of their importance, conservation and productive possibilities. Label-free quantitative analysis was applied in this study to investigate the proteomic differences between the autochthon Teramana and Saanen goats that could be useful for defining peculiar features of these breeds. A total of 2093 proteins were characterized in the muscle exudate proteome of the Teramana and Saanen breeds. A total of 41 proteins clearly separated the two breeds. Eukaryotic initiation factor proteins and aldehyde-dehydrogenase 7 family-member A1 were up-regulated in the autochthon breed and associated with its resilience, whereas catalase was down-regulated and associated with lower muscular mass. This study is the most detailed report of goat muscle proteome. Several differentially regulated proteins between the two breeds were identified, providing insights into functional pathways that define this organism and its biology.

AB  - Montane landscapes present an array of abiotic challenges that drive adaptive evolution amongst organisms. These adaptations can promote habitat specialisation, which may heighten the risk of extirpation from environmental change. For example, higher metabolic rates in an endothermic species may contribute to heightened cold tolerance, whilst simultaneously limiting heat tolerance. Here, using the climate-sensitive American pika (Ochotona princeps), we test for evidence of intraspecific adaptive variation amongst environmental gradients across the Intermountain West of North America. We leveraged results from previous studies on pika adaptation to generate a custom nuclear target enrichment design to sequence several hundred candidate genes related to cold, hypoxia and dietary detoxification. We also applied a 'genome skimming' approach to sequence mitochondrial DNA. Using genotype-environment association tests, we identified rare genomic variants associated with elevation and temperature variation amongst populations. Amongst mitochondrial genes, we identified intraspecific variation in selective signals and significant changes to the amino acid property equilibrium constant, which may relate to electron transport chain efficiency. These results illustrate a complex dynamic of adaptive variation amongst O. princeps where lineages and populations have adapted to unique regional conditions. Some of the clearest signals of selection were in a genetic lineage that includes pikas of the Great Basin region, which is also where recent localised extirpations have taken place and highlights the risk of losing adaptive alleles during environmental change.

AB  - Simple Summary Inappropriate eliminating on a resting area has a negative effect on the environment, the cleanliness of pigs and pens, and can impair farm productivity. There are several factors that can affect pig eliminative behaviour. The primary aim of this survey was to investigate which factors related to the physical environment have the strongest effects on pig and pen cleanliness and ammonia concentration. Secondly, we wanted to assess the relationship between ambient temperature, air velocity and cleanliness of the pen and the pigs and ammonia concentration. Data were collected from 87 pig farms (n = 5769 pigs; n = 643 pens). The larger the eliminative area and resting area, the cleaner were the pigs. The eliminating area could have open partitions and be placed in the back of the pen. The resting area with a large amount of litter on the floor and use of straw as rooting material increased the cleanliness of this area. A more optimal pen design, such as that described in the present study, can reduce the workload for the farmers (cleaning), improve air quality, and lower the environmental footprint. There are several environmental and ambient factors that can affect pig eliminative behaviour. The aim of this survey was to investigate factors related to the physical and ambient environment that have the strongest effects on pig and pen cleanliness and ammonia concentration. Data were collected from 87 pig farms and analysed using mixed (ammonia concentration) or generalized linear (pen and pig cleanliness) model in SAS. The pen was cleaner when pen partitions were open compared to closed (p = 0.010) and increased with increasing amount of litter (p = 0.002), using straw (p = 0.002) as rooting material. Pig cleanliness was higher when pen partitions in the eliminative area were open compared to closed (p = 0.007) and increased with increasing space per pig in the resting area (p < 0.001), with decreasing temperature (p < 0.001), and lowering of air velocity (p = 0.003). Other factors that increased cleanliness was using straw as rooting material (p = 0.028) and increasing amount of litter in the resting area (p = 0.002). Ammonia concentration was reduced with increasing floor space in the eliminative area (p < 0.001) and increasing amount of litter (p = 0.006). Our results pinpoint physical and ambient conditions affecting pen and pig cleanliness and air quality.

AB  - Spatially concentrated resources result in patch-based foraging, wherein the detection and choice of patches as well as the process of locating and exploiting resource patches involve moving through an explicit landscape composed of both resources and barriers to movement. An understanding of behavioral responses to resources and barriers is key to interpreting observed ecological patterns. We examined the process of resource discovery in the context of a heterogeneous seascape using sea urchins and drift kelp in urchin barrens as a model system. Under field conditions, we manipulated both the presence of a highly valuable resource (drift kelp) and a barrier to movement (sandy substratum) to test the interacting influence of these two factors on the process of resource discovery in barren grounds by urchins. We removed all foraging urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) from replicate areas and monitored urchin recolonization and kelp consumption. We tested two hypotheses: (1) unstable substratum is a barrier to urchin movement and (2) the movement behavior of sea urchins is modified by the presence of drift kelp. Very few urchins were found on sand, sand was a permeable barrier to urchin movement, and the permeability of this barrier varied between sites. In general, partial recolonization occurred strikingly rapidly, but sand slowed the consumption of drift kelp by limiting the number of urchins. Differences in the permeability of sand barriers between sites could be driven by differences in the size structure of urchin populations, indicating size-specific environmental effects on foraging behavior. We demonstrate the influence of patchy seascapes in modulating grazing intensity in barren grounds through modifications of foraging behavior. Behavioral processes modified by environmental barriers play an important role in determining grazing pressure, the existence of refuges for new algal recruits, and ultimately the dynamics of urchin-algal interactions in barren grounds.

AB  - Simple Summary The reproductive performance of pigs can vary due to the influence of genetic factors, and this is aggravated by environmental factors. Multiple complex factors affect the difference in the reproductive performance of boars in adulthood. This study examined those genetic differences in young piglets, at a time when they are less affected by the environment. Testicular tissue samples were used to explore candidate genes and related pathways affecting testicular size during early development. This experiment into the reproductive performance of pig breeds using the RNA-Seq analysis of testicular tissue with early developmental differences can provide a theoretical basis for breeding by determining key candidate genes that control testicular predevelopment. The data will be used for subsequent research into the genetic mechanism of boars, which is important for early breeding and improvement.Abstract The RNA-Seq technology was used to screen the key genes that affect the early development of the testes of Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire piglets, to determine the regulatory pathway and provide reference for subsequent reproductive performance research, breeding, and other production practices. This study selected 14-day-old Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire piglets as the trial animals. Testes from piglets with similar weights and no pathological changes were divided into small testis (ST) and large testis (LT) groups, and the RNA-Seq screening of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed to find candidate genes and regulatory pathways related to early testicular development. The results show that 570 DEGs were found in the ST and LT groups, with 281 upregulated and 289 downregulated. The DEGs were mainly enriched on 47 gene ontology (GO) functional items. The Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genotypes (KEGG) enrichment analysis found that there were 44 significantly enriched KEGG signal pathways, and the regulation of testicular development mainly focused on the arachidonic acid metabolism, Wnt signaling pathway and GnRH secretion pathways. The PTGES, SFRP1, SPP1, PLA2G4E, KCNJ5, PTGS2, and HCN1 genes were found to be as closely related to the testicular development of these Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire piglets, and the differential gene expression was consistent with the real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (real-time qRT-PCR) validation results. This study was validated by high-throughput sequencing analysis and real-time qRT-PCR, and showed that the PTGES, SFRP1, SPP1, PLA2G4E, KCNJ5, PTGS2, and HCN1 genes may be involved in the regulation of germ cell development, spermatogenesis and semen traits. These should be further studied as candidate genes for early testicular development and reproductive trait regulation in boars.

AB  - Land use in the catchments draining to the Great Barrier Reef lagoon has changed considerably since the introduction of livestock grazing, various crops, mining and urban development. Together these changes have resulted in increased pollutant loads and impaired coastal water quality. This study compiled records to produce annual time-series since 1860 of human population, livestock numbers and agricultural areas at the scale of surface drainage river basins, natural resource management regions and the whole Great Barrier Reef catchment area. Cattle and several crops have experienced progressive expansion interspersed by declines associated with droughts and diseases. Land uses which have experienced all time maxima since the year 2000 include cattle numbers and the areas of sugar cane, bananas and cotton. A Burdekin Basin case study shows that sediment loads initially increased with the introduction of livestock and mining, remained elevated with agricultural development, and declined slightly with the Burdekin Falls Dam construction.

AB  - Investigating functional traits among mountain species with differing altitude requirements is integral to effective conservation practices. Our study aims to investigate the structural and chemical characteristics of Daphniphyllum macropodum leaves at three altitudes (1100 m, 1300 m, and 1500 m) across southern China to provide insight into changes in leaf functional traits (LFT) as well as plant adaptations in response to changing environmental conditions. Leaf structural characteristics include leaf thickness (LT), leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf tissue density (LD), respectively, while chemical properties include carbon-nitrogen-phosphorus (C:N:P) contents and ratios, such as C/N, C/P, and N/P. Our findings demonstrated the significant effect of altitude on both structural (LT, SLA, LD) and chemical aspects (N, C/N, N/P) of LFT. In particular, leaves at 1100 and 1300 m differed greatly, with 1300 m having lower SLA values than 1100 m. Observable trends included an initial increase followed by a decline as the altitude rose. Notable among them were the LT, LD, N, and N/P values at both locations. Traits at 1300 m were significantly higher than at 1100 m; SLA and C/N values displayed an inverse trend, with their lowest values occurring at 1300 m. Furthermore, this research demonstrated various degrees of variation among LFT, with structural traits exhibiting greater fluctuation than chemical traits. Robust correlations were observed among certain traits, such as LT, LD, and SLA. Furthermore, the interdependency relationships between N and C/N, as well as P and C/P, demonstrated interconnectedness. Redundancy analysis indicated that soil factors, specifically P content, exerted the strongest impact on LFT. At 1100 m, D. macropodum employed acquisition strategies; however, at 1300 m, conservation strategies emerged, showing a shift from acquisition strategies at lower altitudes to conservative strategies at higher ones.

AB  - Recently Camelina sativa, has been genetically modified to produce oils rich in omega-3 (n-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and EPA + DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of using these novel sources of de novo EPA and EPA + DHA as substitutes for marine oil in feeds for juvenile Atlantic Bluefin tuna (ABT). The results showed the oils were practical sources of n-3 LC-PUFA which could potentially replace fish oil (FO) in feeds for ABT juveniles. Fish fed the test diets (ECO, EPA alone and DCO, EPA + DHA) displayed good growth performance, survival and feed utilisation approaching that of ABT fed the reference diet (MGK) containing marine fish oil with the rank order being MGK > DCO > ECO. The test diets showed positive effects, upregulating the expression of genes of major nuclear receptors and those of lipid metabolism including digestion, LC-PUFA synthesis and antioxidant pathways. The results indicated that the DCO feed containing both DHA and EPA performed better than the ECO feed with much lower DHA. However, feeds formulated with both these oils may still require supplementary DHA to satisfy the high requirement of ABT for this essential nutrient.

AB  - The deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) is a generalist species and is widespread among the various early successional forest habitats associated with post-clearcut landscapes. Deer mice seem to occupy clearcuts more than undisturbed late successional forest, at least for abundance, because harvested sites apparently act as dispersal sinks. We investigated the responses in abundance of P. maniculatus populations to cumulative clear cutting of coniferous forests on a landscape that had four independent clearcutting events (Periods 1 to 4) over a 42-year interval from 1979 to 2020 in south-central British Columbia, Canada. We tested three hypotheses (H) that populations of P. maniculatus would (H-1) increase in abundance owing to the ongoing availability of early seral post-harvest habitats associated with cumulative clearcutting; (H-2) have higher mean abundance, reproduction, and survival in clearcut than forest sites owing to greater food resources; and (H3) occupy clearcut sites as dispersal sinks thereby having lower adult body mass (a proximate measure of condition) and reduced reproductive output than in forest sites. Mean annual abundance of P. maniculatus was highest and similar in Periods 2 and 4 with comparable numbers in Period 1 for the first four post-harvest years of these clearcutting periods. This pattern did not support H1 that P. maniculatus would increase in abundance associated with cumulative clearcutting over the 42-year period. Deer mouse populations reached relatively high densities (range of 23 to 53 per ha) on clearcut sites and these irruptions were likely related to supply of lodgepole pine seed from cones in logging debris. Overall mean abundance of P. maniculatus ranged from 1.4 to 3.6 times higher in clearcut than forest sites, thereby supporting the abundance part of H-2. Recruitment, number of successful pregnancies, and breeding young-of-the-year deer mice were all higher in clearcut than forest sites, thereby supporting the reproduction part of H-2. However, equivocal measures of overall survival did not support this hypothesis. The general similarity in mean body mass of adult mice between treatment sites and higher reproductive output in clearcut than forest sites did not support H3 that clearcut sites would act as dispersal sinks for deer mice. This study is the first to measure the long-term demographic responses of deer mice to cumulative clearcutting over a coniferous forest landscape. Clearcut sites may provide high-quality habitat for deer mice in this forest landscape.

AB  - The pastoralists co-exist with wild predators and livestock depredation by predators causes an immense impact on the livelihood of the herders and instigates a negative attitude towards the conservation of these wild predators. Yak herders in western Bhutan move from place to place for herding on pasture and they face challenges with livestock predation by top predators like snow leopard (Panthera uncia) and dhole (Cuon aplinus). To investigate patterns of livestock depredation by the snow leopard and determine the attitude of herders towards snow leopard conservation, we conducted a household interview with all 56 itinerant yak herders in the west of Bhutan. Each herd was keeping a mean of 84 (+/- 29) yaks per herd. Yaks were mainly kept for milk and bulls for breeding and bullocks for meat to sustain their family livelihood. Predation of livestock by predators (42.9%) was among the top problems faced by the yak herders. A total of 398 yaks were lost to snow leopards (78.86%) followed by dhole (18.3%), Himalayan black bear (Ursus thibetanus) (2.7%), and common leopard (Panthera pardus) (0.2%) in the past 5 years (2015-2019). The majority (87.22.8%) of the kills by snow leopards were young yak and most (60.5%) kills were recorded during summer. Snow leopards are considered harmful (73.2%), and herders (71.1%) are not in favour of snow leopard conservation. Herders' conflict with snow leopards is severe in the current study site, and we recommend social development for conservation programmes like livelihood alternatives for the herders, compensation and insurance schemes, and conservation awareness programmes for the yak herders as an intervention to create harmonic co-existence between the yak herder and the snow leopard.

AB  - Farm and industrial residues must be adequately managed to avoid negative environmental implications. In this study, our objective was to evaluate (i) the impact of the co-production of vermicompost using grape bagasse and biochar (BC) on the yield and biochemical, chemical, and biological properties of vermicompost; (ii) the effect of BC on earthworms (Eisenia fetida Sav.). The vermicompost was co-produced over 5 months (n = 4 per treatment) using (i) grape bagasse as the substrate, (ii) earthworms (Eisenia fetida Sav.), and (iii) three BCs (eucalyptus sawdust BC, pig manure BC, and carbonaceous material from poultry litter CM) at 2% (w/w). A control without BC was included. The chemical, microbiological (activity and respiration), enzymatic properties, and enzymatic indices were characterized. After the incubation period, vermicompost yield increased with the application of the three BCs (25% on average). The number of adult earthworms was not affected by any of the BCs. Compared to treatments without BC, those with pig manure BC and eucalyptus BC resulted in maintained or significantly decreased enzymatic activity, indicating that the vermicompost was at an advanced stage of maturity. Eucalyptus BC significantly enriched the C content of the vermicompost by 4.3%, maintaining respiration rates at 18% lower than the treatment without BC. Additionally, pig manure BC generated the lowest respiration rate in the vermicompost (20% lower). We conclude that BC has a positive influence on the vermicompost process, stabilizing organic matter (especially pig manure BC) and improving the potential of vermicompost to store C (when high-C-content BCs are applied).

AB  - This paper presents a streamlined approach to describing potential habitats for red deer (Cervus elaphus) in situations where in situ data collected through observations and monitoring are absent or insufficient. The main objectives of this study were as follows: (a) to minimize the negative effects of limited in situ data; (b) to identify landscape features with a functional relationship between habitat quality and landscape structure; and (c) to use imprecise in situ data for statistical analyses to specify these relationships. The test area was located in the eastern part of Mecklenburg-Western Pomeriania (Germany). For this area, remotely sensed forest maps were used to determine landscape metrics as independent variables. Dichotomous habitat suitability was determined based on hunting distances over a five-year period. Ecological and biological habitat requirements of red deer were derived from suitable landscape measures, which served as model inputs. Correlation analysis identified the most relevant independent landscape metrics. Logistic regression then tested various metric combinations at both class and landscape levels to assess habitat suitability. Within the model variants, the contagion index, edge density, and percentage of forested area showed the largest relative impact on habitat suitability. The approach can also be applied to other mammals, provided there are appropriate structural preferences and empirical data on habitat suitability.

AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate the molecular infection prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in sheep liver tissues destined for human consumption. A total number of 224 liver tissues were collected from slaughtered sheep in Sejnane slaughterhouse (Northwest Tunisia). PCR was used to detect T. gondii DNA in liver tissues followed by phylogenetic analysis of amplicons. The phylogenetic tree was then constructed to compare the partial sequences of the ITS1 gene with GenBank sequences. The overall molecular prevalence of T. gondii in sheep livers was 25% (56/224). The highest molecular prevalence of T. gondii was recorded in sheep aged of less than one year old (27.3%; 52/190). Infection prevalence was significantly higher in Noire de Thibar breed (33%; 17/51) compared to other breeds (p = 0.023). There were no differences depicted according to sheep's gender. The T. gondii sequences obtained in the present study (GenBank accession numbers: OR509829 and OR509830) were 98.40-100% homologous to T. gondii sequences published in the GenBank. These results highlight a high level of T. gondii contamination of tissues destined for human consumption. Further studies are needed to improve our knowledge on different genotypes of T. gondii that infect Tunisian sheep population.

AB  - The United States (U.S.) swine industry has struggled to control porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) for decades, yet the causative virus, PRRSV-2, continues to circulate and rapidly diverges into new variants. In the swine industry, the farm is typically the epidemiological unit for monitoring, prevention, and control; breaking transmission among farms is a critical step in containing disease spread. Despite this, our understanding of farm transmission still is inadequate, precluding the development of tailored control strategies. Therefore, our objective was to infer farm-to-farm transmission links, estimate farm-level transmissibility as defined by reproduction numbers (R), and identify associated risk factors for transmission using PRRSV-2 open reading frame 5 (ORF5) gene sequences, animal movement records, and other data from farms in a swine-dense region of the U.S. from 2014 to 2017. Timed phylogenetic and transmission tree analyses were performed on three sets of sequences (n = 206) from 144 farms that represented the three largest genetic variants of the virus in the study area. The length of inferred pig-to-pig infection chains that corresponded to pairs of farms connected via direct animal movement was used as a threshold value for identifying other feasible transmission links between farms; these links were then transformed into farm-to-farm transmission networks and calculated farm-level R-values. The median farm-level R was one (IQR = 1-2), whereas the R value of 28% of farms was more than one. Exponential random graph models were then used to evaluate the influence of farm attributes and/or farm relationships on the occurrence of farm-to-farm transmission links. These models showed that, even though most transmission events cannot be directly explained by animal movement, movement was strongly associated with transmission. This study demonstrates how integrative techniques may improve disease traceability in a data-rich era by providing a clearer picture of regional disease transmission.

AB  - Hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius) are herbivores and semi-aquatic feeding on farmlands mainly at night. Although human-hippopotamus interactions are known to occur, there is little information in the area surrounding Lake Babati. The study aimed to assess: the areas dominated by hippo visits; problems caused by hippos to the local communities'; major challenges to crops compared to hippos, crops preferred by hippos and seasonal variations in hippo visits across the study villages. Semi structured questionnaire, focused group discussions and direct observation methods were used in data collection. The findings reveal that the hippos mostly visit the farms and residential areas closer to the lake (>3 km) across the villages. Hippos were perceived as the major challenge to crops compared to drought and diseases. The respondents closer to the lake reported crop raiding as the major problem caused by hippos and the incidents reported to be severe during the rainy season. Maize crop was reported to be highly preferred by hippos compared to other crops. The study recommends to the key stakeholders to come up with proper management strategies giving priority to the areas within 3 km adjacent the lake. This may include establishment of the buffer zone and growing alternative crops that are not preferred by the hippos so as to attain hippos' conservation and livelihoods development goals.

AB  - Recognition of group members is an important adaptation in social organisms because it allows help to be directed toward kin or individuals that are likely to reciprocate, and harm to be directed toward members of competing groups. Evidence in a wide range of animals shows that responses to outgroups vary with context, suggesting that cues to group membership also depend on the social or environmental context. In termites, intergroup encounters are frequent and their outcomes highly variable, ranging from destruction of a colony to colony fusion. As well as genetic factors, nestmate recognition in social insects commonly relies on cues that are mediated by environmental factors such as food source. However, single-piece nesting termite colonies share nesting material and food source with rival colonies (their wood substrate serves as both). In principle, the shared environment of single-piece nesting termite colonies could constrain their ability to identify non-nestmates, contributing to some of the variation seen in encounters, but this has not been investigated. In this study, we raised incipient colonies of a single-piece nesting termite, Zootermopsis angusticollis, on two different wood types and conducted behavioral assays to test whether nestmate discrimination can be constrained by common environmental conditions. We found that non-nestmates elicited higher rates of identity checking and defense behavior compared to nestmates, but there was no effect of wood type on the strength of behavioral responses to non-nestmates. We also found that one key cooperative behavior (allogrooming) was performed equally toward both nestmates and non-nestmates. These findings offer no support for the hypothesis that common wood type constrains the nestmate recognition system of single piece nesting termites. We suggest that where groups encounter each other frequently in a common environment, selection will favor discrimination based on genetic and/or higher resolution environmentally mediated cues.

AB  - Bats are reservoirs for various pathogens, including SARS-like coronaviruses (CoVs). Understanding the distribution of bat species is crucial to identifying areas where viral spillover from bats to other animals or humans might occur. In this study, we performed species distribution modeling to predict suitable habitats within Thailand under current and predicted future climate conditions for Rhinolophus acuminatus, a bat species that has been found to host SARS-CoV-2-related viruses. Our assessment of current conditions revealed that temperature seasonality had the greatest impact on habitat suitability and that suitable habitats were primarily restricted to the southern and eastern regions of Thailand. Over time, the projections indicate a diminishing availability of suitable habitats, suggesting a potential trend toward migration into neighboring areas. We next combined modeled bat distribution with urbanization data to estimate regions in Thailand where bat-human interactions might occur. The resulting map highlighted regions of heightened interaction risk, encompassing approximately 46,053.94 km(2) across 58 provinces and representing approximately 9.24% of Thailand's total area. These risk concentrations are prominently situated in the southern, central, and eastern Thai regions, with extensions into neighboring border areas. Our findings will significantly aid future risk surveillance efforts and enhance the effectiveness of monitoring and managing emerging diseases within the country and in contiguous regions.

AB  - The effect of manure application on the distribution and accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in tissue of root vegetables remains unclear, which poses a bottleneck in assessing the health risks from root vegetables due to application of manure. Towards this goal, experiments were conducted in pots to investigate the distribution and bioaccumulation of ARGs in carrot tissues due to application of pig manure. The 144 ARGs targeting nine types of antibiotics were quantified by high throughput qPCR in the soil and plant samples. The rhizosphere was a hot spot for ARGs enrichment in the manured soil. The abundance, diversity, and bioaccumulation factors of ARGs in the phyllosphere were significantly higher than those of carrot root skin and tuber. Manure application increased bioaccumulation of 12 ARGs and 2 MGEs in carrot tuber with 124 the highest factor. The application of manure increased transfer of 10 ARGs and 3 MGEs from carrot skin to inner tuber by factors of 0.1-11.8. The average gene copy number of ARGs of per gram carrot root was about 4.8 x 104 and 1.1 x 106 in the control and the manured treatment, respectively. Children and adults may co-ingest 2.7 x 107 and 3.2 x 107 of ARGs copies/d from carrots grown with pig manure, using estimated human intake values. However, peeling may reduce the intake of ARGs by 28-91% and of MGEs by 46-59%. In conclusion, the application of pig manure increased the accumulation of ARGs in the skin of carrots, whereas peeling was an effective strategy to reduce the risk.

AB  - Extrafloral nectary plants not only occur in natural areas but also in urban parks. These areas are prone to edge effects, and plants face different microenvironmental conditions. We investigated the spatial variation of ant-plant interactions in an urban park, and we examined if plants with ants would show lower herbivory levels and if it depended on habitat type (interior or edges). Seedlings of Inga laurina were set in 200-m long transects (which covered both the west and east edges, and the interior) in an urban park and then experimentally assigned to be either ant-present or ant-excluded plants. Leaf herbivory was investigated throughout the wet season and was influenced by the interaction effect between ants and habitat type. Ants decreased the herbivory on the west edge, but on the east edge results were the opposite. The east edge had higher temperature and sunlight exposure in comparison to the other sites and was assumed to disrupt the stability of ant-plant interactions. In the interior of the fragment, herbivory depended on ant presence/absence and on the location of plants along the transect. Our study highlights how the outcomes of ant-plant interactions are spatially conditioned and affected by different types of habitats.

AB  - Insect frass fertilizer is emerging as a sustainable and novel input for improving soil health and crop production; however, research attention on its safety and microbial properties remains limited. Here, we evaluated the levels of heavy metals, pathogens, diversity, abundance, composition and functional roles of bacteria and fungi in frass fertilizer produced by eight edible insect species. Our results revealed the absence of Salmonella spp. In the frass fertilizers produced by all insect species, while the levels of other pathogens and heavy metals were within permissible limits for organic fertilizers. We found that 79-86 % of the variations in bacterial and fungal communities in the frass fertilizers were influenced by the species of insects used in waste recycling. The highest richness of bacteria and fungi was recorded in the frass fertilizers generated from Oryctes rhinoceros and Pachnoda sinuata. Taxonomic classification revealed 36 bacteria phyla across the frass fertilizers, with most belonging to Firmicutes (43 %), Proteobacteria (23 %), and Actinobacteriota (18 %), whereas the main fungal phyla were Ascomycota (80 %) and Basidiomycota (10 %). Functional profiling revealed that most fungi were sapotrophsymbiotrophs, pathogenic saprotrophs, pathotrophs, and symbiotrophic saprotrophs, which are key in organic matter decomposition, nutrient recycling and pathogen suppression. In contrast, the bacteria were mostly associated with antibiotic and phytohormone production, biosynthesis of plant growth regulators, nitrogen metabolism, nitrification, nitrogen fixation, especially in frass fertilizers derived from P. sinuata, Schistocerca gregaria, and Hermetia illucens. Our findings demonstrate the potential of insects to recycle low-value organic wastes into hygienic organic fertilizer and highlight the role of beneficial microbes, which could be harnessed for bioremediation, sustainable soil health management, improved crop productivity and food security.

AB  - Birds are known to act as potential vectors for the exogenous dispersal of bryophyte diaspores. Given the totipotency of vegetative tissue of many bryophytes, birds could also contribute to endozoochorous bryophyte dispersal. Research has shown that fecal samples of the upland goose (Chloephaga picta) and white-bellied seedsnipe (Attagis malouinus) contain bryophyte fragments. Although few fragments from bird feces have been known to regenerate, the evidence for the viability of diaspores following passage through the bird intestinal tract remains ambiguous. We evaluated the role of endozoochory in these same herbivorous and sympatric bird species in sub-Antarctic Chile. We hypothesized that fragments of bryophyte gametophytes retrieved from their feces are viable and capable of regenerating new plant tissue. Eleven feces disk samples containing undetermined moss fragments from C. picta (N = 6) and A. malouinus (N = 5) and six moss fragment samples from wild-collected mosses (Conostomum tetragonum, Syntrichia robusta, and Polytrichum strictum) were grown ex situ in peat soil and in vitro using a agar Gamborg medium. After 91 days, 20% of fragments from A. malouinus feces, 50% of fragments from C. picta feces, and 67% of propagules from wild mosses produced new growth. The fact that moss diaspores remained viable and can regenerate under experimental conditions following the passage through the intestinal tracts of these robust fliers and altitudinal and latitudinal migrants suggests that sub-Antarctic birds might play a role in bryophyte dispersal. This relationship may have important implications in the way bryophytes disperse and colonize habitats facing climate change.

AB  - Conserving large mammals on small islands poses a great challenge, given their high resource demand within the limited space available. The endangered Togean Islands babirusa (Babyrousa togeanensis) is one of these species, with a distribution range limited to four small islands in the Togean Archipelago, Indonesia. Despite being listed as endangered, very little information is available on the distribution and ecology of this species. To address this critical knowledge gap, we here report the first field-based ecological study of the Togean Islands babirusa across its entire distribution range. Following a stratified random sampling procedure, we distributed camera traps at 103 stations across four islands to collect data on the species distribution from July-October 2022. We performed an occupancy modeling analysis to assess the species' habitat use, with various habitat features estimated through remote sensing and field measurements as covariates. We found that forest and mangrove availability over a large area positively influenced babirusa habitat selection. Babirusas only made use of agricultural areas when large forest areas were available nearby. Our results highlight the benefits of redesigning the national park area to accommodate babirusa habitat requirements, specifically by reassigning the non-forested park areas (about 30% of the park area) to non-protected forests currently outside the park boundary (about 50% of total forested area). Our case study exemplifies key challenges associated with conserving large mammals on small islands and highlights the importance of following an adaptive management approach, which in this case implies shifting 30% of the current protected area.

AB  - Gaining insight into the diversity, structure, and metabolic functions of microbial communities is essential for understanding their roles in host health and ecosystem dynamics. However, research on the seahorse-associated microbiome remains limited, despite these threatened fish facing increasing human pressures worldwide. Here, we explored the microbial diversity and metabolic functions of the skin and gut of the tiger tail seahorse (Hippocampus comes) and its surrounding environment using shotgun metagenomics and bioinformatics. Members of the Pseudomonadota phylum were dominant in the skin microbiome, whereas Bacteroidota was dominant in the gut. Bacillota, Actinomycetota, and Planctomycetota were also detected in the seahorse-associated microbiome. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences (P < 0.01) in species diversity between skin and gut microbiomes, with members belonging to the Moraxellaceae family being dominant on the skin and the Bacteroidaceae family in the gut. Moreover, the surrounding environment (water or sediment) did not have a direct effect on the seahorse microbiome composition. The skin microbiome exhibited a higher abundance of functional genes related to energy, lipid, and amino acid metabolism as well as terpenoids and polyketides metabolism, xenobiotics biodegradation, and metabolism compared with the gut. Despite differences among classes, the total abundance of bacteriocins was similar in both gut and skin microbiomes, which is significant in shaping microbial communities due to their antimicrobial properties. A better knowledge of seahorse microbiomes benefits conservation and sustainable aquaculture efforts, offering insights into habitat protection, disease management, and optimizing aquaculture environments, thereby promoting seahorse health and welfare while minimizing environmental impact and enhancing aquaculture sustainability. NEW & NOTEWORTHY To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first comprehensive examination of the taxonomic and functional patterns of the skin and gut microbiome in the tiger tail seahorse. These findings have the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of the seahorse-associated microbiome, thereby contributing to the prediction and control of bacterial infections in seahorses, which are a leading cause of high mass mortality rates in seahorse aquaculture and other fish species.

AB  - Simple Summary Wildlife may carry ticks that can transmit pathogens to domestic animals and humans. Tick species from hunted and accidentally found dead wild animals were identified in the framework of a Regional Plan of Monitoring and Surveillance of Wildlife health in the Liguria region, northwest Italy. The results are presented to provide updated information on the tick species in the region and on their host preference. A total of 819 ticks, removed from 259 animals, were found and identified as belonging to five different species. Ixodes ricinus was the most frequent species, especially in roe deer and fallow deer, whereas Dermacentor marginatus was more specifically associated with wild boar. Wild animals are useful for characterizing and monitoring the tick population in an area, and these data will help in structuring control strategies. Hard ticks' geographical distribution and abundance are influenced by wildlife population. This work presents the results of the identification of ticks retrieved from wild animals in the framework of a Regional Plan of Monitoring and Surveillance of Wildlife health. The frequency of distribution of ticks in different hosts and their geographical patterns were also investigated. Ticks were collected from game animals (Sus scrofa, Capreolus capreolus, Dama dama, and Rupicapra rupicapra) during two hunting seasons (2018-2019 and 2019-2020) in the four provinces of the Liguria region in northwest Italy. In the same period, ticks were also collected from carcasses of Vulpes vulpes, Canis lupus, Meles meles, and Asio otus received for necropsy. Tick species were identified according to taxonomic keys. A total of 819 ticks, removed from 259 animals, were found and identified. Overall, Ixodes ricinus was the dominant species (62.6%), followed by Dermacentor marginatus (24.5%), Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. (12.5%), Haemaphysalis punctata (0.2%), and Ixodes hexagonus (0.1%). I. ricinus was also the prevalent species in roe deer and in fallow deer and the only species collected from the three wolf carcasses examined. In contrast, D. marginatus was the dominant species in S. scrofa. This last tick species was also more frequent in one province (Imperia), whereas Ixodes spp. were more common in another one (Savona). Wild animals proved to be useful for characterizing and monitoring tick population.

TI  - Herbivory shapes the rhizosphere bacterial microbiota in potato plants
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS
LA  - English
KW  - ROOT
AB  - Plant-associated microbiomes assist their host in a variety of activities, spanning from nutrition to defence against herbivores and diseases. Previous research showed that plant-associated microbiomes shift their composition when plants are exposed to stressors, including herbivory. However, existing studies explored only single herbivore-plant combinations, whereas plants are often attacked by several different herbivores, but the effects of multiple herbivore types on the plant microbiome remain to be determined. Here, we first tested whether feeding by different herbivores (aphids, nematodes and slugs) produces a shift in the rhizosphere bacterial microbiota associated with potato plants. Then, we expanded this question asking whether the identity of the herbivore produces different effects on the rhizosphere microbial community. While we found shifts in microbial diversity and structure due to herbivory, we observed that the herbivore identity does not influence the diversity or community structure of bacteria thriving in the rhizosphere. However, a deeper analysis revealed that the herbivores differentially affected the structure of the network of microbial co-occurrences. Our results have the potential to increase our ability to predict how plant microbiomes assemble and aid our understanding of the role of plant microbiome in plant responses to biotic stress.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict has increased over the decades and is now considered one of the most severe challenges to the survival of threatened species and the livelihood of communities worldwide. In Sri Lanka, population growth, fragmentation of land, and conversion of natural wildlife habitats into settlement and agricultural areas are the leading causes of human-wildlife conflict. This study seeks to characterise the conflict pattern in the Mullaitivu District by identifying land use/cover changes and assessing the vulnerability of land use/cover. Primary data were collected through a field survey using a structured questionnaire and direct observation methods, and secondary data on land use/cover changes were obtained from remote sensing images. These data were analysed statistically and on the Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. The study reveals land use/cover vulnerability status over the twenty-six years. Dense forests are on the decline, and wild animals migrate into human settlements and agricultural sites, resulting in different types of human-wildlife conflict such as crop damage, livestock depredation, and loss of life and/or injuries to both people and wildlife in the Mullaitivu district. People employ various wildlife mitigation strategies. However, they cannot safeguard their crops or livestock from these animals. By implementing appropriate management measures to avoid wildlife infiltration into human settlements, the human-wildlife conflict in the Mullaitivu district can be minimised.

AB  - Understanding early life histories of keystone marine herbivores can broaden insight into population dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Settlement, defined as the transitional process from planktonic larva to benthic juvenile, is not well understood for the long-spined sea urchin Diadema antillarum despite outsized herbivory effects on Caribbean coral reefs. Recent advances in aquaculture methods have enabled experimental investigation of larval ontogeny and cue-mediated settlement dynamics otherwise difficult to understand through field observations. In this study, the morphological attributes preceding metamorphosis of feeding larvae were characterized and factors influencing development of these attributes were examined. Simple access to the nutritious microalgae Rhodomonas lens led to metamorphic competence, defined here by presence of a large rudiment, or imaginal disc, and either internal or external podia with suction rings at the terminal tips. Subsequent exposure to a suite of individual cues revealed highest settlement to two calcareous algae, Halimeda sp. and crustose coralline algae, at 58.0% (+/- 3.7 SE) and 46.0% (+/- 5.1 SE), respectively, and zero settlement to a sterile seawater negative control. Significantly higher settlement to a ceramic tile overgrown with biofilm compared to separate sterile tile and isolated biofilm treatments revealed a synergistic relationship between a structural and biochemical cue. Microalgae exposure further enhanced settlement, but only when a strongly inductive primary cue was present. Together, these results provide insight into active habitat selection and factors likely influencing D. antillarum recruitment potential. Findings can be applied to improve both population dynamics models and aquaculture production methods.

AB  - The present study evaluated fatty acid digestibility, histology, blood biochemistry and gene expression in the gut of juvenile gilthead sea bream, Sparus aurata (initial mean weight, 60.4 ?? 4.9 g) fed with iso-proteic (48%) and iso-lipidic (20.7%) diets in which fish oil was partially (60%) or totally (100%) replaced with either camelina or chia oil. Each of the experimental diets was fed to triplicate groups of fish stocked at 10 fish/tank in 150 L tanks for 90 days. Although inclusion of camelina or chia oil altered dietary fatty acid (FA) profile, major differences in digestibility in the individual FAs were not observed. Total replacement of fish oil with camelina or chia oil did not have any effect on blood glucose levels, whereas cholesterol and triglyceride levels were reduced. Results of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcription showed elevated levels in the expression of the elongases and desaturases in gilthead seabream fed with diets devoid of fish oil. Fish fed with camelina or chia oil based diets had increased expression in lipolytic and lipogenic genes, resulting in accumulation of lipid droplets in the gut of fish. Histological examination revealed no pathological disorders in the guts of the fish.

AB  - In zooplankton surveys, many smaller taxa or species considered less important are often overlooked. One such example is the actinotrocha larvae of phoronid worms that are rarely quantified in zooplankton samples yet may play important roles in marine food webs. To gain a better understanding of phoronid ecology in coastal waters, we retrospectively analysed 145 plankton samples collected from two coastal sites in Ireland (Lough Hyne and Bantry Bay). Samples were collected using plankton nets from depths of 20 and 40 m. Phoronids were present in 37.7% and 38.2% of samples, with mean abundances of 0.3 +/- 0.5 ind. m(-3) and 1.2 +/- 2.8 ind. m(-3), respectively, and were identified as Phoronis muelleri and Phoronis hippocrepia. Phoronids were present consistently each year from April to October at Lough Hyne and from February to October at Bantry Bay. Comparisons with other taxa in Lough Hyne show that abundances are similar to those of fish larvae (1.1 +/- 1.8 ind. m(-3)) and echinoderm larvae (2.3 +/- 4.4 ind. m(-3)). Examination of these samples from Irish waters suggests that phoronids are more abundant in temperate waters than previously reported.

AB  - There is a lack of knowledge of the arthropod communities in both wild hazelnut and cultivated hybrid hazelnut ecosystems in the Midwestern United States. Our goal was to characterize the composition of these arthropod communities in hazelnut plantings. We surveyed six experimental plantings of hazelnuts in Wisconsin and two in Minnesota during growing seasons, from May 2017 to August 2021. We used four methods to survey the arthropod community of these plantings: ad libitum survey of specimen observations and collection, dissection of hazelnut buds and nuts, cone traps placed on the ground, and beat sheet sampling of plants. We registered 116 different morphospecies of five classes and 83 families. Arthropods with known feeding habits were grouped into four guilds: 59 herbivores, 36 carnivores (predators, parasites, and parasitoids), 4 decomposers (detritivores and scavengers), and 4 omnivores. While we registered 12 herbivorous species that could potentially cause damage to hazelnuts, we directly observed nine of them feeding upon or damaging plant parts: Phytoptus avellanae s.l. Nalepa (Eriophyoidea: Phytoptidae), Curculio obtusus Blanchard and Strophosoma melanogrammum Forster (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Popillia japonica Newman (Coleoptera: Scarabeidae), Parthenolecanium sp. (Hemiptera: Coccidae), Euschistus servus euschistoides Say (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae), Acleris sp., and Choristoneura rosaceana Harris (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). We also registered eight species of parasites or parasitoids that could offer biocontrol services in the cropping system. These findings provide a foundation for future targeted studies on potential pests and beneficial arthropods, as well as ecological interactions within the hybrid hazelnut ecosystem in the Midwest.

AB  - The expansion and intensification of agriculture in the last century has reduced floral resources for wild insect pollinators, contributing to their decline and potentially lowering pollination services for crop production. Flowering cover crops that can overwinter in harsh climates, such as winter camelina (Camelina sativa [L.] Crantz), can provide key resources for spring-emerging insects and fit into forage cropping systems in the Upper Midwest region of the United States where corn silage production is an important source of dairy forage. However, the amount of floral cover and length of time that cover is available, as well as the practicality of integrating camelina in annual forage cropping systems, depends on fall planting time and cover crop mix. We performed a plot-scale, randomized block experiment to measure spring floral cover and insect flower visitation of winter camelina and uncultivated flowers. This experiment occurred across 2 years in 3 cover crop mixes: 1) camelina monoculture, 2) camelina, triticale, hairy vetch mix, and 3) camelina, cereal rye, hairy vetch mix. In the second year, 3 camelina monocultures were planted at three different fall planting times, which constituted additional treatments: 4) early, 5) mid, and 6) late plantings. We included an unseeded fallow treatment, i.e., no cover crop, for comparison. Cover crop mixes and camelina in monoculture planted simultaneously (all mid-fall plantings) provided equal amounts of floral cover and supported comparable insect visitation rates the following spring. For monocultures, camelina planted earlier in the fall had the highest spring floral cover, and the latest planting time provided virtually no flower cover. Despite the large proportion of total floral cover attributed to dandelion in many plots, flower visitation exclusively increased with increasing camelina floral cover. However, there was an upper asymptote at which adding more camelina did not further increase visitation. Our study demonstrates that winter camelina can provide resources for insects in early spring when planted in a monoculture or mix the previous September as compared to winter fallow, though the period of flowering is short. We also show that although dandelion may provide floral cover early in the growing season, camelina may be more attractive to insects and provides an important spring floral resource.

AB  - Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and the Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) are mosquito-borne pathogens capable of transmission from animals to humans, causing significant economic and public health impacts in affected countries. Pigs serve as amplifying hosts for JEV and potentially play a role in the natural ecology of MVEV. Reports of JEV viral shedding underscore the prospect of wastewater surveillance for early detection and intervention for animal and human health. To assess the feasibility of wastewater surveillance, the decay rates of JEV and MVEV RNA were determined under the simulated diurnal temperatures in summer and winter by seeding these viruses in piggery wastewater collected from three potential surveillance sites (shed, pit, and lagoon). During a 52-day experiment, a one log10 reduction in RNA copies was found for JEV within 24.8-36.4 days, while MVEV experienced a 90% reduction ranging from 15.5 to 24.4 days, which was significantly faster than that of JEV. Seasonal temperature and site-specific differences significantly influenced the RNA decay rates of both viruses in piggery wastewater samples. These data indicated the sufficient persistence of JEV and MVEV under diurnal temperatures in summer and winter conditions, which would facilitate surveillance of viruses in piggery environments.

AB  - When, where, and what predators prey upon salmon is fundamental to understanding their mortality in a given region. We reviewed the available information about predators of three Japanese Pacific salmon species throughout their life history: chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta, pink salmon O. gorbuscha, and masu salmon O. masou. Thirteen fish species, including seven salmonid species, and three avian species, such as great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo, have been described as predators of fry/juvenile salmon in rivers. Predators of fry/juveniles in estuarine-coastal areas have been relatively well investigated and include 15 fish species, including young masu salmon, and five avian species, such as rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata. Four large fish species, such as salmon shark Lamna ditropis, one baleen whale species, and pinnipeds are reported predators of subadults in the open sea. In the sea around Japan, including the Pacific, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Japan Sea, we found evidence of predation on subadults, adults, unknown life-stage salmon by four pinniped species and three species of baleen and toothed whales. Adults returning to rivers were preyed upon by two mammal species including brown bear Ursus arctos and two raptor species. We also identified information gaps for specific predators by region and life stage. Collaborating with non-researchers to obtain observation records of predation on salmon is one method that could efficiently expand our knowledge of local predators. We further suggest using the information from our review to incorporate predation effects as well as environmental factors in models examining salmon stock fluctuation mechanisms.

AB  - Long-term pre-release evaluations of how invasive plants respond to herbivory in introduced ranges can help identify the most effective biological control agents. However, most evaluations have been conducted within only one generation of introduced invasive species. This study tested effects across seven generations of simulated herbivory (i.e., defoliation) and habitat types on the invasive weed Alternanthera philoxeroides. We found total biomass of A. philoxeroides was decreased by defoliation during the first three generations when grown in a simulated aquatic habitat, but was decreased by defoliation only in the first generation when grown in a simulated terrestrial habitat. Defoliation significantly decreased stem diameter and collenchyma thickness and increased cortex thickness and total phenol production in A. philoxeroides grown in a simulated terrestrial or aquatic habitat during the first generation, but showed little effect during the following six successive generations. The associations between stem anatomical structural parameters and biomass significantly differed between non-defoliation and defoliation treatments in the simulated aquatic habitat, but not in the simulated terrestrial habitat. Our results suggest simulated herbivory exerted successful biological control on A. philoxeroides during the first generation in a simulated terrestrial habitat and the first three generations in a simulated aquatic habitat, but failed to restrain the vegetative offspring of A. philoxeroides. This failure of long-term biological control on A. philoxeroides might be caused by changes in the stem anatomical structure and compensatory growth. Our study highlights the need for long-term pre-release evaluation when testing the efficiency of biological control agents.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) deposition significantly affects the growth and the function of invasive clonal plants. However, the effects of heterogeneous N supply with different frequencies on the growth and the potential contribution of clonal integration in invasion plants are still unclear, especially in the complex environment considering ramet damage. To address this question, apical and basal ramets of the clonal invader Hydrocotyle vulgaris were connected or disconnected, N was added to the basal ramets with a high frequency, a low frequency, or no supply, and the total N quantity was the same for the different frequency. Furthermore, 8 aphids were placed on the apical ramets, and 30% of each leaf was cut off to cause damage. The connection between ramets significantly increased the biomass, total carbon (C), and total N of the basal and apical ramets. Higher frequency N supply significantly increased the biomass, total C, and total N of the basal ramets and the entire clonal fragment biomass. The damage had no significant effect on the growth of basal and apical ramets. Especially, under the high N frequency and ramet damage condition, the connection between ramets more significantly increased the biomass, total C, and total N of the apical ramets and the entire clonal fragment biomass. In addition, the uptake rates of (NH4+)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15 in H. vulgaris had no significant difference, and N supply increased the uptake rates of (NH4+)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15 of the basal ramets. Our results suggest that both higher frequency N supply and clonal integration are beneficial to the growth of H. vulgaris. Moreover, the heterogeneous N supply with high frequency and ramet damage increases the benefits of clonal integration in H. vulgaris. These findings improve our understanding of the response of clonal invader H. vulgaris to nitrogen deposition and ramet damage.

AB  - Legal hunting of threatened species-and especially the recreational practice of "trophy hunting"-is controversial with ethical objections being increasingly voiced. Less public attention has been paid to how hunting (even of threatened species) can be useful as a conservation tool, and likely outcomes if this was stopped. As case studies, we examine the regulated legal hunting of two African rhino species in South Africa and Namibia over the last half-century. Counter-intuitively, removing a small number of specific males can enhance population demography and genetic diversity, encourage range expansion, and generate meaningful socioeconomic benefits to help fund effective conservation (facilitated by appropriate local institutional arrangements). Legal hunting of African rhinos has been sustainable, with very small proportions of populations hunted each year, and greater numbers of both species today in these countries than when controlled recreational hunting began. Terminating this management option and significant funding source could have negative consequences at a time when rhinos are being increasingly viewed as liabilities and revenue generation for wildlife areas is being significantly impacted by COVID-19. Provided that there is appropriate governance, conservation of certain highly threatened species can be supported by cautiously selective and limited legal hunting.

AB  - Plants interact with a diversity of phytophagous insects above- and belowground. By inducing plant defence, one insect herbivore species can antagonize or facilitate other herbivore species feeding on the same plant, even when they are separated in space and time. Through systemic plant-mediated interactions, leaf-chewing herbivores may affect the preference and performance of root-feeding herbivores. We studied how six different leaf-chewing herbivore species of Brassica oleracea plants affected oviposition preference and larval performance of the root-feeding specialist Delia radicum. We expected that female D. radicum flies would oviposit where larval performance was highest, in accordance with the preference-performance hypothesis. We also assessed how the different leaf-chewing herbivore species affected defence-related gene expression in leaves and primary roots of B. oleracea, both before and after infestation with the root herbivore. Our results show that leaf-chewing herbivores can negatively affect the performance of root-feeding D. radicum larvae, although the effects were relatively weak. Surprisingly, we found that adult D. radicum females show a strong preference to oviposit on plants infested with a leaf-chewing herbivore. Defence-related genes in primary roots of B. oleracea plants were affected by the leaf-chewing herbivores, but these changes were largely overridden upon local induction by D. radicum. Infestation by leaf herbivores makes plants more attractive for oviposition by D. radicum females, while decreasing larval performance. Therefore, our findings challenge the preference-performance hypothesis in situations where other herbivore species are present.

AB  - The effects of competition can have far-reaching consequences for individuals, populations, and communities and therefore we should strive toward a deeper understanding of competitive interactions. In some cases, dietary generalists may be predicted to experience weak competition effects because of their ability to use a wide range of host plants. However, competition between insects frequently occurs indirectly, which can hinder insects' abilities to avoid competitive interactions. Therefore, competition may be as strong among dietary generalists as among dietary specialists. Yet competition between insects that are dietary generalists is infrequently studied. We tested for evidence of competitive interactions between two common, temporally separated, generalist insects: the western tent caterpillar (Malacosoma californicum), which feeds early in the season, and the fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea), which feeds later in the season. Both species frequently use a common host plant species (chokecherry) as a preferred host at our field sites. We tested the relative strength of bottom-up effects resulting from competitive interactions between these two generalists with laboratory-rearing trials at the relevant time of year for each insect. We recorded three common fitness measures (development time, pupal mass, and survival) for caterpillars reared on chokecherry with no damage from either of our focal species, with tent caterpillar damage, and with fall webworm damage. To test the strength of top-down pressures on fall webworm larval fitness and any potential interactions with bottom-up effects, we reared larvae in the field either exposed to or protected from predators on host plants that either did or did not have tent caterpillars feeding on them earlier in the season. We found evidence of bottom-up fitness effects on tent caterpillars and top-down and bottom-up fitness effects on fall webworms confirming that tent caterpillars and fall webworms compete indirectly. Tent caterpillars had lower pupal mass when reared on leaves from shrubs damaged by fall webworms. Fall webworms had lower pupal mass and longer development time when reared on leaves from shrubs damaged by tent caterpillars. In field trials, fall webworms reared on shrubs damaged by tent caterpillars had a lower survival and pupal mass. We show evidence of indirect competition in temporally separated generalists through leaf quality (bottom-up effects) and natural enemies (top-down effects).

AB  - Termites are one of the most relevant groups for recycling nutrients and keeping the flow of energy in ecosystems. Although their role as lignocellulose decomposers is the focus of studies, they also act as dung recyclers, but their importance in this process is poorly understood. Here we performed manipulation experiments to determine dung removal by termites in forest remnants and cattle pastures in a fragmented Atlantic Forest landscape. We used wire bags of different mesh sizes placed along transects in three forest fragments and pastures for 10 days to compare the contribution of termites and other coprophagous macrodetritivores to dung removal. Our results indicated that termites removed more dung in pastures than in the forest fragments. In addition, dung beetle exclusion significantly reduced the percentage of dung removal within forest fragments, but not on pastures, indicating termites are important dung recyclers in pastures.

AB  - Black rhinos experience suboptimal population growth in Kenya, thus fecal progestagens were measured in 17 females at Ol Jogi Wildlife Conservancy to assess ovarian function. Regular and irregular cycles were observed, however neither were associated with poor reproductive performance. These methods and findings are foundational for future studies.
   Eastern black rhinos (Diceros bicornis michaeli) are a critically endangered species living in diverse habitats across Africa. In Kenya, once threatened with extinction due to massive poaching pressures, increased protection has resulted in losses being less than 1% annually today. Still, some populations have failed to achieve desired population growth targets. At Ol Jogi Wildlife Conservancy, some individuals are experiencing sub-optimal reproduction based on historical calving records and long inter-calving intervals (>3 years). Hormones drive the reproductive process, so non-invasive assessments of endocrine patterns can be useful indicators of individual reproductive health. In this study, we analysed longitudinal fecal progestagen metabolite (fPM) concentrations in all breeding female eastern black rhinos at Ol Jogi (n = 17) and compared the prevalence of irregular estrous cycles (longer or shorter than 20-40 days) and anestrous periods (interluteal period more than twice the length of a normal follicular phase, i.e. > 10 days) between optimal (inter-calving interval < 3 years) and sub-optimal (>3 years) reproducing individuals. Ten rhinos were pregnant during at least part of the study period. A total of 12 complete cycles were observed in seven females with an average length of 36 +/- 3 days and equal numbers of regular and irregular cycles. Single anestrous periods averaging 67 +/- 13 days were observed in five females. Surprisingly, a majority of cycles in optimal reproducing individuals were categorized as irregular based on fPM profiles. Overall, results suggest that irregular ovarian activity and isolated bouts of anestrus do not have negative impacts on reproductive performance in this subpopulation at Ol Jogi. A high priority is to continue using noninvasive hormone monitoring to evaluate how ecological or other variables influence reproductive success in this and other eastern black rhino subpopulations in Kenya.

AB  - In lactating mammary glands, tight junctions (TJs) prevent blood from mixing with milk and maintain epithelial cell polarity, which is important for milk production. This study aimed to investigate the effect of sodium acetate and sodium butyrate (SB) stimulation direction on the TJ barrier function, which is measured with regard to transepithelial electrical resistance and fluorescein flux, in goat mammary epithelial cells. The expression and localization of the TJ proteins claudin-3 and claudin-4 were examined using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. SB treatment in the lower chamber of cell culture inserts adversely affected the TJ barrier function, whereas sodium acetate barely had any effect, regardless of stimulation direction. In addition, SB treatment in the lower chamber significantly upregulated claudin-3 and claudin-4, whereas TJ proteins showed intermittent localization. Moreover, SB induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ARC155858, a monocarboxylate transporter-1 inhibitor, alleviated the adverse impact of SB on TJs and the associated ER stress. Interestingly, sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate, a butyrate metabolite, did not affect the TJ barrier function. Our findings indicate that sodium acetate and SB influence the TJ barrier function differently, and excessive cellular uptake of SB can disrupt TJs and induce ER stress.

AB  - Domesticated animals have undergone significant changes in their behavior, morphology, and physiological functions during domestication. To identify the changes in gene expression associated with domestication, we collected the RNA-seq data of pigs, chickens, wild boars, and red junglefowl from public databases and performed a meta-analysis. Gene expression was quantified, and the expression ratio between domesticated animals and their wild ancestors (DW-ratio) was calculated. Genes were classified as "upregulated", "downregulated", or "unchanged" based on their DW-ratio, and the DW-score was calculated for each gene. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that genes upregulated in pigs were related to defense from viral infection, whereas those upregulated in chickens were associated with aminoglycan and carbohydrate derivative catabolic processes. Genes commonly upregulated in pigs and chickens are involved in the immune response, olfactory learning, epigenetic regulation, cell division, and extracellular matrix. In contrast, genes upregulated in wild boar and red junglefowl are related to stress response, cell proliferation, cardiovascular function, neural regulation, and energy metabolism. These findings provide valuable insights into the genetic basis of the domestication process and highlight potential candidate genes for breeding applications.

AB  - Fishes of the Mugilidae family are poorly known from a taxonomic perspective, largely because of their conservative morphology. In this paper, we aim to fill the knowledge gap and data deficiency regarding the genetic diversity of mullets occurring in southern peninsular India. A comprehensive mitochondrial phylogeny based on 238 COI sequences (78 newly generated) and three species delimitation methods (ASAP, RESL, and ABGD) confirmed the presence of 21 species of mullets within eight genera in southern peninsular India. These include one species each under the genera Rhinomugil Gill 1863, Minimugil Durand, Chen, Shen, Fu, and Borsa, 2012, Plicomugil Schultz 1953, and Ellochelon Whitley 1930; seven species of Planiliza Whitley 1945; four species of Crenimugil Schultz 1946; four species of Osteomugil Luther 1982; and two species of the "Mugil cephalus Linnaeus 1758" complex-though with uncertainty regarding the exact geographic origin of one of the two species of the "Mugil cephalus" complex and one species phylogenetically close to Planiliza subviridis (Valenciennes 1836). We provide an overview of the specific geographical regions in southern peninsular India, and "species groups", which require future research using an integrative approach, so as to unravel the true extent of mullet diversity and their distribution in the region.

AB  - Accidental oil spills significantly threaten marine ecosystems and fisheries, impacting biodiversity and ecological health. This study examines the downstream transcriptomic responses of Atlantic halibut larvae exposed to crude oil during organogenesis. Findings show concentration-dependent transcriptional abnormalities. Pathway analysis at 10 days post-hatch (dph), 11 days after cessation of oil exposure, indicates downregulation of inflammatory and reparative pathways. By 18 dph, tissue-specific analyses reveal activation of these pathways, especially in head tissues, alongside upregulation of neuronal signaling pathways. This highlights the complex relationship between oil exposure and transcriptional responses, emphasizing recovery mechanisms represented by regulation of inflammatory, repair and wound healing pathways following oil exposure. The activation of repair pathways in surviving larvae suggests compensatory processes to address oil-induced damage. These novel insights enhance understanding of the molecular mechanisms of oil toxicity and the lasting effects on marine organisms.

AB  - Herbivore identity and intensity are important in mediating plant defense responses, but the effects of their interaction on the plant metabolome have not yet been fully explored. Here, gas chromatography mass spectrometry was utilized to detect the metabolic changes in leaves, stems and roots of the common reed Phragmites australis infested with different intensity combinations of leaf-chewing Laelia coenosa and stem piercing-sucking Dimorphopterus pallipes. The supervised partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed that feeding by the two insects distinctly changed the metabolic profiles of all plant tissues. Furthermore, different intensities of the two herbivores resulted in significantly different metabolites in leaves. Only a high intensity of D. pallipes activated a distinct metabolic profile in roots, whereas there was no difference in stem metabolites in response to different herbivore intensities. Significant combined feeding effects of the two herbivores on plant metabolic composition was only detected in leaves infested with high herbivore intensity. Generally, D. pallipes feeding had a stronger effect on metabolite contents in different tissues compared to L. coenosa feeding. There was mostly a linear relationship between responses of leaf metabolites and herbivore intensity, whereas root metabolites generally showed non-linear responses to herbivore intensity. Additionally, there were significant interactions during simultaneous feeding of the two herbivores in leaves, which tended to be antagonistic. In general, our study suggested that plant responses to herbivory vary among tissues and are affected differently based on herbivore identity and intensity, which may vary in their interactions on plant metabolites at the whole-plant level.

AB  - Although composting, a measure to dispose agricultural waste, is widely accepted and applied, specific knowledge of microbially driven effects on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions during composting remains limited. Here, we monitored the impact of sawdust on N2O emissions during pig manure composting. The results suggested that adding sawdust to the compost improved the compost temperature and reduced N2O emissions. The addition of sawdust significantly altered the bacterial community structure and enhanced community turnover during the composting process. The addition of sawdust significantly reduced the relative abundance of denitrification and ureolysis, while increasing the relative abundance of nitrogen fixation. Specifically, adding sawdust may reduce N2O emissions by reducing the relative abundance of Salinithrix, Truepera, Azomonas, Iamia, Silanimonas, Phycisphaera, and Gp21 during the thermophilic and mature phases of the composting period.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the immediate energy, carbon, and other nutrient substrates for microbial growth and, therefore, plays an essential role in agroecosystem biochemical processes. The aim of this study was to elucidate the interrelationships among watermelon growth, DOM chemical characteristics, nutrient content, and microbial functional diversity in organic soilless growing substrates. We analyzed the effect of no fertilizer application (CK), PK fertilizer application (PK), and NPK fertilizer application (NPK) on fruit yield of watermelon, DOM chemical structure, nutrient status, and microbial functional diversity in organic substrates cultivated with watermelon. Compared with the CK, the NPK treatment resulted in a significantly lower fruit yield of watermelon, lower DOC concentration, significantly higher DON concentration, and higher NO3--N concentration. The application of NPK chemical fertilizer in substrates decreased the degree of humification in DOM and microbial functional diversity compared with CK treatment. Our results demonstrate that the quality of DOM plays an important role in improving the fruit yield of watermelon and is tightly related to microbial functional diversity in organic substrates.

AB  - Simple Summary: In recent years, the increased presence of wildlife in habitats close to urban settlements has raised concerns about the risk of pathogen transmission from wild animals to humans due to the spread of different parasites. For this reason, a survey aimed at describing the dispersal and parasitism level of two cervid ectoparasites was carried out in the northern Apennines, in central Italy. The presence of two hippoboscids, the autochthonous Lipoptena cervi and allochthonous L. fortisetosa, native to Eastern Asia and recently recorded in Italy, were assessed on their main host species (red deer, fallow deer, and roe deer), considering host sex and age. The alien species L. fortisetosa was found to be widespread in the study area, most likely competing with L. cervi. Moreover, red deer seemed to be the favored host of both flies, with differences in sex and age class preferences. This study demonstrated the importance of regularly monitoring the populations of these parasites, especially the invasive species, due to the risks to human health, as these insects are potential vectors of pathogens.
   Lipoptena fortisetosa and L. cervi are hematophagous ectoparasites belonging to the Hippoboscidae family and preferentially living on cervids. In recent years, they have received specific attention due to the great increase in the abundance of their host species, and to their medical and veterinary importance as possible vectors of pathogens harmful to humans and animals. The aim of this study was to investigate the parasitism level of both of these flies on their main hosts in Italy, which are red deer, fallow deer, and roe deer, and to highlight a possible preference for a species, sex, or age class among the hosts. Deer keds were collected by examining 326 cervids hunted in the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines. Outcomes showed that L. fortisetosa has greatly spread throughout the study area, where it competes with the autochthonous L. cervi. Moreover, red deer was the favored host species of both ectoparasites, while different preferences for host sex and age classes were observed in the two hippoboscids. The regular monitoring of deer ked populations, especially the allochthonous L. fortisetosa, which is continuously spreading in Europe, is recommended to expand the knowledge on these parasitic species that are potentially dangerous to public health.

AB  - The blackberry poses a threat as an invasive plant in various regions worldwide, where it aggressively competes with native species and risks delicate ecosystems. Livestock grazing has emerged as a potential strategy to mitigate its spread. This study investigated the effects of seasonal variations and altitude on the chemical composition and in vitro degradability of blackberry leaves. The leaves accessible to goats were collected in the Northwestern Italian Alps across all seasons at three altitudes (low: 450 m, medium: 700 m, high: 1000 m). The findings indicated that blackberry leaves can serve as a cost-effective, high-protein, and high-fiber feed for ruminants in these regions. However, the goats exhibited a limited capacity for fiber degradation. Furthermore, the nutritional value of these leaves was significantly influenced by the season, altitude, and their interaction. Spring leaves had the highest protein content (241.9 g/kg dry matter) and the best digestibility, with lower lignin levels (69 g/kg dry matter). At higher altitudes, lignin content decreased significantly during winter compared to the other seasons, resulting in a significant increase in fiber degradability. These insights offer crucial guidance for optimizing the utilization of the blackberry plant in goat feeding systems and underscores the necessity of considering both seasonal and altitudinal factors in grazing management practices.

AB  - The propagation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) in the saline-alkali soils and associated environmental factors remains unknown. In this study, soil samples from the Yellow River Delta, China with four salinity gradients were characterized by their physiochemical properties, and shotgun meta-genomic sequencing was used to identify the ARGs and VFs carried by microorganisms. Soil salinization significantly reduced the relative abundances of Solirubrobacterales, Propionibacteriales, and Micrococcales, and quorum sensing in microorganisms. The number of ARGs and VFs significantly decreased in medium and high saline-alkali soils as compared with that in non-saline-alkali soil, however, the ARGs of Bacitracin, and the VFs of iron uptake system, adherence, and stress protein increased significantly in saline-alkali soils. Spearman analysis showed that the ARGs of fluoroquinolone, tetracycline, aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, and tigecycline were positively correlated with soil pH. Similarly, we observed an increased contribution to the ARGs and VFs by taxa belonging to Solirubrobacterales and Gemmatimonadales, respectively. The control plot was mainly improved from saline-alkali land through application of animal manure, which tended to contain large amounts of ARGs and VFs in this study. Further studies are needed to observe ARGs and VFs in the saline-alkali land for multiple years and speculate the potential risks caused by varied ARGs and VFs to the soil ecosystem and human health.

AB  - Circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations in newborn goat kids are not sufficient to protect the animal against external agents. Therefore, consumption of colostrum, rich in immune components, shortly after birth is crucial. Traditional laboratory methods used to measure IgG concentrations, such as ELISA or RID, are reliable but costly and impractical for many farmers. This study proposes a more accessible alternative for farmers to predict IgG concentration in goat colostrum by integrating color-based techniques with machine learning models, specifically decision trees and neural networks, through the development of two regression models based on colostrum color data from Majorera dairy goats. A total of 813 colostrum samples were collected in a previous study (June 1997-April 2003) that utilized multiple regression analysis as a reference to verify that applying data science techniques improves accuracy and reliability. The decision tree model outperformed the neural network, achieving higher accuracy and lower error rates. Both models provided predictions that closely matched IgG concentrations obtained by ELISA. Therefore, this methodology offers a practical and affordable solution for the on-farm assessment of colostrum quality (i.e., IgG concentration). This approach could significantly improve farm management practices, ensuring better health outcomes in newborn animals by facilitating timely and accurate colostrum quality evaluation.

AB  - Pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and most other farmed species are social animals for whom social isolation is known to cause stress. However, their social nature is commonly ignored in behavioural and cognitive tasks, on which they are trained and tested individually, which may impact their welfare and the validity of test results. We chose the Judgement Bias Task (JBT), a promising proxy measure of affective states, to compare training duration, task performance and behaviour of pigs trained and tested in social isolation (ISO; n = 12) with pigs trained and tested with physical and visual contact to social companions through an opening covered with wire mesh (SOC; n = 12). Eleven SOC pigs and eight ISO pigs learned the task, but SOC and ISO pigs did not differ in training duration or task performance when tested. However, ISO pigs showed a higher frequency of all behavioural measures indicative of stress, i.e. high-pitched vocalisation, freezing, exit-approaching behaviour, heavy escape attempts, defaecation and urination compared to SOC pigs. Future research should replicate our study, additionally in combination with other treatments like different housing conditions, to investigate potential interacting effects on learning and task performance. Several open questions remain, but the unambiguous behavioural differences we found strongly advocate for more research to decrease the stress and thus improve the welfare of pigs and other social animals used in behavioural and cognitive tasks.

AB  - Background and aims - Where one or several tree species come to dominate patches of tropical forest, as many masting ectomycorrhizal legumes do in Central Africa, ecological theory predicts they may be prone to herbivory, which might alter their reproductive output. This was indirectly investigated in lowland rainforest in Cameroon for Tetraberlinia korupensis, whose crowns were attacked in 2008 by an outbreaking black caterpillar-identified as an Achaea sp., probably A. catocaloides-in Korup National Park.
   Material and methods - Field-collected data on tree-level seed and fruit (pod) production of T. korupensis in its 2008 masting event were compared with that of its two co-dominant neighbours (T. bifoliolata, Microberlinia bisulcata), whose populations masted in 2007 (and 2010). To do this, bivariate regression models (linear, polynomial, ZiG [zero-inflated gamma model]), contingency table analysis, and non-parametric measures of dispersion were used.
   Key results - Assuming T. korupensis is prone to Achaea caterpillar attacks, empirical data support the hypothesized lower proportion of adults participating in its masting (54% in 2008) than for either masting population of M. bisulcata (98% in 2007, 89% in 2010) or T. bifoliolata (96% in 2007, 78% in 2010). These fruiting T. korupensis trees were about one-third larger in stem diameter than conspecific non-fruiters and produced as many pods and seeds per capita as T. bifoliolata. However, regressions only modestly support the hypothesis that the positive tree size-fecundity relationship for T. korupensis was weaker (i.e. lower adj. R-2) than for M. bisulcata (whose leaves are morphologically similar) or T. bifoliolata, with mostly similar dispersion about the median among these species.
   Conclusion - Altogether, the findings suggest a role for tolerance in nutrient-poor forests. It is postulated that instead of conferring resistance to herbivores, the ectomycorrhizas associated with these trees may enable them to more quickly recover from potential yet unpredictable insect outbreaks.

AB  - Morphological variability in response to environmental features is an important feature of alien species, increasing their adaptive capabilities and facilitating naturalization in new habitats. The prussian carp Carassius gibelio is currently very widespread in the world. Much of its current range is believed to be acquired as a result of human activity, with the prussian carp recognized as an invasive species capable of having a significant impact on recipient ecosystems. On the territory of Uzbekistan, prussian carp has been known in the lower reaches of the Syr-Darya and Amu-Darya since the 4th millennium BC, and was also recorded in the first half of the 20th century. However, its numbers were not large. In the 1960s, the Amur form of the prussian carp was introduced into the water bodies of Uzbekistan, as a result of a targeted introduction from the "Savvino" fish farm near Moscow and the accidental import of herbivorous fish with juveniles from the Russian Far East, after which its unauthorized resettlement began with planting material of cultivated cyprinids. In the 1970s, prussian carp found their way into the Charvak Reservoir. This is a mountain cold-water reservoir, formed on the Chirchik River (the right tributary of the Syrdarya River) and is located between the spurs of the Western Tien-Shan. With an area of only 37 km2, 2 , it has a volume of about 2 km3 3 and a depth of more than 50 m. The reservoir is characterized by summer drawdown of the water level used for irrigation in the river valley Chirchik. This causes an almost complete absence of vegetation in the water area of the reservoir. Despite the atypical conditions, the prussian carp formed a self-sustaining population. There is none below the reservoir dam to the middle reaches of the Chirchik River. Indicators of counting characteristics of prussian carp in reservoir are D III-IV 17-19; A II 5-6; 26-30 (average 29) scales in the lateral line; on the first gill arch, 40-53 (on average 48) gill rakers and generally correspond to the characteristics in this climatic zone. Indices of plastic characteristics, both in traditional morphological analysis (see Table 1 ) and in the analysis of morphometric distances according to the "truss protocol" assessment method ( see Table 2 ), do not have pronounced differences from the indicators of prussian carp living in a lowland reservoir Tudakul and in the fish ponds of the fish hatchery of the Research Institute of Fisheries of Uzbekistan. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the cyt b gene of prussian carp from the Charvak reservoir showed their similarity with samples from the upper reaches of the Yangtze river, China ( see Table 3 ), which proves Far Eastern origin of prussian carp ih the Charvak reservoir. It is likely that it was the prussian carp, brought from the Far East, that ensured the growth in the number of the species in Uzbekistan. The question of the breadth of distribution of the Amur form of prussian carp in the region and the preservation of its native form currently remains open and requires further research using molecular genetic methods.

AB  - The critically endangered Mona Island iguana, Cyclura stejnegeri, is threatened by nest predation by feral pigs, invasive plants that reduce nesting area, and high juvenile mortality. Even though studies in the last 45 years have been sporadic, they had led to different management actions such as protecting nesting areas from feral pig incursion and expanding suitable nesting sites by eradicating the Australian pine (Casuarina equisetifolia) and other invasive plant species. In addition, from 1999 to 2016 a head-start program (HST) was implemented, to increase the recruitment and survival of juvenile iguanas. In 2021, we conducted a 10-week mark-recapture study to survey the population. Data obtained suggest that the Mona iguana lifespans can exceed 32 years, iguanas are very philopatric staying in the same areas over many years, and that health parameters for HST individuals are similar to those of wild ones. These findings provide new information that should be considered when implementing management actions directed at guaranteeing the survival of the Mona iguana.

AB  - Asiatic wild ass, or kulan (Equus hemionus kulan) were once a key species of the Eurasian steppes and deserts. In Kazakhstan they went extinct by the 1930s. Early reintroductions have reestablished the species in two protected areas, but the species has reclaimed <1% of their former range and remained absent from central Kazakhstan. To initiate restoration in this vast region, we captured and transported a first group of nine wild kulan to a large pre-release enclosure in the Torgai region in 2017, and two more in 2019. We used direct observations and post-release movement data of four kulan equipped with GPS-Iridium collars to document their adaptation process in a vast novel habitat without conspecifics. For comparison with movements in the source populations, we additionally equipped two kulan in Altyn Emel National Park and six in Barsa Kelmes State Nature Reserve. The nine transported kulan formed a cohesive group with very high movement correlation in the enclosure. After release, the group initially stayed tightly together but started to break up by mid-May and all kulan travelled independently by mid-August. With 48,680-136,953 km(2), the 95% Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimation ranges of the reintroduced kulan were huge and about 10-100 times larger than those in the source populations. The reintroduced mares never reconnected, there was no evidence of successful reproduction, and two of the four collared mares were killed by poachers and one died of natural causes. At least one stallion survived in the wild, but the fate of the other uncollared animals remains unclear. We speculate that the fission-fusion dynamics and low movement correlation of kulan societies and the need for migratory movements harbours the risk that animals released into a novel environment loose contact with each other. This risk is likely enhanced in steppe habitats where movement constraining factors are absent. Further kulan reintroductions to the steppes and deserts of central Kazakhstan should aim to release larger groups and build up the free-ranging population quickly to reach a critical mass, increasing the chance of kulan encountering conspecifics to successfully breed and increase their chances of survival.

AB  - Beef and mutton production has been aided by breeding to integrate allelic diversity for myostatin (MSTN), but a lack of diversity in the MSTN germplasm has limited similar advances in pig farming. Moreover, insurmountable challenges with congenital lameness and a dearth of data about the impacts of feed conversion, reproduction, and meat quality in MSTN-edited pigs have also currently blocked progress. Here, in a largest-to-date evaluation of multiple MSTN-edited pig populations, we demonstrated a practical alternative edit-site-based solution that overcomes the major production obstacle of hindlimb weakness. We also provide long-term and multidomain datasets for multiple breeds that illustrate how MSTN-editing can sustainably increase the yields of breed-specific lean meat and the levels of desirable lipids without deleteriously affecting feed-conversion rates or litter size. Apart from establishing a new benchmark for the data scale and quality of genome-edited animal production, our study specifically illustrates how gene-editing site selection profoundly impacts the phenotypic outcomes in diverse genetic backgrounds.

AB  - Strategies to help producers cope with unpredictable forage production associated with low and variable pre-cipitation patterns on arid rangelands are needed, particularly if global warming trends continue as projected. One option is to identify cattle biotypes compatible with less productive shrubby landscapes. One such biotype is the Raramuri Criollo (RC) from the Copper Canyon of northern Mexico. This small-framed animal exhibits travelling behaviors that allow it to exploit vegetation at a greater distance from water, although it is unknown whether RC have dietary preferences that differ from European breeds typically raised in the southwestern U.S.A. We examined diet selection of RC vs. desert adapted Angus x Hereford (AH) crossbreds typical of the region using DNA metabarcoding to determine the proportion of plant species in fecal samples. Fecal samples were collected from 10 cows of each breed in two adjacent pastures during two seasons (growing and dormancy; four weeks per season) for three consecutive years. Dominant plant species in fecal samples of both cattle breeds were Atriplex canescens (four-wing saltbush), Hoffmannseggia glauca (hog potato), Hopia obtusa (vine mesquite), Setaria leucopila (plains bristlegrass), Sporobolus spp. (S. contractus , S. flexuosus , and S. giganteus), Pleuraphis mutica (tobosa), and Bouteloua eriopoda (black grama), which is consistent with previous studies in the region using different tech-niques for assessing dietary plant composition of other breeds of cattle. Only a few differences were detected between breeds. Compared to AH, fecal samples from RC tended to contain a higher proportion of mesquite and Yucca spp. (P < 0.07) and less Ephedra spp. (P < 0.06). The only grass species that differed between breeds was black grama (P < 0.05), with AH fecal samples containing about twice as much as RC cows (~8% vs. 4%). This finding could have important implications for conservation of black grama in the Chihuahuan Desert.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of this paper was to present the current situation of native sheep breeding in Poland, in terms of the significance and the effects of genetic resources protection programmes. The sheep farming tradition in Poland is deeply rooted in culture, particularly in the mountain and foothill regions. Sheep are permanently linked to many areas of country, not only playing an indispensable part in shaping the landscape, but also providing unique products. The most effective method of conserving native breeds is their sustainable management. It is important to maintain and develop the promotion and certification of high-quality products from native breeds and to control the endangered status of local breeds, which must be monitored and updated on an ongoing basis. The sheep population of native breeds, despite their unique features and the ability to adapt to harsh environmental conditions, has significantly decreased in recent years. Due to the low profitability of breeding, many local breeds of sheep in Poland were exposed to the risk of extinction. Many years of crisis in sheep farming have exacerbated this situation. The aim of this paper was to present the current situation of native sheep breeding in Poland, in terms of significance and effects of genetic resources protection programmes. The conservation of genetic resources of sheep aims to maintain and increase the population size while striving to maintain the greatest possible genetic variability. There are 17 native breeds included in the Polish sheep genetic resources conservation programme. A positive element of the implementation of the conservation of genetic resources programme for sheep is the accompanying measures which are based on the use of the non-productive role of the species. Extensive sheep grazing, as a form of nature conservation, serves to preserve valuable natural landscapes and the culture of local communities associated with sheep farming. Production and promotion of quality products, especially using niche markets and short production chains, are essential to ensure the economic viability of farms. These activities must be accompanied by raising public awareness of indigenous breeds and their alternative use in environmental activities, as well as their role in preserving the cultural heritage of local communities, for example through mountain grazing and the production of traditional products.

AB  - The increase in the size of the global population increases the food and energy demand, making the use of pesticides in agricultural and livestock industries unavoidable. Exposure to pesticides can be toxic to the nontarget species, such as humans, wildlife, and livestock, in addition to the target organisms. Various chemicals are used in the livestock industry to control harmful organisms, such as insects, weeds, and parasites. Pigs are one of the most important food sources for humans. In addition, pigs can be used as promising models for assessing the risk of absorption of environmental pollutants through the skin and oral exposure since they are physiologically similar to humans. Exposure to numerous environmental pollutants, such as mycotoxins, persistent organic pollutants, and heavy metals, has been reported to adversely affect growth, fertility, and endocrine homeostasis in pigs. Various pesticides have been observed in porcine tissues, blood, urine, and processed foods; however, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of their effects on porcine health. This review provides a comprehensive description of the characteristics of pesticides that pigs can be exposed to and how their exposure affects porcine reproductive function, intestinal health, and endocrine homeostasis in vivo and in vitro.

AB  - To mitigate the negative effects of emerging wildlife diseases in biodiversity and public health it is critical to accurately forecast pathogen dissemination while incorporating relevant spatio-temporal covariates. Forecasting spatio-temporal processes can often be improved by incorporating scientific knowledge about the dynamics of the process using physical models. Ecological diffusion equations are often used to model epidemiological processes of wildlife diseases where environmental factors play a role in disease spread. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are deep learning algorithms that constrain neural network predictions based on physical laws and therefore are powerful forecasting models useful even in cases of limited and imperfect training data. In this paper, we develop a novel ecological modeling tool using PINNs, which fits a feedforward neural network and simultaneously performs parameter identification in a partial differential equation (PDE) with varying coefficients. We demonstrate the applicability of our model by comparing it with the commonly used Bayesian stochastic partial differential equation method and traditional machine learning approaches, showing that our proposed model exhibits superior prediction and forecasting performance when modeling chronic wasting disease in deer in Wisconsin. Furthermore, our model provides the opportunity to obtain scientific insights into spatio-temporal covariates affecting spread and growth of diseases. This work contributes to future machine learning and statistical methodology development by studying spatio-temporal processes enhanced by prior physical knowledge.

AB  - Coyotes (Canis latrans Say, 1823) have great dietary plasticity, which can variably impact population dynamics and food availability of other wildlife. Understanding coyote diet in a system with a lack of human intervention can provide insight into their natural ecological role, a perspective muddled in the context of extrinsic influences. Our study evaluated the diet of a coyote population in southern Texas where no native wildlife is managed by harvesting, trapping, or supplemental feeding, and compared our results with previous studies. We collected coyote scat from transects on the roads of the East Foundation's San Antonio Viejo Ranch every month of 2022. From morphological analysis of fecal remains, we identified 23 unique species with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780)) and invasive wild pig (Sus scrofa Linnaeus, 1758) being the most common prey items over the year, detected 38.4% and 14.4% among all prey items, respectively. The distinctly high proportion of ungulates consumed as opposed to small mammals is possibly due to high ungulate prey density as well as intraspecific niche differentiation by the unmanaged coyote population, where older, more experienced coyotes select for large mammals and younger coyotes select for small mammals. Future research exploring anthropogenic effects on predator and prey population demographics as well as predator behavior could provide more insight into how human presence may alter predator diet.

AB  - In conservation science, observation-based methods are generally applied to wildlife monitoring. While useful, such approaches are often restricted to well-characterized and conspicuous species. Environmental DNA (eDNA) can complement observation-dependent surveys, as sample collection is generally less labor-intensive. Furthermore, eDNA can be used to simultaneously detect multiple taxa in various habitats. Most eDNA applications rely on short PCR product-based meta-barcoding approaches. However, such approaches may be less robust when applied to genetically uncharacterized species. Hybridization capture techniques while less sensitive than metabarcoding, can identifying divergent sequences, especially those obtained from highly degraded DNA. To assess eDNA based methods for surveillance in a conservation context, we collected samples during the dry season from randomly selected waterholes from a protected area in eastern Cambodia. We applied both hybridization capture enrichment and metabarcoding targeting mammal mitogenomes to water (N = 46) and sediment (N = 10) samples. Seventeen species were detected, including 11 mammals, three amphibians, two reptiles, and one bird. Six species overlapped between the two applied methods. Seven species were hybridization capture-specific detections, and four were metabarcoding-specific. Metabarcoding was more sensitive to abundant or large body-size species while hybridization capture provided more mitogenomic information. While both methods have some advantages over observational approaches, combining them may improve the sensitivity, number of species detected and amount of genetic information obtained from eDNA. We demonstrate that eDNA from tropical forest waterholes can be used to determine the presence of wildlife that may be difficult to detect using other observational approaches.

AB  - Insect herbivores use different cues to locate host plants. The importance of CO2 in this context is not well understood. We manipulated CO2 perception in western corn rootworm (WCR) larvae through RNAi and studied how CO2 perception impacts their interaction with their host plant. The expression of a carbon dioxide receptor, DvvGr2, is specifically required for dose-dependent larval responses to CO2. Silencing CO2 perception or scrubbing plant-associated CO2 has no effect on the ability of WCR larvae to locate host plants at short distances (<9 cm), but impairs host location at greater distances. WCR larvae preferentially orient and prefer plants that grow in well-fertilized soils compared to plants that grow in nutrient-poor soils, a behaviour that has direct consequences for larval growth and depends on the ability of the larvae to perceive rootemitted CO2. This study unravels how CO2 can mediate plant-herbivore interactions by serving as a distance-dependent host location cue.

AB  - Humans may have settled the Faroe Islands and begun using the land for livestock grazing as early as 500 CE, around 300 years earlier than previously believed, according to sedimentary DNA and molecular fecal biomarkers from a lake sediment core.
   The Faroe Islands, a North Atlantic archipelago between Norway and Iceland, were settled by Viking explorers in the mid-9th century CE. However, several indirect lines of evidence suggest earlier occupation of the Faroes by people from the British Isles. Here, we present sedimentary ancient DNA and molecular fecal biomarker evidence from a lake sediment core proximal to a prominent archaeological site in the Faroe Islands to establish the earliest date for the arrival of people in the watershed. Our results reveal an increase in fecal biomarker concentrations and the first appearance of sheep DNA at 500 CE (95% confidence interval 370-610 CE), pre-dating Norse settlements by 300 years. Sedimentary plant DNA indicates an increase in grasses and the disappearance of woody plants, likely due to livestock grazing. This provides unequivocal evidence for human arrival and livestock disturbance in the Faroe Islands centuries before Viking settlement in the 9th century.

AB  - Selection on flowering time in plants is often mediated by multiple agents, including climatic conditions and the intensity of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions with animals. These selective agents can have both direct and indirect effects. For example, climate might not only influence phenotypic selection on flowering time directly by affecting plant physiology, but it can also alter selection indirectly by modifying the seasonal activity and relative timing of animals interacting with plants. We used 21 yr of data to identify the drivers of selection on flowering time in the perennial herb Lathyrus vernus, and to examine if antagonistic plant-animal interactions mediate effects of climate on selection. We examined the fitness consequences of vertebrate grazing and predispersal seed predation, and how these effects varied among years and among individuals within years. Although both antagonistic plant-animal interactions had important negative effects on plant fitness, only grazing intensity was consistently related to plant phenology, being higher in early-flowering individuals. Spring temperature influenced the intensity of both plant-animal interactions, as well as the covariance between seed predation and plant phenology. However, only differences in grazing intensity among years were associated with differences in selection on flowering time; the strength of selection for early flowering being stronger in years with lower mean intensity of grazing. Our results illustrate how climatic conditions can influence plant-animal interactions that are important selective agents for plant traits. A broader implication of our findings is that both ecological and evolutionary responses to climatic changes might be indirect, and largely mediated by species interactions.

AB  - Epiphytic lichens are especially threatened by accelerated climatic change at high elevations. All lichens are sensitive to atmospheric conditions. Treelines constrain epiphyte ability to migrate upward to follow suitable conditions. Thus, acclimation to changing conditions will likely determine their survival. To simulate lichen response to climate change, we conducted a translocation field experiment in three regions of the trans-Himalayas. Translocation of thalli to lower elevations simulated future increased temperatures, reduced relative humidity, and increased vapor pressure deficit. We hypothesized that this would decrease initial establishment, growth rates, reproduction, photosynthetic pigments, and photosynthesis, but that lichens might alternatively acclimate or shift life history strategies. The study species comprised three fruticose and six foliose species with regional medicinal or culinary uses. Dolichousnea longissima is also crucial for the endangered, endemic, lichenivorous monkey: Rhinopithecus bieti. We found some support for each hypothesis, but high interspecific, intraspecific, and regional variability. Host tree associations and bark pH impacted lichens, but microclimate variables were more important. Increased winter temperatures were most influential at the highest elevation region, whereas reduced relative humidity was most important at mid-elevations. Increased vapor pressure deficit was beneficial to Do. longissima but detrimental to four species. Life history strategy switching occurred for both Sulcaria sulcata (beginning apothecia production in younger thalli) and Dendriscosticta hookeri (faster growth, but delayed apothecia production). The prime beneficiary of simulated climate change was Do. longissima, which had faster growth, healthier thalli, and increased photosynthetic pigments. The worst outcomes were for Hypogymnia flavida. After harvesting translocated specimens, we measured carbon exchange rates under laboratory conditions. All species increased photosynthetic rates at increased CO2 concentrations, but temperature impacts were variable. The extent of photosynthetic acclimation varied with the degree of temperature increase. Conservation of intact mature forest habitat in high-elevation regions will be crucial for the performance of these epiphytic lichens.

AB  - Human-made hydrocarbon-rich environments are important reservoirs of microorganisms with specific degrading abilities and pathogenic potential. In particular, black fungi are of great interest, but their presence in the environment is frequently underestimated because they are difficult to isolate. In the frame of a biodiversity study from fuel-contaminated sites involving 30 diesel car tanks and 112 fuel pump dispensers (52 diesel and 60 gasoline, respectively), a total of 181 black fungal strains were isolated. The long cold incubation (LCI) of water-suspended samples, followed by plating on Dichloran Rose Bengal Chloramphenicol Agar (DRBC), gave isolation yields up to six times (6.6) higher than those of direct plating on DRBC, and those of enrichment with a phenolic mix. The sequencing of ITS and LSU-rDNA confirmed the dominance of potentially pathogenic fungi from the family Herpotrichiellaceae and Exophiala xenobiotica. Moreover, other opportunistic species were found, including E. opportunistica, E. oligosperma, E. phaeomuriformis, and Rhinocladiella similis. The recurrent presence of E. crusticola, Knufia epidermidis, Aureobasidium melanogenum, Cladosporium spp., and Scolecobasidium spp. was also recorded. Interestingly, 12% of total isolates, corresponding to 50% of taxa found (16/32), represent new species. All the novel taxa in this study were isolated by LCI. These findings suggest that black fungal diversity in hydrocarbon-rich niches remains largely unexplored and that LCI can be an efficient tool for further investigations.</p>

AB  - Despite their economic, cultural, and ecological significance, the phylogenetic relationships among North American deer remain uncertain, due in part to discordance between phylogenies built from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear markers. Nuclear markers resolve mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) as reciprocally monophyletic, but mtDNA results in a mixed topology. These two genomic regions have heretofore been analyzed in isolation. We compared phylogenies built from mtDNA cytochrome b and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the mitogenome and nuclear (ultraconserved elements, UCEs) markers from the same individuals to investigate mito-nuclear discordance within and between taxa in the genus Odocoileus. A Cyt b tree shows haplotype sharing between O. hemionus and O. virginianus. Mitochondrial DNA SNPs separated only O. hemionus and O. virginianus, whereas nuclear SNPs separated O. hemionus, O. virginianus, and the distinct subspecies Coues deer (O. v. couesi), Key deer (O. v. clavium), and Sitka black-tailed deer (O. h. sitkensis) plus Columbian black-tailed deer (O. h. columbianus). We found less support for O. h. columbianus as a distinct taxon, which had signs of introgression with nominate O. h. hemionus. The well-established paraphyly of mtDNA haplotypes from O. virginianus and O. hemionus is confirmed with comparisons of mtDNA and nuclear-encoded SNPs from the same individuals. Our attempts to explain mito-nuclear discordance among Odocoileus deer remain inconclusive. We suspect incomplete lineage sorting of a recent evolutionary split may explain this pattern, although mtDNA capture via ancient hybridization is also a possibility. Niche models suggested allopatric refugia at the Last Glacial Maximum for these taxa except for a parapatric or sympatric distribution estimated for O. virginianus and O. v. clavium and O. hemionus and O. h. columbianus, the latter of which might explain the modern hybrid zone.

AB  - Dietary fiber is widely recognized for its benefits to human health. Individual variations in the ability to degrade dietary fiber are influenced by the gut microbiome that may be associated with the host's metabolic phenotype and genetic diversity. This is exemplified by the distinct fiber digestibility observed in obese (e.g. Meishan) and lean-breed (e.g. Yorkshire) pigs. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The present study found that with the same diet under the same environment, the obese-type Meishan pigs showed greater dietary fiber digestibility and harbored higher abundances of polysaccharide-degrading bacteria (Bacteroides, Treponema, and Paraprevotella) compared to lean-type Yorkshire pigs. Metatranscriptomic profiling revealed that the elevated presence of Bacteroides contributed to the enrichment of carbohydrate-active enzymes, particularly those degrading arabinoxylan, indicating a preference for arabinoxylan as a substrate in Meishan pigs. Further enzymatic-product measurements, combined with microbial enzyme profiles, validated greater microbial conversion of xylose into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in Meishan pigs. Additionally, higher abundances of hydrogenotrophic microbes (Methanobrevibacter and Blautia) were detected in the Meishan gut, along with the enrichment of methanogenesis and acetogenesis pathways. To determine whether methanogenesis drives inter-breed variation in arabinoxylan degradation, an in vitro experiment using the methanogen inhibitor, 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) was performed. The results confirmed that Meishan gut microbiome effectively reduced hydrogen accumulation through methanogenesis, promoting arabinoxylan degradation. Conversely, inhibiting methanogenesis by BES led to hydrogen accumulation, reduced SCFAs, beta-xylosidase activity, and Bacteroides abundances. These findings demonstrate that the Meishan pigs have a superior ability of dietary fiber utilization with greater microbial conversion to more SCFAs, which is linked to stronger hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. This study reinforces the role of gut microbial hydrogenotrophy in dietary fiber utilization in pigs.

AB  - Background Toxoplasma gondii, a globally distributed zoonotic obligate intracellular parasite, infects a wide array of mammals, including humans, sheep, and birds. As a unique sheep breed in southwestern China, Yunnan semi-fine wool sheep occupies an important position in animal husbandry in Zhaotong due to its strong adaptability, high reproductive rate, and excellent wool quality. Lambs infected with T. gondii are prone to neurological symptoms and growth retardation, while T. gondii infection in ewes can cause abortions, stillbirths, and deformities, thus affecting sheep reproduction and sheep product quality. Meanwhile, mutton and dairy products contaminated with T. gondii can become potential sources of human infection, potentially threatening public health and safety. Method To understand the T. gondii infection in semi-fine wool sheep in Zhaotong, Yunnan Province, 586 blood samples were collected and subjected to indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) for T. gondii antibodies, and the infection-related factors were analyzed through cross-sectional analysis. In the meantime, nested PCR was conducted on a total of 217 samples collected from 31 rodents caught in and around the sheep breeding ground to test the T. gondii B1 gene in rodent tissues. Results A total of 94 sera tested positive for T. gondii antibodies, with a total positive rate of 16.04% (94/586) (95% CI: 14.77-20.89). Cross-sectional statistical analysis on factors related to semi-fine wool sheep infection rate, including sampling season, sex, age, and weight, suggested that age (< 6 months: 23.81%; 6-12 months: 11.74%; > 12 months: 15.83%) was a significant factor explaining the infection rate differences (P = 0.003 < 0.05, chi(2) = 11.62, df = 2). Thus, age was considered a key risk factor for T. gondii infection in this study (odds ratio, OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.42-3.87). Nested PCR analysis on 217 (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, brain, and muscle) tissues from the 31 rodents indicated that 11 tested positive. The total infection rate of rodents in and around the breeding ground was 35.48% (11/31), and 14 samples tested positive, with a positive infection rate of 6.45% (14/217). Conclusion The T. gondii infection rates of semi-fine wool sheep and rodents from their breeding environment in Zhaotong, Yunnan Province, were high, necessitating enhanced prevention, control, and treatment measures to ensure the healthy breeding of semi-fine wool sheep and veterinary public health and safety.

AB  - In recent decades, intensive techniques of livestock raising have flourished, which has largely replaced traditional farming practices such as transhumance. These changes may have affected scavengers' behaviour and ecology, as extensive livestock is a key source of carrion. This study evaluates the spatial responses of avian scavengers to the seasonal movements of transhumant herds in south-eastern Spain. We surveyed the abundance of avian scavengers and ungulates, and analysed the factors affecting the space use by 30 GPS-tracked griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus). Griffons' foraging activity increased in the pasturelands occupied by transhumant herds, which implied greater vulture abundance at the landscape level during the livestock season. In contrast, facultative scavengers were more abundant without transhumant livestock herds, and the abundance of wild ungulates did not change in relation to livestock presence. We conclude that fostering transhumance and other traditional farming systems, to the detriment of farming intensification, could favour vulture conservation.

AB  - Social relationships are important aspects of the behavioural biology of pigs and can be affected by the type of housing pigs are kept in. Exploring agonistic interactions and affiliative behaviours can reveal effects on adult pigs and their descendants. This research investigated the social dynamics among gilts throughout pregnancy during collective feeding in an outdoor housing system and the effects of these dynamics on the stability of the group and the offspring of the group members. For this study, 15 gilts were oestrus synchronised and artificially inseminated with three different semen pools. The paddocks where the gilts were housed contained a mud pool, natural tree shade, and two nipple drinkers. Two daily meals (similar to 2.5 kg/day/gilt) were provided to the group on the floor. Feeding behaviour was recorded for three continuous days (20 min in the morning and again in the afternoon) every gestational (a total of 42 h of video recording). Saliva samples were collected at 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on these same days. A trained observer evaluated all the videos using Boris software to determine agonistic and affiliative behaviours. After farrowing, the piglet data collected included sex, mortality, and body weight (BW) at 10, 25, 29, and 36 d of age. Elo scores were calculated to quantify the relative hierarchy among the gilts based on the behaviour assessment. Generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used for data analyses, and the significance of fixed effects was determined at p < 0.05. The tendency of the gilts to feed together decreased as gestation progressed. Heavier gilts had lower salivary cortisol concentrations, and higher gilt rank was correlated with higher morning salivary cortisol concentrations and heavier piglets. Maternal modulation of offspring performance in pigs warrant further investigation. Assessment of gilts' social feeding behaviours is relevant for considering pigs' behaviour in genetic selection and improving commercial facilities and management practices to improve animal welfare.

AB  - Seasonal reproduction contributes to increased chances of offspring survival in some animals. Dairy goats are seasonal breeding mammals. In this study, adult male Guanzhong dairy goats (10-12 months old) were used. Testis size, semen quality, hormone level, apoptosis of germ cells, and autophagy of Sertoli cells were analyzed in dairy goats during the breeding (October) and nonbreeding (April) seasons. We found that, during the nonbreeding season for dairy goats, semen quality, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and testosterone levels were reduced, and the number of apoptotic germ cells increased. The proliferation with decrease activity of germ cells in dairy goat during the nonbreeding season was significantly affected. However, the testis size did not change seasonally. Interestingly, Sertoli cell autophagy was more active during the nonbreeding season. The expression levels of FSH receptor, wilms tumor 1, androgen binding protein, glial cell derived neurotrophic factor, and stem cell factor decreased in dairy goats during the nonbreeding season. In summary, our results indicate that spermatogenesis in dairy goats during the nonbreeding season was not completely arrested. In addition, germ cell apoptosis and the morphology of Sertoli cells considerably changed in dairy goats during the nonbreeding season. Sertoli cell autophagy is involved in the seasonal regulation of spermatogenesis in dairy goats. These findings provide key insights into the fertility and spermatogenesis of seasonal breeding animals.
   Summary sentence
   Spermatogenesis is regulated seasonally in dairy goats. During the nonbreeding season, Sertoli cell autophagy was more active, and the proliferation activity of germ cells was reduced.

AB  - Conflicts between humans and mammalian predators are globally widespread and increasing, creating a long-lasting challenge for conservation and local livelihoods. Protection interventions, which are essential to conflict mitigation, should be based on solid evidence of effectiveness produced by robust study designs. Yet, it is unclear what study designs have been used in predator-targeted interventions and how they can be improved to provide best practices for replications. I examined how applications of five study designs (before-after, before-after-control-impact, control-impact, crossover [i.e., the same randomly assigned study units acting as treatments and controls during alternating trials], and randomized controlled trial) have changed over time and how these changes are related to authors, predator species, countries, and intervention types (aversion, husbandry, mixed interventions, invasive management, lethal control, and noninvasive management). I applied multinomial regression modeling to 434 cases (28 predator species and 45 countries) from 244 studies published from 1955 to 2020. Study design was related only to intervention type. Less reliable before-after and control-impact studies were the most common (47.7% and 38.2% of cases, respectively), and their use increased over years as did all interventions. The contribution of the most robust before-after-control-impact (7.4%), randomized controlled trial (5.3%), and crossover designs (1.4%) remained minor over time. Crossover is suitable for aversion, most husbandry techniques, and a few other interventions, but crossover interventions also have the most limitations in terms of applicability. Randomized controlled trial is generally applicable, but impractical or inappropriate for some interventions, and before-after-control-impact appears to be the most widely applicable study design for predator-targeted interventions.

AB  - Simple Summary: Improving boar semen quality is essential for successful artificial insemination due to its direct impact on fertility rate and litter size, making it very important for efficient reproduction in pig farming. Boar sperm is highly sensitive to oxidative stress, which damages sperm cells and decreases fertility. This study is focused on finding whether dietary supplementation can enhance the quality of boar semen, preserve sperm from oxidative damage, and affect the expression of epigenetic-related genes by examining the impact of particular nutrients with antioxidant effects. Key findings revealed that the supplemented group showed improved sperm concentration, motility, and kinematics, with enhanced antioxidative capacity, through increased enzyme activity in seminal plasma and lower lipid peroxidation markers. Changes in epigenetic-related gene expression levels also indicated positive impacts on genetic stability, which could enhance fertility. These results imply that dietary supplementation could improve reproductive performance in boars. This study investigates the impact of nutritional supplementation on semen quality, epigenetic-related gene expression, and oxidative status in boars. Thirty boars were divided into a control group and a treatment group receiving Espermaplus (a supplement containing various vitamins, amino acids, omega-3 fatty acids, and trace elements with antioxidant properties). The experiment was performed for 12 weeks. Semen samples were collected at four moments: before starting the supplementation and after 3 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks. Spermatozoa concentration, motility, and kinematics were assessed using the CASA system. The measured parameters included curvilinear velocity-VCL; straight-line velocity-VSL; average path velocity-VAP; curvilinear distance-DCL; straight line distance-DSL; distance of average path-DAP; amplitude of lateral head displacement-ALH; beat-cross frequency-BCF; and head activity-HAC. Moreover, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in seminal plasma, as well as the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), were measured to assess oxidative stress levels in boar's seminal plasma. The expression of epigenetic-related genes such as Protamine 1 (Prm1), Protamine 2 (Prm2), and DNA-methyltransferase 3 alpha (Dnmt3a) were evaluated using real-time PCR. The treated group showed a significant increase in spermatozoa concentration (p = 0.003), total motility (p = 0.001), and progressive motility (p = 0.002) after 12 weeks compared to the control group. Kinematic parameters such as VCL, VSL, and VAP were also significantly higher (p < 0.001; p = 0.028; p < 0.001, respectively) in the treated group by the end of the experiment. SOD and GPx activities were consistently higher (p < 0.01; p < 0.001, respectively) in the treated group, indicating enhanced antioxidative capacity. TBARS levels as an indicator of lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage were significantly lower (p < 0.01) in the treated group by the end of the study. Significant changes were observed in the expression of epigenetic-related genes. The supplementation of boar diets with Espermaplus significantly improved semen quality, reduced oxidative stress, and had an impact on the expression levels of certain epigenetic-related genes, suggesting that dietary antioxidants and bioactive compounds can enhance boar semen.

AB  - The determination of the maturity of compost and other organic fertilizers is very important because of possible phytotoxic or phytostimulating effects. The maturity of compost can be assessed on the basis of chemical analyses, and a germination test with different test plants is most often used to determine phytotoxicity. In this research, the maturity of compost produced from the plant residues subsequent to the maintenance of green public areas was assessed using the results of chemical analyses. Simultaneously, a germination test was carried out with the four test plant species (cucumber, garden cress, triticale, and barley) to determine the phytotoxicity of compost extract in a ratio of 1:2.5 v/v (1:3.3 w/v) and 1:10 v/v (1:13.3 w/v) and the three ammonium N solutions (in the concentrations of 200, 400, and 600 mg/L NH4-N). According to the chemical properties of compost (primarily the C/N, NH4-N/NO3-N ratios, and the NH4-N concentration) and the germination test with cucumber and garden cress, we may conclude that the tested compost was mature and that we did not expect a phytotoxic effect. The choice of a plant is very significant because the germination test with a compost extract demonstrated an undoubted phytostimulating effect on the garden cress and cucumber, with a more pronounced phytostimulating effect of the 1:10 than that of the 1:2.5 v/v compost extract. No such effect was detected on the monocotyledonous test plants triticale and barley since the 1:10 v/v extract had no significant effect, and the 1:2.5 v/v extract had a phytotoxic effect, moderate on the triticale and high on barley. The conclusion is that garden cress and cucumber are suitable test plants for the determination of compost's phytostimulative effect, but they are not suitable for the determination of phytotoxicity for monocotyledonous plants, especially if the cause of phytotoxicity is a non-ammonium component. Barley is the most suitable species for the determination of compost's non-ammonium phytotoxicity and nitrogen's ammonium-form phytostimulative or phytotoxic effect. It would be very useful to conduct a comparative germination test with the compost extracts in the ratios 1:2.5 and 1:10, whereby the 1:2.5 extract would be used as a test of phytotoxicity, and the 1:10 extract for the test of a phytostimulating effect.

AB  - Plants are frequently exposed to heat stress as a result of global warming. Heat stress leads to a series of physiological responses including stress volatile elicitation, but how heat stress-induced volatile cues affect the behavior of herbivores is poorly understood. In this study, the polyphagous herbivore Spodoptera litura (tobacco cutworm, TCW) and Chrysanthemum nankingense were selected as the model to elucidate the interactions between herbivore behavior and heat stress-induced plant physiological changes. Photosynthetic characteristics and volatile emissions were measured in C. nankingense control plants (25 & DEG;C for 3 h), in C. nankingense exposed to moderate (35 & DEG;C for 3 h), and severe (45 & DEG;C for 3 h) heat stresses. Net photosynthetic rate (A(n)) decreased by more than two-fold after exposure to 45 & DEG;C due to non-stomatal inhibition of photosynthesis. 45 & DEG;C treatment induced emissions of the camphor and (E)-beta-caryophyllene. Exposure to 35 & DEG;C had minor effects on photosynthetic characteristics and did not induce terpene emissions. Using dual-choice olfactometer bioassays, we found that 45 & DEG;C treatment enhanced the attractiveness of the plants to TCW. Moreover, the leaf concentrations of nine sesquiterpenes were increased and the feeding of TCW was strongly inhibited after 45 & DEG;C treatment compared with control plants. Taken together, our study highlights the impact of heat stress on the behavior of the herbivore mediated by the accumulation and emission of sesquiterpenes and suggests altered pest-host interactions under future warmer climates. Modulation of terpenoid emissions and contents should be considered in developing future ecological pest control strategies in agricultural fields.

AB  - Scientific and precise evaluations of the megafaunal and landform characteristics of seamounts are important guides for their protection and study. A series of manned and unmanned submersibles have provided invaluable observational imaging data for the ecological study of seamounts. However, traditional methods of artificial observation of seamount imaging data cannot accurately and efficiently determine the characteristics of megafauna and landforms. This research harnesses data-driven technology to systematically investigate the distributional traits and morphological features of megafaunal organisms, as well as the topographical characteristics, in the Caiwei Guyot region of the western Pacific's Magellan Seamounts. To construct the landform and megafauna dataset of the Caiwei Guyot region, we used a data preprocessing technology based on image enhancement to provide high-quality imaging data for data-driven technologies. A megafaunal identification and counting algorithm based on YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once Version 5) was developed to efficiently assess the abundance, variety, and dominant species of megafauna. Simultaneously, a landform three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction algorithm based on PatchmatchNet was developed to reconstruct the 3D form of the terrain accurately. This study pioneers the application of data-driven technology to deep-sea imaging within the Caiwei Guyot region, offering an innovative approach to accurately and efficiently characterize the region's unique megafauna and landforms.

AB  - The evolution of species composition and species richness from the end of the Middle Pleistocene to the Middle Holocene (similar to 200-5 ka, MIS7-MIS1) studied in two Central European bioregional mammal assemblages include 176 chrono-species. The study is based on the list of 745 palaeontological sites and 1604 dated localities. For each region, the descriptive models (non-metric multidimensional scaling technique used) of evolution were obtained for full mammal assemblages as well as particular mammalian "guilds" (carnivorous, large herbivorous, small herbivorous and insectivorous). The models for full assemblages revealed several properties of the evolution process: non-linearity, combination of stationary and nonstationary states, irreversible (evolutionary per se) and reversible changes, threshold like effects accompanying transitions between stationary and nonstationary states, and elements of adaptive dynamics in changing environmental conditions. The evolutionary trajectories of mammal "guilds" have the same properties but differ significantly from each other and their relative complexity is no less than the trajectories of full mammal assemblages. Hence, the evolution shows emergent property and irreducibility of complexity at different structural levels of an assemblage. Throughout MIS7-MIS1 the regional faunas responded to global climate changes (delta O-18 used as temperature variable), but had various contents, directions, consequences mediated by current species composition and geographic positions in relation to the Saale and the Weichsel continental ice sheets. The study shows a time/spatial invariance (scale-invariant property) of species richness for the stationary states of fauna evolution (especially during MIS3), which is described by a power law function. A mammal assemblage evolution is discussed within the framework of concept of open non-linear self-organising complex quasi-deterministic system with an ability of adaptive behaviour. Internal organisation of such systems justifies their existence and evolution in the area at a borderline between order and chaos and thus their evolution is intrinsically unpredictable.

AB  - Epigenetic mechanisms are important modulators of neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring of animals challenged during pregnancy. Pregnant sows living in a confined environment are challenged with stress and lack of stimulation which may result in the expression of stereotypies (repetitive behaviours without an apparent function). Little attention has been devoted to the postnatal effects of maternal stereotypies in the offspring. We investigated how the environment and stereotypies of pregnant sows affected the neuro-epigenome of their piglets. We focused on the amygdala, frontal cortex, and hippocampus, brain regions related to emotionality, learning, memory, and stress response. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were investigated in these brain regions of male piglets born from sows kept in an enriched vs a barren environment. Within the latter group of piglets, we compared the brain methylomes of piglets born from sows expressing stereotypies vs sows not expressing stereotypies. DMRs emerged in each comparison. While the epigenome of the hippocampus and frontal cortex of piglets is mainly affected by the maternal environment, the epigenome of the amygdala is mainly affected by maternal stereotypies. The molecular pathways and mechanisms triggered in the brains of piglets by maternal environment or stereotypies are different, which is reflected on the differential gene function associated to the DMRs found in each piglets' brain region . The present study is the first to investigate the neuro-epigenomic effects of maternal enrichment in pigs' offspring and the first to investigate the neuro-epigenomic effects of maternal stereotypies in the offspring of a mammal.

AB  - Information on the nutritive value and in vitro fermentation characteristics of native shrubs in New Zealand is scant. This is despite their potential as alternatives to exotic trees and shrubs for supplementary fodder, and their mitigation of greenhouse gases and soil erosion on hill-country sheep and beef farms. The objectives of this study were to measure the in vitro fermentation gas production, predict the parameters of the in vitro fermentation kinetics, and estimate the in vitro fermentation of volatile fatty acids (VFA), microbial biomass (MBM), and greenhouse gases of four native shrubs (Coprosma robusta, Griselinia littoralis, Hoheria populnea, and Pittosporum crassifolium) and an exotic fodder tree species, Salix schwerinii. The total in vitro gas production was higher (p < 0.05) for the natives than for the S. schwerinii. A prediction using the single-pool model resulted in biologically incorrect negative in vitro total gas production from the immediately soluble fraction of the native shrubs. However, the dual pool model better predicted the in vitro total gas production and was in alignment with the measured in vitro fermentation end products. The in vitro VFA and greenhouse gas production from the fermentation of leaf and stem material was higher (p < 0.05), and the MBM lower (p < 0.05), for the native shrubs compared to the S. schwerinii. The lower in vitro total gas production, VFA, and greenhouse gases production and higher MBM of the S. schwerinii may be explained by the presence of condensed tannins (CT), although this was not measured and requires further study. In conclusion, the results from this study suggest that when consumed by ruminant livestock, browsable native shrubs can provide adequate energy and microbial protein, and that greenhouse-gas production from these species is within the ranges reported for typical New Zealand pastures.

AB  - Gut microbiome studies based on fecal samples can non-invasively reflect the survival and health status of endangered species. This study presents the first characterization of the gut microbiome in the semi-wild population of the critically endangered Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica), unveiling the existence of two distinct enterotypes within the semi-wild Saiga: the Oscillospiraceae UCG-005 enterotype and the Arthrobacter enterotype. These enterotypes show significant differences in microbiome diversity, composition, and predicted functions. The Arthrobacter enterotype has lower alpha diversity, fewer short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, more potential pathogens, lower energy metabolism and higher lipid metabolism abundance. The findings imply that Saiga with the Arthrobacter enterotype have lower energy utilization efficiency and higher disease risks, particularly for obesity. Microbial correlation network analysis indicates SCFAsproducing bacteria play a key role in the formation of these enterotypes. This suggests that next-generation probiotics, primarily composed of SCFAs-producing bacteria, could be used to regulate and improve the health of the Saiga. Additionally, the similarity of the enterotype associated with a healthier survival state to that of wild counterparts suggests that incorporating gut microbiome monitoring into the key indicators for the reintroduction of endangered species could be significant for wildlife conservation and management.

AB  - The greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis) once occupied much of Australia's mainland. Bilbies are now listed as vulnerable and only occur in 20% of their former range. Operation Rangeland Restoration aims to to restore an ex-pastoral lease; reintroduce several species of locally extirpated fauna, including the bilby; and maintain the area in perpetuity for the conservation of Australian arid zone species. Bilbies were reintroduced to the Matuwa Indigenous Protected Area between 2007 and 2010 and, with ongoing landscape-scale control of feral predators, herbivores, and fire, have thrived. Here, we present a detailed account of the methods used during the reintroduction, showing that between 2007 and 2019 there has been an 88% increase in the area of occupancy by bilbies at Matuwa. The results of 2-ha track plot surveys conducted by the traditional owners of Matuwa suggest that the reintroduced bilbies are emigrating out of Matuwa. In addition, in 2018 and 2019 we used 120 camera-traps over 18 mo and occupancy analysis to confirm the widespread presence of bilbies across Matuwa and define significant habitat correlates. Bilbies were more likely to be detected on sandplains with Eucalyptus species as overstorey vegetation and Triodia as understorey vegetation. Bilbies were not detected in habitats with >= 75% bare ground. We attribute the success of the bilby reintroduction at Matuwa to the consistent implementation of landscape-scale control of feral predators. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Nutrient dilution (ND) - the decrease in the concentration of nutritional elements in plant tissue - arises from an increase in the mass of carbohydrates and/or a decrease in the 20+ essential elements. Increasing CO2 levels and its promotion of biomass are linked to nutrient dilution. We build a case for nutrient dilution as a key driver in global declines in herbivore abundance. Herbivores must build element-rich animal tissue from nutrient-poor plant tissue, and their abundance commonly increases with fertilization of both macro- and micronutrients. We predict the global impacts of nutrient dilution will be magnified in some of Earth's most biodiverse, highly productive, and/or nutrient-poor ecosystems and should favor specific traits of herbivores, including sap-feeding and ruminant microbiomes.

AB  - Dorper rams are widely distributed throughout the world under different climatic conditions, however, little is known about their reproductive performance in desert regions. Ten Dorper rams were individually housed and exposed to thermoneutrality for 35 d in spring (23.6 +/- 5.6 degrees C, mean +/- SD) and outdoor heat stress (HS) for 35 d in summer (33.6 +/- 2.0 degrees C) to evaluate the effect of seasonal HS on physiological responses, testicular biometry, and seminal quality under desert climatic conditions. Rectal temperature, respiration rate and coat surface temperatures in different body regions were measured every 7 d (0600, 1200, and 1800 h); also, testicular biometry was registered at 0600 h. Semen was collected via an artificial vagina 3 d after physiological variables were measured and seminal traits were evaluated. Rectal temperature, respiration rate and coat surface temperatures were higher (P < 0.01) at each hour of measurement in summer compared to spring. Overall, scrotal length and circumference, as well as testicular volume were higher (P < 0.01) in summer than in spring. Compared to spring conditions, summer HS caused lower (P <= 0.05) sperm concentration and viability combined with a higher percentage of sperm abnormalities without affecting ejaculate volume. Both mass and sperm motility were similar between seasons in the first two sampling weeks, and then decreased (P <= 0.03) due to summer HS. In conclusion, Dorper rams developed testicle hyperthermia and, consequently, showed poor semen quality due to the high environmental temperatures prevailing in desert regions.

AB  - The decision to engage in escalated fighting involves an interplay between the individual's estimate of the value of the resource under dispute and the ability of the combatants to invest sufficient time and energy in the contest. Although fallow deer, Dama dama, contests usually take place between pairs of individuals, they are sometimes terminated by the intervention of dominant third-party individuals. Theory argues that these interventions prevent subordinates from gaining a competitive boost via a winner effect; thus, interveners benefit by removing this threat to their status. Prior to intervention, third-party individuals often approach and closely follow the competing dyad before either abandoning their interest in the contest, or physically targeting one of the contestants. This study investigated the possibility that third-party following is an assessment process whereby individuals monitor the quality of fighting rivals during the annual rut. We tested three hypotheses: (1) that third-party followers are socially dominant individuals, that (2) follow contests to assess the current quality of high-ranking rivals (3) when resource abundance (i.e. the number of oestrous females) is high. Our results show that socially dominant individuals are most likely to follow contests; however, contrary to expectation, third-party males tended to follow dyads consisting of low-ranking rivals. We also show that as resource abundance increased in the population there was an increased tendency for males to follow contests, and a reduction in the probability of engaging in a third-party intervention of the contest. As expected by theory, dominance and resource abundance were important correlates of third-party following. Our results support the idea that socially dominant males monitor subordinate males that possess sufficient resources to expend in fighting, and that thus may be a threat to their status.

AB  - Simple Summary: Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that can cause serious disease in humans, especially in pregnant women. This parasite is found in many animals and people can be infected by eating raw or undercooked meat. Wild boar are known to harbor this parasite; populations and habitats have increased in the past decade, as it also increased the consumption of venison. The European population of wild boar has a mean prevalence of 26%. In our study, we found that the prevalence in the Slovenian wild boar population is 62%, the highest in the world to date. The prevalence was influenced by age and weight, but not by gender. In conclusion, the hunting community should be made aware of the high risk of parasite exposure when dealing with wild boar meat.
   Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic parasite of great public health concern. Wild boars could be considered an emerging source of toxoplasmosis in humans due to the popularity of venison and their increasing population. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of T. gondii in the Slovenian wild boar population and evaluate risk factors for human infection. Of 353 samples, 62% were positive for T. gondii using ELISA tests. This is the highest T. gondii seroprevalence reported to date in wild boar worldwide. The increase in prevalence with increasing age (p = 0.003) and weight (p = 0.002) were statistically significant, whereas gender was not (p = 0.781). Odds for being T. gondii-positive increased with age with the largest difference being between 2-3-year-old and 1-2-year-old animals (OR = 2.66, 95%CI: 1.03-6.85). Animals weighing 20-40 kg had a higher risk than animals weighing 0-20 kg (OR = 2.74, 95%CI: 1.21-6.20), whereas a further increase in the weight was not associated with increasing the odds. Due to the high Toxoplasma prevalence, the study concluded that the risk of exposure to T. gondii from handling raw or undercooked wild boar meat is high. Surveillance protocols should be established at the national level together with increased awareness within the hunting community.

AB  - A chief tool in plant conservation is the augmenting or establishment of threatened plant populations by translocating individuals grown ex-situ. As translocations become an increasingly common practise in conser-vation and land management, various techniques to increase survival and persistence have become established as standard. Here we use a large historical database of plant translocations to evaluate the evidence for common management techniques to enhance translocation performance. We found that the most important factors associated with maximising size and survival of translocated plant populations were the number of propagules planted, fencing to protect from herbivores, and stimulating recruitment. Factors influencing the probability of recruitment were less certain, however burning and watering increased its likelihood. We also asked how habitat and lifeform influenced translocation performance. Translocations in grassland habitats performed worse than other habitats, and translocations of their predominant lifeform, the perennial grasses, also compared poorly. Our results make a strong case for the utility of a limited number of management interventions, and we highlight where a more explicit focus on experimental data might build our understanding of the factors influencing success in plant translocations.

AB  - Cultivation of rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties having ratooning potential under adequate organic nutrient sources (ONSs) could improve system productivity, soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and energy use efficiency in the eastern Indian Himalayas. A 6-year study was conducted to evaluate the impact of four varieties (Shahsarang-1, Lampnah, IR-64 and Krishna Hamsha) under five ONSs [pig manure (PM), farmyard manure (FYM), vermicompost (VC), in situ paddy straw (PS) recycling and farmers' practice] on productivity, soil health and energetics of a rice-ratoon system in a mid-hill (950 m asl) subtropical climate. Organic manures were applied on an N-equivalent basis. The 6-year average grain yield of main rice was significantly highest for Shahsarang-1 (4.40 Mg ha(-1)) followed by IR-64. Shahsarang-1 (2.58 Mg ha(-1)) and IR 64 also produced higher ratoon crop yields, leading to higher total annual productivity (main + ratoon crops) than other varieties. Rice grown with PM produced the highest average rice productivity of main crop, followed by FYM. The highest total N, P and K uptake by the rice was obtained under PM followed by FYM. After six cropping cycles, the maximum SOC stock and available N and P were observed under PM, whereas available K was highest under PS recycling. The highest gross energy output, net energy and energy intensity were registered with PM, whereas energy use efficiency and energy productivity were the highest under control. Thus, cultivation of either Shahsarang-1 or IR-64 using PM/FYM is appropriate for enhancing productivity, soil health and conservation of energy in the study region and similar eco-regions elsewhere.

AB  - Goat milk is increasingly recognized by consumers dueto its highnutritional value, richness in short- and medium-chain fatty acids,and richness in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Exogenous supplementationof docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an important approach to increasingthe content of PUFA in goat milk. Several studies have reported benefitsof dietary DHA in terms of human health, including potential againstchronic diseases and tumors. However, the mechanisms whereby an increasedsupply of DHA regulates mammary cell function is unknown. In thisstudy, we investigated the effect of DHA on lipid metabolism processesin goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC) and the function of H3K9acepigenetic modifications in this process. Supplementation of DHA promotedlipid droplet accumulation increased the DHA content and altered fattyacid composition in GMEC. Lipid metabolism processes were alteredby DHA supplementation through transcriptional programs in GMEC. ChIP-seqanalysis revealed that DHA induced genome-wide H3K9ac epigenetic changesin GMEC. Multiomics analyses (H3K9ac genome-wide screening and RNA-seq)revealed that DHA-induced expression of lipid metabolism genes (FASN, SCD1, FADS1, FADS2, LPIN1, DGAT1, MBOAT2), which were closely related with changes in lipidmetabolism processes and fatty acid profiles, were regulated by modificationof H3K9ac. In particular, DHA increased the enrichment of H3K9ac inthe promoter region of PDK4 and promoted its transcription,while PDK4 inhibited lipid synthesis and activatedAMPK signaling in GMEC. The activation of the expression of fattyacid metabolism-related genes FASN, FADS2, and SCD1 and their upstream transcription factor SREBP1 by the AMPK inhibitor was attenuated in PDK4-overexpressing GMEC. In conclusion, DHA alters lipid metabolismprocesses via H3K9ac modifications and the PDK4-AMPK-SREBP1 signalingaxis in goat mammary epithelial cells, providing new insights intothe mechanism through which DHA affects mammary cell function andregulates milk fat metabolism.

AB  - Early terrestrial vertebrates (amniotes) provide a classic example of diversification following adaptive zone invasion. The initial terrestrialization of vertebrates was closely followed by dietary diversification, as evidenced by a proliferation of craniomandibular and dental adaptations. However, morphological evolution of early amniotes has received limited study, in analyses with restricted taxonomic scope, leaving substantial questions about the dynamics of this important terrestrial radiation. We use novel analyses of discrete characters to quantify variation in evolutionary rates and constraints during diversification of the amniote feeding apparatus. We find evidence for an early burst, comprising high rates of anatomical change that decelerated through time, giving way to a background of saturated morphological evolution. Subsequent expansions of phenotypic diversity were not associated with increased evolutionary rates. Instead, variation in the mode of evolution became important, with groups representing independent origins of herbivory evolving distinctive, group-specific morphologies and thereby exploring novel character-state spaces. Our findings indicate the importance of plant-animal interactions in structuring the earliest radiation of amniotes and demonstrate the importance of variation in modes of phenotypic divergence during a major evolutionary radiation.
   Analysis of dental characters reveals an early burst in the evolution of the amniote feeding apparatus, but subsequently, variation in the mode of evolution became important as phenotypic diversification became disassociated from increased evolutionary rates.

AB  - Noninvasive data collection methods are increasingly used to monitor endangered, cryptic, or otherwise difficult to observe wildlife populations. Spatial capture-recapture and count-based statistical methods are often used to model these data to derive population estimates, each with their own advantages. The goal of our study was to integrate these 2 data sources and model structures to maximize the use of single-season surveys in which capture-recapture and count-based data are collected. We formulated a Bayesian spatial, closed integrated population model (cIPM) that leverages scat DNA-based spatial capture-recapture and camera-based spatial count sub-models to derive sex and age class-specific population estimates. Our cIPM has the advantage of sharing the spatial scaling (& sigma;) parameter directly between sub-models and drawing proposed individuals from the same data-augmented superpopulation for each sub-model. This allows for separate estimation of sex and age-class groups simultaneously without any assumptions of population structure or conversions between model output types. We applied our cIPM to a wild population of Roosevelt elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti, Karuk: ishyuux) during winter 2018-2019 in their winter range within Karuk Ancestral Territory in northern California, USA. We also conducted a simulation study to test our cIPM on a known population consisting of 2 age classes and 2 sexes. The cIPM was able to estimate most population, detection, and & sigma; parameters with good accuracy, including population size. The assignment of sex and age was biased, however, resulting in fewer juvenile males, more juvenile females, and more adult males. Our cIPM applied to the data estimated approximately 310 (95% CI = 235-411) female adults, 90 (95% CI = 57-134) male adults, 75 (95% CI = 43-149) female calves, and 23 (95% CI = 12-47) male calves. These estimates were different from those that would have been made had we relied on common assumptions such as equal calf sex ratios, though this ratio was likely biased towards females based on our simulation results. Our methods are widely applicable and maximize the amount of information available to managers and researchers from any single-season survey in which separate data sources capturing sex and age-class information are obtained.

AB  - Assessment of zooarchaeological data for the principal livestock (i.e., cattle, sheep, goats and pigs) reveals regional and cultural variability in how animals were manipulated, marketed, bred, and utilized over the course of antiquity. This paper focuses upon those developments, as reconstructed through zooarchaeological frequency and morphometric data for the period from c. 1000 BCE to c. 700 CE. Regionally, North Africa encompasses a vast territory, from Egypt, in the East, to Mauretania, in the West. Ecologically, there are variations within each of these zones. Culturally, moreover, these regions witnessed the introduction and influence of different social and economic agents and factors over the timeframe under investigation. This paper examines patterns in these components in a broad synthetic manner, using zooarchaeological data across the entire expanse of Roman North Africa-from Egypt to Mauretania. Focus centers upon the nature and degree of size and shape changes within the principal livestock, modifications that were in part influenced by aspects such as the scale and pattern in trade, dietary appeal for animal products (notably fatty meats), market demands, ecological adaptations, as well as economic and cultural contact among areas. Key similarities and differences in faunal patterns, across time and space within ancient North Africa, and the links these share with changes in animal husbandry schemes are outlined.

AB  - Spermatogenesis is a complex process that involves proliferation and differentiation of diploid male germ cells into haploid flagellated sperm and requires intricate interactions between testicular somatic cells and germ cells. The cellular heterogeneity of this process presents a challenge in analyzing the different cell types at various developmental stages. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a useful tool for exploring cellular heterogeneity. In this study, we performed a comprehensive and unbiased single-cell transcriptomic study of spermatogenesis in sexually mature 4-year-old yak using 10x Genomics scRNA-seq. Our scRNA-seq analysis identified six somatic cell types and various germ cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, spermatogonia, early-spermatocytes, late-spermatocytes, and spermatids in yak testis. Pseudo-timing analysis showed that Leydig and myoid cells originated from common progenitor cells in yaks. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the top expressed genes in yak testicular somatic cells were significantly enriched in the cAMP signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and ECM receptor interactions. Throughout the spermatogenesis process, genes related to spermatogenesis, cell differentiation, DNA binding, and ATP binding were expressed. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we identified candidate marker genes for spermatogonial stem cells and Sertoli cells. Our research provides new insights into yak spermatogenesis and the development of various types of cells in the testis, and presents more reliable marker proteins for in vitro culture and identification of yak spermatogonial stem cells in the later stage.

AB  - Female reproductive success is one of the most important life-history traits to be monitored when determining population dynamics in free-ranging ungulates. Several studies have described how phenotypic characteristics of the mother, climatic conditions, population status, and habitat can impact on potential reproductive output in wild ungulates. However, little is known regarding the internal, physiological factors, that may account for differences in implantation rates. The present study investigated the differences in implantation rates and site on the basis of site and number of ovulations through the examination of about 3000 intact uteri collected from pregnant roe deer does (Capreolus capreolus). Although ovulation occurs with the same frequency in the left and right ovary, we revealed a higher frequency of embryos implantation in the left uterine horn in odd litter size, demonstrating that embryos can migrate between the uterine horns. In our study, a greater proportion of reproductive wastage was associated to females with three and four corpora lutea and interestingly, in relation to the site of ovulation, the percentage of corpora lutea that did not correspond to a fetus was higher in the right ovary than in the left one (73.2% vs. 26.8%). Our research described for the first time the absence of laterality in ovulation and the presence of laterality in implantation in roe deer, thus laying the foundations for in-depth studies about the functionality of this uterine side and for comparisons with populations located in other geographical areas to understand whether it is a widespread phenomenon or a local adaptation.

AB  - Egg yolk (EY, control) is an essential ingredient of diluents for boar semen cryopreservation. Pasteurized egg yolk (PEY) reduces hygienic risks in processing and is easier to standardize. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro effect of PEY (treatment) on frozen-thawed boar semen. In a split-sample approach (n = 13 boars), it could be shown that there is neither an influence (p > .05) on post-thawing motility (PTM: 5, 30 and 120 min) nor on morphologically intact sperm, percentage of acrosome defects and membrane fluidity using a PEY extender compared to the control. Mitochondrial activity (p = .043), membrane integrity (p = .015) and PTM 300 min (p = .023) were slightly affected in the treatment group. Overall, sperm quality was at a high level in both experimental groups. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of PEY on the fertilizing capacity of boar ejaculates.

AB  - Maintaining cellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis is essential for many aspects of cellular life. The high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway responsible for signal integration and transduction plays crucial roles in environmental adaptation, especially in the response to osmotic stress. Hog1 is activated by transient Ca2+ increase in yeast, but the functions of the HOG pathway in Ca2+ homeostasis are largely unknown. We found that the HOG pathway was involved in the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in Fusarium graminearum, a devastating fungal pathogen of cereal crops. The deletion mutants of HOG pathway displayed increased sensitivity to Ca2+ and FK506, and elevated intracellular Ca2+ content. Ca2+ treatment induced the phosphorylation of FgHog1, and the phosphorylated FgHog1 was transported into the nucleus by importin beta FgNmd5. Moreover, the increased phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of FgHog1 upon Ca2+ treatment is independent of the calcineurin pathway that is conserved and downstream of the Ca2+ signal. Taken together, this study reported the novel function of FgHog1 in the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in F. graminearum, which advance the understanding of the HOG pathway and the association between the HOG and calcineurin pathways in fungi.

AB  - The time of dominance rank acquisition is a crucial phase in male life history that often affects reproductive success and hence fitness. Hormones such as testosterone and glucocorticoids can influence as well as be affected by this process. At the same time, hormone concentrations can show large individual variation. The extent to which such variation is repeatable, particularly in dynamic social settings, is a question of current interest. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate how dominance rank and individual differences contribute to variance in hormone concentrations during male rank acquisition in a complex social environment. For this purpose, dominance rank as well as baseline testosterone, baseline cortisol, and cortisol responsiveness after exposure to a novel environment were determined in colony-housed guinea pig males from late adolescence through adulthood. Hormone-dominance relationships and repeatability of hormone measures beyond their relation to rank were assessed. There was a significant positive relationship between baseline testosterone and rank, but this link became weaker with increasing age. Baseline cortisol or cortisol responsiveness, in contrast, were not significantly related to dominance. Notably, all three endocrine parameters were significantly repeatable independent of dominance rank from late adolescence through adulthood. Baseline testosterone and cortisol responsiveness showed a significantly higher repeatability than baseline cortisol. This suggests that testosterone titres and cortisol responsiveness represent stable individual attributes even under complex social conditions.

AB  - Secondary metabolites are suggested as a major mechanism explaining genetic variation in herbivory levels in Pinus radiata. The potential to incorporate these chemical traits into breeding/deployment programmes partly depends on the presence of additive genetic variation for the relevant chemical traits. In this study, near-infrared spectroscopy was used to quantify the constitutive and induced levels of 54 compounds in the bark of trees from 74 P. radiata full-sib families. The trees sampled for chemistry were protected from browsing and induced levels were obtained by subjecting half of the trees to artificial bark stripping. The treatment effect on bark chemistry was assessed along with narrow-sense heritability, the significance of non-additive genetic effects and the additive genetic correlations of compounds with bark stripping by mammalian herbivores that was observed in unprotected replicates of the field trial. The results indicated: (i) significant additive genetic variation, with low-moderate narrow-sense heritability estimates for most compounds; (ii) while significant induced effects were detected for some chemicals, no significant genetic variation in inducibility was detected; and (iii) sugars, fatty acids and a diterpenoid positively genetically correlated while a sesquiterpenoid negatively genetically correlated with bark stripping by the mammalian herbivore, the Bennett's wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus). At the onset of browsing, a trade-off with height was detected for selecting higher amounts of this sesquiterpenoid. However, overall, results showed potential to incorporate chemical traits into breeding/deployment programmes. The quantitative genetic analyses of the near infrared predicted chemical traits produced associations with mammalian bark stripping that mostly conform with those obtained using standard wet chemistry.

AB  - High levels of antibiotics and heavy metals in animal manure pose a potential threat to both the ecological environment and public health. A regional knowledge of their distribution and risk assessment across China remains unclear. A dataset containing 4082 records covering a total of forty-two antibiotics and eight heavy metals was established for animal manure across China. The results showed that the residual concentration of antibiotics was in the order of tetracyclines > aminoglycosides > fluoroquinolones > macrolides > sulfonamides > beta-lactams, and that of heavy metals is Zn > Cu > Cr > Pb > Ni > As > Cd > Hg. The mean concentration of antibiotics and heavy metals was higher in pig manure compared to chicken and cow manure (Kruskal-Wallis test). The lowest level of antibiotics was observed in Northwest China based on geographic distribution characteristics. It was related to the high ratio of cow and sheep farming that less antibiotics were administered to. The pollution status of heavy metals was more severe in East China. Furthermore, high correlations were observed between antibiotics (tetracyclines) and heavy metals (Cu, Zn, and As). Especially, tetracycline in North China and Cd in Northeast China exhibited a high risk in manure; thus, they were priority regions for antibiotics/ heavy metals pollution control. This study identified risk assessment of typical antibiotics and heavy metals in animal manure and emphasized the necessity of regional management across China.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to describe the impact, dynamics and risk factors of the incursion of the African Swine Fever (ASF) virus detected in early 2022 in the wild boar population straddling Piedmont and Liguria, 24 months after its emergence. A study area of 4,162.2 km2s, comprising 234 municipalities in Liguria and Piedmont (north-western Italy), along with an external buffer zone, was considered. The epidemiological units were wild boars tested for ASF using real-time PCR between late December 2021 and December 31, 2023. The data were obtained from passive and active surveillance. Conventional methodologies were applied in the analysis of time series of tests, cases, or prevalence rates of positive animals. Maps were used to visualise and compare the monitoring activities, the location of cases and municipal standardised prevalence ratios. Clustering of high and low trends was studied by semester using a space-time permutation model. Risk factors analysis was based on multivariate Poisson regression modelling. Over the 2-year study period, the epidemic's spread was closely monitored by testing 10,412 wild boars (25 % of them from passive surveillance). Probability of disease detection was 10.9 times higher among found dead animals compared with animals tested in active surveillance. Difficulties in carcass searching led to heterogeneities in surveillance sensitivity achieved locally and inherent uncertainties. A total of 1,165 wild boars that tested positive for ASF have been detected in 125 municipalities across three provinces. The outbreak has expanded over time and exhibited an increasing trend, with an epidemic doubling time of 10.7 months. There was seasonality, with an increasing trend from summer to spring. Prevalence rates followed the same temporal pattern. Significant low and high clusters respectively indicated endemic episodes in the interior areas of virus circulation and an ongoing invasion of surrounding regions. The characteristics of this outbreak align with the cycle of wild boar habitat transmission observed in other outbreaks across Europe. The measures implemented were not sufficient to stop the epidemic: however, targeted interventions such as depopulation campaigns, reinforcement of physical barriers and increased biosecurity measures have prevented local spillover to domestic pigs and partially hindered the advance of the disease. In addition, the shown seasonality of the disease, likely can enhance control measures. The ongoing studies of the local wild boar populations and the evolution the epidemic along with the lessons learned so far will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of efforts to limit and ultimately eradicate the disease.

AB  - Extensively applied glufosinate (GLU) will trigger molecular alterations in nontarget tea plants (Camellia sinensis), which inadvertently disturbs metabolites and finally affects tea quality. The mechanistic response of tea plants to GLU remains unexplored. This study investigated GLU residue behavior, the impact on photosynthetic capacity, specialized metabolites, secondary pathways, and transcript levels in tea seedlings. Here, GLU mainly metabolized to MPP and accumulated more in mature leaves than in tender ones. GLU catastrophically affected photosynthesis, leading to leaf chlorosis, and decreased Fv/Fm and chlorophyll content. Physiological and biochemical, metabolomics, and transcriptomics analyses were integrated. Showing that GLU disrupted the photosynthetic electron transport chain, triggered ROS and antioxidant system, and inhibited photosynthetic carbon fixation. GLU targeted glutamine synthetase (GS) leading to the accumulation of ammonium and the inhibition of key umami L-theanine, causing a disorder in nitrogen metabolism, especially for amino acids synthesis. Interestingly, biosynthesis of primary flavonoids was sacrificed for defensive phenolic acids and lignin formulation, leading to possible losses in nutrition and tenderness in leaves. This study revealed the defense intricacies and potential quality deterioration of tea plants responding to GLU stress. Valuable insights into detoxification mechanisms for non-target crops post-GLU exposure were offered.

AB  - BackgroundSpecies constantly interact with many organisms simultaneously, and multiple species interactions can have unique effects when combined and potentially cause resource and fitness trade-offs to the host. For example, extrafloral nectar can be an effective defence against herbivory, yet this nectar production can be influenced by abiotic and biotic environmental factors, including other mutualisms.AimsHere, we tested how traits associated with two different types of species interactions, herbivory and rhizobia-induced nodulation, may independently and interactively affect a host plant.MethodsWe manipulated the presence or absence of rhizobia at two different levels of herbivory in the field. We measured multiple plant growth traits and fitness responses, such as plant height, above- and below-ground biomass, total biomass, the ratio between above- and below-ground biomass, rhizobia nodule number, and average nodule size, extrafloral nectar volume, extrafloral nectar sugar concentration, as well as ant and arthropod visitation to explore the potential ant-plant mutualism.ResultsRhizobia inoculation did not affect ant or other arthropod visitation but did alter plant traits associated with growth as well as decreased allocation to sugar concentration within extrafloral nectar. Extrafloral nectar volume remained nearly constant in nearly all treatments, except for a decrease when plants did not have rhizobia and were not subjected to herbivory. Finally, increased herbivory led to reduced nodule size but did not alter nodule number, indicating potential shifts in resource allocation.ConclusionsOverall, multiple species interactions have compounding effects when combined, and plant traits alter differentially in response. In particular, we found a substantial benefit of rhizobia to the plants which did not result in either higher ant visitation or herbivory. However, greater herbivory did reduce plant growth, yet these effects varied depending on the presence or absence of rhizobia. This study demonstrates the importance of considering traits associated with multiple diverse species interactions simultaneously to better understand plant responses to environmental conditions.

To investigate the impact of novel ammonifying microorganism cultures (NAMC) on microbial community dynamics and carbon and nitrogen metabolism, five treatments [5% (v/w) sterilized distilled water, Amm-1, Amm-2, Amm-3, and Amm-4] were applied to cow manure compost. Inoculation with NAMC improved the structure of bacterial and fungal communities, enriched the populations of the functional microorganisms, enhanced the role of specific microorganisms, and promoted the formation of tight modularity within the microbial network. Further functional predictions indicated a significant increase in both carbon metabolism (CMB) and nitrogen metabolism (NMB). During the thermophilic phase, inoculated NAMC treatments boosted carbon metabolism annotation by 10.55%-33.87% and nitrogen metabolism annotation by 26.69%-63.11. Structural equation modeling supported the NAMC-mediated enhancement of NMB and CMB. In conclusion, NAMC inoculation, particularly with Amm-4, enhanced the synergistic interaction between bacteria and fungi. This collaboration promoted enzymatic catabolic and synthetic processes, resultng in positive feedback loops with the endogenous microbial community. Understanding these mechanisms not only unravels how ammonifying microorganisms influence microbial communities but also paves the way for the development of the composting industry and global waste management practices.

AB  - Simple Summary Metabolites of intestinal microorganisms play an important role in the growth process of animals, and there are differences in the feeding behavior of animals of different sexes. The aim of this study was to reveal the sex differences in intestinal microbial metabolites of Hainan special wild boars. This study shows that the highest number of differential metabolites was found between entire males and females, the differential metabolites were enriched in more metabolic pathways, and castration reduced this difference. This study provides a certain metabolite database for future precision feeding of Hainan special wild boars and other pig breeds of different sexes.Abstract The intestinal microbiota and its metabolites are essential for the health and growth development of animals. Current research indicates that sex has a certain impact on the structure and function of the intestinal microbiota, but there are few reports on sex differences in intestinal microbiota metabolites, including those of castrated male animals. This study aimed to explore the impact of sex on the intestinal microbial metabolites of Hainan special wild boars (10 entire male pigs, 10 female pigs, and 10 castrated male pigs, denoted EM, FE, and CM, respectively) by employing non-targeted metabolomics and gas chromatography. A total of 1086 metabolites were detected, with the greatest number of differential metabolites observed between EM and FE (54 differential metabolites, including 18 upregulated and 36 downregulated metabolites), the fewest between CM and FE (7 differential metabolites, including 1 upregulated and 6 downregulated metabolites), and an intermediate number between CM and EM (47 differential metabolites, including 35 upregulated and 12 downregulated metabolites). Differential metabolites were involved in more pathways between EM and FE and between CM and EM, including amino acid metabolism and digestive system pathways, whereas differential metabolites were involved in the fewest pathways between CM and FE. Correlation analysis showed Ruminococcaceae UCG-009, uncultured_bacterium_o_SAR324_cladeMarine_group_B, and Candidatus Saccharimonas contributed to the production of metabolites such as trehalose, docosatrienoic acid, D(-)-beta-hydroxy butyric acid, and acetyl-DL-leucine. The levels of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, and isovaleric acid were significantly higher in EM than in FE, with CM falling between the two. Streptococcus, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group showed a significant positive correlation with the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), while [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group, uncultured_bacterium_f_p-251-o5 and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 showed a significant negative correlation with the generation of SCFAs. This study provides foundational data and significant insights into precision feeding strategies for Hainan special wild boars of different sexes, as well as the study of sex differences in intestinal microbial metabolites in animals.

AB  - Water deficit stress largely limits plant growth and survival in natural and managed ecosystems. We studied the morpho-physiological responses of plants associated with distinct strains of Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> fungal endophytes to water deficit. We hypothesised that Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> symbionts would alleviate the negative effects of water deficit on plants and that both magnitude and mechanisms of endophyte-based alleviation would vary depending on the Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> strain. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) plants from the experimental cultivar GA66 associated with the Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> strains AR1, AR5, AR6, and AR37 were subjected to a treatment of sustained water deficit in a pot experiment under controlled growth conditions. We measured plant biomass (shoot and root), water retention, stress-related phytohormones (abscisic acid, jasmonic acid), proline and other water-soluble amino acids, and Epichloe<spacing diaeresis>-derived antiherbivore alkaloids. Alleviation of the negative effects of water deficit on plants depended on the Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> strain, with AR37 and AR5 providing the greatest protection followed by AR1, while AR6 did not alleviate stress. The AR37-derived water deficit alleviation was associated with enhanced root biomass and plant water retention, and increased concentrations of abscisic acid, proline, and fungal alkaloids. The AR5-derived stress alleviation was associated with enhanced plant water retention and increased proline concentrations, and the AR1-derived alleviation with increased fungal alkaloid concentrations and mycelial biomass. Although AR6 did not alleviate the water deficit, the stress increased Epichloe<spacing diaeresis>-derived alkaloid concentrations (and enhanced root biomass) which could provide an advantage for resisting herbivory. Our study highlighted that while Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> generally alleviated the effects of water deficit on plants, the mechanisms of stress alleviation varied among associations, and that the host fitness could be increased even in those associations where endophytes did not alleviate direct water deficit stress if herbivores would be present.

AB  - Very little is known about the feeding of naupliar and juvenile life stages of omnivorous fairy shrimps (Crustacea: Anostraca). Here, we aim to reveal whether the fairy shrimp Branchinecta orientalis is an ontogenetic omnivore and at which age and ontogenetic stage they gain the ability to feed on zooplankton. We assess how food uptake rates change with age until reaching maturity by providing algae (pico- and nanoplanktonic unicellular algae) and zooplankton (rotifers and copepod nauplii) as food in individual experiments. We found that the fairy shrimp B. orientalis started to feed on both types of algal prey immediately after hatching. Nanoplanktonic algae likely represented the most important food source until reaching maturity. Moreover, fairy shrimps started to feed on zooplankton already when they were 7 days old. Slow-moving rotifers gradually gained importance in the fairy shrimp diet with time. Our results reveal an ontogenetic change in the prey spectrum of fairy shrimp. The systematic shift towards omnivory likely affects both phyto- and zooplankton community composition, possibly contributing to temporal changes in food web dynamics in fairy shrimp habitats, and temporary ponds, which may warrant more detailed investigations in future studies.

AB  - Aggregations are key events, supporting critical ecological and biological functions in many species. For highly mobile and elusive species, aggregations often provide the only feasible opportunities for research. Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) form at least 30 consistent seasonal aggregation sites globally, yet none have been documented in the Coral Sea, despite sporadic sightings of solitary individuals and groups. This study aimed to identify and characterise the first whale shark aggregation on Australia's east coast by predicting potential sites through a data layering approach and confirming their presence through targeted field expeditions. A combination of historical sightings data, expert and anecdotal knowledge, and scientific knowledge from other whale shark aggregation sites led to the identification of Wreck Bay, situated at the far northern Great Barrier Reef, as potential aggregation habitat. An initial field expedition in 2019 confirmed the aggregation, and three subsequent voyages in 2021-2024 gathered further demographic and movement data. A total of 59 individuals were identified, with a strong male bias (3.5:1) and all classified as immature sharks ranging from 3.5 to 8.0 m in estimated total length. Satellite tracking revealed a mean residence time of approximately 3 weeks (21.6 days +/- 10.1 SD; range: 7-43 days), with some individuals revisiting the aggregation in subsequent years. The peak aggregation period occurs from late November to late December, with movements concentrated along the continental shelf before dispersing into the Coral Sea. Tracked sharks (n = 18) exhibited wide-ranging movements, with a mean track duration of 144 days (range: 3-770 days) and a mean total track length of 1463 km (range: 19-11,355 km). This study provides the first evidence of a whale shark aggregation in the Coral Sea and highlights Wreck Bay as key habitat for this iconic and globally endangered species.

AB  - We evaluate the growth and mortality of veteran oaks studied by C. Raunki ae r in a game park in Denmark in 1933. Raunki ae r mapped 664 oaks, of which 329 healthy looking oaks had their girth measured (average girth of 318 cm). Mortality decreased with increasing circumference and was estimated to be 0.426% per year. The healthy-looking trees in 1933 had even lower mortality (0.211% per year). There was no difference in mortality between naturally recruited oaks and those planted in the 1830s. These mortality estimates were lower than in previous reports of oaks, veteran trees and large tropical trees, presumably because these oaks were in a non-crowded, non-forested situation. When girth was measured after 50 growing seasons, they had grown an average of 1.33 cm per year. However, the growth rate of these initially healthy trees was highly variable and could be partially explained by the initial tree size. Taking this into account, statistical models suggest that a 300 cm circumference oak in 1933, measured at breast height (130 cm), would have grown 1.28 cm per year in circumference, corresponding to radial growth of 0.20 cm per year and basal area increment of 71.0 cm2 per year.

AB  - Evidence has demonstrated the hippocampal cholinergic system and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) participation during the memory formation of aversive events. This study assessed the role of these systems in the hippocampus for the extinction memory process by submitting male Wistar rats to fear-motivated step-down inhibitory avoidance (IA). The post-extinction session administration of the nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonists, mecamylamine and scopolamine, respectively, both at doses of 2 mu g/mu l/side, and rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor (0.02 mu g/mu l/side), into the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus, impaired the IA extinction memory. Furthermore, the nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonists, nicotine and muscarine, respectively, had a dose-dependent effect on the IA extinction memory when administered intra-CA1, immediately after the extinction session. Nicotine (0.6 mu g/mu l/side) and muscarine (0.02 mu g/mu l/side), respectively, had no effect, while the higher doses (6 and 2 mu g/mu l/side, respectively) impaired the IA extinction memory. Interestingly, the co-administration of muscarine at the lower dose blocked the impairment that was induced by rapamycin. This effect was not observed when nicotine at the lower dose was co-administered. These results have demonstrated the participation of the cholinergic receptors and mTOR in the hippocampus for IA extinction, and that the cholinergic agonists had a dose-dependent effect on the IA extinction memory. This study provides insights related to the behavioural aspects and the neurobiological properties underlying the early stage of fear -motivated IA extinction memory consolidation and suggests that there is hippocampal muscarinic receptor participation independent of mTOR in this memory process.

AB  - Brucellosis is a widespread zoonotic illness, and it poses serious public health and economic risks. The purpose of this investigation is to look at the antimicrobial susceptibility of unpasteurized milk, blood, and lymph node specimens from cattle, goats, and sheep, as well as to identify virulence-associated genes. In this investigation, a total of 123 isolates were examined. The activity of 15 antimicrobials against Brucella pathogens were assessed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique. Nine virulence factors were detected with polymerase chain reaction analysis. Five antibiotics were 100% effective against Brucella isolates. A high level of resistance (100%) was documented with streptomycin, penicillin, and seven more antibiotics. Doxycycline resistance was found in 12% of goat isolates, and tetracycline resistance was found in 21% and 44% of goat and sheep isolates, respectively. Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index >0.2 was found in 38.2% (47/123) of Brucella isolates. VecC and BetB, two B. abortus genes, were confirmed to be comparable. The findings of this study suggests that Brucella spp. are reservoirs of antibiotic resistance in the Eastern Cape Province. As such, they represent a potential pool of antibiotic genes that might be transferred to other pathogens in the community, and thus continue to pose a healthcare hazard.

AB  - Tropical western Atlantic reefs have gradually shifted from being dominated by corals to being mainly covered by macroalgae. The mass-mortality of the sea urchin Diadema antillarum in the 80s and the slow to non-existent recovery exacerbated this shift. Chemical cues associated with these reefs are expected to have shifted too with potential negative effects on larval recruitment, possibly limiting recovery of important species like D. antillarum. In this study, we tested the effects of naturally derived biofilm and macroalgae species native to Caribbean coral reefs on the settlement rate of cultured D. antillarum larvae in two separate experiments. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) were included in both experiments, making it possible to compare settlement rates from both experiments. A biofilm of one week old yielded significantly lower settlement rates compared to two, four, and six weeks old biofilm and the highest settlement rate was found for CCA with over 62% of total larvae. All six tested macroalgae species resulted in settled larvae, with little significant difference between algal species, partly due to a high variation in settlement rates within treatments. Sargassum fluitans induced the highest settlement rate with 33%, which was not significantly different from CCA with 29%. We conclude that dominant macroalgae species likely to be encountered by D. antillarum on shifted reefs are no major constraint to settlement. Our findings increase the understanding of alternative stable state settlement dynamics for a keystone coral reef herbivore.

AB  - Sensitivity analysis is often used to help understand and manage ecological systems by assessing how a constant change in vital rates or other model parameters might affect the management outcome. This allows the manager to identify the most favorable course of action. However, realistic changes are often localized in time-for example, a short period of culling leads to a temporary increase in the mortality rate over the period. Hence, knowing when to act may be just as important as knowing what to act on. In this article, we introduce the method of time-dependent sensitivity analysis (TDSA) that simultaneously addresses both questions. We illustrate TDSA using three case studies: transient dynamics in static disease transmission networks, disease dynamics in a reservoir species with seasonal life history events, and endogenously driven population cycles in herbivorous invertebrate forest pests. We demonstrate how TDSA often provides useful biological insights, which are understandable on hindsight but would not have been easily discovered without the help of TDSA. However, as a caution, we also show how TDSA can produce results that mainly reflect uncertain modeling choices and are therefore potentially misleading. We provide guidelines to help users maximize the utility of TDSA while avoiding pitfalls.

AB  - Plant traits, used by the invasive insect herbivores to find and select suitable hosts, can play an important role in insect host range expansion. With regard to invasive Lycorma delicatula, it is not well explored, however, how the plant origin affects insect host selection, and whether native and introduced host plants differ in their morphology, lifespan, as well as environmental requirements for growth. We addressed this issue in our study through the comprehensive assessment of 25 relevant plant traits (a total of 27,601 records retrieved from the TRY database), as well as the origin and phylogenetic relationships of 37 host plants of L. delicatula in the U.S. Our results showed that only leaf area, leaf chlorophyll content, and canopy size were significantly greater in the introduced hosts than that in native plants. We did not detect a significant effect of the plant origin on other characteristics. Additionally, no significant differences between native and introduced hosts of L. delicatula in genetic distances from introduced Ailanthus altissima (the most preferred host) were detected. These results, for the first time, suggest strong evidence for ecological fitting which might drive the host plant selection of L. delicatula and its rapid spread in the U.S.

AB  - Noninvasive faecal hormone analyses can provide valuable information on the physiological state of wild animals and how they respond to ecological changes or anthropogenic disturbances. However, preservation techniques to prevent hormone alteration can be problematic, and not all are field friendly. We compared five processing methodologies to preserve samples for faecal glucocorticoid, progestagen and thyroid hormone metabolites. Samples were collected from adult zoo Africa savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) (one male, four females) immediately after defecation. Subsamples were then subjected to five preservation methods: lyophilisation (LYO) (considered the gold standard), dehydration, solid-phase extraction (SPE) and two ethanol extraction methods-with and without being immediately dried down. Faecal glucocorticoid, progestagen and thyroid hormone metabolites were quantified by validated enzyme immunoassays. After 7 days at room temperature (to emulate shipping conditions), faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations were lower for all methods compared to LYO. For thyroid hormone metabolite concentrations, the dehydration process resulted in higher concentrations compared to LYO, whereas with SPE, concentrations were lower. For faecal progestagen metabolite concentrations, there were no discernible differences across methods. Based on these results, we recommend ethanol extraction followed by immediate sample desiccation, a method that combines technical simplicity with the advantage of ambient temperature sample storage and transportation. Nevertheless, each investigator should consider the best method for the research question, field conditions, budget, equipment accessibility and shipping requirements, especially as results can vary by species and assay used. With growing interest in assessing animal welfare, validating field methods for noninvasive hormone monitoring is essential.
   Field studies rely on noninvasive faecal hormone analyses. We compared five preservation methodologies for measuring faecal glucocorticoid, progestagen and triiodothyronine metabolites in African savanna elephant faeces compared to standard lyophilisation. All techniques proved satisfactory, but shipping dried ethanol extracts is recommended based on results, shipment ease and relative costs.

AB  - Soybeans, one of the most important legumes, face multiple stresses including drought and herbivory. But the potential transfer of the interactive effects of these stressors onto the transgenerational plants has not been understood. We hypothesised that progeny from stressed parents will have enhanced ecophysiology and defence traits through priming, affecting fitness. Experimental plants were derived from seeds of drought (D), drought and herbivory interaction (D x H), herbivory (H) and well-watered (WW) treatments imposed on parental generation. The findings revealed significant transgenerational effects of D, D x H, H and WW treatments; D x H treatment had negative impacts on seed germination and seedling vigour. The percent change in leaf and root nitrogen and protein content in seedling roots and leaves in D x H compared to D revealed possible remobilisation of nutrients in transgenerational seedlings. The transgenerational effects due to D x H persisted throughout the growing period reducing physiological parameters including net photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance. But the trichomes were significantly induced indicating potential tradeoff for strengthened defences confirmed by soybean looper bioassays. And the tradeoff between defence and morpho-physiology also led to negative effects on yield and fitness. Taken together, transgenerational induction, offers opportunities for developing resilient crops under multiple stressors like drought and herbivory.

AB  - The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) is the best-known hypothesis explaining high performance (e.g. rapid population growth) of exotic species. However, the current framing of the ERH does not explicitly link evidence of enemy release with exotic performance. This leads to uncertainty regarding the role of enemy release in biological invasions. Here, we demonstrate that the effect of enemy release on exotic performance is the product of three factors: enemy impact, enemy diversity, and host adaptation. These factors are modulated by seven contexts: time since introduction, resource availability, phylogenetic relatedness of exotic and native species, host-enemy asynchronicity, number of introduction events, type of enemy, and strength of growth-defence trade-offs. ERH-focused studies frequently test different factors under different contexts. This can lead to inconsistent findings, which typifies current evidence for the ERH. For example, over 80% of meta-analyses fail to consider ecological contexts which can alter study findings; we demonstrate this by re-analysing a recent ERH synthesis. Structuring the ERH around factors and contexts promotes generalisable predictions about when and where exotic species may benefit from enemy release, empowering effective management. Our mechanistic factor-context framework clearly lays out the evidence required to support the ERH, unifies many enemy-related invasion hypotheses, and enhances predictive capacity.
   The enemy release hypothesis as an explanation for (a) increased exotic performance is the product of (b) three factors, which are modulated by (c) seven contexts. Three factors: 1) the difference in per-capita effect of enemies (compare damage on leaves); 2) the difference in enemy diversity, which incorporates enemy abundance (number of individuals) and richness (number of species); and 3) host adaptation, which involves changes in exotic growth (plant size) and defence (shield size). Changes in any one factor will benefit the exotic, assuming the other factors are held constant (e.g. reductions in enemy impact will lead to release, even if enemy diversity remains unchanged). The influence of these factors and our ability to detect them changes with seven contexts. Each panel in (c) shows two hypothetical studies that examine different levels of a given context, and so would give contrasting support for the ERH. While context dependence is visualised in terms of two different exotic species, the contexts are equally applicable to a single exotic species arriving to different native communities, or different source populations of a single exotic species invading the same native community.

AB  - Introduction: Small-scale sheep and goat farming is one of the business models the EU depends on to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal. However, these production systems are characterized by structural weaknesses that risk being aggravated by international events, such as the post-COVID-19 crisis and reconstruction, the conflict in the European area and the generalized inflationary wave. Against this scenario, the work aims to expand knowledge of these companies' sustainability levels to assess their performance, business model, the strategic keys to their resilience and chances of survival in the changed international scenario. Materials & Methods: The approach chosen is SAFA (Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems), the FAO's holistic framework. The empirical analysis focused on a sample of farms in a semi-arid Mediterranean area. Results: The results demonstrate the sustainability lag in governance, social capital, fertilizer management, landscape heritage and economic terms. This is due to the absence of strategic planning on soil, environmental and livestock management, genetic and human resource management, and farm structure. Regarding economic resilience on performance, the weight of the CAP (common agricultural policy) for these farms and the effect of high production costs are high. Conclusion: The work is helpful for different stakeholders, who are invited both to structure the intervention of eco-schemes on animal welfare for the 2023/2027 programming period and to support farm development plans to foster the flow of innovation, cooperation and sustainability.

AB  - Orthoptera are insects that have been widely studied in Argentina and worldwide. However, some groups such as the suborder Ensifera, have received less attention, and their knowledge is scarce. This work reports the presence of the genus Miogryllus (Saussure) in the Chubut Province for the first time (this being the southernmost distribution of the genus), describes a new species for science, and expands the distribution of Gryllus (Gryllus) argentinus (Saussure) to this province. Although about a third of the material studied came from the biogeographic province of Patagonia, it is interesting that both Miogryllus patagonicus sp. nov. like G. (G.) argentinus were exclusively found in sites belonging to the Monte desert, to the east of Chubut Province. Furthermore, all sites where M. patagonicus sp. nov. was collected were characterized by the absence of sheep activity for at least 10 years or by the implementation of environmental remediation strategies. This work represents a valuable contribution to understanding the distribution pattern of the Gryllidae family in Argentine Patagonia and has the potential to enhance current conservation strategies for these fragile ecosystems, as these insects could be good indicators of environmental changes.

AB  - Intensive pig farming produces large amounts of slurry, which is applied to agricultural soils as fertilizer. A 7-year field study was performed to check the effect of pig slurry on soil properties and on the accumulation of some essential nutrients and heavy metals in a calcareous silty-loam soil (0-0.3 m) and in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) plants in two cropping seasons with contrasting amounts of rainfall. Five fertilization treatments, control (no N applied), mineral fertilizer (90 kg N ha(-1)), and different N doses of pig slurry (146, 281, 534 kg N ha(-1)), were applied at sowing of a barley crop. Organic carbon, available P and K, and total P in soil increased with slurry dose. No differences were found in Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Pb soil concentrations. Slurries increased Cu, Mn, and Zn extractions and plant concentrations of P in straw and Zn in grain. However, the lowest slurry rate was able to maintain the highest grain yields while improving fertility. The results of this research study support the sustainability of pig slurry fertilization at appropriate rates in relation to soil chemical quality.

AB  - Approximately 400 million people work and live in high-altitude areas and suffer from memory dysfunction worldwide. Until now, the role of the intestinal flora in plateau-induced brain damage has rarely been reported. To address this, we investigated the effect of intestinal flora on spatial memory impairment induced by high altitudes based on the microbiome-gut-brain axis theory. C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups: control, high-altitude (HA), and high-altitude antibiotic treatment (HAA) group. The HA and HAA groups were exposed to a low-pressure oxygen chamber that simulated an altitude of 4000 m above sea level (m. a. s.l.) for 14 days, with the air pressure in the chamber set at 60-65 kPa. The results showed that spatial memory dysfunction induced by the high-altitude environment was aggravated by antibiotic treatment, manifesting as lowered escape latency and hippocampal memory-related proteins (BDNF and PSD-95). 16 S rRNA sequencing showed a remarkable separation of the ileal microbiota among the three groups. Antibiotic treatment exacerbated the reduced richness and diversity of the ileal microbiota in mice in the HA group. Lactobacillaceae were the main target bacteria and were significantly reduced in the HA group, which was exacerbated by antibiotic treatment. Meanwhile, reduced intestinal permeability and ileal immune function in mice exposed high-altitude environ-ment was also aggravated by antibiotic treatment, as indicated by the lowered tight junction proteins and IL-1 & beta; and IFN-& gamma; levels. Furthermore, indicator species analysis and Netshift co-analysis revealed that Lactobacillaceae (ASV11) and Corynebacteriaceae (ASV78, ASV25, and ASV47) play important roles in high-altitude exposure-induced memory dysfunction. Interestingly, ASV78 was negatively correlated with IL-1 & beta; and IFN-& gamma; levels, indicating that ASV78 may be induced by reduced ileal immune function, which mediates high-altitude envi-ronment exposure-induced memory dysfunction. This study provides evidence that the intestinal flora is effective in preventing brain dysfunction caused by exposure to high-altitude environments, suggesting a relationship between the microbiome-gut-brain axis and altitude exposure.

AB  - Simple Summary Archaea is identified as the key link in the interaction between gut microbiota and host metabo-lism. Studies on human and mice have reported archaea, especially methanogenic archaea, makes an important impact on the energy harvesting capacity of the host by improving fermentation. But, in pigs, the metabolic potential of archaea at different production stages are still largely unknown. Herein, we re-analyzed 276 metagenomic samples to explore the diversity, composi-tion, and potential functions of archaea in pigs. The results showed significant regional variations in archaeal composition. Furthermore, the Metacyc pathway related to hydrogen consumption (METHANOGENESIS-PWY) was only observed in archaeal reads, and archaea may be involved in carbohydrate metabolism and de novo synthesis of some kinds of essential amino acid. Overall, metagenomic re-analysis revealed that the composition and functional potential of archaea in the swine gut and suggested that archaea may make an important function in pigs. Archaea are an essential class of gut microorganisms in humans and animals. Despite the substantial progress in gut microbiome research in the last decade, most studies have focused on bacteria, and little is known about archaea in mammals. In this study, we investigated the composition, diversity, and functional potential of gut archaeal communities in pigs by re-analyzing a published metagenomic dataset including a total of 276 fecal samples from three countries: China (n = 76), Denmark (n = 100), and France (n = 100). For alpha diversity (Shannon Index) of the archaeal communities, Chinese pigs were less diverse than Danish and French pigs (p < 0.001). Consistently, Chinese pigs also possessed different archaeal community structures from the other two groups based on the Bray-Curtis distance matrix. Methanobrevibacter was the most dominant archaeal genus in Chinese pigs (44.94%) and French pigs (15.41%), while Candidatus methanomethylophilus was the most predominant in Danish pigs (15.71%). At the species level, the relative abundance of Candidatus methanomethylophilus alvus, Natrialbaceae archaeon XQ INN 246, and Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii were greatest in Danish, French, and Chinese pigs with a relative abundance of 14.32, 11.67, and 16.28%, respectively. In terms of metabolic potential, the top three pathways in the archaeal communities included the MetaCyc pathway related to the biosynthesis of L-valine, L-isoleucine, and isobutanol. Interestingly, the pathway related to hydrogen consumption (METHANOGENESIS-PWY) was only observed in archaeal reads, while the pathways participating in hydrogen production (FERMENTATION-PWY and PWY4LZ-257) were only detected in bacterial reads. Archaeal communities also possessed CAZyme gene families, with the top five being AA3, GH43, GT2, AA6, and CE9. In terms of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), the class of multidrug resistance was the most abundant ARG, accounting for 87.41% of archaeal ARG hits. Our study reveals the diverse composition and metabolic functions of archaea in pigs, suggesting that archaea might play important roles in swine nutrition and metabolism.

AB  - We investigated palaeofood web structures using stable isotope analyses on animal bone collagen from four Upper Palaeolithic sites dated to the Early Gravettian (Krems-Hundssteig and Krems-Wachtberg: 33-31k cal a bp, Langenlois: 31-29k cal a bp) and to the Early Epigravettian (Kammern-Grubgraben: 24-20k cal a bp). In both periods, d(13)C values show niche partitioning between hare, horse and mammoth on one side, and reindeer and ibex on the other, indicating different diets and habitats between both herbivore groups. The d(15)N differences between carnivores and herbivores suggest a difference of one trophic level during the pre-Last Glacial Maximum (pre-LGM) period at the Early Gravettian sites and a tendency towards secondary carnivores during the LGM at Kammern-Grubgraben. d(15)N values of pre-LGM mammoths are elevated in relation to other herbivores but shifted to the level of other herbivores in the LGM. A general d(15)N value shift in herbivores of 3.3 & PTSTHOUSND; from the pre-LGM to the LGM is related to climatic deterioration. This may have led to the disappearance of certain ecological niches and to a shift from broader to overlapping ecological herbivore niches shortly before the LGM, as demonstrated by SIBER analyses.

AB  - Simple Summary The antler is an important product of deer, which involves in the fast growth of bone. Previous study demonstrated that the production efficiency of 1,25(OH)(2)D is associated with the growth of antler. 25(OH)D is a 1,25(OH)(2)D precursor that is closely associated with bone development in mammals. However, the direct effects on antler growth and transcription, and the responses of the gut microbiota and metabolism of 25(OH)D supplementation in deer remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that 25(OH)D supplementation directly increased the growth and affected the gene expression profiles of sika deer antler. The bacteria community composition and metabolites in rumen were also changed following 25(OH)D supplementation, suggesting the enhanced metabolism of branch-amino acids. Our results confirmed the positive effect of 25(OH)D on antler growth and revealed the regulation of 25(OH)D supplementation on the host and microbes in sika deer. The level of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is associated with the growth of the antler, a fast-growing bone organ of Cervidae. However, the benefits of 25(OH)D supplementation on antler growth and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, the antler growth profile and transcriptome, plasma parameters, rumen bacteria, and metabolites (volatile fatty acids and amino acids) were determined in sika deer in a 25(OH)D supplementation group (25(OH)D, n = 8) and a control group (Ctrl, n = 8). 25(OH)D supplementation significantly increased the antler weight and growth rate. The levels of IGF-1,25(OH)D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher in the 25(OH)D group than in the Ctrl group, while the levels of LDL-C were lower. The levels of valerate and branched-chain amino acids in the rumen fluid were significantly different between the 25(OH)D and Ctrl groups. The bacterial diversity indices were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the relative abundances of the butyrate-producing bacteria (families Lachnospiraceae and Succinivibrionaceae) and the pyruvate metabolism pathway were higher in the 25(OH)D group. The transcriptomic profile of the antler was significantly different between the 25(OH)D and Ctrl groups, with 356 up- and 668 down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 25(OH)D group. The up-regulated DEGs were enriched in the proteinaceous extracellular matrix and collagen, while the down-regulated DEGs were enriched in the immune system and lipid metabolism pathways. Overall, these results provide novel insights into the effects of 25(OH)D supplementation on the host metabolism, rumen microbiota, and antler transcriptome of sika deer.

AB  - Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide with a yearly increase in global application. Recent studies report glyphosate residues from diverse habitats globally where the effect on non-target plants are still to be explored. Glyphosate disrupts the shikimate pathway which is the basis for several plant metabolites. The central role of phytohormones in regulating plant growth and responses to abiotic and biotic environment has been ignored in studies examining the effects of glyphosate residues on plant performance and trophic interactions. We studied interactive effects of glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) residues and phosphate fertilizer in soil on the content of main phytohormones, their precursors and metabolites, as well as on plant performance and herbivore damage, in three plant species, oat (Avena sativa), potato (Solanum tuberosum), and strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa). Plant hormonal responses to GBH residues were highly species-specific. Potato responded to GBH soil treatment with an increase in stress-related phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and jasmonic acid (JA) but a decrease in cytokinin (CK) ribosides and cytokinin-O-glycosides. GBH residues in combination with phosphate in soil increased aboveground biomass of potato plants and the concentration of the auxin phenylacetic acid (PAA) but decreased phaseic acid and cytokinin ribosides (CKR) and O-glycosides. Chorismate-derived compounds [IAA, PAA and benzoic acid (BzA)] as well as herbivore damage decreased in oat, when growing in GBH-treated soil but concentrations of the cytokinin dihydrozeatin (DZ) and CKR increased. In strawberry plants, phosphate treatment was associated with an elevation of auxin (IAA) and the CK trans-zeatin (tZ), while decreasing concentrations of the auxin PAA and CK DZ was observed in the case of GBH treatment. Our results demonstrate that ubiquitous herbicide residues have multifaceted consequences by modulating the hormonal equilibrium of plants, which can have cascading effects on trophic interactions.

AB  - The depiction of an Orthoptera Ensifera discovered in Enlene cave (Ariege, France) in 1928 has long been interpreted as a Troglophilus sp., i.e. a representation of a cave-dwelling orthoptera species. We here propose another interpretation based on the knowledge of the contemporary community of bush- and cave-cricket species, and their morphological and ecological traits. We rather suggest that this engraved Orthoptera may represent a bush-cricket species (Polysarcus spp.) and propose arguments supporting the hypothesis that it may represent a bush-cricket that could have been part of their diet.

AB  - The dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) is a large ungulate that copes well with the xeric environment of the desert. Its peculiar adaptation to heat and dehydration is well-known. However, its behavior and general activity is far from being completely understood. The present study was carried out to investigate the ecological effect of the various seasons on the locomotor activity (LA) rhythm and diurnal activity of this species. Six adult female camels were maintained under mesic semi-natural conditions of the environment during four periods of 10 days in each season: autumn, winter, spring and summer. In addition, three female camels were used to test the effect of rain on the LA rhythm during a period of 18 days during the winter. The animal's LA was recorded using the locomotion scoring method. Camels displayed a clear 24.0h LA rhythm throughout the four seasons. Activity was intense during Day-time (6-22 fold higher in comparison to night) and dropped or completely disappeared during nighttime. Mean daytime total activity was significantly higher in the summer as compared to winter. Regardless of the season, the active phase in camels coincided with the time of the photophase and thermophase. Furthermore, the daily duration of the time spent active was directly correlated to the seasonal changes of photoperiod. The diurnal activity remained unchanged over the four seasons. For each season, the start and the end of the active phase were synchronized with the onset of sunrise and sunset. At these time periods, temperature remained incredibly stable with a change ranging from 0.002 to 0.210 degrees C; whereas, changes of light intensity were greater and faster with a change from 0.1 to 600 lux representing a variation of 3215-7192 fold in just 25-29 min. Rainfall affected the pattern of the LA rhythm with occurrence of abnormal nocturnal activity during nighttime disturbing nocturnal rest and sleep. Here we show that the dromedary camel exhibits significant seasonal changes of its activity within daylight hours. However, the diurnal pattern remains unchanged regardless of the season; whereas, abnormal nocturnal activity is observed during periods of rain. The activity onset and offset in this species seems to be primarily driven by the changes in light intensity at dusk and dawn.

AB  - High intra-specific genetic diversity is associated with adaptive potential, which is key for resilience to global change. However, high variation may also support deleterious alleles through genetic load, thereby increasing the risk of inbreeding depression if population sizes decrease. Purging of deleterious variation has been demonstrated in some threatened species. However, less is known about the costs of declines and inbreeding in species with large population sizes and high genetic diversity even though this encompasses many species globally that are expected to undergo population declines. Caribou is a species of ecological and cultural significance in North America with a wide distribution supporting extensive phenotypic variation but with some populations undergoing significant declines resulting in their at -risk status in Canada. We assessed intra-specific genetic variation, adaptive divergence, inbreeding, and genetic load across populations with different demographic histories using an annotated chromosome -scale reference genome and 66 whole-genome sequences. We found high genetic diversity and nine phylogenomic lineages across the continent with adaptive diversification of genes, but also high genetic load among lineages. We found highly divergent levels of inbreeding across individuals, including the loss of alleles by drift but not increased purging in inbred individuals, which had more homozygous deleterious alleles. We also found comparable frequencies of homozygous deleterious alleles between lineages regardless of nucleotide diversity. Thus, further inbreeding may need to be mitigated through conservation efforts. Our results highlight the "double-edged sword"of genetic diversity that may be representative of other species atrisk affected by anthropogenic activities.

AB  - In temperate European forests invaded by Prunus serotina Ehrh. (black cherry), a reduction in the spontaneous regeneration capacity of Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) is observed. It could be caused by various factors, including allelopathic properties of this invasive plant. In this study the phytotoxic effect of P. serotina volatile compounds on P. sylvestris and the seasonal variation in this effect were assessed. Simple assays showed that volatiles emitted from P. serotina leaves significantly inhibited root growth of P. sylvestris seedlings. Their negative effect on stem growth was much weaker. The strongest phytotoxic effect on Scots pine seedlings was caused by the volatiles emitted from the youngest black cherry leaves. In fresh foliage of P. serotina, nineteen volatile organic compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The dominant compound was benzaldehyde. On the basis of tests of linalool alone, it was found that this monoterpene present in the volatile fraction has a strong allelopathic potential and inhibits germination, root elongation and shoot elongation of pine seedlings. The results of our research suggest that volatile compounds from P. serotina leaves could limited survival of P. sylvestris individuals in the seedling phase.

AB  - Background Dispersal is a fundamental process to animal population dynamics and gene flow. In white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus), dispersal also presents an increasingly relevant risk for the spread of infectious diseases. Across their wide range, WTD dispersal is believed to be driven by a suite of landscape and host behavioral factors, but these can vary by region, season, and sex. Our objectives were to (1) identify dispersal events in Wisconsin WTD and determine drivers of dispersal rates and distances, and (2) determine how landscape features (e.g., rivers, roads) structure deer dispersal paths. Methods We developed an algorithmic approach to detect dispersal events from GPS collar data for 590 juvenile, yearling, and adult WTD. We used statistical models to identify host and landscape drivers of dispersal rates and distances, including the role of agricultural land use, the traversability of the landscape, and potential interactions between deer. We then performed a step selection analysis to determine how landscape features such as agricultural land use, elevation, rivers, and roads affected deer dispersal paths. Results Dispersal predominantly occurred in juvenile males, of which 64.2% dispersed, with dispersal events uncommon in other sex and age classes. Juvenile male dispersal probability was positively associated with the proportion of the natal range that was classified as agricultural land use, but only during the spring. Dispersal distances were typically short (median 5.77 km, range: 1.3-68.3 km), especially in the fall. Further, dispersal distances were positively associated with agricultural land use in potential dispersal paths but negatively associated with the number of proximate deer in the natal range. Lastly, we found that, during dispersal, juvenile males typically avoided agricultural land use but selected for areas near rivers and streams. Conclusion Land use-particularly agricultural-was a key driver of dispersal rates, distances, and paths in Wisconsin WTD. In addition, our results support the importance of deer social environments in shaping dispersal behavior. Our findings reinforce knowledge of dispersal ecology in WTD and how landscape factors-including major rivers, roads, and land-use patterns-structure host gene flow and potential pathogen transmission.

AB  - A study was conducted to investigate effects of starvation and refeeding on growth, physiology and intestine structure of Hippocampus erectus. This study was divided into 2 periods within one month: a starvation period in which seahorses were subjected to the following 4 starved stage: 0 days (S0), 5 days (S5), 10 days (S10), 15 days (S15) and a refeeding period: S5F25 (25 days of refeeding after 5 days of starvation), S10F20 (20 days of refeeding after 10 days of starvation), S15F15 (15 days of refeeding after 15 days of starvation). Total protein content decreased significantly during starvation while S5F25, F10F20 existed no significant difference with continuedly feeding group. Intestine lipase of S5 increased significantly while intestinal lipase of S15 markedly decreased. Intestine protease activity and hepatic digestive enzyme significantly decreased after starvation, but digestive enzyme of S5F25, S10F20 had no significant difference with continuedly feeding group. Hepatic SOD and CAT activities reached highest at S5 and S10, respectively. MDA level of S5, S10 and S15 was significantly higher than that of continuedly feeding group. SOD, CAT, MDA level of S5F25 and S10F20 had no significant difference with continuedly feeding group. Starved seahorse showed decreased height of mucosal fold and microvilli, enlarged gap between mucosal layer and submucosal layer, reduced number of organelles and swollen mitochondria in intestinal epithelial cells but recovered to some extent after refeeding. This study explored starvation physiology knowledge of seahorse which provided scientific significance for seahorse aquaculture.

AB  - Mode of reproduction in the genus Opuntia varies among species but often includes both vegetative and sexual reproduction, with the latter often facilitated by animal seed dispersal. In this multi-year study, we examined fruit and seed production and seed dispersal in the Mojave prickly pear (Opuntia phaeacantha) at two sites in the southwest Mojave Desert. Between 2015-2020 we counted fruits on randomly selected cactus patches, quantified fruit losses from those patches over time, collected fruits, and extracted and counted seeds. To assess seed dispersal, we collected fresh mammal pellets in belt transects at one site from 2016-2018; pellets were examined for Opuntia seeds. To assess animal fruit consumption and removal, we installed camera traps at one site. We baited selected patches with fruits and photographed animals that consumed or removed fruits. Fruit numbers varied widely among years and sites, although fruit production was not significantly correlated with climatic variables. Fruit losses were high at both sites, occurring more slowly in years of high fruit production. Seeds per fruit also varied with means ranging from 65 to 125 seeds. Rabbit and deer (Odocoileus hemionus) pellets were abundant at one site where we found 0.02 seeds per rabbit pellet but none in deer pellets. Camera traps baited with fruits revealed that they disappeared more quickly from patch edges than from patch interiors. Desert cottontails (Sylvilagus audubonii) and California jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) dominated photographs at patch edges while nearly all interior photographs were of white-tailed antelope squirrels (Ammospermophilus leucurus). In summary, although the number of seeds produced by O. phaeacantha is highly variable, the total number per site is high in some years, and fruits are consumed and seeds spread by animal dispersers.

AB  - Herbivory may have a great impact in plants, reducing plant biomass and fitness. Herbivory patterns may differ among genders in dioecious species, affecting male and female plants differentially, and it has been suggested this is a consequence of differences in resource allocation among genders. In this study, we evaluated herbivory intensity and mechanical defenses among genders during two years and during different phenological stages in populations of Fuchsia parviflora, a dioecious shrub. We also evaluated generalist and specialist herbivore gender preferences through a cafeteria experiment. No evident herbivory patterns were detected among genders using both the proportion of leaves affected by herbivory and the proportion of leaf area removed, except during one year in two populations where females had a significantly higher proportion of leaves affected by herbivory. This pattern is similar to the specialist herbivore preference detected in the cafeteria experiment. We also found significant differences in herbivory intensity among phenological stages, populations, and years, highlighting the relevance of continuous sampling to depict the general patterns of herbivory in dioecious plants.

AB  - The Tibetan Plateau, despite being the highest and least populated plateau on the Earth, harbors antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARBs) as well as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in its pristine environment and animals. There is, however, limited knowledge regarding antibiotic resistance in Tibetan Plateau animals. Here, fecal samples of grazing yaks and intestinal content samples of wild rats were collected at altitudes of 2920 m and 4360 m and subjected to selective culture, PCR, and metagenomic sequencing. The results revealed a higher antibiotic resistance rate in lowaltitude regions than in high-altitude regions. The simultaneous presence of bacteria exhibiting different antibiotic resistance phenotypes across multiple samples suggests the potential emergence of multidrug-resistant strains within the animal gut microbiota. Pseudomonas spp. and Escherichia coli were the predominant ARBs. In contrast to low-altitude regions with frequent human activities, ARG dissemination in the Tibetan Plateau did not show a significant correlation with mobile genetic elements. ARGs in high-altitude regions relied more on vertical gene transmission. This study expands our knowledge of antibiotic resistance in grazing and wild animals inhabiting the Tibetan Plateau, thereby highlighting the potential threat posed by antibiotic resistance in this region.

AB  - True water bugs (Nepomorpha) are mostly predacious insects that live in aquatic habitats. They use their piercing-sucking mouthparts to inject venomous saliva that facilitates the capture and extra-oral digestion of prey animals, but their venom can also be deployed for defence. In Central Europe, nepomorph species representing different families coexist in the same habitat. However, their feeding ecology, including venom composition and deployment, has not been investigated in detail. We used an integrated proteotranscriptomic and bioactivity-based approach to test whether venom composition and activity differ between four water bug species sharing the same habitat but occupying different ecological niches. We found considerable species-dependent differences in the composition of digestive enzymes and venom components that probably evolved as adaptations to particular food sources, foraging strategies and/or microhabitats. The venom of Corixa punctata differed substantially from that of the three strictly predatory species (Ilyocoris cimicoides, Notonecta glauca and Nepa cinerea), and the abundance of herbivory-associated proteins confirms a mostly plant-based diet. Our findings reveal independent adaptations of the digestive and defensive enzyme repertoires accompanied by the evolution of distinct feeding strategies in aquatic bugs.

AB  - Elephants in Africa are declining rapidly due to habitat loss and human-wildlife conflicts, with these problems worsening with climate change. Understanding how age classes respond to such events is crucial to designing and implementing mitigation strategies and developing the adaptive capacity of wildlife managers to respond to these challenges adequately. This study builds a dynamic simulation model of the age classes of elephants and their interaction with habitat, water, and climate. The dynamic response of elephant populations to habitat change, water resources, and climate change is assessed. It is observed that climate change affects older elephants more than young ones in terms of survivability and migration. It is also likely that the undetected direct climate change impact on the elephant population is due to changes in habitats, particularly forests and wetlands used for thermal regulation. An improvement in the habitat type and availability of water resources improved the age classes of populations. The results suggest that if the environmental and anthropogenic stressors are not mitigated, Greater Virunga Landscape (GVL) will face a change in population demography for younger elephants and impact overall populations. Such age-class- specific stress could substantially affect African elephants' long-term population viability and sustainability. Conservation of elephants requires a transboundary management approach to climate change mitigation, cooperation among conservation agencies, and effective partnerships with all relevant stakeholders for conservation.

AB  - Enrofloxacin (ENR) is one of the most commonly used antibiotics in pig farms. In this study, using fresh pig manure and corn straw powder as substrates, the effects of different concentrations of ENR (2.5, 10, and 20 mg/L) on anaerobic digestion in completely mixed anaerobic reactors were investigated. A relatively low concentration of ENR (2.5 mg/L) increased methane production by 47.58% compared with the control group. Among the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the reactors, the propionic acid content was the lowest, and the concentrations of acetic acid kinase and coenzyme F420 were highest in the first seven days during peak gas production. However, methane production in the reactors with 10 mg/L and 20 mg/L ENR decreased by 8.59% and 20.25%, respectively. Furthermore, the accelerated hydrolysis of extracellular polymeric substances causes a significant accumulation of VFA levels. The microbial community in anaerobic reactors was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Proteiniphilum was the dominant bacterial genus. In addition, ENR at 2.5 mg/L effectively increased the abundance and diversity of anaerobic microorganisms, whereas a high concentration of ENR (10 and 20 mg/L) significantly decreased these parameters. This study demonstrated that different concentrations of ENR had significantly different effects on anaerobic digestion.

AB  - This research investigated a synthetic amendment to improve composting and resource recycling of pig manure and biogas residue. We further examined whether adding a synthetic amendment impacts the microbial ecosystem in the composted materials. Three mixing ratios were used to investigate composting performance: no synthetic amendment (T0), 5% synthetic amendment (T1), and 10% synthetic amendment (T2) (T1 and T2 were measured as a wet weight ratio). There were no significant differences in the fundamental characteristics between composting products in T0 and T1. The moisture content of composting material in T0, T1, and T2 significantly decreased from a baseline of approximately 65% to 35.5%, 37.3%, and 55.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, the germination index significantly increased to 111.6%, 155.6%, and 62.3%, respectively. When an optimal proportion of synthetic amendment was added, T1 showed high degree of humification, lignocellulase activities, and effective biodegradation. Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacteria, while Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungi in all treatment groups. Amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, glycolysis, starch, and sucrose metabolism were among the primary pathways in predicted functions. The synthetic amendment can generate a mature composting product and can be reused or recycled to conserve resources.& nbsp; (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many organisms divide limited defenses among heterogeneous assets. Plants allocate defensive chemicals among tissues differing in value, cost of defense, and risk of herbivory. Some ant colonies allocate specialized defenders among multiple nests differing in volume, entrance size, and risk of attack. We develop a general mathematical model to determine the optimal strategy for dividing defenses among assets depending on their value, defendability, and risk of attack. We build on plant defense theory by focusing on defendability, which we define as the functional relationship between defensive investment and successful defense. We show that if hard-to-defend assets cost more to defend, as assumed in resource defense theory, the optimal strategy allocates more defenses to those assets, regardless of risk. Inspired by cavity-nesting ants, we also consider the possibility that hard-to-defend assets have a lower chance to be successfully defended, even when defensive investment is high. Under this assumption, the optimal response to elevated risk is to reduce defensive allocation to hard-to-defend assets, a conservative strategy previously observed in turtle ants (Cephalotes). This new perspective on defendability suggests that in systems where assets differ in the chance of successful defense, defensive strategies may evolve to be sensitive to risk in surprising ways.

AB  - Heat waves are becoming more frequent with climate change, and their impact on lower and higher trophic levels can differ. Higher trophic levels, such as predators and parasitoids, are predicted to be more strongly affected by heat waves than herbivores because they may have smaller thermal windows and because of altered ecological interactions with lower trophic levels. We tested the effects of heat waves of varying intensity (36-42 degrees C), imposed for 4 h during five consecutive days on the egg stage of an invasive herbivore, the brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys), and on various developmental stages of its parasitoid, Trissolcus japonicus. Halyomorpha halys eggs had lower hatching success and fewer nymphs emerging with increasing intensity of heat stress, while exposure during the egg and larval stages of T. japonicus did not decrease adult emergence rates. Heat waves increased developmental time of parasitoids and decreased adult emergence when pupal stages were exposed. Adult parasitoids experiencing heat stress had lower survival, but their parasitism success overall was not affected. In addition, we detected transgenerational effects, whereas emergence success and the number of adult parasitoids emerging in the second generation declined when the parental generation was exposed to 42 degrees C. Contrary to expectations, the results suggest that H. halys may be more sensitive to heat stress than T. japonicus, at least during early development. Our findings indicate that biological control services provided by T. japonicus can be maintained in the face of increasing heat wave events and point to the importance of following populations beyond the first generation to better understand the long-term consequences of heat stress.

AB  - Land use change could significantly affect soil organic carbon (SOC) and other soil chemical properties. However, the responses of soil labile C fractions at different soil depths to land-use change are not still clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of paddy field conversion on woodlands or corn fields on total soil organic C (TOC) and its labile C fractions including particulate organic C (POC), microbial biomass C (MBC), and potassium permanganate-oxidizable C (KMnO4-C) along a 0-100 cm soil profile. Our results indicate that soil TOC concentrations increased by 3.88 g kg(-1) and 3.47 g kg(-1) in the 0-5 cm soil layer and 5.33 g kg(-1) and 4.68 g kg(-1) in the 5-20 cm soil layer during 13 years after the conversion from paddy fields to woodlands and corn fields, respectively. In the 20-40 cm soil layer, the woodlands had the highest TOC concentration (12.3 g kg(-1)), which was 5.13 g kg(-1) and 3.5 g kg(-1) higher than that of the paddy and corn fields, respectively. The increase in TOC was probably due to the absence of soil disturbance and greater root residue input into the woodland soil. In corn fields, pig manure addition contributed to the increase in soil organic C concentrations. In addition, the proportion of soil KMnO4-C increased after conversion from paddy fields to woodlands or corn fields in the 0-40 cm soil layer, ranging from 39.9-56.6% for the woodlands and 24.6-32.9% for the corn fields. The soil POC content was significantly higher in woodland and corn field soils than in paddy field soils at lower soil depths (5-40 cm). However, there were no differences in MBC contents in the whole soil profile between the woodlands and paddy fields. The KMnO4-C and MBC was the most important factor affecting the CMI values through the whole 0-100 cm soil profile. Overall, converting paddy fields to woodlands or corn fields increased the TOC and labile C fractions in the 0-40 cm soil layer. Future studies should focus on the response of the deeper soil C pool to land-use change.

AB  - Simple Summary This study quantified glucocorticoids in faeces of wild European bison and correlated it to different aspects of social status (leadership, age as a proxy of experience, dominance, social centrality) in order to better understand social mechanisms in this endangered species. Measurement of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites could thus be a valuable tool to follow and improve the adaptation and the welfare of herds in the semi-wild and in captivity by long-term following states of animals and changing conditions, according to them. Stress is the body's response to cope with the environment and generally better survive unless too much chronic stress persists. While some studies suggest that it would be more stressful to be the dominant individual of the group, others support the opposite hypothesis. Several variables can actually affect this relationship, or even cancel it. This study therefore aims to make the link between social status and the basal level of stress of 14 wild European bison (Bison bonasus, L. 1758) living together. We collected faeces and measured the faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM). We showed that FGM is linked to different variables of social status of European bison, specifically age, dominance rank, eigenvector centrality but also to interactions between the variables. Preferential leaders in bison, i.e., the older and more dominant individuals which are more central ones, are less stressed compared to other group members. Measurement of such variables could thus be a valuable tool to follow and improve the conservation of species by collecting data on FGM and other social variables and adapt group composition or environmental conditions (e.g., supplement in food) according to the FGM concentration of herd individuals.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aimed to investigate the nutritional intake deficiency on rearing yak calves. We investigated supplemental concentrate feeding effects on the morphological and functional development of the pancreas in early weaned yak calves. In the study, we determined the apparent digestibility of nutrients by digestion trail, the morphological development of the pancreas in yak calves by tissue sectioning, the activity of main digestive enzymes and hormone levels by ELISA kits, and the content of major small molecule metabolites in the pancreas by non-targeted metabolomics techniques. The morphological and functional development of the pancreas and its small molecule metabolites are mainly presented in graphical form, which had positive regulatory effects on the development of the pancreas in early weaned yak calves. In summary, we found that supplemental concentrate feeding was crucial for the high-quality growth and development of early weaned yak calves and had a positive influence on the intrinsic relationship between the overall development level and physiological functions of the pancreas, which could provide an important reference for scientific rearing of early weaned yak calves. This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of supplemental concentrate feeding on the pancreatic development of yak calves. Twenty one-month-old yak calves with healthy body condition and similar body weight were selected as experimental animals and randomly divided into two groups, five replicates in each group. The control group yak calves were fed milk replacer and alfalfa hay, the experimental group yak calves were fed milk replacer, alfalfa hay and concentrate. The pre-feeding period of this experiment was thirty days, the trial period was one hundred days. At the end of feeding trail, five yak calves from each group were selected and slaughtered and the pancreas tissues of yak calves were collected and determined. The results showed that: (1) Dry matter and body weight of yak calves in the test group were significantly higher than those of the control group. (2) The apparent nutrient digestibility of crude protein, crude fat, calcium and phosphorus in the test group of yak calves was significantly higher than that of the control group, while the apparent nutrient digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber in the test group was significantly lower than that of the control group. (3) Pancreatic weight, organ index, total ratio of exocrine part area and total ratio of endocrine area of yak calves in the test group were significantly higher than those in the control group, while the ratio of exocrine area was significantly lower in the test group than that of the control group. (4) The activities of the main pancreatic digestive enzymes: pancreatic amylase, pancreatic lipase, pancreatic protease and chymotrypsin were significantly higher in the test group than those of the control group, as were the hormonal contents of glucagon, insulin and pancreatic polypeptide.
   (5) The main differential metabolites of the pancreas in the test group were significantly higher than those of the control group, such as D-proline, hypoxanthine, acetylcysteine, gamma-glutamylcysteine, thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, piperidinic acid, ellagic acid, nicotinamide, tropolone, D-serine, ribulose-5-phosphate, (+/-)5(6)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid(EET), 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, L-phenylalanine, creatinine, tetrahydrocorticosterone, pyridoxamine, xanthine, 5-oxoproline, asparagine, DL-tryptophan, in-dole-3-acrylic acid, thymine, trehalose, docosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids(FAHFA) (18:1/20:3), fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids(FAHFA) (18:2/20:4), adrenic acid and xanthosine. In conclusion, supplemental concentrate feeding promoted the good development of morphological and functional properties of the pancreas in early weaned yak calves to improve the digestion and absorption of feed nutrients, so as to enhance the growth and development quality of early weaned yak calves.

AB  - This study aimed to verify the impact of parity on tissue mobilisation, metabolic response, oxidative stress and reproductive tract traits during the peripartum period. Nineteen goats with singleton pregnancies were grouped into nine nulliparous (NU) and 10 multiparous (MU). The animals were followed from the fifth week before delivery to the fourth week after delivery. Does, kids and milk production were weighed; the loin muscle depth area, subcutaneous loin, kidney fat thicknesses, size of the uterus and haemodynamics of the uterine artery were measured by ultrasound. Placenta was weighed and the cotyledons were counted and measured. Plasma was assayed for total protein, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), glutamic-oxaloacetic acid transaminase (GOT) and glutamic-pyruvic acid transaminase (GPT), glutathione peroxidase and beta-hydroxybutyrate. MU showed a greater live weight loss (+8%) and longer period of body mass loss (+12 days). Milk production was higher in MU and their kids were heavier at birth with greater weight gain. No differences in the effect of parity were found for uterine diameter and placental weight, while the NU goats had a larger cotyledonary surface. Additionally, MU goats had higher levels of glucose, GPT, GGT, cholesterol, total protein and glutathione peroxidase. In MU females, there was a greater muscle mass mobilisation throughout the peripartum period and a superior replacement of adipose tissue after delivery (+1.3 mm). Therefore, MU females appear to have better tissue mobilisation and productive performance dynamics, although parity does not affect uterine involution in goats.

AB  - Simple Summary Swiss dairy goats are commonly housed on deep littler, at least during the winter season. Due to the lack of horn wear, their claws often show overgrown wall horn. However, little is known about the impact of wall horn overgrowth on claw health and whether wall horn overgrowth impairs the goats' locomotion behavior. Data was collected on 28 Swiss commercial dairy goat farms during autumn and spring. It was shown that severe wall horn overgrowth dominated during the indoor housing period and was associated with an increase in the proportion of claws with sole hemorrhages. Furthermore, wall horn overgrowth did not seem to have an effect on the goats' locomotion behavior. The results of this study underline the importance of regular and careful claw trimming. Due to a rising demand for goat milk and goat milk products worldwide, it is likely that dairy goat production will be intensified in the future, with larger herds per farm. In Switzerland, as in many other countries with intensive farming systems, dairy goats are typically housed on deep litter, with little access to hard abrasive surfaces. Such housing conditions will result in wall horn overgrowth. The aim of this study was to gain profound knowledge on the occurrence of overgrown wall horn, its impact on claw health and locomotor behavior, and possible adverse effects on animal welfare. Additionally, housing and management factors that may contribute to non-physiological claw conditions were evaluated. To compare claw conditions after the summer grazing period and the winter indoor housing period, data were collected on 28 Swiss dairy goat farms in autumn and spring (621 goats in total). Claw lesions were recorded with the help of a "claw card" documenting each claw. Furthermore, pictures were taken of each claw to determine the severity of wall horn overgrowth. Locomotion behavior (activity, lying time and lying bouts) was recorded with three-dimensional accelerometers fixed to the goats' hind legs. In autumn, 66.7% of the examined claws showed moderate overgrowth, 32.4% severe overgrowth and 0.9% no overgrowth. In spring, 47.4% of the examined claws were affected with moderate overgrowth, 52.6% with severe overgrowth and 0.0% with no overgrowth. Horn separation (48.1% of examined claws) and sole hemorrhages (16.0% of examined claws) were the most frequent lesions. In goats with severely overgrown claws, the risk of developing sole hemorrhages was doubled compared with moderate overgrowth. The occurrence rate of horn separation was lower if the trimmer had attended a special skills training course (p < 0.001). Furthermore, locomotor activity (p < 0.01) and the number of lying bouts per day (p < 0.01) were higher in spring than autumn. Neither the goats' activity nor the number of lying bouts per day differed before and after claw trimming. Finally, season and trimming were not associated with the goats' total lying time. A certain extent of wall horn overgrowth in dairy goat claws cannot be avoided under the housing conditions typical for Swiss farms. Severe wall horn overgrowth is associated with an increase in the proportion of claws with sole hemorrhages. Therefore, regular and careful functional claw trimming, taking the housing situation (deep bedding, access to pasture, grazing on alpine pasture) into account, should be promoted.

AB  - Philippine brown deer Rusa marianna Desmarest 1822, has been considered a conservation priority following its declaration as an endangered species by the Philippine Red List of Threatened Fauna in 2020. The research study analyzed the gender roles of women and men in the conservation of the Philippine brown deer (R. marianna) in the Obu Manuvu Ancestral Domain (OMAD) in Baguio District, Davao City, Philippines. Using the Harvard Analytical Framework (HAF), the study explored women's and men's (1) activity profile, (2) access to and control over resources, (3) knowledge, beliefs, and perceptions, (4) decision-making power, (5) laws, legal rights, policies, and institutions, and (6) priorities, and needs/ opportunities, and constraints. Sixteen individuals participated in the key informant interviews (KIIs), represented by chieftains, elders, and women. The results of the gender analysis conveyed that women and men are primarily involved in deer conservation. Gender gaps have been documented in education, employment, and resource management, showing that men have better access than women. However, both genders are provided access to information and training as part of the capacity-building for conservation works. In terms of employment preference, Obu Manuvu men largely dominated the farming jobs, while women worked home-based. They are also given equal rights regarding their participation in the decision-making process and property ownership. A livelihood program is considered one of the needs of the indigenous community, which includes the opportunity to economize their conservation services. Therefore, the study recommends that gender roles be integrated into formulating a conservation model. Providing equal education, employment, and livelihood opportunities for women and men is vital to the deer's sustainable conservation.

AB  - Biosynthesis and storage of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is under dietary and genetic control in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Enhanced EPA and DHA biosynthesis and storage may improve utilization, and thus reduce marine forage fish oil use in aquafeeds. To determine phenotypic variability in EPA and DHA tissue content and growth performance, 50 families (n = 30 salmon/family, 48 g/fish initial weight) of Atlantic salmon (Saint John River strain) were reared in freshwater and fed either a fish oil (FO) control diet or FO-free diet. After 16 weeks, body size was recorded. Salmon fed the FO-free diet overall showed significantly lower growth performance compared to salmon fed the FO control diet, regardless of family. To determine the relationship between growth and FA content, the five families with the highest and the five families with the lowest weight gain were sampled for tissue and liver FA analysis. There was a significant interaction between growth and diet. The family x diet interaction was significant for final weight, final length, weight gain, growth rate and feed conversion ratio. Among the five fastest growing families, there was a significant family effect for EPA and DHA storage in the liver but not for muscle. Among the five slowest growing families, by comparison salmon had similar liver DHA and EPA content, independent of diet treatment. Family and diet were interacting factors that determine EPA and DHA storage in liver. Certain fast-growing families also had significantly higher DHA content in liver and muscle. This study demonstrates the potential for selecting families that can better utilize a diet without marine forage fish oil.

AB  - Native legumes are functionally important members of grasslands, but their reintroduction into degraded systems is limited by strong establishment filters. One of these establishment filters might be rhizobia limitation, where legume seedlings are unable to find suitable rhizobia symbionts in grasslands targeted for restoration. To test links between rhizobial inoculation and legume demographic parameters in a grassland restoration context, we evaluated how inoculation with rhizobia altered survival and seed production of a native annual legume (Chamaecrista fasciculata) inoculated with rhizobia and transplanted into a restored prairie. Small mammal herbivory was an important filter affecting survival of C. fasciculata transplants, with inoculated plants 81% more likely to be grazed than uninoculated plants. Despite this heavy grazing, plants inoculated with rhizobia survived transplantation 71% more often and, as a result, produced 82% more flowers, experienced 73% more visits by pollinators, and on average produced 220% more seeds. Our results indicate that although herbivory may also shape legume population establishment, at least in some years in some places, rhizobia could alter C. fasciculata interactions with both herbivores and pollinators and improve population establishment.

AB  - In the mountain regions of northern Pakistan, pasture-based animal husbandry is a substantial element of people's livelihood. To study the implications of herding strategies on rangeland utilization patterns, individual interviews with 90 herders and 10 group interviews with five to eight herders per group, respectively, were conducted in three valleys each of Pakistan's Gilgit-Baltistan region. Data collection targeted number and species of animals kept, livestock management practices and seasonal pasture use and included GIS-based participatory mapping of spring, summer, autumn and winter pastures of yak, small ruminants and cattle. Households kept 10 yaks on average, along with 4 cattle and 15 small ruminants. Herding practices varied between valleys and seasons and were influenced by topographic as well as social factors. Full-time herding led to a more uniform distribution of yaks on pastures than part-time herding and unattended grazing, but in small ruminants promoted higher animal numbers near campsites. Many livestock keepers perceived rangeland degradation as a veritable challenge and identified lack of herding labour as one important problem. Training programmes for young herders, strengthening of group herding schemes and prevention of lowland pasture conversion into farmland were suggested as effective countermeasures.

AB  - Despite the challenges posed by multi-drug resistance in synthetic anthelmintics, the potential of plant extracts as an alternative helminth control option offers a ray of hope. The current study, conducted with meticulous care and thoroughness, delves into the anthelmintic activity of crude water and ethanol extracts of three plant species, Andrographis paniculata (Hempedu Bumi), Azadirachta indica (Neem), and Litsea elliptica (Pawas), against the nematode, C. elegans . The preparation of water and ethanol extracts from the three plants involved maceration and ultrasonic methods, respectively. Phytochemical screening was conducted to identify the active compounds in both extracts, followed by determining the total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid contents (TFC) using the corresponding Folin-Ciocalteau and aluminum colorimetric methods. The percentage yields of water extracts were 15.10%, 13.11%, and 9.55%, and ethanol extracts were 9.78%, 2.94%, and 15.50% for A. paniculata , A. indica , and L. elliptica , respectively. All extracts tested positive for alkaloids, steroids, terpenoids, protein, and carbohydrates. In water extract, A. indica exhibited the highest total phenolic (TPC) and total flavonoid (TFC) contents of 58.38 +/- 0.005 mg GAE/g and 18.68 +/- 0.005 mg QE/g, respectively. In contrast, in ethanol extract, L. elliptica exhibited the highest TPC and TFC of 122.67 +/- 0.398 mg GAE/g and 96.69 +/- 0.027 mg QE/g, respectively. L. elliptica ethanol extract appeared to induce the most pronounced effect on reducing head thrashing activity compared to other extracts in C. elegans . Both water and ethanol extracts of A. indica and L. elliptica exhibited significant mortality in all examined concentrations with maximum mortality.

AB  - The Hadar Formation at Hadar (Lower Awash Valley, Ethiopia,-3.45-2.95 Ma) is one of the most wellknown and studied Pliocene hominin-bearing sequences in eastern Africa, yielding numerous fossils of the species Australopithecus afarensis. While much research has been conducted on the palaeoecology of the Hadar Formation broadly, little attention has been placed on the carnivore guild. Here, we present new stable carbon and oxygen isotope data for Hadar carnivores that contribute to the palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of the Hadar Formation and facilitate inference of predator-prey relationship between the large carnivore and herbivore guilds at Hadar. Overall, the members of the Hadar carnivore guild had relatively high carbon values (-4.6 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand), with the highest values in the middle part of the sequence (Denen Dora Member,-3.2 Ma). These values are higher than the carbon values of carnivores from penecontemporaneous sediments in the Turkana Basin (southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya). Stable oxygen isotope values are variable throughout the Hadar Formation, but reconstruction of estimated meteoric water oxygen values indicates a wetter and more pluvial climate than that at the present. Carbon isotope mixing models weighted by a prey selectivity index based on established predator-prey body size relationships reveals that two large-bodied taxa (Homotherium and Crocuta venustula) had partitioned their dietary niches only to a limited extent. Understanding the nature of the large carnivore guild at Hadar allows us to predict which taxa may have been competitors or predators of Au. afarensis, offering insights into the palaeoecological context beyond what can be inferred from palaeoenvironmental reconstructions alone. Moreover, our analyses provide a valuable insight into the little-known isotopic ecology of fossil African carnivores. (c) 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Accurate pig counting is crucial for precision livestock farming, enabling optimized feeding management and health monitoring. Detection-based counting methods face significant challenges due to mutual occlusion, varying illumination conditions, diverse pen configurations, and substantial variations in pig densities. Previous approaches often struggle with complex agricultural environments where lighting conditions, pig postures, and crowding levels create challenging detection scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose EAPC-YOLO (enhanced adaptive pig counting YOLO), a robust architecture integrating density-aware processing with advanced detection optimizations. The method consists of (1) an enhanced YOLOv8 network incorporating multiple architectural improvements for better feature extraction and object localization. These improvements include DCNv4 deformable convolutions for irregular pig postures, BiFPN bidirectional feature fusion for multi-scale information integration, EfficientViT linear attention for computational efficiency, and PIoU v2 loss for improved overlap handling. (2) A density-aware post-processing module with intelligent NMS strategies that adapt to different crowding scenarios. Experimental results on a comprehensive dataset spanning diverse agricultural scenarios (nighttime, controlled indoor, and natural daylight environments with density variations from 4 to 30 pigs) demonstrate our method achieves 94.2% mAP@0.5 for detection performance and 96.8% counting accuracy, representing 12.3% and 15.7% improvements compared to the strongest baseline, YOLOv11n. This work enables robust, accurate pig counting across challenging agricultural environments, supporting precision livestock management.

AB  - The study aimed to evaluate the role of morpho-physiological and anatomical attributes of Alhagi maurorum Medik. Populations from five water deficit regions in Punjab province, Pakistan, namely, Cholistan desert (KHP), Rajanpur (DGK), Thal (LYH), Patisar Lake (LAS), and Salt Range (WSM), in their adaptability to arid and semiarid regions. The study sheds light on the adaptive components of various plant populations to cope with increasing dryness ratio. Arid populations [Khanpur-KHP (D = 44.91, P = 97.1 mm), Dera Ghazi Khan-DGK (D = 41.41, P = 105.3 mm), Layyah-LYH (D = 37.11, P = 117.5 mm) and Ladamsar-LAS (D = 34.83, P = 125.2 mm)] relied on larger roots and leaves, enhanced biomass production, ion accumulation, and photosynthetic pigments. It also encompassing larger root and stem cellular area, cortex and vascular region, thicker leaves, and numerous large stomata. Semi-arid populations display distinctive changes, such as longer shoots, higher root and shoot Na+ levels, organic osmolytes, thicker epidermis, and enlarged pith region in stems [Warcha Salt Mine-WSM (D = 8.70, P = 501 mm)]. These modifications at both structural and functional levels guarantee the survival and success of this species in challenging environmental conditionswhich will have implications for sustainable agriculture, ecosystem restoration, and adaptation to climate change adaptation in arid and semi-arid regions.

AB  - Nepal is a biodiversity-rich country harboring endangered wildlife species. Despite commendable achievements in conserving charismatic wildlife species like the Tiger and Rhinoceros, Nepal is still a pivotal point for the illicit wildlife trade. In this perspective, we explore the current situation of wildlife poaching and smuggling, factors conducive to such activities, and present some minimum practitioner steps for what should be tried to prevent such a situation in Nepal.

AB  - Tannins are secondary metabolites naturally present in various plants as a defense mechanism. In animal nutrition, they play a dual role, acting as both antinutritional factors and bioactive agents, with potential benefits in nutrient metabolism and product quality. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary tannin on nutrient intake and digestibility, blood serum metabolite levels, growth performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality in small ruminants. Ninety-seven studies were included in this meta-analysis. The effects of tannins were analyzed using a random-effects model to determine the weighted mean difference between treatments with tannins and the control (without tannins). Publication bias and heterogeneity between studies were explored, and meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed. The results indicated that tannin significantly increased the intake of dry matter, crude protein, nitrogen (N), fecal N, and meat fatty acids (FA), such as C18:2 omega 6, C18:3 omega 3, C20:4 omega 6, C20:5 omega 3, total omega 3 and omega 6 FA, and total polyunsaturated FA (PUFA). However, NH3-N, urinary N, blood urea nitrogen, cold carcass weight, subcutaneous fat thickness, drip loss, and nutrient digestibility decreased. In conclusion, tannin in small ruminants did not affect animal productivity and antioxidative status, but mainly modified nitrogen metabolism and improved the fatty acid profile of meat.

AB  - IntroductionRenewal is a behavioral phenomenon wherein extinction learning fails to generalize between different contextual environments, thereby representing a significant challenge to extinction-based rehabilitative therapies. Previously, we have shown that renewal of extinguished appetitive behavior differs across the estrous cycle of the female rat. In this experiment that effect is replicated and extended upon to understand how the estrous cycle may modulate contextual representation at the neuronal population level to drive renewal. MethodsEstrous cycle stage [i.e., proestrus (P, high hormone) or metestrus/diestrus (M/D, low hormone)] was considered during two important learning and behavioral expression windows: at extinction training and during long-term memory (LTM)/renewal testing. Cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity using fluorescence in situ hybridization (catFISH) for Arc mRNA was conducted after the distinct context-stimulus exposures. ResultsRats in P during context-dependent extinction training but in a different stage of the estrous cycle during LTM and renewal testing (P-different) were shown to exhibit more renewal of conditioned foodcup (but not conditioned orienting) behavior compared to rats in other estrous cycle groups. Importantly, we discovered this depends on the order of tests. P-different rats showed differential Arc mRNA expression in regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, and hippocampus (HPC). For each case P-different rats had more co-expression (i.e., expression of both nuclear and cytoplasmic) of Arc mRNA compared to other groups; specific to the dorsal HPC, P-different rats also had a more robust Arc mRNA response to the extinction context exposure. ConclusionThese data suggest female rats show estrous cycle state-dependent renewal of appetitive behavior, and differences in context and conditioned stimulus representation at the neuronal level may drive this effect.

AB  - The growing pig production sector is a large contributor of negative impacts to the environment and feed production is responsible for a large part of these impacts. Pig production systems, including feed compositions, are variable, resulting in variable potential environmental impacts. This study investigated the influence of different farm characteristics and feed compositions on the environmental impact of pig production in Flanders. A Life Cycle Assessment approach was followed, including data from 39 farms and monthly feed compositions in the year 2018. Even though feed production contributes significantly to the overall environmental impact of pig production, the results show that environmental impacts are more affected by variabilities in farm characteristics than by fluctuating feed compositions. A higher productivity, in terms of feed conversion efficiency and the number of pigs produced per sow, is generally related to lower environmental impacts. Another influencing factor is the type and amount of energy used. For feed consumption, high variabilities are observed for water use, mainly caused by varying levels of sugar cane molasses. Climate change impacts and variabilities are mainly caused by soy ingredients and their origin. Finally, amino acids show large contributions to the environmental impact of pig feed consumption. Our research highlights that future developments for reducing the environmental impact of pig production should target animal productivity, the type and amount of energy used and selection of protein sources in pig feed.

AB  - Camelids are economically and socially important in several parts of the world and might carry pathogens with epizootic or zoonotic potential. However, biological research in these species is limited due to lack of reagents. Here, we developed RT-qPCR assays to quantify a panel of camelid innate and adaptive immune response genes, which can be monitored in a single run. The assays were validated with PHA, PMA-ionomycin, and Poly I:Cstimulated PBMCs from alpaca, dromedary camel and llama, including normalization by multiple reference genes. Further, comparative gene expression analyses for the different camelid species were performed by a unique microfluidic qPCR assay. Compared to unstimulated controls, PHA and PMA-ionomycin stimulation elicited robust Th1 and Th2 responses in PBMCs from camelid species. Additional activation of type I and type III IFN signalling pathways was described exclusively in PHA-stimulated dromedary lymphocytes, in contrast to those from alpaca and llama. We also found that PolyI:C stimulation induced robust antiviral response genes in alpaca PBMCs. The proposed methodology should be useful for the measurement of immune responses to infection or vaccination in camelid species.

AB  - Triacylglycerol (TAG) components in human milk during different lactation periods, infant formulas with different fat sources, other mammalian milk (cow, goat, donkey, and yak milk), and plant oil (sunflower, rapeseed, corn, soybean, palm, palm kernel, and coconut oil) were analyzed and compared using ultraperformance supercritical fluid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPSFC-Q : TOF-MS). We identified 191 TAGs (86, 102, 101, and 54 TAGs in human milk, infant formula, mammalian milk, and plant oil, respectively). TAGs esterified with palmitic acid (16:0) were major TAG structures in human milk (59.08% of total TAGs) and contained 30 TAG types. The sn-O/P/O regioisomer constituted more than 80% of the 0/P/O content of human milk, whereas the sn-O/O/P levels were higher in other samples. The carbon number (CN) 52 content was higher than the CN 54 content in human milk, with the opposite observed in infant formula. TAGs with CN < 40 content were abundant in cow, goat, and yak milk; donkey milk was rich in CN 52 content. TAGs composed of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) were rich in human milk, while TAGs with three MCFAs were rich in infant formula. The TAG characteristics of infant formula were directly related to its fat resource. TAGs with fewer double bonds were abundant in the plant oil formula; however, highly unsaturated TAGs were prominent in the cow and goat milk formulas, similar to plant oil and mammalian milk. Significant differences in the TAG distribution were observed among the different species.

AB  - Biofloc technology (BFT) is an environmentally friendly aquaculture technology and has been demonstrated to improve water quality and promote the growth, immunity, disease resistance, and reproduction of some cultured animals. The lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) has been cultured in China for more than 10 years; however, there are still some major problems in large-scale culture, one of which is that juveniles are prone to enteritis. In this study, to test the feasibility of BFT for H. erectus juvenile, the effects of different carbon sources (glucose, sucrose, or corn starch) and carbon-nitrogen ratios (C/N, 16:1 or 20:1) on the water quality, survival, growth, and intestinal biochemical parameters of juveniles cultured under zero-water exchange conditions were investigated. The results show that different combinations of carbon source and C/N had different effects. Some combinations had significant positive effects, while others had no or even negative effects. The best positive effects appeared in combinations of glucose and C/N 16:1, and sucrose and C/N 16:1, which were mainly reflected in the reduction of ammonia and nitrite in water, the promotion of bacterial proliferation and community diversity in water; and the improvement in intestinal microflora, digestion, immunity and survival of the juveniles. In conclusion, adding extra organic carbons to water is promising to improve the culture of H. erectus juveniles, as long as the carbon source type and C/N are properly combined (e.g., glucose or sucrose at C/N 16:1). This study may provide a new potential method for seahorse enteritis.

AB  - The efficacy of translocation as a method for conserving species in peril has not been fully evaluated. Post-release monitoring rarely involves long-term assessments and initial success metrics may not translate to population viability. In particular, genetic factors may play a critical role in fitness following release as founder effect, genetic drift, inbreeding depression and outbreeding depression can influence extinction risk. As part of a multi-year recovery effort, we translocated populations of the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi; SKR), in order to restore population connectivity. Here we evaluate the success of the translocation efforts through long-term population estimation and genetic analyses. We conducted post-release assessments for 9 years, and used Bayesian clustering analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) of 24 microsatellite markers developed for this species to assess genetic admixture between source and translocated populations. Demographic results indicate long-term translocation success, as evidenced by founder survival and establishment, and population growth and regulation. Genetic results show admixture at the release site between genetically discrete source populations, provide definitive evidence that translocated individuals, not immigrants, produced offspring at the release site, that these offspring successfully reproduced and that even with moderate to great genetic differentiation of source populations, outbreeding depression was not detected. Despite the historical failure of heteromyid translocation efforts, our long-term study illustrates how the development of species-specific best practices led to an effective strategy for SKR recovery. More broadly, our results suggest efforts that use a systematic hypothesis-testing framework alongside long-term monitoring offer great promise in improving translocation outcomes.

AB  - The effects of diet on reproduction success in fishes are fairly well known for many species. In syngnathids (seahorses, pipefishes and seadragons), almost nothing is known about how diet quality supplied during the prebreeding period might influence subsequent breeding performance and fry quality. In the present study, the influence of pre-breeding diet was assessed for the first time in seahorses. For that, adult seahorses Hippocampus reidi were submitted to three dietary treatments (based on Artemia alone or supplemented with mysidaceans) including different timing schedules. The assimilation of the diets by breeders and subsequent newborn batches were evaluated isotopically (delta C-13 and delta N-15). The timing of brood release, brood size, and length, weight and survival at day 7 in newborn seahorses were also evaluated. The species followed a mixed capital-income reproduction strategy and showed a higher breeding performance and larger newborn when fed on a mixed diet (Artemia and mysidaceans) supplied during the whole pre-breeding period (5 months). The enhancements were also noticed on the second half of the breeding period. An isotopic steady-state in newborn batches was achieved beyond the second month of the breeding period (i.e., slow isotopic change rates), depending on the treatment and isotope considered. For the first time in syngnathids, this study also revealed an isotopic relationship between breeder's diet and newborn. This work highlights the importance of the pre-breeding diet on seahorse reproduction, and will contribute to the optimization of breeding performance in seahorse culture.

AB  - We report a landscape-scale natural experiment that followed the abundance and demography of forest-floor small mammals and the activity of small mustelids over a 4-year period of an extreme heat wave and abundant coniferous cone crops. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) are major species in the coniferous forest-floor small mammal community near Summerland in southern British Columbia, Canada. Their major mammalian predators include the short-tailed weasel (Mustela richardsonii), long-tailed weasel (Neogale frenata), and American marten (Martes americana). We evaluated three hypotheses (H) that may explain the changes in these mammals from 2021 to 2024: (H1) that large coniferous cone crops in 2022 would have generated high populations of forest-floor small mammals in 2023 owing to enhanced reproductive output and overwinter survival; (H2) that increased activity of mustelids would have followed population increases, resulting in the decline of small mammal prey in 2024; and (H3) that the widespread occurrence of cone crops in 2022 would also have elicited the same mammalian responses in 2023 at a second study area (Golden, BC) 276 km and three mountain ranges from Summerland. During the summer periods of each year, small mammal populations were monitored by intensive live-trapping, and mustelid presence was measured via an index of activity based on live traps, fecal scats, and predation events. The mean abundance and reproductive performance of the P. maniculatus and M. gapperi populations increased in response to the coniferous seedfall, thereby supporting H1. The activity of small mustelids responded positively to increased numbers of small mammal prey and potentially acted in a regulatory and top-down function in these communities, and hence partially support H2. Similar responses at Summerland and Golden indicated that this seedfall event and changes in the mammalian community occurred at a landscape-scale, thereby providing partial support for H3. Potential differential effects of large seed crops on consumers did not affect the mean abundance patterns for P. maniculatus but apparently reduced this metric for M. gapperi. Heat waves, induced by anthropogenic climate change, may alter the frequency of coniferous masting events, and their effects may temporarily change the number and species of mammalian seed consumers and their predators.

AB  - Food resources are key limiting factors for migratory waterbirds, and the foraging strategies adopted by herbivorous waterbirds are affected by food availability in wetland habitats. The greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) is mainly dependent on Carex in the lower and middle Yangtze River floodplain. Exploring the relationship between the growth conditions of Carex and the foraging strategies adopted by wintering greater white-fronted geese has important ecological implications for habitat protection and management. In this study, scan sampling and focal animal sampling were used to record the foraging behaviors of greater white-fronted geese wintering at Shengjin Lake, and the plant height and water content of Carex were surveyed simultaneously. The relationship between plant characteristics and foraging behaviors was tested using a linear regression equation. The results showed that Carex had two growth periods at Shengjin Lake, and the pecking rate and foraging time budget of greater white-fronted geese were higher during these two periods. Plant characteristics were positively correlated with goose foraging behaviors. The strategic adjustment of the foraging behaviors adopted by wintering greater white-fronted geese was consistent with the growth stage of Carex, which is the optimal foraging window for greater white-fronted geese. During the foraging windows, geese changed their foraging strategies to obtain more energy in order to guarantee successful wintering and migration.

AB  - Calcocambisol (brown soil on limestone and dolomite) is one of the most common soil types in Croatia, and it is the dominant soil type developed on karst, as well as in the area of the Plitvice Lakes National Park, which is located in the karst area. As its name suggests, calcocambisol is developed on different carbonate substrates, which are different in terms of chemical composition as well as in terms of rock erosion.. In the area of the National Park, 30 pedological profiles have been opened, 18 of which were on limestone and 12 on dolomite. In the field, ectomorphological and endomorphological soil parameters were determined. The following parameters were determined on the collected soil samples in the humus -accumulative (A) and cambic (B) horizons: particle size distribution of the soil, soil reaction, i.e. pH -value in water and CaCl 2 solution, carbonate content, and total carbon and total nitrogen content using the dry burning method. The highest differences in ectomorphological parameters between limestone and dolomite were found in the classification of rockiness and stoneness, where they ranged from very low to very high on limestone, while they were absent on dolomite. On the profiles of calcocambisol on top of dolomite, a higher proportion of sand fractions and less clay than on calcocambisol on top of limestones was found. The dominant soil textural class of calcocambisol on top of limestone was silty clay, while in calcocambisol on top of dolomite it was silty clay loam. The pH -values of the soil and the proportion of CaCO 3 on calcocambisol on top of dolomite were statistically significantly higher than on calcocambisol on top of limestone. Since there was no great difference in the fractions of organic carbon and total nitrogen between calcocambisol on top of limestones and dolomites, there was also no great difference in the C/N ratio. The average C/N ratio along the entire profile of calcocambisol on top of limestone and dolomite was 14, i.e. decomposition continued undisturbed and there was no accumulation of raw humus. The hypotheses in this paper were confirmed, and clear differences in the investigated ectomorphological (rockiness and stoniness) and endomorphological (particle size distribution, pH -values and CaCO 3 content) properties between calcocambisol on top of limestone and dolomite were observed.

AB  - Fetal programming by subnutrition affects offspring 's behaviour, metabolism, and sensitivity to stressors in sheep. The objective was to determine the stress response of ewes born to mothers nutritionally restricted during gestation to social isolation followed by exposure to a novel object. Twenty -six -year -old Corriedale ewes born to mothers who grazed high or low pasture allowances (HPA and LPA groups) from 23 days before conception until 122 days of gestation were used. Ewes were individually isolated in a novel place for 10 min, and 5 min after its beginning, an orange ball was dropped into the test pen. The ewes ' behaviours were recorded during the test. Blood proteins, glucose and cortisol concentrations, heart and respiratory rates and rectal and surface temperatures were determined. The number of times looking at the ball tended to be greater in HPA ewes than LPA (6.7 +/- 1.0 vs 4.7 +/- 0.8, P = 0.08). The LPA ewes had greater serum albumin concentration than HPA ewes (3.2 +/- 0.1 g/dL vs 3.0 +/- 0.1 g/dL, P = 0.02), regardless of the applied stressors. Overall, the nutritional treatments applied to ewes during their intrauterine development did not modify the stress responses to social isolation followed by exposure to a novel object.

AB  - The risk of outbreaks of African Swine Fever (ASF) is minimized when farmers are knowledgeable and have a positive perception of risk factors associated with the spread of ASF. This study assesses the knowledge, attitude, and practices with respect to ASF among emerging pig farmers in uThukela District. A cross-sectional study design was conducted on all emerging pig farmers (n=426) in the study area. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Pig rearing in the study area is dominated by middle aged men with no formal education, low income, and >5 years of experience of rearing pigs. The main reason for rearing pigs, is to provide meat for the family. Knowledge of some aspects of ASF was very low. However, most farmers displayed a good attitude towards ASF. Feeding pigs on swill and hunting wild pigs were practiced in the stud area. Residence, sex, age and reason for rearing pigs were significantly correlated with a high knowledge score for ASF. Authorities in charge of controlling livestock diseases should consider findings of the present study when designing interventions to improve on the knowledge of ASF and to limit outbreaks of ASF.

AB  - Background and Aims Protection mutualisms involve plants receiving defence against herbivores from predators, such as ants and insectivorous birds, in exchange for food resources. Ants can reduce herbivory by actively patrolling plants with extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) or by tending trophobiotic insects that provide them with food rewards. Insectivorous birds also contribute to herbivore suppression but might simultaneously reduce ant activity through predation. Although both ants and birds can enhance plant performance, few studies have explored how the availability of multiple ant-associated resources influences herbivore suppression, or how bird predation on ants affects these ant-plant mutualisms. These gaps limit our understanding of the dynamics in complex multitrophic interactions.Methods We investigated how the availability of multiple food resources for ants and the predation exerted by insectivorous birds on ants influence the performance of the tropical shrub Banisteriopsis malifolia. To address this, we conducted two field experiments. The first manipulated the individual and combined presence of mutualistic ant resources (EFNs, myrmecophilous caterpillars and treehoppers). The second experiment manipulated the presence or absence of both ants and birds to assess their interactive effects. Plant performance was evaluated by measuring leaf herbivore damage, the number of fruits and fruit weight.Key Results Our findings show that B. malifolia plants offering a full complement of mutualistic food resources for ants, including EFNs and trophobiotic insects, experienced significantly lower leaf herbivory and higher fruit production in comparison to plants lacking these resources. Bird exclusion resulted in increased herbivore damage and reduced fruit output, with these negative effects being even more pronounced when both birds and ants were excluded.Conclusions Our findings highlight the complexity of multitrophic interactions in ant-plant mutualisms. They emphasize the importance of considering multiple trophic levels in plant defence strategies and underscore the cascading effects of predator interactions within natural ecosystems.

AB  - Existing studies on community-based conservation in India, while highlighting the results and effectiveness of conservation interventions fail to engage with the underlining social processes emerging from the interactions among conservation actors. This article demonstrates conservation as a social process in which the actors interact with each other daily. We use the notion of 'Everyday Conservation' to highlight that actors use their resources, skills and limitations to create a space where conservation processes are negotiated and shaped on an everyday basis. Using ethnographic work carried out in Assam (India), this article analyzes an Asian elephant conservation project to understand the various actors involved in the project, such as project managers, staff, local community, funding organization and forest department and their interactions, resulting in 'Everyday Conservation.' The inter-actor interactions were of varying intensity, depending upon which the actors negotiated, collaborated, or came into conflict, thereby producing conservation results embedded in contextual factors. We suggest that conservation needs rethinking and the framework of 'Everyday Conservation' can provide a fresh perspective on community-based wildlife conservation.

AB  - Temperature has a profound effect on the growth and development of ectothermic animals. However, the extent to which ecologically driven selection pressures can adjust thermal plastic responses in growth schedules is not well understood. Comparing temperature-induced plastic responses between sexes provides a promising but underexploited approach to evaluating the evolvability of thermal reaction norms: males and females share largely the same genes and immature environments but typically experience different ecological selection pressures. We proceed from the idea that substantial sex differences in plastic responses could be interpreted as resulting from sex-specific life-history optimization, whereas similarity among the sexes should rather be seen as evidence of an essential role of physiological constraints. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of sex-specific thermal responses in insect development times, using data on 161 species with comprehensive phylogenetic and ecological coverage. As a reference for judging the magnitude of sex specificity in thermal plasticity, we compared the magnitude of sex differences in plastic responses to temperature with those in response to diet. We show that sex-specific responses of development times to temperature variation are broadly similar. We also found no strong evidence for sex specificity in thermal responses to depend on the magnitude or direction of sex differences in development time. Sex differences in temperature-induced plastic responses were systematically less pronounced than sex differences in responses induced by variations in larval diet. Our results point to the existence of substantial constraints on the evolvability of thermal reaction norms in insects as the most likely explanation. If confirmed, the low evolvability of thermal response is an essential aspect to consider in predicting evolutionary responses to climate warming.

AB  - Simple Summary The wild boar (Sus scrofa) has been identified as a reservoir of zoonoses and food-borne pathogens. Wild boar populations are growing worldwide, also near urban centers such as Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). The aim of this study was to assess the presence of zoonotic agents in the wild boar populations from the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (MAB). The detection of Escherichia coli carrying critical antimicrobial resistance genes to beta-lactams and, for the first time in Spain, the detection of toxigenic Clostridioides difficile strains in wild boars foraging in urban areas show the value of this game species as a sentinel of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (AMRB) and zoonotic agents in the environment. Moreover, the wild boars foraging in urban and peri-urban locations were more exposed to AMRB sources than the wild boars dwelling in natural environments. The responsible health agencies should undertake specific actions to fully assess the potential implications for the human population and/or environmental health. Zoonotic diseases and hazards beyond the compulsory surveillance diseases should be specifically targeted in the growing human-wildlife interface of urban environments such as the MAB under the One Health approach. Disease transmission among wild boars, domestic animals and humans is a public health concern, especially in areas with high wild boar densities. In this study, fecal samples of wild boars (n = 200) from different locations of the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona were analyzed by PCR to explore the frequency of beta-lactamases and extended cephalosporin and carbapenem resistance genes (ESBLs) in Escherichia coli strains and the presence of toxigenic Clostridioides difficile. The prevalence of genes conferring resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials was 8.0% (16/200): bla(CMY-2) (3.0%), bla(TEM-1b) (2.5%), bla(CTX-M-14) (1.0%), bla(SHV-28) (1.0%), bla(CTX-M-15) (0.5%) and bla(CMY-1) (0.5%). Clostridioides difficile TcdA+ was detected in two wild boars (1.0%), which is the first report of this pathogen in wild boars in Spain. Moreover, the wild boars foraging in urban and peri-urban locations were more exposed to AMRB sources than the wild boars dwelling in natural environments. In conclusion, the detection of E. coli carrying ESBL/AmpC genes and toxigenic C. difficile in wild boars foraging in urban areas reinforces the value of this game species as a sentinel of environmental AMRB sources. In addition, these wild boars can be a public and environmental health concern by disseminating AMRB and other zoonotic agents. Although this study provides the first hints of the potential anthropogenic sources of AMR, further efforts should be conducted to identify and control them.

AB  - Real-time PCR analysis of environmental samples (dust and aerosols) is an easy tool to investigate the presence of Coxiella burnetii in the farm environment. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of C. burnetii DNA in dust collected inside animal premises from 272 small ruminant farms in Bizkaia (northern Spain), a region with recent reports of human Q fever cases and outbreaks. Within each farm, 5 samples of dust were collected from difference surfaces, and data on animal census, management procedures, characteristics of the premises and geographic location were collected. Real-time PCR analysis of the dust samples detected presence of C. burnetii DNA in 98 farms (36.0%), flock-prevalence being higher in sheep (38.9%) or mixed ovine-caprine production systems (36.8%), compared to goats (25.0%). Larger bacterial burdens were observed in mixed farms, compared to sheep (p < .05). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis identified 5 different genotypes, with SNP8 being the predominant genotype (73%), followed by SNP6 (11%), SNP2 (9%), SNP4 (5%) and SNP1 (2%). Proportion of farms where C. burnetii DNA was detected differed among the different agricultural counties, and a higher proportion of C. burnetii DNA positive farms was associated with the occurrence of recent human Q fever outbreaks at several geographical locations. Dust sampling in domestic ruminant farms coupled with real-time PCR to screen for the presence of C. burnetii and estimate bacterial load can be a useful tool to identify herds and regions with high prevalence, define priority actions and monitor the effect of control measures. If combined with molecular genotyping and spatial distribution maps, it can help to identify farm contamination sources and trace the origin of human outbreaks.

AB  - The evolutionary processes that underlie variation in plant genome size have been much debated. Abiotic factors are thought to have played an important role, with negative and positive correlations between genome size and seasonal or stressful climatic conditions being reported in several systems. In turn, variation in genome size may influence plant traits which affect interactions with other organisms, such as herbivores. The mechanisms underlying evolutionary linkages between plant genome size and biotic and abiotic factors nonetheless remain poorly understod. To address this gap, we conducted phylogenetically controlled analyses testing for associations between genome size, climatic variables, plant traits (defenses and nutrients), and herbivory across 29 oak (Quercus) species. Genome size is significantly associated with both temperature and precipitation seasonality, whereby oak species growing in climates with lower and less variable temperatures but more variable rainfall had larger genomes. In addition, we found a negative association between genome size and leaf nutrient concentration (found to be the main predictor of herbivory), which in turn led to an indirect effect on herbivory. A follow-up test suggested that the association between genome size and leaf nutrients influencing herbivory was mediated by variation in plant growth, whereby species with larger genomes have slower growth rates, which in turn are correlated with lower nutrients. Collectively, these findings reveal novel associations between plant genome size and biotic and abiotic factors that may influence life history evolution and ecological dynamics in this widespread tree genus.

AB  - The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus Linnaeus) is a globally endangered species, an internationally protected species, and a first-class protected animal in China. However, future climate change and human activities exacerbate the instability of its habitat range, leading to a possible reduction in the range. By using multi-source remote sensing data and products, as well as climate change models, including ASTER GDEM v3, Landsat8 OLI image and ClimateAP, we examined the effects of ecological factors related to climate and natural and anthropogenic influences on the distribution of Asian elephants in Sipsongpanna. Multiyear elephant field tracking data were used with a MaxEnt species distribution model and the climate model. First, the distribution of Asian elephants in potentially suitable areas in Sipsongpanna was simulated under current climatic conditions without considering human activities. The predicted distribution was verified by existing Asian elephant migration trajectories. Subsequently, the distribution of potentially suitable areas for Asian elephants in Sipsongpanna was simulated under two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) in three periods (2025, 2055, and 2085). The changes in potentially suitable areas for Asian elephants in Sipsongpanna were analyzed under multiple climate change scenarios for the current (2017) and different future periods by considering the effects of human activities. The results show the following: (1) under anthropogenic interference (AI), the optimal MaxEnt model has a high prediction accuracy with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.913. The feature combination (FC) includes linear, quadratic, and threshold features, and the regularization multiplier (RM) is 2.1. (2) Jackknife analyses of the non-anthropogenic interference (NAI) and anthropogenic interference (AI) scenarios indicate that topography (altitude (Alt)), temperature (mean warmest month temperature (MWMT)), and precipitation (mean annual precipitation (MAP)) are the top three factors influencing the distribution of Asian elephants. (3) The total area suitable for Asian elephants under current climate conditions and AI accounts for 46.35% of the total area. Areas of high suitability (occurrence probability >0.5) are located in Jinghong City in central Sipsongpanna and Mengla County in southeastern Sipsongpanna. Among them, the minimum habitat range and ecological corridors are mainly located in Mengman Town, Mohan Town, Mengla Town, Mengban Township, Dadugang Township, and Mengwang Township. (4) The change in potentially suitable areas for Asian elephants between current and future conditions is small under AI and large under undisturbed conditions.

AB  - The southwestern coasts of Europe (Strait of Gibraltar) are experiencing a severe invasion of the brown alga Rugulopteryx okamurae, original from the northwestern Pacific ocean. Currently there is no clue regarding to the reasons of such huge invasive potential, although the involvement of chemical defenses has recently been suggested. In this context, this study was aimed to investigate the presence and potential role of chemical defenses in the invasive success of R. okamurae. The chemical study of R. okamurae from the Strait of Gibraltar led to the isolation of six secondary metabolites, among which the compound dilkamural stands out because of its high concentration. Later, in a set of feeding deterrent assays, the generalist native herbivore Paracentrotus lividus showed higher consumption over the native alga Ulva sp. than over the non-native R. okamurae. This low consumption was tracked down to dilkamural, which displayed not only deterrent properties but also caused harmful and even lethal effects over the sea urchins. These results are consistent with the novel weapons hypothesis, since dilkamural was not described previously in the invaded area and has a defensive role against generalist herbivores in the new range, thus helping to explain the great expansion of R. okamurae in the Strait of Gibraltar.

AB  - The study was carried out in the Hushe Valley, CKNP region, Pakistan, during summer 2012. Sampling was performed along altitudinal gradients in rangelands of CKNP area Hushe. Five quadrats were laid on each of line transects (25m) in four dimensions at 5 meters' intervals, on alternate sides of transect line. Biomass productivity and carrying capacity were estimated by using 1-m(2) quadrats (N=20 by site; total N = 60). The average standing biomass and carrying capacity was 48 Kg ha(-1) and 55.67 ha(-1) AU -1 5 mo(-1) respectively. Furthermore, cumulative standing biomass of shrub, grass and forb at each altitudinal gradient of upper, mid and lower was estimated atl 8, 60 and 66 Kg ha(-1), respectively. The carrying capacity for the forb category was 16 months'ha(-1) AU(-1)/ 5 months(-1) at the lower elevation, whereas at mid elevation the carrying capacity for the shrub category was 23 ha(-) 1AU(-1) 5 mo(-1). The assessment of soil organic matter at each site was highest (1.5%) at the high elevation, while P (27.9 mgkg(-1)) and K (260 mgkg1) concentrations were highest at mid elevation. The study highlighted low production which also vary along altitudinal gradient. This is an alarming situation for the livestock farmers and wild ungulates under present and predicted climate change scenarios. Therefore, the results of the study would be beneficial for the policy makers and managers in the planning of rangeland of CKNP.

AB  - Simple Summary Biodiversity is being lost at a rapid pace, with habitats being reduced and fragmented. Wild populations are declining, and zoos have become a crucial component of species conservation. However, zoo populations tend to be limited in size and based on few founders, which elevates the risk of genetic diversity loss. As the management needed to prevent such a risk is commonly reliant on incomplete and inaccurate pedigree data, the inclusion of molecular methods is recommended. This study assessed the relationship between the level of genetic diversity and management strategies, conservation status, demography, and geographic origin in European zoo populations of six spiral horned-antelope taxa using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers. We identified an association between the values of genetic diversity and the intensity of management, as well as the diversity and contribution of wild populations to founders of the captive stocks. Some zoo populations apparently consist of animals from genetically distinct lineages, which could have elevated the captive genetic diversity parameters but needs to be carefully considered as it can disrupt adaptive potential. The study shows that with careful interpretation, genetic data are very useful in the management of captive populations.Abstract The rapid loss of biodiversity and the associated reduction and fragmentation of habitats means that ex situ populations have become an important part of species conservation. These populations, which are often established from a small number of founders, require careful management to avoid the negative effects of genetic drift and inbreeding. Although the inclusion of molecular data is recommended, their availability for captive breeding management remains limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the levels of genetic diversity in six spiral-horned antelope taxa bred under human care and their respective management strategies, conservation status, demography, and geographic origin, using 10 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci and mitochondrial control region DNA sequences. Our findings include associations between genetic diversity and management intensity but also with the diversity and contribution of wild populations to captive founders, with some populations apparently composed of animals from divergent wild lineages elevating captive genetic diversity. When population sizes are large, the potential advantages of maximizing genetic diversity in widely outcrossed populations may need careful consideration with respect to the potential disruption of adaptive diversity. Genetic data serve as a robust tool for managing captive populations, yet their interpretation necessitates a comprehensive understanding of species biology and history.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an emerging tick-borne human disease in Spain. Although CCHF is mainly confined to humans, the CCHF virus (CCHFV) can infect several vertebrate species. To predict high-risk exposure areas for public health interventions, it is essential to understand the factors that determine the risk of exposure to CCHFV through animal models. We conducted a cross-sectional study over a defined period (1999 to 2022) on various wild and domestic ungulate species in Castilla-La Mancha (CLM), south-central Spain. We analyzed 6,236 sera of ungulates using a specific double-antigen ELISA to assess CCHFV exposure spatial distribution. We modeled exposure probability with host and environmental predictors using generalized linear mixed models with a binomial distribution. Anti-CCHFV antibodies were detected in 3,531 sera (56.6%; 95% CI: 55.4 to 57.9%), with the greatest exposure rates in western and southern CLM. The red deer (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, 1758) exhibited the highest seroprevalence (76.45%; 95%CI: 75.1 to 77.7%), and the best-fit statistical model indicated that it was the species with the highest risk of exposure. The most relevant predictors of virus exposure risk were shrubland cover, small ruminant density, wild ungulate density, and woodland cover. The spatial projection of the best-fit model identified high-risk foci in most of western and southwestern CLM but also in limited areas across the region. Our results demonstrate that serological surveys conducted on various CCHFV vector hosts serve as a potent, robust, and highly informative resource for public health authorities to address and prevent human CCHF cases in enzootic and emergency situations.

AB  - Early-life adversity may have programming effects on the psychological and physiological development of offspring. Domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) are an excellent model species for studying these effects because of their many physiological similarities to humans. Piglets from 10 sows were subjected to daily 2-h maternal deprivation on postnatal days (PND) 2-15 alone (DA) or in a group of littermates (DG). Control piglets (C) from 10 sows stayed with their mothers. Mother-offspring interaction, milk oxytocin, and cortisol were analyzed. An open-field/novel-object (OF/NO) test was performed with piglets on PNDs 16 and 40. Plasma cortisol and immune parameters were determined on PND 5 and 16. Two piglets from each group and sow were sacrificed on PND 20 and stress-related gene expression in the limbic system and prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as splenic lymphocyte proliferative abilities, were examined. The milk cortisol of sows increased during the first separation of mother and offspring on the second day of lactation, whereas milk oxytocin did not change. The increase in cortisol by the OF/NO test on PND 16 was greater in C piglets than in DA and DG ones. DA piglets showed less agitated behavior than DG and C piglets in the OF/NO test at PND 16, but appeared more fearful. On PND 40, DA piglets showed more arousal than DG and C piglets in the OF/NO test. Neither plasma IgA nor N/L ratios in blood nor mitogen-induced proliferation of spleen lymphocytes were affected by deprivation. We found a higher mRNA expression of CRHR1 in the hypothalamus and a higher expression of MR in the hippocampus in DA piglets than in DG ones. The expression of GR, MR, and CRHR1 genes in the PFC was reduced by maternal deprivation, however, the expression of arginine vasopressin and oxytocin receptors was not affected. Repeated maternal deprivation induces sustained effects on stress reactivity and behavior of domestic piglets. Some of these effects were buffered by the presence of littermates. In addition, we found sex-specific differences in behavior and gene expression.

AB  - The Nepal-India transboundary region hosts one of Asia's most complex large mammal assemblages, including a small (but growing) population of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). These elephants occur in four widespread and geographically disjunct subpopulations, and some of them undergo seasonal transboundary movements. We conducted a broad-scale evaluation of the amount and quality of elephant habitat available in the region and of functional landscape connectivity between and within subpopulations using Maxent, circuit theory, and least -cost path analysis. Habitat suitability was highly influenced by abiotic geographical factors (altitude and precipitation) and less by ecological factors (habitat heterogeneity, plant productivity) and human disturbance (distance to settlements). The region had a relatively small amount of high and optimal suitability habitat (12.6% out of 93,700 km(2)) but all subpopulations seem to be far from carrying capacity, suggesting ample potential for further population growth. Landscape connectivity was higher between and within the west and far-west sub-populations, which should be considered a single subpopulation. The central and east subpopulations, however, had low to very low between-subpopulation connectivity. Conservation priorities include maintaining the current connectivity in the west subpopulation and across the border in the east, and protecting high-quality habitats in eastern Nepal. Restoring connectivity between the central and other subpopulations is possible if the number of elephants continues growing, and it should be a long-term conservation aspiration. Maintaining and enhancing landscape connectivity in this region requires transboundary cooperation and coordination between Nepali and Indian authorities. If successful, it will bring considerable benefits for the conservation of elephants and other wildlife.

AB  - Lowering crude protein in pig diets can reduce nitrogen (N) excretion and alter manure characteristics. Anaerobic digestion (AD) offers potential for converting pig manure into biogas and bio-based fertilizers (i.e., digestate). However, limited research exists on the effects of N content in pig manure on AD when pigs are fed diets with varying crude protein levels. This study investigated how lowering N content in pig manure through low crude protein diets may affect AD process stability, biogas generation, and digestate properties. Manures from different dietary treatments, named as control (CON), low N (LN), and very low N (VLN), with Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen concentrations of 5.87, 5.42, and 5.15 g/L, respectively, were investigated. Daily biogas production, composition (CH4, CO2, and H2S), and digestate properties were monitored over 13 fed-batch cycles (25 +/- 4 days per cycle). The experiment was conducted at 20 +/- 1 degrees C, a condition suited for milder climate regions, using six single-stage digesters operated in sequencing fed-batch mode. Data were analyzed by ANOVA using PROC MIXED with repeated measures. Results showed that the differences in N content in pig manure due to the three dietary treatments had a limited impact on biogas generation, with specific methane yields remaining similar over time. CH4 concentrations remained stable between 60 and 65 %, ensuring high-quality biogas despite dietary variations. Differences between treatments became more pronounced with increased organic loading rates (OLRs) due to variations in the amount of volatile solids fed. AD also remained stable (Total Volatile Fatty Acids/Total Alkalinity <0.25) even at an OLR of 2.15 g of chemical oxygen demand L-1 day(-1), highlighting AD's robustness at lower temperatures. Digestate samples contained essential minerals beneficial for plant growth. More research is needed to explore varied manure compositions and feeding strategies to better understand the interactions of animal nutrition with AD.

AB  - Context. Monitoring spatial and temporal change in relative abundance using statistically powerful designs is a critical aspect of wildlife management. Many indices of relative abundance are available, but information regarding their influence on statistical power is limited. Aims. We compared the statistical power associated with occurrence-based and frequency-based indices derived from faecal pellet counts and camera trapping to detect changes in the activity of five mammalian herbivores. Methods. We deployed camera traps and counted faecal pellets in native vegetation subjected to four management treatments in south-eastern Australia. We used simulation coupled with generalised linear mixed models to investigate the statistical power associated with a range of effect sizes for each combination of species, survey method and data type. Key results. The index derived from camera frequency data provided the greatest statistical power to detect species' responses and was the only index capable of detecting small effect sizes with high power. The occurrence index from camera trapping did not provide the same level of statistical power. Indices derived from faecal pellet frequency data also detected spatial and temporal changes in activity levels for some species, but large numbers of plots were required to detect medium to large effect sizes. High power to detect medium to large effects could be achieved using occurrence indices derived from pellet presence-absence data, but required larger sample sizes compared to the camera frequency index. Conclusions. Both camera trapping and pellet counts can be applied to simultaneously monitor the activity of multiple mammalian herbivore species with differing activity patterns, behaviour, body size and densities, in open and closed habitat. However, using frequency indices derived from camera trapping may improve management outcomes by maximising the statistical power of monitoring programs to detect changes in abundance and habitat use. Implications. Frequency indices derived from camera trapping are expected to provide the most efficient method to detect changes in abundance. Where the use of cameras is cost prohibitive, occurrence indices derived from pellet presence-absence data can be used to detect medium to large effect sizes with high power. Nonetheless, the cost-effectiveness of camera trapping will improve as equipment costs are reduced and advances in automated image recognition and processing software are made.

AB  - Heartwater is an economically important disease of livestock and some wild ruminants in Southern Africa. The study used retrospective laboratory data from Lephalale Veterinary Laboratory, Limpopo to establish the prevalence and seasonal occurrence of heartwater in commercial farms of Lephalale Municipality between 2010 and 2022. A total of 472 brain samples from livestock (cattle, goats, sheep) and game carcasses brought to the laboratory for postmortem examination were subjected to heartwater testing using Giemsa staining technique. The overall prevalence of heartwater in Lephalale Municipality was 34.1% (95% CI = 29.9-38.6, p < 0.001). During the years under investigation, there was a significant (p < 0.001) variation, with the highest and lowest prevalence in 2022 (72.2%) and 2019 (6.3%), respectively. The prevalence of heartwater was high in springbok (57.1%), sheep (49.3%), cattle (36.6%) and goats (32.2%). Heartwater was detected throughout the year with autumn having the highest (40.6%) frequency followed by summer (40.3%), spring (30.5%) and winter (25.5%). This study is the first to establish the prevalence and seasonality of heartwater in Lephalale Municipality which will serve as a baseline for prevention and control strategies as well as future epidemiological studies. Official surveillance programmes, more research on the distribution and genotypes of E. ruminantium in the area need to be undertaken for better understanding of the disease in the area.

AB  - Pu'an County, located in southwestern Guizhou Province, China, is one of the original habitats for wild tea plants. It is renowned not only as the "Home of Ancient Tea Trees in China" but also as the "Core Production Area for High-Quality Early Tea in China". The wild ancient Camellia tetracocca tea trees are considered "living fossil". Understanding the genetic diversity of wild ancient C. tetracocca in Pu'an, Guizhou, is of great significance for addressing conservation concerns and mitigating genetic erosion in this endemic species. This study investigates the genetic diversity and population structure of wild ancient C. tetracocca tea plants in Pu'an County to support the development of conservation strategies. We genotyped 138 ancient wild C. tetracocca specimens using 40 intron-length polymorphism markers. A total of 180 alleles were detected, with the allele numbers per locus ranging from 2 to 10 and an average of 4.50. The number of effective alleles varied from 1.36 to 8.01, with an average of 2.86. The Shannon information index ranged from 0.28 to 2.19, with an average of 1.10. Nei's gene diversity index ranged from 0.14 to 0.88, with an average of 0.58. The polymorphic information content (PIC) varied from 0.14 to 0.85, with an average of 0.58. Our findings indicate that the genetic diversity of wild ancient C. tetracocca tea plants in Pu'an is high. Specifically, the genetic diversity in Qingshan Township surpassed that in Xindian Township. Analysis of molecular variance indicated that 91.59% of the genetic variation occurred within the subpopulations, suggesting limited differentiation. Despite their geographical separation, populations from Qingshan and Xindian showed a complex genetic relationship (FST = 0.04). STRUCTURE analysis identified three distinct genetic clusters, indicating a complex demographic history. These findings underscore the conservation significance of wild C. tetracocca populations in Pu'an and highlight the need for conservation strategies that prioritize the protection of genetically diverse subpopulations, especially in the Qingshan region.

AB  - Simple Summary Sheep's milk is usually produced on small farms. It is mainly used in the pro duction of cheese products. One of the methods of extending the shelf life of sheep's milk is freezing it. In this study we examined the effect of freezing on sheep's milk and a mixture of sheep's and cow's milk on the quality of fresh pasta filata cheeses produced from the milk. It has been proven that the freezing of milk affects the possibility of using it in later cheese processing. Freezing sheep's milk influenced, among others, a greater hardness and less elasticity of the cheese. We also noticed that the addition of frozen sheep's milk caused consumer dissatisfaction. Sheep's milk is produced in smallholdings, which hinders the continuity of production. Therefore, freezing during periods of high production can be a solution. Herein, we examined the effect of freezing on sheep's milk and a mixture of sheep and cow's milk (70:30, v/v) on the quality of fresh pasta filata cheeses produced from the milk. Frozen/thawed sheep's milk contributes little to the development of innovative and reformulated cheeses. This was due to 24% higher hardness and greater extensibility and cutting force, as well as lower stretching and elasticity. Although their flowability increased (Oiling-off from 3 to 12%), the meltability (tube test, and Schreiber test) decreased. Additionally, the use of frozen milk caused consumer dissatisfaction. The consumer penalty analysis of the just-about-right showed that freezing of the milk caused the loss of the refreshing, elasticity and shininess of pasta filata cheeses.

AB  - Annual rotation green manure crops of selected brassicas, buckwheat, forage pearl millet, forage radish, black-eyed Susan, sesame, sudangrass, and velvetbean were evaluated to determine impacts on lesion nematode Pratylenchus penetrans and dagger nematode Xiphinema americanum populations densities. Canadian forage pearl millet '101'and 'Tifgrain 102' millet effectively controlled P. penetrans but increased population densities of X. americanum. Black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta) and sudangrass 'Trudan 8' also reduced P. penetrans densites but not X. americanum. Rapeseed and other brassicas as a green manure reduced X. americanum densities but did not suppress P. penetrans. Brassica juncea 'Pacific Gold', B. napus 'Dwarf Essex', but not mustard 'Caliente' resulted in low densities of X. americanum in soil. Velvetbean and sesame increased both P. penetrans and X. americanum population densities. A moderately suitable host plant such as buckwheat was ineffective in managing both P. penetrans and X. americanum populations. These results emphasize that suppressive effects of any given cover crop are nematode-specific, and that within a group of cover crops, e.g., the Brassicaceae, species and varieties can vary substantially in their effectiveness. If the rotation crop chosen is a good host for the nematodes present, it may exacerbate the problem instead of controlling it.

AB  - Finding food is one of the most important aspects of an animal's life. Yet, locating it can be challenging as the availability and quality of food varies both spatially and temporarily. To overcome these challenges, mammalian herbivores may use spatial memory or senses such as smell and vision. Recent studies have found that African elephants (Loxodonta africana) use olfactory cues to locate food patches and to select plants to eat within these patches. However, the extent to which they may also use visual cues, such as those associated with leaf colour, a proxy for food quality, when making foraging decisions is unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we tested whether African elephants were able to discriminate differences in leaf colour (i.e., light green: high-quality new growth, dark green: lower quality old growth, brown: poor-quality senesced vegetation) over a range of distances (i.e., 3, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 m). Testing four semi-tame elephants using visual-based choice experiments between different coloured canvases, we found that the elephants were able to discriminate colour differences at close range (i.e., <= 10 m), but not beyond. This suggests that when feeding within a patch, African elephants may utilise the visual cues associated with leaf colour to help locate high-quality food (e.g., individual trees, branches, and leaves) and thus increase their foraging efficiency. However, as they were unable to discriminate between the different colours over distances > 10 m, it is unlikely that they use colour when making long-range foraging decisions such as selecting feeding patches.

AB  - Humans are chronically exposed to a mixture of environmental chemicals (ECs), many with metabolic and endocrine disrupting potential, contributing to non-communicable disease burden. Understanding the effects of chronic exposure to low-level mixtures of ECs requires an animal model that reflects real-world conditions, lags behind studies on single ECs. Biosolids, from wastewater treatment, offers a real-life model to investigate the developmental health risks from EC mixtures. Prenatal biosolids exposure studies have documented metabolic perturbations including heavier thyroid glands in male fetuses and reduced bodyweight in prepubertal male lambs followed by catchup growth. We hypothesized that maternal preconceptional and gestational exposure of sheep to biosolids programs sex-specific transcriptional and functional changes in the offspring liver. Ewes (F0) were grazed on either inorganic fertilizer (C) or biosolids-treated pastures (BTP) preconception till parturition. All lambs (n = 15/group with male n = 7/group and females n = 8/group) were raised on Control pastures until euthanasia at 9.5 weeks. Next generation sequencing of liver RNA and DESeq2 was used to identify exposurespecific differentially expressed genes (DEG) and sex-differentially expressed genes (SDG). Liver function was assessed with markers of oxidative stress, triglyceride and fibrosis markers. Control lambs exhibited 647 SDGs confirming the inherent sexual dimorphism in hepatic gene expression. A sex-stratified analysis identified 10 DEG, mostly affecting metabolism, in male and none in female lambs. Biosolids exposure diminished the sexual dimorphism in hepatic gene expression barring 41 genes, potentially due to the increase in androgenic steroids found in F0 maternal circulation. Additionally, BTP male lambs showed elevated plasma triglyceride and a trend towards increased liver triglyceride concentrations. The identified effects of prenatal exposure to low-dose mixture of ECs via biosolids, in a precocial species paralleling human developmental patterns holds translational importance for understanding the sexually dimorphic origin of non-communicable diseases.

AB  - At the regional scale, upwelling conditions are known to influence ecosystems and communities and their primary and secondary productivity. However, the influence of upwelling on local herbivore-algae interactions is less well understood. We address this question by cross-examining herbivores and seaweeds from sites associated with upwelling and downwelling conditions along the Humboldt Current System. Specifically, we quantified the feeding and benefits attained by the black sea urchin (Tetrapygus niger) and the black sea snail (Tegula atra) while consuming a widespread kelp species (Lessonia spicata). We hypothesized that food quality drives herbivores' preference, consumption, and growth rates, regardless of the origin or "prior" conditions of the consumers. Laboratory trials measured algal consumption rates with (preference) and without a choice, and consumer's growth rates, to assess the influence of food quality (algae from upwelling vs downwelling sites) and the site of origin of the consumers. Our results showed that algal quality was a prevailing factor for both herbivores: they chose, consumed more, and grew faster on high quality (upwelling) algae. By comparison, the origin of the consumer was only significant for sea snails: those coming from an upwelling site, consumed significantly more and grew faster than those from downwelling. The bulk of our results provided strong support to our hypothesis and suggest that the high nutritional quality of algae associated with upwelling centers has a strong influence on consumers' preferences, consumption, and performance (growth). The fact that origin was found to be relevant for one of the herbivores suggests that the conditions in which species grow may dictate some of their efficiency as consumers.

AB  - Nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) impact predator-prey interactions when the presence of a predator affects behavior, physiology, or population dynamics of the prey species without resulting in consumption. NCEs are critical to understanding ecological interactions broadly and in an applied manner, when addressing the efficacy of biological control within agroecosystems. In this study, we explore the impact of cues from the predator, Hippodamia convergens Gu & eacute;rin-M & eacute;neville (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), on the probing and feeding behavior of Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), which transmits the causal bacteria of Huanglongbing (HLB) disease of citrus (Rutaceae). Due to wide-spread HLB incidence and insecticide resistance, it has become critical to better understand the activity of biological control agents within the HLB-ACP pathosystem. Utilizing electropenetrography (EPG), we investigated the feeding behavior of ACP exposed to the predator H. convergens or exposed to the chemical trails H. convergens produce while foraging. Overall, ACP detected H. convergens cues and responded by avoiding probing, although the extent of this response varied depending on the type of cue perceived. When H. convergens was present in the leaf but unable to reach the psyllid, ACP were slower to initiate probing and spent less time overall on probing and feeding from the xylem. In contrast, when exposed to H. convergens foraging cues without the beetle present, ACP initiated probing quicker than when the beetle was present and had a shorter total probing time compared to the control, with no other parameters being affected. Interestingly, the H. convergens chemical trail extracts, at two dosages, did not significantly influence ACP probing and feeding, except for a lower proportion of salivation and ingestion events into the phloem at the lower test dose. Our results suggest ACP exhibits avoidance behaviors in response to H. convergens cues, leading to a reduction in feeding, which suggests the maintenance of agroecosystem health through preservation of insect community diversity may be overlooked as an additive factor in vector management.

AB  - Bacterial loading aggravates the harm of particulate matter (PM) to public health and ecological systems, especially in operations of concentrated animal production. This study aimed to explore the characteristics and influencing factors of bacterial components of inhalable particles at a piggery. The morphology and elemental composition of coarse particles (PM10, aerodynamic diameter <= 10 mu m) and fine particles (PM2.5, aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m) were analyzed. Full-length 16 S rRNA sequencing technology was used to identify bacterial components according to breeding stage, particle size, and diurnal rhythm. Machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to further explore the relationship between bacteria and the environment. The results showed that the morphology of particles in the piggery differed, and the morphologies of the suspected bacterial components were elliptical deposited particles. Full-length 16 S rRNA indicated that most of the airborne bacteria in the fattening and gestation houses were bacilli. The analysis of beta diversity and difference between samples showed that the relative abundance of some bacteria in PM2.5 was significantly higher than that in PM10 at the same pig house (P < 0.01). There were significant differences in the bacterial composition of inhalable particles between the fattening and gestation houses (P < 0.01). The aggregated boosted tree (ABT) model showed that PM2.5 had a great influence on airborne bacteria among air pollutants. Fast expectation-maximization microbial source tracking (FEAST) showed that feces was a major potential source of airborne bacteria in pig houses (contribution 52.64-80.58 %). These results will provide a scientific basis for exploring the potential risks of airborne bacteria in a piggery to human and animal health.

   Oxygen plays a vital role in the development of early embryos, no matter whether it is too high or low, it will adversely affect the early embryo development, but the mechanisms involved in these effects are still unclear. RNA-seq was performed to compare 8-cell-stage and blastocyst-stage goat embryos under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, the mRNA expression mechanisms of 8-cell- and blastocyst-stage embryos were systematically analyzed under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly related to biological processes and function regulation. In conclusion, we can infer that oxidative stress regulates early embryo development by affecting the expression of zygotic genes and transcription factors, and those stress genes play a potential role in adaptation to normoxic environments in goat embryos.
   It has been reported that hypoxic environments were more suitable for the in vitro development of mammalian embryos, but the underlying mechanisms were still unclear. In the present study, RNA-seq was performed to compare 8-cell-stage and blastocyst-stage goat embryos under hypoxic and normoxic conditions; zygotes were checked at 72 and 168 h to 8-cell stage (L8C) and blastocyst stage (LM) in hypoxic conditions and 8-cell stage (H8C) and blastocyst stage (HM) in normoxic conditions. In the H8C and L8C groups, 399 DEGs were identified, including 348 up- and 51 down-regulated DEGs. In the HM and LM groups, 1710 DEGs were identified, including 1516 up- and 194 down-regulated DEGs. The expression levels of zygotic genes, transcription factors, and maternal genes, such as WEE2, GDF9, HSP70.1, BTG4, and UBE2S showed significant changes. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these DEGs were mainly related to biological processes and function regulation. In addition, combined with the pathway-gene interaction network and protein-protein interaction network, twenty-two of the hub genes were identified and they are mainly involved in energy metabolism, immune stress response, cell cycle, receptor binding, and signal transduction pathways. The present study provides comprehensive insights into the effects of oxidative stress on early embryo development in goats.

AB  - Copper is an important selectors for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) transfer because of metal-antibiotic cross-resistance and/or coresistance. Due to carbon-based materials' good adsorption capacity for heavy metals, graphene and graphene oxide have great potential to reduce ARGs abundance in the environment with copper pollution. To figure out the mechanics, this study investigated the effects of graphene and graphene oxide on the succession of ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), heavy metal resistance genes (HMRGs), and bacterial communities during copper-contained swine manure anaerobic digestion. Results showed that graphene and graphene oxide could reduce ARGs abundance in varying degrees with the anaerobic reactors that contained a higher concentration of copper. Nevertheless, graphene decreased the abundance of ARGs more effectively than graphene oxide. Phylum-level bacteria such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and Verrucomicrobiaat were significantly positively correlated with most ARGs. Network and redundancy analyses demonstrated that alterations in the bacterial community are one of the main factors leading to the changes in ARGs. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetes were enriched lower in graphene reactor than graphene oxide in anaerobic digestion products, which may be the main reason that graphene is superior to graphene oxide in reduced ARGs abundance. Additionally, ARGs were close to HMRGs than MGEs in the treatments with graphene, the opposite in graphene oxide reactors. Therefore, we speculate that the reduction of HMRGs in graphene may contribute to the result that graphene is superior to graphene oxide in reduced ARGs abundance in anaerobic digestion.

AB  - DNA metabarcoding is increasingly used in dietary studies, but this molecular technique has limitations including DNA extraction, primer choice suitability and completeness of DNA reference databases. Together, these limitations can create successive biases; some of which can be identified by careful data interrogation. Here, we examine some of the influential factors impacting DNA metabarcoding by focusing on the diet of the grazing coral reef parrotfish Scarus rivulatus (Labridae). The 16S V3-4 and 18S V4 gene regions were targeted to detect a wide range of taxa in the pharyngeal content, but genus-level amplicon sequence variant (ASV) assignments were <= 40%. Multiple universal 18S V4 primer sets, which amplified the same portion of the gene region, highlighted disparities that impacted resulting datasets and dietary data interpretation. Approximately 50% of ASVs overlapped among these 18S V4 datasets. Overall, our results show that protein-rich epilithic and endolithic microscopic photoautotrophs were consistently present and that S. rivulatus appears to rely on protein-rich taxa, especially dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Even if all qualitative limitations could be addressed, our data emphasise the difficulty of making straightforward quantitative conclusions about the diet composition of grazing fishes using DNA metabarcoding alone. Thus, until DNA metabarcoding reaches a state of maturity where quantitative data can be gained, additional support is required from other dietary analysis methods to provide robust interpretations and conclusions.

AB  - Foraging strategy is fundamentally linked with resource availability and dietary preference. Adaptive feeding behaviours, such as the role of spatial memory when navigating to food sites, are found in wild foraging species. We hypothesised that domesticated livestock species also possess adaptive foraging, with potential interspecies differences in this ability resulting from variations in foraging strategy. As such, this study aimed to compare foraging behaviour, in relation to ability to remember and prioritize food sites of different value, in livestock species that have different dietary preferences and backgrounds: sheep (Ovis aries), goats (Capra hircus) and alpacas (Vicugna pacos). A total of 705 trials were conducted across general training, criterion training and test trials. Eighteen sheep, 10 goats and 7 alpacas were presented with eight identical buckets, positioned on four cross mounts, that were placed into four corners of the test arena. Following acclimation and training, the subjects were required to search the arena for two randomly baited buckets, each of the two buckets containing either the large food reward or small food reward. After locating the reward, the animals re-entered the arena and were tasked to relocate the same buckets (Experiment 1). Each subject was allowed a maximum of two incorrect visits to non-baited buckets per trial, and the trial continued until both baits had been eaten or 7 min of inactivity had passed (more than two errors resulted in a 'failure' score for the individual trial). These conditions were then replicated, except that the animal was allowed to make a single selection between the large or small reward following their return to the arena after the initial search (Experiment 2). The goats passed the most trials across all three species (p < 0.001) and made fewer errors when relocating the baited buckets in training and test trials across both experiments (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). In contrast, the alpacas failed to pass the training criterion, with the exception of one individual, primarily due to exceeding the time limit for inactivity. We detected no significant difference in preference for the larger food quantity between species in either experiment (p = 0.65 and p = 0.55, respectively). Equally, selection of either quantity did not deviate from random chance across all individuals (except for a single sheep, p < 0.05, Experiment 2). Thus, goats exhibited the greatest spatial memory of the three species across both test conditions, which may reflect the adaptive foraging strategy that is required to navigate patchy distributions of browse in the complex natural habitats of this species. We recommend that further work should be carried out to determine the scale of selectivity and role of habitat perception on grazing distribution in these species. This information could be used to predict how differences in foraging strategy can be exploited to maximise pasture use efficiency in multi-species grazing systems.

AB  - The erstwhile developed temperature-humidity index (THI) has been popularly used to indicate heat stress in dairy cattle and often in buffaloes. However, scientific literature suggests differences in thermotolerance and physiological responses to heat stress between cattle and buffalo. Therefore, THI range used to indicate degree of heat stress (mild, moderate, and severe) in cattle should be recalibrated for indicating heat stress in buffaloes. The present study was carried out to delineate THI range to indicate onset and severity of heat stress in buffaloes based on physiological, biochemical, and expression profiling of heat shock response (HSR) genes in animals at different THI. The result indicated early onset of heat stress in buffaloes as compared to cattle. Physiological and biochemical parameters indicated onset of mild signs of heat stress in buffaloes at THI 68-69. Significant deviation in these parameters was again observed at THI range 73-76. At THI 77-80, the physiological and biochemical responses of animals were further intensified indicating extreme alteration in homeostasis. The in vivo expression profiling of HSR genes indicated that members of Hsp70 gene family are expressed in a temporal pattern over different THIs, whereas expressions of Hsf genes were evident during intense heat stress. Overall, the study established that amplitude of heat shock response and THI range for indicating severity of thermal stress for buffaloes are not in unison to cattle. The study also suggests skin temperature of the poll region could be used as non-invasive tool for monitoring heat stress in dairy buffaloes.

AB  - Soil erosion driven by gravitational forces poses a significant environmental challenge, particularly in the mining regions of Northwest China. Vegetation, and specifically the root systems of plants, plays a pivotal role in soil stabilization and erosion mitigation. However, the precise contributions of different shrub species to the mechanical reinforcement of soil under gravitational erosion remain insufficiently understood. This study addresses this gap by examining the reinforcement effects of plant roots on soil under gravitational erosion. Four shrubs of Salix psammophila, Caragana microphylla, Artemisia ordosica, and Hippophae rhamnoides, were used as research objects. Initially, we analyzed the root distribution characteristics along soil depth, then the root tensile properties. Subsequently, we employed an in situ shear instrument to measure the shear strengths of root-soil composite. The enhancement effect of root systems on soil shear strength was predicted using the WWM model and the FBM model, and the predicted values from the models were compared with the measured values obtained from the shear tests to evaluate the reliability of the models. Our results demonstrated that root-soil interactions, such as root length and root surface area, were predominantly concentrated in the 10-20 cm soil layer, whereas root biomass, including root volume and root dry weight, was mainly found in the 0-10 cm layer. The tensile strengths of the roots exhibited a negative power-function relationship with root diameter. Specifically, the roots of S. psammophila, C. microphylla, A. ordosica, and H. rhamnoides increased soil shear strength by 259.75 %, 131.66 %, 74.84 %, and 82.18 %, respectively. SEM modeling indicated that the root area ratio (RAR) directly and positively influenced soil consolidation capacity. Shrubs characterized by the highest root number and lowest mean diameter demonstrated the most pronounced soil reinforcement effect. The WWM model predictions for increased soil strength due to root systems ranged from 1.33 to 31.74 times higher than measured values, whereas the FBM model predictions ranged from 0.37 to 6.24 times higher. Among the species studied, S. psammophila exhibited superior performance in supporting soil structure and preventing displacement deformation, identifying it as the preferred species for revegetation, ecological restoration, and erosion control in areas affected by the erosive forces of gravity.

AB  - Pig farming is one of the major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the agricultural sector; nevertheless, few studies have been undertaken to directly measure or estimate GHGs, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) from pig barns. Therefore, the main objective of the present research was to estimate and predict CO2 emission rate as a function of the mass of pigs and feed consumption. Two identical experiments were carried out in experimental pig barns in 2020 and 2021 to develop and evaluate the performance of CO2 emission model. The CO2 emission data (ppm) were collected utilizing Livestock Environment Management Systems (LEMS) and weather sensors, respectively within the pig barns and the outside environment. The models were built using seven statistical and machine learning-based regression algorithms, i.e., linear, multiple linear, polynomial, exponential, ridge, lasso, and elastic net. The findings of the study revealed that among the seven models, the exponential-based regression model performed the best, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) greater than 0.78 in the training stage and 0.75 in the testing stage being suitable to describe the relationship between the feed intake and the rate of CO2 emission. However, when compared to the other models in the testing stage, the lasso model had the worst performance (R-2 < 0.65 and RMSE > 20.00 ppm). In conclusion, this study recommends employing an exponential-based regression model by taking feed intake as an input variable in predicting CO2 for a small number of the experimental dataset.

AB  - Trauma can shape the way an individual experiences the world and interacts with other people. Touch is a key component of social interactions, but surprisingly little is known about how trauma exposure influences the processing of social touch. In this review, we examine possible neurobiological pathways through which trauma can influence touch processing and lead to touch aversion and avoidance in trauma-exposed individuals. Emerging evidence indicates that trauma may affect sensory touch thresholds by modulating activity in the primary sensory cortex and posterior insula. Disturbances in multisensory integration and oxytocin reactivity combined with diminished reward-related and anxiolytic responses may induce a bias towards negative appraisal of touch contexts. Furthermore, hippocampus deactivation during social touch may reflect a dissociative state. These changes depend not only on the type and severity of the trauma but also on the features of the touch. We hypothesise that disrupted touch processing may impair social interactions and confer elevated risk for future stress-related disorders.

AB  - The multi-proxy study of sediment cores from Lake Isoba (43 degrees 02 ' N, 5 degrees 18 ' W; 1400 m a.s.l.) allows a detailed assessment of the past hydrological and environmental dynamics in north-western Iberia resulting from the interplay between climate variability and anthropogenic impact. The combination of diatom stratigraphy, sedimentology and high-resolution elemental geochemistry along with a robust chronological framework (established by Pb-210, Cs-137 and C-14 dating) provides a detailed environmental reconstruction for the past similar to 500 years. Abrupt changes in the fossil diatom assemblages indicate a high sensitivity of this small lake to past environmental change and allow identifying four major stages related to the main climate fluctuations of the Little Ice Age (LIA) and recent warming. High lake levels, enhanced runoff and higher productivity characterised the middle phase of the LIA (similar to 1550 to 1630 CE), indicating an overall wet climate. Conversely, shallow lake levels, decreased runoff and relatively low productivity prevailed during the last phase of the LIA and the onset of the Industrial Era (similar to 1630 to 1925 CE), likely due to colder and drier conditions. High lake levels and higher carbonate input occurred after similar to 1925 CE until the 1980s CE, when our data show an abrupt drop in lake levels probably caused by a regional negative rainfall anomaly related to climate warming during the past decades. Finally, since similar to 1997 CE a remarkable and abrupt increase in the lake nutrient load and turbidity is detected, probably associated with the replacement of transhumant sheep flocks with staying cattle. The main environmental changes reconstructed at Lake Isoba mostly agree with other palaeoclimatic records from northern Spain. However, the hydrological patterns reconstructed are opposed to those observed on the northern slopes of the Cantabrian Mountains. The recent and strong impact of land-use changes on the lake, causing more ecological disruptions than previous climate changes, is noteworthy and demonstrates the high sensitivity of mountain lakes to human activities in a global change context.

AB  - Drought, a major stress for crop plants, is expected to increase in frequency due to climate change. Drought can alter crop growth and levels of secondary plant metabolites, which in turn can affect herbivores, but this latter point is still controversial. This study used three different polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) levels (0%, 1%, and 3%) to simulate drought stress and evaluated their effects on cotton plants and the impacts on the performance of the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii. Cotton plants under drought stress showed decreased water content, above-ground biomass, and nitrogen content and increased soluble protein, soluble sugar, and tannin contents. Based on analysis of the developmental time and fecundity data from individuals and at the population level, a significantly lower fecundity and population abundance of A. gossypii were detected on cotton plants with drought stress, which supports the "plant vigor hypothesis". The poor development of A. gossypii is possibly related to lower xylem sap and phloem ingestion under drought stress. In addition, the increased tannin content of cotton plants induced by drought and lower detoxification enzyme activities of A. gossypii may have affected the responses of aphids to drought-stressed plants. Overall, the results showed that drought stress altered the physiological characteristics of the cotton plants, resulting in adverse bottom-up effects on cotton aphid performances. This implies that the adoption of drip irrigation under plastic film that can help alleviate drought stress may favor the population growth of cotton aphids.

AB  - How climate change will modify belowground tritrophic interactions is poorly understood, despite their importance for agricultural productivity. Here, we manipulated the three major abiotic factors associated with climate change (atmospheric CO2, temperature, and soil moisture) and investigated their individual and joint effects on the interaction between maize, the banded cucumber beetle (Diabrotica balteata), and the entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) Heterorhabditis bacteriophora. Changes in individual abiotic parameters had a strong influence on plant biomass, leaf wilting, sugar concentrations, protein levels, and benzoxazinoid contents. Yet, when combined to simulate a predicted climate scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, RCP 8.5), their effects mostly counter-balanced each other. Only the sharp negative impact of drought on leaf wilting was not fully compensated. In both current and predicted scenarios, root damage resulted in increased leaf wilting, reduced root biomass, and reconfigured the plant sugar metabolism. Single climatic variables modulated the herbivore performance and survival in an additive manner, although slight interactions were also observed. Increased temperature and CO2 levels both enhanced the performance of the insect, but elevated temperature also decreased its survival. Elevated temperatures and CO2 further directly impeded the EPN infectivity potential, while lower moisture levels improved it through plant- and/or herbivore-mediated changes. In the RCP 8.5 scenario, temperature and CO2 showed interactive effects on EPN infectivity, which was overall decreased by 40%. We conclude that root pest problems may worsen with climate change due to increased herbivore performance and reduced top-down control by biological control agents.

AB  - Temperate grassy woodlands were once widespread in southeast Australia and were shaped by fire regimes imposed by Indigenous peoples. Today, they persist as scattered fragments in matrices of highly modified farmland, where fire is rare and eucalypt trees are in decline. Returning fire to these fragments is a suggested approach to reduce fuels and stimulate eucalypt recruitment. We implemented a single round of small, low-intensity surface fires in a woodland fragment in the Tasmanian Midlands and assessed adult eucalypt mortality and juvenile recruitment. The fires were set during mild fire weather, were tended by 4-15 people, and fire-fighting vehicles were used to extinguish burning trees. Still, the fires killed 7% of adult eucalypts (18 trees), mostly due to cambial girdling which occurred where burning litter and coarse woody debris at the base of the trees initiated smouldering fires in thick bark on the lower trunks. Seedling recruitment was restricted to ash beds near trees with viable seed crops. Seedlings survived only if protected from mammalian herbivores. Herbivore protection also increased the growth of lignotuberous sprouts after fire. Our findings demonstrate that eucalypt trees in degraded woodland fragments may be vulnerable to low-intensity surface fire. We make recommendations as to how managers may burn woodland fragments in ways that avoid killing eucalypt trees and enhance postfire recruitment, enabling transition to more sustainable fire regimes.

AB  - In this study, the effects of goat manure fertilization (2, 4, 8, and 12 Tn/ha) on the grain yield, organic compounds, and mineral composition of two quinoa varieties (CICA-17 and Regalona Baer) were evaluated under field conditions in Northwest Argentina. The results indicate that fertilization improved the quinoa grain yield and total protein content. Low manure doses positively affected the fatty acid (FA) profile, and significant changes were determined for the monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acid contents of CICA-17 and on the saturated fatty acid (SFA) contents of R. Baer seeds. The amino acid contents were positively affected in CICA-17 and negatively in R. Baer. Soluble sugars (glucose, fructose, and sucrose), major elements (K, Si, P, Mg, Ca, and Na), minor elements (Fe, Mn, Al, Zn, and Cu), and ultratrace elements (Cr and Li) were detected and discussed in terms of their impact on human nutrition and health. Conclusively, manure addition affected some essential amino acids, the desaturase activity, the n6:n3 and SFA/UFA ratios, the atherogenic index, soluble sugars, and mineral content, and the fatty acid metabolism of each variety was differently affected, especially the C16 and C18 desaturase activity, which responded differently to various manure doses. Manure addition is a promising alternative to improve the nutritional quality and functionality of quinoa grains, but the response is not linear.

Here, we characterised environmental conditions that protect versus erode polymorphic chemical defences in Boechera stricta (Brassicaceae), a short-lived perennial wildflower. By manipulating drought and herbivory in a 4-year field experiment, we measured the effects of driver variation on vital rates of genotypes varying in defence chemistry and then assessed interacting driver effects on total fitness (estimated as each genotype's lineage growth rate, lambda) using demographic models. Drought and herbivory interacted to shape vital rates, but contrasting defence genotypes had equivalent total fitness in many environments. Defence polymorphism thus may persist under a range of conditions; however, ambient field conditions fall close to the boundary of putatively polymorphic environment space, and increasing aridity may drive populations to monomorphism. Consequently, elevated intensity and/or frequency of drought under climate change may erode genetic variation for defence chemistry in B. stricta.

AB  - Inter-individual differences are necessary for selection to act, while plasticity (intra-individual variation) may buffer against selection. Sleep is a critical self-maintenance behaviour but, unlike most behaviours, the causes and consequences of its inter- and intra-individual variation in wild animals is poorly understood, particularly in neonates where sleep plays a key role in development. We have shown previously that free-ranging neonate fallow deer (Dama dama) differ in sleep during the first few weeks of life. Here, we test whether individual variability in sleep is organised systematically across the population, and whether these individual differences are associated with chronic stress measured using hair cortisol, or the timing of birth.
   Four dimensions of sleep behaviour (total sleep time, sleep fragmentation, sleep quality, and sleep distribution over 24-h) were quantified using state-of-the-art triaxial accelerometers. We then used a multivariate mixed-effects model in a Bayesian framework to evaluate covariation between multiple dimensions of sleep behaviour, and quantify the relative importance of chronic stress and the timing of birth, while accounting for the confounding effects of environmental conditions and age.
   We found that the timing of birth and chronic stress were not associated with changes in sleep between individuals. While both total sleep time and the number of bouts per day declined with age, their rate of development covaried, but no other sleep dimensions covaried.
   Our results represent an in-depth analysis of natural variation in sleep, and show that individual differences in four aspects of sleep architecture in free-living fallow deer fawns are strong but independent of one another and unrelated to chronic stress or the timing of birth. We suggest that covariation between sleep dimensions might emerge later in life and effects of cortisol and birth timing might be very short and transient.

AB  - Grafting is an important approach to improving tea plant varieties, and tea grafting can result in changes in secondary metabolites. However, the shifting pattern of secondary metabolites between scions, rootstocks, and non-grafted tea leaves is unclear. We employed "Yuncha 1" as the scion and "Zijuan" as the rootstock with significant differences in leaf color traits to reveal the influences of grafting on the generation of secondary metabolites and transcriptional activities. By non-targeted metabolomic analysis, we identified that grafting led to an obvious shift in secondary metabolites between the scion, rootstock, and non-grafted tea leaves. Importantly, we found that grafting significantly enhanced the accumulation of flavonoids, the vital component of secondary metabolites for the flavor quality, purple color, and health-beneficial effect of Zijuan tea. Via transcriptomics, we found that the key biosynthetic genes DFR and EC 1.1.1.219 for synthesizing flavonoids were significantly enhanced in rootstock compared with non-grafted Zijuan. Concurrently, ANS for biodegrading flavonoids was significantly suppressed in rootstock compared with non-grafted Zijuan. These results revealed the shifting mechanism of key secondary metabolites during grafting. In addition, we found that the shift after grafting possessed no significant influence on bacterial community diversity, but grafting slightly enhanced the fungal community diversity of scions. We found that the shift in fungal community diversity was driven by rootstocks with a higher fungal community diversity. This study systematically reveals the shift in secondary metabolites and fungal community diversity, which provides a novel and comprehensive understanding and theoretical basis for plant breeding using grafting.

AB  - Megalobrama amblycephala, a main herbivorous fish with notable economic benefits in China, often faces serious challenges to its survival and growth due to hypoxia and heat caused by factors such as global warming and intensive aquaculture. To evaluate the combined effects of these stressors, we performed a two-factor crossover test to assess the impacts of simultaneous exposure to hypoxia (2 mg/L) and heat (35 degrees C) on oxidative stress, immunity and apoptosis in M. amblycephala. These results showed that hypoxia and heat exposure significantly enhanced the expression of oxygen-sensing and heat shock protein (HSP) genes, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (Hif1 alpha), HIF-prolyl hydroxylase-2 ( phd2) and factor inhibiting Hif-1 ( fih-1) , as well as hsp70 and hsp90 alpha. Furthermore, M. amblycephala suffering from hypoxia and heat exposure exhibited several changes in liver tissues, with the most severe lesions and up-regulation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) observed in those subjected to simultaneous exposure. Moreover, the combined hypoxia and heat exposure initially triggered an increase in the activities of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH) contents, followed by a reduction, and the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA), which induced oxidative stress. This was accompanied by an increase and subsequent reduction in the contents of alkaline phosphatase (AKP), acid phosphatase (ACP), complement component 3 (C3) and C4, immunoglobulin M (IgM), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) leading to immunosuppression. Additionally, hypoxia and heat exposure up-regulated the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes ( nrf2 , cu/zn-sod, mn-sod cat, ho-1 , pi3k and gpx-1a), inflammatory genes (interleukin il-1 beta, il-8 and tnf-alpha), immunity effectors ( igm and lyz ), as well as apoptosis genes ( casp3 , casp8, casp9 and p53) and activated p-Akt/Akt, suggesting apoptosis may be linked with oxidative stress and inflammation and mediated through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. In short, the combined hypoxia and heat exposure disrupted homoeostasis in M. amblycephala, with a more pronounced detrimental effect than exposure to either stressor alone These results will contribute to understanding the mechanism of combined exposure to hypoxia and heat in fish and provide a fundamental base for fisheries management.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) cycle in ecosystems has been overbalanced by human activities. However, it remains uncertain whether the altered N supply results in a change in the elemental composition of phytoplankton and, consequently, affects the life history strategy of zooplankton. To investigate these impacts, a simple lab-based food chain was established. Results show that lack or excess of nitrogen reduced algal density, cell volume, growth rate and chlorophyll content. Moreover, N content in algae significantly increased with increased N concentration in the medium, and reached saturation at concentrations =5 mg.L-1. Feeding on algae grown in a low-nitrogen or no nitrogen mediums resulted in faster decline in age-specific survival of rotifers, and slower popula-tion growth, as well as longer generation time. In order to make up for nutritional shortage, grazing and filtration rates increased. On the other hand, rotifers feeding on algae grown in high-N mediums (A(50) and A(200)) had significantly shorter average lifespan and life expectancy at hatching. Therefore, nitrogen imbalances have adverse effects on the growth, development and reproduc-tion of both primary producers and herbivorous zooplankton in the food chain.

AB  - Introduction: Ecosystem restoration facilitates ecological succession. When a coral reef experiences a distur-bance, the community of sessile benthic organisms can follow a successional trajectory that favors the domi-nance of coral or a change of state to an ecosystem dominated by algae. Objective: To better understand the impact of coral transplants on succession of the sessile benthic community. Methods: To measure and monitor the coral cover (cm2) of Pocillopora spp., and the composition of the associ-ated benthic community, experimental and control coral reef patches were established at the coral restoration site in Golfo Dulce, South Pacific Costa Rica. Thirty Pocillopora spp. colonies were attached to nails on the substrate in an experimental patch. The control coral patch contained nails with non-transplanted colonies. Both treatments were photographed monthly during a period of eight months. Changes in the coverage of coral and other sessile benthic organisms were measured from the images and compared over time between the experi-mental and control patches. Results: The coral transplants experienced bleaching events in August through September 2019 and January through February 2020. The first bleaching event possibly due to sedimentation, and the second to high tem-peratures. By the end of the experiment, 83 % of the colonies had survived. The live colonies grew significantly following transplantation; > 67 % of their initial coverage area after eight months. In the experimental patch, the areas of Pocillopora spp., coralline crustose algae (CCA), and cyanobacteria increased while the area of algal turf decreased. The increase in coral coverage and CCA, and decrease in algal turf in the experimental patch could be due to herbivores attracted to transplants. The increase in cyanobacteria in the experimental patch could be the result of higher temperatures and may have been a factor in the death of colonies. Conclusions: The transplantation of Pocillopora spp. colonies in Golfo Dulce changed the early successional trajectory of the sessile benthic community to favor the dominance of coral dominance in the experimental patch. These results may be useful in informing expectations for future restoration efforts.

AB  - Simple Summary The presence of gastrointestinal parasites such as coccidia (protozoa), gastrointestinal nematodes, flukes, and tapeworms are a considerable problem in goat keeping. Parasitic infections cause a deterioration of animal health, delay in growth rate, weight loss, reduced milk production, and miscarriages. The aim of the study was to compare the prevalence and intensity of parasitic infections observed in the digestive tracts of goats kept on organic and conventional farms. Our findings indicate that conventional goat herds demonstrate a similar prevalence of parasitic diseases as organic herds. Nevertheless, the prophylactic programs used to combat parasitic infections in both types of farms appear ineffective and require improvement. There is a need for goat herds to be covered by ongoing parasitological monitoring, including parasitological testing before and after the pasture season, to detect carriers and shedders of parasite eggs, oocysts, and cysts. It is also recommended that keepers employ rotational or intensive rotational grazing methods and take care to ensure the hygiene of animal quarters and livestock rooms. Furthermore, accurate diagnosis of parasitic infections, as well as effective monitoring and prophylaxis, are essential for keeping goat herds free from parasitic infections. The aim of the study was to compare the prevalence and intensity of gastrointestinal parasitic infections in goats kept on organic (n = 76) and conventional farms (n = 82). In general, a higher prevalence of some gastrointestinal parasitic infections was found in the conventional farms compared to the organic farms: the mean prevalence of Eimeria spp. was 85.4% in conventional farms and 77.6% in organic farms, that of Fasciola hepatica was 6.10% in conventional farms and 2.63% in organic farms, and that of Moniezia expansa was 31.7% and 17.1%, in conventional and organic farms, respectively. Both farm types demonstrated a similar mean prevalence of nematodes (80.3 vs. 84.2%). Conventional farms demonstrated a significantly higher intensity of infection with E. arloingi, Haemonchus spp., Nematodirus spp. and Moniezia expansa compared to organic farms. They also demonstrated a higher intensity of infection with Eimeria spp. than organic farms. The prophylactic programs used to combat parasitic infections in both types of farms appear ineffective and require improvement. There is a need for goat herds to be covered by ongoing parasitological monitoring. It is also recommended that keepers employ rotational or intensive rotational grazing methods and take care to ensure the hygiene of animal quarters and livestock rooms.

AB  - Avocado lace bug, Pseudocysta perseae (Heidemann) (Hemiptera: Tingidae), is a sap-feeding insect that feeds on the underside of avocado leaves. First observed in 2019, P. perseae has spread throughout the Hawaiian islands, causing premature leaf drop and decrease in avocado yield. Due to Hawai'i's approximately 200 cultivars comprised of all 3 avocado races with extensive racial hybrids, we were able to investigate whether certain cultivars were more prone to experiencing higher P. perseae abundances and infestations compared to others. We conducted longitudinal abundance surveys on Hawai'i Island across several common avocado varieties monitoring changes in P. perseae abundance. These surveys were supplemented with longitudinal infestation severity surveys across 4 avocado lineages (Mexican, Guatemalan, West Indian, and Guatemalan x West Indian hybrid). Additionally, we collected leaves of 'Sharwil', 'Hass', 'Kahalu'u', and 'Nishikawa' cultivars looking at associations between P. perseae abundance and cultivar, herbivory-related biomechanical traits, and soluble sugar content. We found that some cultivars, such as 'Malama', typically experience lower P. perseae abundances compared to cultivars such as 'Kahalu'u', 'Beshore', and 'Sharwil'. Guatemalan x West Indian hybrid trees were also shown to have a higher probability of experiencing more severe P. perseae infestations compared to other lineages. Lastly, soluble sugar content, specifically fructose content, had a positive effect on juvenile P. perseae abundance. These findings suggest that cultivar differences in P. perseae infestations may exist, but tree-to-tree leaf compositional differences, such as soluble sugar content, may be a large driver of variation in P. perseae abundance.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates and cell wall polymers in Protium icicariba individuals along an environmental gradient of a Coastal Brazilian Atlantic Forest (restinga). The concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, sucrose and starch) and cell wall polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) were quantified in samples of stems, branches and leaves of individuals distributed in contrasting zones regarding the occurrence of floods [periodically floodable (PI), transitional (IT) and non-floodable (NI)]. Individuals from the non-flooded zone had higher concentrations of starch and hemicelluloses in the branches and leaves. On the other hand, cellulose and lignin concentrations were higher in the leaves of individuals from the periodically flooded and transitional zones. The variations in the concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates and cell wall polymers were mainly associated with water availability and plasticity of the species, in addition to possible influences of soil nutrient supply and the occurrence of herbivory. The sensitivity in the dynamics of the carbon molecules of P. icicariba in a diverse and spatially short environmental gradient, requires considerable plasticity of the species that, in the imminence of climatic changes, must favor its survival in the face of the imposition of new environmental filters.

AB  - USING the PCR-RFLP method, pigs were genotyped for the leptin gene (the mutations T3266G and A1112G). The boars of four breeds (Duroc, Large White, Landrace and Yorkshire) from the Belgorod region of Russia were studied in the work. The LEP gene of pigs is located in the 18-th chromosome and serves as a promising candidate gene for pig growth and obesity evaluation. Purpose of the study: Evaluation of allele frequencies for the polymorphisms A1112G and T3266G among the boars of the Duroc, Large White, Landrace and Yorkshire breeds at the farms of the Belgorod region (Russia). Materials and methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from alcoholized earmarks using the DNA-Extran-2 reagent kit (SINTOL, Russia) according to the protocol. Pigs were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. PCR products were hydrolyzed with 4 units of restriction enzyme FokI or TaqI (SibEnzyme, Russia) for 16 hours. Gel blocks were stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 mu g/ml) and visualized on UV transilluminator to detect DNA fragments. The sequencing reaction was performed using the BigDye v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit. DNA sequencing was performed on the ABI 3500 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Result: For both polymorphisms in all breeds of pigs they revealed a higher frequency of mutant alleles recorded in Yorkshires, as well as homozygous genotypes for them. At the same time, they showed a high degree of alleles and genotype frequencies dependence for two polymorphisms caused by linked inheritance. The allele frequencies of the studied breeds for the A1112G polymorphism correspond to the data of European selection. For T3266G polymorphism the Durocs revealed a significant deviation of genotype frequencies from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which may indicate an active breeding process in this breed. In addition to the studied polymorphisms relative to the reference sequence of the chromosome 18 (NC_010460.4), we identified 11 other mutations, including 8 SNPs and 3 deletions. Of these, 10 mutations were previously described during sequencing of the leptin gene (the sequences U66254.1 and AJ865080.1). For the first time, we described the G3297A mutation in the leptin gene intron among Duroc pigs, which can potentially act as a genetic marker of lipid metabolism and fat content in pigs. Conclusion: Based on the results of the pig LEP gene fragment sequencing, they confirmed the presence of polymorphisms T3266G and A1112G relative to the reference sequence U66254.1. They revealed a higher frequency of mutant alleles recorded in Yorkshires, as well as homozygous genotypes for both polymorphisms in all breeds of pigs. At the same time, they showed a high degree of dependence of alleles and genotype frequencies for two polymorphisms caused by linked inheritance. According to the T3266G polymorphism, a significant deviation of the genotype frequencies from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was revealed among the Durocs, which may be the consequence of an active selection process in this breed. The Duroc breed showed a new SNP in the leptin gene G3297A.

AB  - Orf virus (ORFV) represents the causative agent of contagious ecthyma, clinically characterized by mild papular and pustular to severe proliferative lesions, mainly occurring in sheep and goats. In order to provide hints on the evolutionary history of this virus, we carried out a study aimed to assess the genetic variation of ORFV in Sardinia that hosts a large affected small ruminant population. We also found a high worldwide mutational viral evolutionary rate, which resulted, in turn, higher than the rate we detected for the strains isolated in Sardinia. In addition, a well-supported genetic divergence was found between the viral strains isolated from sheep and those from goats, but no relevant connection was evidenced between the severity of lesions produced by ORFV and specific polymorphic patterns in the two species of hosts. Such a finding suggests that ORFV infection-related lesions are not necessarily linked to the expression of one of the three genes here analyzed and could rather be the effect of the expression of other genes or rather represents a multifactorial character.

AB  - Context. An increasing leopard population outside forests and their interactions with humans have become a global conservation concern. Decline in natural habitats and wild prey has driven leopards to rely on livestock and stray animals near cultivated lands.Aims This study aimed to assess communities perceptions of livestock depredation by Indian leopards (Panthera pardus fusca) in human-dominated landscapes. The study sought to quantify animal losses, evaluate people's views on leopard conservation, and understand the extent of awareness of leopard's ecological role.Methods A survey was conducted in 2021-2022 through a structured interview-based questionnaire in five most affected sub-districts of Surat, Gujarat. A total of 587 randomly selected households were interviewed to gather data on (i) participants general information, (ii) participants knowledge, their views and thoughts regarding human-leopard interaction, (iii) livestock depredation information, and (iv) people's perception towards leopards.Key results Survey revealed agriculture (58%) as the primary source of livelihood, followed by poultry and other livestock rearing for the locals. From January 2020 to June 2022, a total of 364 domestic animal losses due to leopard attacks were reported including goats, stray dogs and poultry, which accounted for 92% of predation cases. The community's attitude towards leopards was mostly negative (similar to 54%) due to economic losses. Though leopard conservation was supported by 50% of respondents, only 17% of respondents knew their ecological significance.Conclusions This study highlights that, although human-leopard interactions in Surat district are driven by significant economic losses from livestock depredation, local attitudes are not entirely negative. Despite these interactions, communities support leopard conservation and are likely to be receptive towards achieving coexistence. These perceptions are further shaped by demographic factors, indicating that social context also dictates the potential for coexistence.Implications The present study tried to bridge the gap in local understanding of leopards' ecological role. The findings suggest that a lack of awareness and insufficient compensation contribute to negative attitudes towards leopards, implying a need for strategies that address both ecological understanding and community concerns. A fair public support has been shown for leopard's conservation in the region despite the challenges associated in shared landscapes with these large predators.

AB  - Leaves are important 'source' organs that synthesize organic matter, providing carbon sources for plant growth. Here, we used Populus talassica x Populus euphratica, the dominant species in ecological and timber forests, to simulate carbon limitation through artificial 25%, 50%, and 75% defoliation treatments and explore the effects on root, stem, and leaf morphology, biomass accumulation, and carbon allocation strategies. At the 60th d after treatment, under 25% defoliation treatment, the plant height, specific leaf weight, root surface area and volume, and concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates in stem and root were significantly increased by 9.13%, 20.00%, 16.60%, 31.95%, 5.12%, and 9.34%, respectively, relative to the control. There was no significant change in the growth indicators under 50% defoliation treatment, but the concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates in the leaf and stem significantly decreased, showing mostly a negative correlation between them. The opposite was observed in the root. Under 75% defoliation treatment, the plant height, ground diameter, leaf number, single leaf area, root, stem, and total biomass were significantly reduced by 14.15%, 10.24%, 14.86%, 11.31%, 11.56%, 21.87%, and 16.82%, respectively, relative to the control. The concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates in various organs were significantly reduced, particularly in the consumption of the starch concentrations in the stem and root. These results indicated that carbon allocation strategies can be adjusted to increase the concentration of non-structural carbohydrates in root and meet plant growth needs under 25% and 50% defoliation. However, 75% defoliation significantly limited the distribution of non-structural carbohydrates to roots and stems, reduced carbon storage, and thus inhibited plant growth. Defoliation-induced carbon limitation altered the carbon allocation pattern of P. talassica x P. euphratica, and the relationship between carbon reserves in roots and tree growth recovery after defoliation was greater. This study provides a theoretical basis for the comprehensive management of P. talassica x P. euphratica plantations, as well as a reference for the study of plantation carbon allocation strategies in the desert and semi-desert regions of Xinjiang under carbon-limitation conditions.

AB  - Reduced energy intake can compromise the ability of a mammal to maintain body temperature within a narrow 24-h range, leading to heterothermy. To investigate the main drivers of heterothermy in a bulk grazer, we compared abdominal temperature, body mass, body condition index, and serum leptin levels in 11 subadult Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) during a drought year and a nondrought year. Low food availability during the drought year (as indexed by grass biomass, satellite imagery of vegetation greenness, and fecal chlorophyll) resulted in lower body condition index, lower body mass relative to that expected for an equivalent-aged buffalo, and lower leptin levels. The range of 24-h body temperature rhythm was 27C during the nondrought year and more than double that during the drought year, and this was caused primarily by a lower minimum 24-h body temperature rhythm during the cool dry winter months. After rain fell and vegetation greenness increased, the minimum 24-h body temperature rhythm increased, and the range of 24-h body temperature rhythm was smaller than 27C. In order of importance, poor body condition, low minimum 24-h air temperature, and low serum leptin levels were the best predictors of the increase in the range of 24-h body temperature rhythm. While the thermoregulatory role of leptin is not fully understood, the association between range of 24-h body temperature rhythm and serum leptin levels provides clues about the underlying mechanism behind the increased heterothermy in large mammals facing food restriction.

AB  - Introduction The renewal effect of extinction describes the reoccurrence of an extinguished response if recall is performed in a context that is not the same as the extinction context. This learning phenomenon is clinically relevant, since it potentially interferes with therapy success for anxiety disorders or phobias. The propensity to show the renewal effect appears to be a stable processing strategy in context-related extinction, associated with higher BOLD activation in hippocampus, ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in individuals who show renewal (REN) compared to those who do not (NoREN). However, evidence on a potential relationship between structural properties such as gray matter volume (GMV) in these regions and the propensity to show renewal is lacking.Methods In this study, we applied voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate whether individuals with and without a propensity for renewal differ regarding their GMV in extinction-related brain regions, and whether such a difference is linked to the renewal level.Results Results revealed differential GMV in REN and NoREN in adjacent subregions of IFG and vmPFC, respectively. Higher GMV in REN was located predominantly in orbital IFG and in BA10 of vmPFC. Higher GMV in NoREN was located predominantly in triangular IFG and in BA 11 of vmPFC. In bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior hippocampus, GMV was overall higher in NoREN. In the complete sample, higher GMV in IFG BA 47, vmPFC BA11, bilateral ACC and bilateral anterior hippocampus was associated with less renewal, and partially with a higher error level in extinction learning in a novel context.Discussion The findings suggest that higher GMV in several regions active during extinction learning may support a more thorough processing of extinction trials which in turn could be conducive to an extinction recall solely based on recent extinction memory, disregarding context information. In summary, this study provides first-time evidence for a relationship of GMV in of extinction- and renewal-relevant brain regions with behavioral performance during extinction learning and the propensity to show the renewal effect.

AB  - Community-intrinsic properties affect the function and composition of microbial community, and understanding of the microbial community-intrinsic properties in different pipe materials of drinking water distribution systems can help to prevent microbial pollution more reasonably and efficiently. This study investigated the biofilm formation and chlorine resistance of multi-species biofilms in two representative outdoor pipe materials (poly-ethylene (PE) and cast iron pipe). The results showed that cast iron pipes have higher biofilm biomass but lower biofilm activity than PE pipes. The different growth environments of the two pipe materials resulted in diverse microbial community-intrinsic properties and affected multi-species biofilm formation. The microbial commu-nities without Sphingomonas or Acidovorax in cast iron pipe exhibited higher biofilm biomass, when compared with those in PE pipe. In contrast, the microbial community without Bacillus in PE pipe presented higher biofilm biomass, when compared with those in cast iron pipe. Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and corrosion products protected bacteria from chlorination. Although community-intrinsic properties helped bacteria resist chlorination, the same microbial community exhibited diverse chlorine resistance in different pipe materials owing to different community-intrinsic properties. While the chlorine resistance of microbial community without Bacillus was low in PE pipe, that in cast iron pipe was better owing to high corrosion degree. Multi-species biofilm without Sphingomonas or Acidovorax presented higher biofilm biomass, but lower EPS content and corrosion products in cast iron pipe, resulting in low chlorine resistance. In summary, this study revealed that outdoor pipe materials could affect microbial community-intrinsic properties, which in turn could influence biofilm charac-teristics, and provided unique insights for ensuring drinking water safety.

AB  - Herbivore insects affect the performance of plants. The cochineal insect (Dactylopius coccus (C.) is among the herbivores insects of cactus plants that severely destruct Opuntia ficus-indica plants. Host-plant fitness performance against herbivorous insects is controlled through symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and has been reported for different plant species. We studied the effects of AMF-inoculation in inducing resistance in the O. ficus-indica plant against cochineal insects under various soil water levels. In this study, spiny and spineless O. ficus-indica plants were grown with the presence and absence of AMF, and with four levels of soil water stress. The treated plants were grown in greenhouse conditions. After 24 months of growing, all treated cladodes were exposed to the cochineal insects through crawler inoculation. The findings indicated that AMF not only improved O. ficus-indica performance but also activated the defense response of O. ficus-indica against the cochineal insect. AMF colonization strongly affected the performance of the inoculated crawlers, mainly the number of established crawlers, survival rates, and number of crawlers that reached nymph I, first molting, nymph II, second molting, proto-pupa, and pupa, female and male adults. Female mass weight, egg, and crawler production were reduced in AMF O. ficus-indica plants. AMF colonization significantly affected the cochineal populations in the cladodes. Opuntia ficus-indica type and water treatment alone were not significant sources of variation for cochineal performances. Colonization of O. ficus-indica with AMF significantly increased morphological traits and nutrient concentrations of the cladodes. Improvements in morphological traits and nutritional concentration have been shown to play a key role in enhancing mycorrhizal O. ficus-indica plants resistance against cochineal.

AB  - The wild water deer (Hydropotes inermis) population has declined rapidly over recent decades and has reached an endangered status in China. Therefore, it is important to understand their habitat selection to effectively protect both existing and emerging populations. This paper used the data of 11 habitat factors in Baishan Musk Deer National Nature Reserve in the autumn and winter from 2018 to 2019 to conduct a habitat selection study of water deer by resource selection function analysis. The results indicated that in both the autumn and winter, water deer preferred grasslands at sunny and middle slopes, dominated by Artemisia carvifolia and A. argyi, respectively. In addition, the resource selection function showed that the height of dominant herbage, hiding cover, distance from water, and distance to human settlements greatly contribute to the habitat selection of water deer in the cold season. The correct prediction rate of the resource selection function model exceeded 80%, highlighting its suitability for predicting the habitat selection of water deer. The outcomes of this study provide an effective scientific basis for the conservation and restoration of water deer, and valuable enlightenment for implementing a sustainable development strategy in northeast China.

AB  - Philippine native pigs (PhNP) are small black pigs domesticated in rural communities in the Philippines. They are valued locally for their various sociocultural roles. Recently, considerable literature has accumulated in the field of native pig production and marketing. However, there is limited research on the genetic diversity of PhNP. No previous study has investigated the evolutionary relatedness among native pigs from various islands and provinces in Luzon and the Visayas, Philippines. In addition, a much debated question is whether the PhNP were interbreeding with or even domesticated from endemic wild pigs. This study aims to clarify some of the uncertainties surrounding the identity and classification of PhNP based on mito-chondrial DNA (mtDNA) signatures. Native pig samples (n = 157) were collected from 10 provinces in Luzon and the Visayas. Approximately 650 base pairs of the mtDNA D-loop region were sequenced and analyzed together with publicly avail-able sequences. Pairwise-distance analysis showed genetic separation of North and South Luzon (SL) and the clustering of SL with Visayan pigs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the PhNP clustered within 3 recognized Asian pig domestication centers: D2 (East Asia), D7 (Southeast Asia) and the Cordillera clade (sister to the Lanyu). We identified 19 haplotypes (1-38 samples each), forming 4 haplogroups, i.e., North Luzon, South Luzon and Visayas, Asian mix and the Cordillera cluster. No endemic wild pig mtDNA was detected in the native pig population, but evidence of interspecific hybridization was observed. This study showed that the Philippine native pigs have originated from at least 3 Sus scrofa lineage and that they were not domesticated from the endemic wild pigs of the Philippines.

AB  - This study delves into the innovative application of a novel bacterial and enzyme mixture alone or combined with aeration in mitigating emissions from pig slurry storage and explores their impacts on the methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and ammonia (NH3) emissions from stored pig slurry. A dynamic chamber was used in this research to assess the efficacy of the treatments. Biological additives (HIPO-PUR & Iacute;N) of specific microbial strains were tested (a mixture ofof Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus amyloliquefacien, and Bacillus thuringiensis) alone and combined with an aeration system (OXI-FUCH). Controlled experiments simulated storage conditions, where emissions of ammonia, methane, and carbon dioxide were measured. By analyzing the results statistically, the treatment with HIPO-PUR & Iacute;N demonstrated a significant reduction in CH4 emissions by 67% and CO2 emissions by 60% with the use of biological additives, which was increased to 99% and 87%, respectively, when combined with OXI-FUCH aeration, compared to untreated slurry. Ammonia emissions were substantially reduced by 90% with biological additives alone and by 76% when combined with aeration. The study was driven by the need to develop sustainable solutions for livestock waste management, particularly in reducing emissions from pig slurry. It introduces techniques that significantly lower greenhouse gases, aligning with circular economy goals and setting a new standard for sustainable agriculture. Furthermore, there is a need to validate that farmers can independently manage pig slurry using simple and effective treatments techniques with profound environmental benefits, encouraging broader adoption of climate-conscious practices.

AB  - Animals' diets reflect the morpho-physiological and behavioral responses used to obtain nutrients and energy. While optimal foraging theory predicts them in terms of food availability, the obligatory heat model (OHM) predicts them based on ambient temperature, which affects the activity and/or size of the digestive organs, influencing food digestibility. In the highlands of central-west Argentina, rodent diversity is dominated by Phyllotis vaccarum, Abrothrix andina, Akodon oenos, and Euneomys sp. that coexist in different sections of their elevational ranges. Although these species' diets are relatively flexible, it is unclear how temperature and food availability influence their constitution. To unveil this, we explored their feeding strategies at different elevations (1700, 2300, and 3100 m a.s.l.) and seasons (winter and spring-summer). By examining fecal samples, we quantified the intake of vegetative parts of plants, seeds, and arthropods. Abrothrix andina was insectivorous at 2300 m and omnivorous at 3100 m a.s.l. in line with the OHM predictions, suggesting a higher plant consumption derived from an increased capacity of digestive organs, favored by lower temperatures at higher elevations. Phyllotis vaccarum was herbivorous at all elevations, independently of food supply or temperature conditions. However, the secondary food choice occurred in line with the OHM predictions, suggesting a certain degree of digestive adjustment to ambient temperature. Akodon oenos, which was only captured at 2300 m, was insectivorous, whereas Euneomys sp., which was only present at 3100 m, was a specialist herbivore. We detected no seasonal variation in the feeding strategies of the rodents examined. Intraspecifically, thermoregulatory demands would influence the variation in feeding strategies at the elevational gradient, whereas nutritional requirements would explain their consistency between seasons. Interspecifically, we found that diet dissimilarity was relatively high, mainly at high elevations and during winter, which could facilitate species coexistence.

AB  - Insect pollination is an important process in the natural ecosystem and plays a vital role in crop reproduction. The bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (L.), is a widely used pollinator for crops, especially tomato. The efficiency of bee pollination is related to many factors, including biotic factors such as bee species, nutrition plants, and herbivores. Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae) is one of the most common and serious pests of tomato plants. However, whether B. tabaci affects the pollination behaviour of B. terrestris on tomato, and how plant-herbivore-pollinator interactions are unclear. In this study, we found that B. terrestris preferred B. tabaci-damaged plants. Furthermore, plant volatiles of tomato plants damaged by B. tabaci were detected and analysed. Electroantennogram (EAG) and the Y-tube bioassay were used for olfactory responses of B. terrestris to plant volatiles. Interestingly, methyl hexanoate and eugenol induced by B. tabaci in tomato plants were found to significantly attract B. terrestris. Therefore, Bemisia tabaci influenced B. terrestris preference through volatiles. The plant volatile-mediated interaction between B. tabaci and B. terrestris could enrich our understanding of the interaction between herbivores and pollinators. In addition, methyl hexanoate and eugenol could be applied for synergist of pollination.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of age and sex on the content of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Zn and Cu) in the hair, liver and the longissimus lumborum muscle of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.). In addition, correlations between heavy metals in individual tested matrices were studied as well as an attempt was made to explain the reasons for their accumulation in specific research matrices. The levels of Zn and Cu were measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy (F-AAS). The levels of Pb and Cd were analysed by means of electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy (ET-AAS). In the own research, sex-related statistically significant differences in concentrations of analysed elements were confirmed. Higher levels of the elements were observed in samples collected from does (except for Cd in the liver samples of 6-7-month-old male fawns) but only in some cases, these values were statistically significantly higher. In some cases, age-related differences in the content of individual metals were also confirmed. Age-dependent increased Pb levels in the muscle and liver were reported in 6-7-month-old, <3-4-year-old, <5-6-year-old males. Similar relationships were confirmed for Zn in the bucks' muscles. In the group of does, the increase in heavy metal concentrations with aging was observed for Zn in the muscle and for Pb in the liver. In the other cases, the trend of age-related level changes regarding heavy metals was not clearly demonstrated. Significant positive correlations between Cu and Cd were found for all samples, and significant negative correlations of Cu with Pb were found for the hair and liver. There was a negative correlation of Zn with Cu in all matrices. The study also revealed a negative correlation between Zn and Pb in muscle and a strong significant negative correlation between Zn and Cd in hair and in the liver.

AB  - While bycatch, the unintentional catch of untargeted species, is one of the main threats to large marine species such as cetaceans, reef sharks and turtles, also known as megafauna, fishers can also be negatively impacted by bycatch. Understanding local fisheries profiles, fishers' demography and their opinion is thus a necessary part of the strategy to mitigate marine megafauna bycatch in artisanal fisheries. Interviews with fishers were conducted in order to assess the magnitude of marine megafauna bycatch, the dependency of fishers on the fishery and the potential for implementation of bycatch mitigation measures in the artisanal fisheries in Gorontalo, northern Sulawesi (Indonesia). Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyse the data. Regression trees showed that cetacean and turtle bycatch were mainly influenced by the fishing location, while bycatch of reef sharks, whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) and mobulids was mainly influenced by the gear type. Cetaceans mostly escaped after being caught or were released. Reef sharks, which were often sold for their meat, were caught in the highest numbers followed by sea turtles. Interviewed fishers had large households, typically averaging more than five people, and mostly were dependent on the fishery, often with few other sources of income. Fishers were generally in favour of reducing bycatch as bycatch often posed a financial threat, due to lost catch and damaged gear. When implementing bycatch reduction measures, it is important to involve fishers in design and implementation of mitigation measures. As awareness on bycatch management and mitigation is growing in Indonesia, measures including recordings (official and self-reporting), capacity building on bycatch specimen handling and release and bycatch mitigation techniques (e.g. gear modifications) are some of the most important bycatch reduction strategies for the country.

AB  - Early growth and environmental conditions can shape life-history trajectories. Long-lived iteroparous species with indeterminate growth face growth-reproduction trade-offs for most of their lives. Poor early conditions can delay primiparity and restrict growth, potentially compensated for by faster growth later in life, at the cost of reduced reproduction. We explored the variation in age at primiparity and early reproduction in eastern Grey kangaroos, based upon 13 yr of monitoring about 100 known-age females. We then examined associations between early reproduction, later reproduction, and lifetime growth. We used a modified von Bertalanffy growth function to model the indeterminate growth of females and to test the effects of early reproduction on lifetime growth. Favorable environmental conditions, large size, and condition as a subadult led to earlier reproduction and higher reproductive success at ages 3 to 5. As females aged, size and condition had diminishing effects on reproductive success. Females with greater early-adulthood reproduction had slightly higher reproduction later in life. We did not detect a growth cost of early reproduction. Large females in good condition favored early reproduction over growth, while those with poor early growth exhibited growth catch-up at the cost of reproduction both early and later in life. As reported for other long-lived iteroparous species with indeterminate growth, female kangaroos prioritize growth over reproduction for much of their lifespan. Eastern Gray kangaroos show heterogeneity in early growth and reproductive strategies. Early primiparity and reproduction are constrained by body condition, size, and environmental conditions when females are pre-reproductive subadults.
   Reproduction is demanding, but for young female kangaroos, being larger helps. Kangaroos grow continuously for most of their lives, but energy constraints often force a choice between growth and reproduction. Taller, heavier young females that have experienced favorable environmental conditions tend to reproduce earlier and more frequently in early and late stages of life. In contrast, smaller females prioritize growth to catch up in size. Overall, early-life conditions influence reproductive success among female kangaroos.

AB  - The African elephant (Loxodonta africana), once thought to be absent from the Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa, has recently reestablished or expanded its range into the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR), Botswana, with documented occurrences over the past decade. This study explores the temporal and spatial dynamics of elephants in and around the CKGR, focusing on their largely understudied movement patterns. Movement and home range data was obtained from two adult female and eight adult male elephants using GPS/UHF collars. The analysis revealed distinct seasonal ranging behaviours. Collared females migrated between CKGR and the Okavango Delta periphery, while collared male showed both migratory and sedentary patterns around artificial water points and Gope mine in CKGR. Some collared male elephants migrated to the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA) during the wet season, returning to the CKGR in the dry season. This pattern confirms established migration routes and the emergence of pseudoresident male elephants within CKGR. These findings highlight the importance of management strategies that integrate water distribution, elephant movement, and human-elephant conflicts. Ensuring ecological connectivity beyond the KAZA region is vital for the long-term survival of elephants and other key species.

AB  - Based on the random encounter model, the population densities of species potentially prey or competitor to the leopard (Panthera pardus) were estimated in the Hyrcan National Park, Azerbaijan. Data obtained from 18 camera traps were processed, 11 of which were installed in the southern part of the park, and 7 in the northern part. The total operating time of the cameras amounted to 3950 traps per day for the period from April 2018 to December 2019. A very high Wild boar population density was revealed in the southern part of the park (32.5 ind./1000 ha). On the contrary, no Roe deer was recorded in the southern part, while it had a rather low density in the northern part (4.4 ind./1000 ha). The population densities of the Golden jackal (0.6 ind./1000 ha), the Grey wolf (0.1 ind./1000 ha), the Jungle cat (6.7 ind./1000 ha), and the Raccoon (46.9 ind./1000 ha) ranged within the normal limits characteristic of similar populations in other parts of their global distribution. The population densities of the Indian porcupine (9.7 ind./1000 ha) and the Brown bear (0.4 ind./1000 ha) seem to have also corresponded to the mountain forest conditions of the study area. From a view point of food supply, the territory of the Hyrcan National Park is quite suitable for permanently supporting 3-4 leopard individuals.

AB  - A central goal in camera-trapping (CT) studies is to maximize detection probability and precision of occupancy estimates while minimizing the number of CTs to reduce equipment and labor costs. Few studies, however, have examined the effect of CT number on detection probability. Moreover, historically, most studies focused on a specific species and the design could be tailored toward maximizing detection of this target species. Increasingly, however, such studies use data for all captured, non-target, species (by-catch data) for animal community-level analyses. It remains unclear if, and how, the targeting of CTs toward one species affects the detection of non-target species. We paired CTs from a permanent camera-trapping grid (with 38 CTs) targeted at monitoring Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in Innlandet County, Norway, with additional randomly placed CTs at two spatial scales (38 CTs within the same habitat patch and 38 CTs within the same 50-km(2) grid cell as the lynx-targeted CTs) for three months. We combined multi-scale occupancy models that enable the separation of large-scale occupancy, CT-scale site use, and detection probability with single-scale occupancy models. This allowed us to study the effects of targeted placement and CT number on the detection probability of the target species (lynx) and seven non-target mammal species (four carnivores, three herbivores, and one rodent). We found that all species, except moose (Alces alces), had the highest detection probability at lynx-targeted CTs. Moose had equal detection probabilities at all three placement types. Adding extra CTs generally increased detection probabilities. Consequently, for all species, combining a lynx-targeted CT with one or more randomly placed CTs, increased the accuracy and precision of occupancy estimates for 50-km(2) grid cells compared to single CT estimates. The placement of single CTs underestimated grid-cell occupancy compared to known minimum occupancy and were similar to site-use probability estimates of multi-scale models. It is, however, uncertain to which spatial extent these site-use probabilities refer. We therefore recommend the use of multiple (targeted) CTs to estimate occupancy in large grid cells and to interpret occupancy estimates from single CTs as site use of an, as of yet undefined, area surrounding the CT.

AB  - During a survey of headwater springs in France, an unknown Staurosirella taxon was observed that could not be identified using the currently available literature. Based on light and scanning electron microscopy observations, the taxon is described as a new species: Staurosirella lucectoriana. The new species is characterised by small isopolar, elliptical frustules, with a very small apical pore field, composed of only a few pores on one valve pole. Staurosirella lucectoriana is typically found in waters with high nitrate concentrations. A detailed comparison with morphologically similar species is provided.

AB  - Simple Summary: Besides the well-known adverse effects of antibiotic usage such as drug resistance, residue, and immune system suppression, there is emerging evidence suggesting their potential to induce fat accumulation in the body, which can affect human health and the quality of animal products. Kitasamycin (KM) is widely used to treat various conditions like upper respiratory tract diseases, dysentery, and fibrosis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different doses of KM on lipid metabolism using pigs as models. The pigs were fed diets containing varying levels of KM: none, subtherapeutic, and therapeutic doses. The findings revealed that the subtherapeutic KM diet resulted in fat accumulation in back fat thickness, plasma, and longissimus dorsi muscle accompanied by alterations in both cecal microflora and concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Interestingly, the therapeutic KM diet had decreased intestinal weight and density accompanied by improved apparent digestibility of nutrients. Overall, this study underscores the dose-dependent impact of KM on intramuscular fat deposition and underscores concerns regarding the potential risks associated with subtherapeutic and therapeutic KM doses in both human and animal disease treatment. Kitasamycin (KM), a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic, has implications for growth performance and residue in animals and humans. This study aimed to explore the effects of different KM doses on intramuscular fat accumulation, cecal microflora, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) using a growing-finishing pig model. Forty-two pigs were divided into three groups: control, subtherapeutic KM (50 mg/kg, KM50), and therapeutic KM (200 mg/kg, KM200) diets over 8 weeks. KM50 led to increased back fat thickness, fat content in the longissimus dorsi muscle (LM), and elevated plasma total cholesterol (TC) levels (p < 0.05), supported by upregulated lipid synthesis gene expression (Acc1, Fas, Scd1) (p < 0.05) in the LM. KM50 altered cecal microflora, reducing Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. abundance, while increasing SCFA concentrations (acetic acid, propionic acid, total SCFAs) (p < 0.05). KM200 had minimal effects on intestinal weight and density, with increased apparent digestibility of nutrients. These findings highlight the dose-dependent impact of KM on intramuscular fat deposition. Subtherapeutic KM induced ectopic fat deposition, emphasizing potential risks in disease treatment for humans and animals.

AB  - Flight initiation distance (FID) procedures are used to assess the risk perception animals have for threats (e.g., natural predators, hunters), but it is unclear whether these assessments remain meaningful if animals have habituated to certain human stimuli (e.g., researchers, tourists). Our previous work showed that habituated baboons displayed individually distinct and consistent responses to human approaches, a tolerance trait, but it is unknown if the trait is resilient to life-threatening scenarios. If it were consistent, it would imply FIDs might measure specific human threat perception only and not generalize to other threats such as predators when animals have experienced habituation processes. We used FID procedures to compare baseline responses to the visual orientation distance, FID, and individual tolerance estimates assessed after a leopard predation on an adult male baboon (group member). All variables were consistent despite the predation event, suggesting tolerance to observers was largely unaffected by the predation and FID procedures are unlikely to be generalizable to other threats when habituation has occurred. FID approaches could be an important tool for assessing how humans influence animal behavior across a range of contexts, but careful planning is required to understand the type of stimuli presented.

AB  - The domestication and subsequent development of sheep are crucial events in the history of human civilization and the agricultural revolution. However, the impact of interspecific introgression on the genomic regions under domestication and subsequent selection remains unclear. Here, we analyze the whole genomes of domestic sheep and their wild relative species. We found introgression from wild sheep such as the snow sheep and its American relatives (bighorn and thinhorn sheep) into urial, Asiatic and European mouflons. We observed independent events of adaptive introgression from wild sheep into the Asiatic and European mouflons, as well as shared introgressed regions from both snow sheep and argali into Asiatic mouflon before or during the domestication process. We revealed European mouflons might arise through hybridization events between a now extinct sheep in Europe and feral domesticated sheep around 6000-5000 years BP. We also unveiled later introgressions from wild sheep to their sympatric domestic sheep after domestication. Several of the introgression events contain loci with candidate domestication genes (e.g., PAPPA2, NR6A1, SH3GL3, RFX3 and CAMK4), associated with morphological, immune, reproduction or production traits (wool/meat/milk). We also detected introgression events that introduced genes related to nervous response (NEURL1), neurogenesis (PRUNE2), hearing ability (USH2A), and placental viability (PAG11 and PAG3) into domestic sheep and their ancestral wild species from other wild species.
   Chen, Xu, et al. performed a population genetics analysis of the eight species in the Ovis genus to assess the evolutionary and demographic history of these wild species and its domesticated counterpart. The authors identified a number of introgression events at different time periods, likely associated with the domestication process as well as identify a number of possible genomic targets of domestication.

AB  - An endangered species, Rhinogobius brunneus, lives in the shortest river leading to a deep inner bay, Uchiura Bay, Japan. To understand how to conserve its habitat, we surveyed the distribution and spawning grounds of R. brunneus at four sites. The distribution survey was carried out in July, August, and September 2017 by using a backpack electrofisher and dip nets. The spawning grounds were surveyed in May, June, and July 2018. We observed the presence or absence of egg clutches by turning over stones on the riverbed. As a result of the distribution survey, we caught 355 individuals of R. brunneus. As a result of the spawning grounds survey, we observed 24 egg clutches. Both the number of individuals and the egg clutch densities of R. brunneus were the largest at survey site 2 (70-110 m from the river mouth). R. brunneus is presumed to have similar habitats and spawning grounds, allowing them to inhabit even the shortest rivers with minimal living space. Additionally, because R. brunneus inhabits the shortest river leading to a deep inner bay in the Japan Sea, it is estimated that the water temperature of the sea where the larvae of R. brunneus descend during May-July is approx. more than 20 & DEG;C.

AB  - Simple Summary Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly prevalent disease in wild boar from Southwestern Spain, which in turn plays a key role in the maintenance of TB prevalence in bovine and other sympatric species. The severity of TB lesions in wild boar may be triggered by coinfections with pathogens like Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV2) or Metastrongylus spp. In fact, measures focused on the control of these pathogens (such as vaccination against PCV2 and reiterative ivermectin treatments) have proven to be effective in reducing the severity of TB in wild boar. This study aimed to assess whether a combination of deworming treatments and vaccination against PCV2 improves TB development in wild boar. The results confirmed that PCV2-vaccinated animals showed lower probabilities of suffering severe TB lesions. However, the obtained data suggest that annual deworming is not sufficient to produce a long-term parasitological load reduction that is able to influence the development of TB in wild boar, nor does it improve the effect of PCV2 vaccination on this disease. The combination of both treatments did not improve the results compared to PVC2 vaccination alone.Abstract Vaccination against PCV2 has been proven to be an effective measure to reduce the severity of TB in wild boar. The combination of this measure with strategies focused on treating other key concomitant pathogens, such as nematodes, could be a useful strategy. This study assesses whether a combination of deworming treatments and PCV2 vaccination may reduce the prevalence and severity of TB in wild boar. The study was conducted on five game estates in mid-western Spain where four groups of wild boar were produced: control, vaccinated, dewormed and vaccinated-dewormed. Wild boars from all groups were hunted between 2017 and 2020, and all of them received a TB diagnosis based on pathological and microbiological tests. Generalised linear models were used to explore the effect of deworming and PCV2 vaccination on TB prevalence and severity. PCV2-vaccinated animals showed lower probabilities of suffering severe TB lesions. However, no differences regarding TB severity were found between dewormed and non-dewormed wild boar. PCV2 vaccination reduces TB severity in wild boar. However, annual deworming does not produce a long-term parasitological reduction that can influence the development of TB in wild boar, nor does it improve the effect of PCV2 vaccination on TB.

AB  - The common chimpanzee Pan troglodytes is the closest extant relative of modern humans and is often used as a model organism to help understand prehistoric human behavior and ecology. Originally presumed herbivorous, chimpanzees have been observed hunting 24 species of birds, ungulates, rodents, and other primates, using an array of techniques from tools to group cooperation. Using the literature on chimpanzee hunting behavior and diet from 13 studies, we aimed to determine the prey preferences of chimpanzees. We extracted data on prey-specific variables such as targeted species, their body weight, and their abundance within the prey community, and hunter-specific variables such as hunting method, and chimpanzee group size and sex ratio. We used these data in a generalized linear model to determine what factors drive chimpanzee prey preference. We calculated a Jacobs' index value for each prey species killed at two sites in Uganda and two sites in Tanzania. Chimpanzees prefer prey with a body weight of 7.6 +/- 0.4 kg or less, which corresponds to animals such as juvenile bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) and adult ashy red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus tephrosceles). Sex ratio in chimpanzee groups is a main driver in developing these preferences, where chimpanzees increasingly prefer prey when in proportionally male-dominated groups. Prey preference information from chimpanzee research can assist conservation management programs by identifying key prey species to manage, as well as contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of human hunting behavior.

AB  - In quadrupeds, limb bones are strongly affected by functional constraints linked to weight support, but few studies have addressed the complementary effects of mass, size and body proportions on limb bone shape. During their history, Rhinocerotoidea have displayed a great diversity of body masses and relative size and proportions of limb bones, from small tapir-like forms to giant species. Here, we explore the evolutionary variation of shapes in forelimb bones and its relationship with body mass in Rhinocerotoidea. Our results indicate a general increase in robustness and greater development of muscular insertions in heavier species, counteracting the higher weight loadings induced by an increased body mass. The shape of the humerus changes allometrically and exhibits a strong phylogenetic signal. Shapes of the radius and ulna display a stronger link with body mass repartition than with the absolute mass itself. Congruent shape variation between the humerus and the proximal part of the ulna suggests that the elbow joint is comprised of two strongly covariant structures. In addition, our work confirms the uniqueness of giant Paraceratheriidae among Rhinocerotoidea, whose shape variation is related to both a high body mass and a cursorial forelimb construction.

AB  - This study assessed the influence of a 2014 United States of America (USA) imposed ban on the importation of elephant (Loxodonta africana) hunted trophies from Zimbabwe on the hunting patterns (i.e., elephant quota allocation, utilisation and hunter's or client country of origin dynamics) in Matetsi Hunting Complex. The study was divided into two period, i.e., pre-ban (2008-2013) and post-ban (2014-2017). Although the study results showed a non-significant quota allocation variation difference between the pre-ban and post-ban periods, there was however, a significant decline in quota utilisation in post-ban period compared to the pre-ban period. Accordingly, a significant decline in US hunters or clients was recorded in the post-ban period. It is concluded that trophy hunting and trade bans by some global north countries without an alternative global conservation framework that provides conservation incentives will likely reverse the gains in wildlife conservation and rural development in some global south countries where sustainable utilisation is an integral part of the wildlife conservation practice.

AB  - Key messageAerial application of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner var. kurstaki (Btk) every second year to stands of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench)Voss.), black spruce (Picea mariana Mill.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) is the most cost-effective spraying scenario for reducing the impact of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens) on wood production, providing a similar level of forest protection, but at lower cost, to the standard scenario currently used in which 50% of current year's foliage is protected every year. ContextInsect outbreaks can have significant effects on forest productivity and various formulations of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner var. kurstaki (Btk) are used to reduce their damage. In the Province of Qu & eacute;bec, Canada, control programs aim to protect at least 50% of current-year foliage to limit tree mortality, but little information exists on the long-term cost-effectiveness of such programs. AimsOur goal was to evaluate the benefit/cost ratio and the efficacy of different Btk protection scenarios in reducing coniferous tree mortality and growth losses over a 11-year period. We hypothesized that less-intensive protection approaches (Btk applications every 2 or 3 years) may provide similar levels of protection but with higher cost-effectiveness ratios than the standard program currently used in Quebec. MethodsIn 2007, we established nineteen 100-ha experimental units in Quebec's C & ocirc;te-Nord region to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of different Btk spraying scenarios for reducing tree mortality and volume losses in coniferous stands dominated by mature balsam fir trees (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., with white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss.) and black spruce (P. mariana Mill.) as companion species. Tree mortality was monitored annually in three circular plots of 400 m2 within each experimental unit. Growth losses were evaluated using stem analyses. ResultsMortality was much higher in balsam fir than in black spruce and white spruce (respectively 74.4%, 13.8% and 5.9% in untreated stands) in all protection scenarios. The application of Btk every 2 years reduced balsam fir mortality to a level similar to the standard scenario (10.3% vs 7.15%, respectively) at a much lower cost. Growth losses have also been reduced but not to the same extent as in the standard scenario. ConclusionSpraying Btk every 2 years provides effective protection to balsam fir and is the most cost-effective scenario. A less intensive use of Btk would mitigate impact on non-target lepidoptera and allow protecting other areas, such as habitat of the woodland caribou, a threatened species which avoids disturbed areas.

AB  - This study assessed the diet composition of Salt's dik-dik (Madoqua saltiana) in Awash National Park and is aimed at identifying the forage species and analyzing their contributions to the respective forage categories (grass or browse). Feeding duration records, coupled with quadrat surveys, were used to evaluate the dietary contributions and acceptability of the plants. Twenty plant species were found to be consumed by the animal; however, only 16 species were recorded during the dry season. The three staple plants were Acacia senegal (41.3%), Acacia mellifera (20.5%), and Balanites aegyptiaca (12.7%), and these species constituted 74.4% of the dik-diks' diet. Between the wet and dry seasons, a similar dietary proportion was found for A. senegal, while significant variations were observed for both A. mellifera and B. aegyptiaca. From the forage categories, browse constituted the major proportion of the diet both during the wet (91.9%) and dry (93.3%) seasons, while plant litter, herbs, and grass constituted the remainder. Acceptability index analysis showed that A. mellifera was highly acceptable during the wet season followed by A. senegal. However, during the dry season, A. senegal was the most accepted plant followed by B. aegyptiaca and A. mellifera.

AB  - The first parity, or first pregnancy, of ruminant females has negative effects on offspring during fetal, perinatal, and pre-weaning periods which ultimately lead to diminished pre-weaning productivity. Offspring born to primiparous ruminant females can have decreased fetal and preweaning growth, resulting in lower body weights at birth and weaning in cattle, sheep, and goats. Moreover, mortality is greater during both neonatal and pre-weaning periods. Insults during these critical developmental windows likely also have long-term consequences on firstparity offspring through developmental programming, but less research has been done to investigate effects in the post-weaning period. Many potential physiological, metabolic, and behavioral mechanisms exist for the outcomes of dam primiparity. Although competition for nutrient partitioning between maternal and fetal growth or lactation is often cited as a major contributor, we hypothesize that the most important mechanism causing most first-parity outcomes is the relative physiological inexperience of reproductive tissues such as the uterus and mammary gland during the first pregnancy and lactation, or a "first use theory" of tissues. More research is necessary to explore these areas, as well as if primiparous dams respond differently to stressors than multiparous dams, and if stress during the first parity affects subsequent parities.

AB  - High throughput sequencing of gut microbiota helps to understand the nutrition and health of the host. In this sense, it is an important tool for improving wildlife conservation and management. Little is known about the microbial communities occupying the gastrointestinal tract and the differences of microbiota among primate species. We conducted a microbiome study of the gastrointestinal tract in golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellanae), green monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus), and ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), using the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The gastrointestinal tract of all three primates were characterized by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, although the relative abundance of these taxa differed across non-human primate species and gastrointestinal segments. In addition, the stomach of the golden monkey demonstrated a strong signal of microbial metabolic activity, especially in metabolizing carbohydrate. Prevotella multisaccharivorax and Selenomonas bovis were the main contributors to the function, and the enzymes involved in these metabolic activities were mainly derived from the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family. Microbial composition and function vary widely across non-human primate species and gastrointestinal segments. Therefore, while faecal samples are necessary for studying many mammals, particularly in the wild, data from the gastrointestinal tract have the potential to greatly improve our knowledge of host-gut microbe interactions. This information can contribute to the development of conservation interventions and animal care protocols in the wild and captivity to more fully describe a species' nutritional needs and advance health and survival.

AB  - The seahorse is a typical suction feeder with an elongated, tubular snout and a small terminal mouth. It is important to determine the details of this unique prey-capture behavior to improve the survival rate during seahorse breeding, especially for juveniles. In this study, we described the sucking process and characterized the kinematics in juvenile lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) at different ages (1-30 days after parturition; DAP) using a high-speed video system, and also investigated the histological basis of the feeding-related organs, including snout, eye, and intestine. The sucking of juvenile seahorses can be divided into four steps: searching, locating, capturing, and swallowing. Seahorses capture prey mainly based on the vision system, and histological results revealed a developed visual acuity in the newborn seahorses, so that they were able to prey once after releasing from the male seahorse's brood pouch. The attack distance, maximum snout width, capture success rate, and daily food intake of juvenile seahorses increased with maturation. A remarkable inflection point, in the snout expansion rate, successful predation rate, and growth rate, occurs at about 10 DAP, when calcification of the snout bones was completed. In addition, the intestines of newborn seahorses were short and quite simple, but developed rapidly during the first 20 DAP. These findings provide a better understanding of prey capture kinematics and nutritional physiology, and will be beneficial for improving the feeding strategies for juveniles during large seahorse breeding.

AB  - The fallow deer (Dama dama) represents a typical example of a species in the early stage of domestication, where selection for tameness is not yet complete. In contrast to fully domesticated species, there is still a lack of studies on the behaviour of deer under farm conditions and their response to changes in their environment. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the behaviour of fallow deer after the introduction of the novel object (NO) into the enclosure. The herd was observed at the most frequently visited part of the enclosure, i.e. the foraging area near the feeding station. We installed several different Non-animal NOs (abstract object/installation, camping chair, colourful boxes) and Animal NO (animal-shaped toy) with intervening Controls (periods without NO). Results generally showed that time spent at the foraging area decreased in the presence of NO (p < 0.05). This effect was significantly stronger when NO had an animal shape (horse-shaped toy), with the frequency of animal appearance also being lower with frequent complete absence of animals at the foraging area. However, diurnal rhythm of animal appearance did not differ, nor did group size. When looking at the ratio among different behaviours that animals performed in the foraging area (movement, stationary, feeding), we found no differences between the Control and Non-animal NO (feeding 42-43 %, stationary 38-39 %). However, in the presence of Animal NO, feeding behaviours increased significantly (57 %), while the stationary behaviours decreased significantly (24 %). While resting predominated among stationary behaviours in the Control and Non-animal NO treatments (72-75 %), vigilance represented the most stationary behaviours in the presence of Animal NO (58 %). Movement was consistently performed to the same extent (18-20 %). Therefore, the presence of the novel object reduced foraging activity and increased vigilance in fallow deer, and deer breeders should consider this. Avoidance of the foraging area within the enclosure, where animals have fewer alternative food sources, can be particularly problematic. Therefore, preventing or disturbing their regular foraging routine should be minimized to meet basic welfare requirements.

AB  - Simple Summary During the antler-growing period, sika deer (Cervus nippon) need a large amount of protein from feed for rapid antler growth. Antlers are the most important economic product of sika deer. Methionine is the first or second limiting amino acid in the diets of sika deer, which greatly limits the effective utilization of protein in the feed, while methionine has biological functions such as antioxidant and immune function improvement. In this study, we evaluated for the first time the effect of methionine supplementation in the diet on antler-growing sika deer and tried to investigate the changes in rumen microorganisms and obtain better production efficiency through methionine regulation. The results showed that supplementation with appropriate methionine improved the antioxidant and immune function of the sika deer, while obtaining better antler weight. Methionine is the first or second limiting amino acid for ruminants, such as sika deer, and has a variety of biological functions such as antioxidant activity, immune response, and protein synthesis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of methionine supplementation on antler growth, serum biochemistry, rumen fermentation, and the bacterial community of sika deer during the antler-growing period. Twelve 4-year-old male sika deer were randomly assigned to three dietary groups supplemented with 0 g/day (n = 4, CON), 4.0 g/day (n = 4, LMet), and 6.0 g/day (n = 4, HMet) methionine. No significant difference (p > 0.05) was found in the production performance between the three groups, but antler weight was higher in both the LMet and HMet groups than in the CON group. Methionine supplementation significantly increased the serum glutathione peroxidase activity (p < 0.05). The serum immunoglobulin G level was significantly higher in the HMet group than in the other two groups (p < 0.05). No significant effect was found on the apparent amino acid digestibility of the three groups, but cysteine and methionine digestibility were higher in the LMet group. The serum hydroxylysine level was significantly lower in the LMet and HMet groups, whereas the serum lysine level was significantly lower in the HMet group compared with the CON group (p < 0.05). The LMet group had the highest but a nonsignificant total volatile fatty acid content and significantly higher microbial protein content in the rumen than the CON group (p < 0.05). The phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were dominant in the rumen of the sika deer. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) results showed a significant change in the bacterial composition of the three groups (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Prevotella and Rikenellaceae-RC9 was significantly higher in the LMet group compared with the CON group and CON and HMet groups, respectively. These results revealed that methionine supplementation improved the antioxidant activity and immune status, affecting amino acid metabolism and rumen microbial composition of the sika deer.

AB  - Spodoptera frugiperda is a highly polyphagous and invasive agricultural pest that can harm more than 300 plants and cause huge economic losses to crops. Symbiotic bacteria play an important role in the host biology and ecology of herbivores, and have a wide range of effects on host growth and adaptation. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to investigate the effects of different hosts (corn, wild oat, oilseed rape, pepper, and artificial diet) on gut microbial community structure and diversity. Corn is one of the most favored plants of S. frugiperda. We compared the gut microbiota on corn with and without a seed coating agent. The results showed that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes dominated the gut microbial community. The microbial abundance on oilseed rape was the highest, the microbial diversity on wild oat was the lowest, and the microbial diversity on corn without a seed coating agent was significantly higher than that with such an agent. PCoA analysis showed that there were significant differences in the gut microbial community among different hosts. PICRUSt analysis showed that most of the functional prediction categories were related to metabolic and cellular processes. The results showed that the gut microbial community of S. frugiperda was affected not only by the host species, but also by different host treatments, which played an important role in host adaptation. It is important to deepen our understanding of the symbiotic relationships between invasive organisms and microorganisms. The study of the adaptability of host insects contributes to the development of more effective and environmentally friendly pest management strategies.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the spatial distribution and seasonal variability of zooplankton, mainly copepod groups, along the Beagle Channel (BC), an interoceanic passage at the southernmost tip of South America. We focused on the Argentine part of the BC, which comprises an inner sector under a strong continental influence and an outer sector influenced by offshore sub-Antarctic waters, separated by the narrow Mackinlay Strait. We analyzed zooplankton samples collected with 67 mu m- and 200 mu m-mesh nets in the inner and outer sectors of the BC during different seasons from 2014 to 2018, along with oceanographic parameters, total chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration, and microbial community composition. Results showed a seasonal pattern, where zooplankton abundance was highest during spring and summer, with the largest-sized calanoid copepods being dominant in the inner sector in spring and in the outer sector in summer, and lowest in autumn and winter, small calanoid copepods being dominant in winter. Calanoid and cyclopoid copepodites and copepod nauplii were more abundant in spring and summer than in the other seasons. Conversely, adults of both groups were predominant in autumn and winter. The variables that better explained the abundance of the main copepod groups were Chl a concentration, picoeukaryotes abundance, and, to a lesser extent, water column stratification. Our findings suggest the existence of two seasonal patterns in the mid-eastern BC: a classical herbivore food web in springsummer under high phytoplankton biomass, where the presence of larger copepods is associated with higher trophic levels, and a microbial food web in autumn-winter, with low phytoplankton biomass, characterized by great dominance of picoplankton that supports the grazing of the smallest copepods.

AB  - Featured Application The present work envisages the valorization of cheese whey concentrated by ultrafiltration as the main ingredient of frozen yoghurts. The objective of this work was the use of goat and sheep liquid whey concentrates (LWCs) produced by ultrafiltration (UF) for the manufacturing of frozen yoghurts. In a first step, natural yoghurts using only goat's and sheep's LWCs as raw material were obtained. One day after production, these yoghurts were used to produce frozen yoghurts with different concentrations of added inulin. The physicochemical characteristics of ewe's and goat's yoghurts were significantly different regarding dry matter, protein, fat and minerals. Ewe's yoghurts were solid, while goat's yoghurts behaved as a viscous liquid. Frozen yoghurts with different levels of inulin addition also presented significant differences concerning physicochemical and microbiological characteristics. Overrun was similar for all formulations except for that produced with ewe's LWC containing 5.0% inulin, which presented a significantly higher value. Higher meltdown rates in goat's frozen yoghurts were observed. The survival rates of lactic acid bacteria were lower than the data reported for similar products. Concerning sensory acceptance, both products showed encouraging results. It can be considered that the production of frozen yoghurts by using LWCs as the main ingredient can be an interesting option to broaden the product portfolio of small/medium scale dairy producers.

AB  - Selecting appropriate candidates for genetic rescue mostly relies on previous genetic research and monitoring, while ecological and behavioural traits of the remnant and source populations are rarely considered for such conservation measures. Because of their slow recovery, Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx populations in Central and Western Europe have been a repeated target of genetic reinforcements and reintroductions in the past 50 years. Once inhabiting much of south-eastern Europe, the Balkan lynx L. l. balcanicus is now critically endangered and confined to a small population. Long-term isolation has caused loss of genetic diversity and has possibly led to inbreeding depression. Immediate actions need to consider genetic reinforcement to increase the genetic diversity and secure population viability. Here, we compared the Balkan lynx with two neighbouring populations: Dinaric population originating from the Carpathian subspecies (L.l. carpathicus) and Anatolian population of Caucasian subspecies (L.l. dinniki) to determine is better suited source from an ecological standpoint. Main findings suggest that the L.l. carpathicus is ecologically more similar to the L.l. balcanicus and therefore likely better suited for the environment of south-western Balkans on the basis of prey preference (roe deer being the main prey), local prey availability (lower lagomorph and higher ungulate availability) and habitat use (predominant use of the mixed and broadleaved forests). We discuss the contrasting results of genetic and ecological analyses from both the evolutionary and conservation perspective and provide potential solutions that would take into account both aspects to pave the road towards potential genetic rescue of the Balkan lynx.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever (ASF) has been present in Poland since 2014. The article describes and explains the changes in the ASF epidemic in the wild boar population in the period 2014-2020. In that relatively short time, the disease has spread to about half of the territory of Poland, affecting eastern and western provinces. Most ASF-positive animals were molecular/virus-positive, however, the observation of the increase of serologically positive animals (potential survivors) in successive years of the epidemic, especially in areas where the virus has been present for a longer time, may indicate the potential beginning of ASF endemicity in Poland. African swine fever (ASF) is a lethal hemorrhagic disease of Suidae, i.e., domestic pigs and wild boars. The disease was introduced to Poland in 2014 and is now present in the wild boar population. Appropriate ASF prevention requires further research for answers to fundamental questions about the importance of vectors in virus transmission, the impact of environmental factors on the presence of ASFV in wild boar habitats, and the role of survivors as potential virus carriers and their part in the potential endemicity of ASF. In order to analyze the changes in the molecular and serological prevalence of ASFV in wild boar population in Poland, real-time PCR and ELISA/IPT tests were conducted. In the analyzed period (2014-2020), most of the ASF-positive wild boars were molecular/virus-positive, however, over the years the percentage and the number of seropositive animals has increased. At the beginning of the epidemic, the disease was limited to a small area of the country. Since then, it has spread to new provinces of Poland. From the beginning and until today, most notifications of ASF-positive wild boars were for carcasses (passive surveillance), however, the number of serologically positive animals is still increasing. Despite the fact that notifications of ASF outbreaks are still being received near the eastern border of Poland, the old ASF area seems to be limited mainly to ASF serologically positive animals, which may indicate the beginning of ASF endemicity in Poland.

AB  - Megafauna paintings have accompanied the earliest archaeological contexts across the continents, revealing a fundamental inter-relationship between early humans and megafauna during the global human expansion as unfamiliar landscapes were humanized and identities built into new territories. However, the identification of extinct megafauna from rock art is controversial. Here, we examine potential megafauna depictions in the rock art of Serrania de la Lindosa, Colombian Amazon, that includes a giant sloth, a gomphothere, a camelid, horses and three-toed ungulates with trunks. We argue that they are Ice Age rock art based on the (i) naturalistic appearance and diagnostic morphological features of the animal images, (ii) late Pleistocene archaeological dates from La Lindosa confirming the contemporaneity of humans and megafauna, (iii) recovery of ochre pigments in late Pleistocene archaeological strata, (iv) the presence of most megafauna identified in the region during the late Pleistocene as attested by archaeological and palaeontological records, and (v) widespread depiction of extinct megafauna in rock art across the Americas. Our findings contribute to the emerging picture of considerable geographical and stylistic variation of geometric and figurative rock art from early human occupations across South America. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the early human history of tropical South America. This article is part of the theme issue 'Tropical forests in the deep human past'.

TI  - Predation of a Juvenile Iguana rhinolopha (Squamata: Iguanidae) by Basiliscus plumifrons (Squamata: Corytophanidae) in the Costa Rican Rainforest
T2  - CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Lizards play key roles in ecosystems where they are prey for a wide variety of predators, including snakes, other lizards, mammals, birds, and invertebrates. The Green Basilisk (Basiliscus plumifrons; Squamata: Iguania: Corytophanidae) and the Green Iguana (Iguana rhinolopha; Squamata: Iguania: Iguanidae) are two large lizards usually found sympatrically in the lowland humid forests of Central America, and show the same diurnal, arboreal habits; both species are found near bodies of water. Male Green Iguanas can reach two meters in length; females up to 1.4 m. This species possesses a notable crest of comb-like spines along the neck, back, and tail, and a greatly enlarged smooth scale on the side of the throat. It is green, particularly so the juvenile individuals, and they commonly develop darker wavy transverse dorsal crossbands. The Green Basilisk can exceed 0.9 m in total length, although females are shorter. The coloration is emerald green with strikingly yellow eyes and conspicuous crests are present on the head, dorsum, and tail. This species feeds mainly on insects and other arthropods, but it also consumes flowers and fruits and occasionally eats vertebrates such as small lizards. On July 11, 2022 at 09:36 h we observed an adult Green Basilisk preying on a young Green Iguana at Selva Verde Lodge, located in tropical wet forest in northern Costa Rica. Herein, we present the details of this event in the context of lizard predatory encounters.

AB  - Theoretical models on mutualism dynamics predict that partner traits may influence the outcome of mutualistic interactions. However, most empirical data on this issue is restricted to case studies, limiting our ability to reach a more widespread comprehension of the role of partner traits on the dynamic of mutualisms. We investigated how the outcome of protective mutualisms between ants and plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) is influenced by the traits of EFNs and ants feeding on EFNs. We used a meta-analytical approach based on 35 studies investigating the effect of ant attendance on the herbivores and reproductive performance of EFN-bearing plants. We evaluated how variation in the EFN vascularization and location on plants and the ant aggressiveness can modulate the effect of ant attendance on the plants. Both plant and ant traits investigated here drove the outcome of the protective mutualism for EFN-bearing plants. Plants exclusively bearing EFNs near reproductive organs benefited more from ant attendance than plants bearing EFNs on vegetative or vegetative and reproductive organs. Ants had a higher positive impact on the reproductive performance of plants bearing non-vascularized EFNs than plants bearing vascularized EFNs, although their effects on herbivores had been similar in both plant types. Regarding the ant behaviour, plants often attended by more aggressive ant species had a higher reproductive performance than plants often attended by less aggressive ones. Synthesis. Our results highlight that the selective pressures and evolutionary routes in ant-plant protective mutualisms may depend on the pool of traits exhibited by partner species. Although some studies have already reported some impact of species traits on the outcome of ant-plant mutualisms, this is the first time that a generalization about the role of species traits on the net balance of ant attendance was proposed. Due to this generalization, it was possible to advance our knowledge about the evolution of facultative mutualisms by showing that the role of species traits on the mutualistic outcome can vary in intricate ways due to a particular trait combination found among partners in communities where the interactions are embedded in.

AB  - In mammals, human-animal bonding is recognized as a source of positive affect for companion or farm animals. Because this remains unexplored in birds, we investigated captive parrots' perspective of the human-animal relationship. We used a classical separation-reunion paradigm and predicted that variations in parrots' facial displays and behaviours would indicate their appraisal of the relationship. The test was divided into three phases of two minutes each: the bird was placed in an unfamiliar environment with a familiar caregiver (union), then the bird was left alone (separation) and finally, the caregiver returned (reunion). The test was repeated 10 times for each bird and video recorded in order to analyze their behaviour. The data show significantly higher crown and nape feather heights, higher redness of the skin and higher frequency of contact-seeking behaviours during the union and reunion phases than during the separation phase during which they expressed long distance contact calls. We observed the expression of eye pinning during the union and reunion phases in one out of five macaws. We argue that variation in facial displays provides indicators of parrot's positive appraisal of the caretaker presence. Our results broaden the scope for further studies on parrots' expression of their subjective feelings.

AB  - Background Dinosaurs dominated terrestrial environments for over 100 million years due in part to innovative feeding strategies. Although a range of dental adaptations was present in Late Jurassic dinosaurs, it is unclear whether dinosaur ecosystems exhibited patterns of tooth disparity and dietary correlation similar to those of modern amniotes, in which carnivores possess simple teeth and herbivores exhibit complex dentitions. To investigate these patterns, we quantified dental shape in Late Jurassic dinosaurs to test relationships between diet and dental complexity. Results Here, we show that Late Jurassic dinosaurs exhibited a disparity of dental complexities on par with those of modern saurians. Theropods possess relatively simple teeth, in spite of the range of morphologies tested, and is consistent with their inferred carnivorous habits. Ornithischians, in contrast, have complex dentitions, corresponding to herbivorous habits. The dentitions of macronarian sauropods are similar to some ornithischians and living herbivorous squamates but slightly more complex than other sauropods. In particular, all diplodocoid sauropods investigated possess remarkably simple teeth. The existence of simple teeth in diplodocoids, however, contrasts with the pattern observed in nearly all known herbivores (living or extinct). Conclusions Sauropod dinosaurs exhibit a novel approach to herbivory not yet observed in other amniotes. We demonstrate that sauropod tooth complexity is related to tooth replacement rate rather than diet, which contrasts with the results from mammals and saurians. This relationship is unique to the sauropod clade, with ornithischians and theropods displaying the patterns observed in other groups. The decoupling of herbivory and tooth complexity paired with a correlation between complexity and replacement rate demonstrates a novel evolutionary strategy for plant consumption in sauropod dinosaurs.

AB  - Simple Summary Recently, the escalating prices of feedstuff resources have posed significant challenges to animal husbandry, necessitating the creation of innovative approaches to mitigate its effects. GAA (also known as N-amidinoglycine) serves as the sole precursor for creatine synthesis. GAA could enhance growth performance and regulate fat deposition to improve meat quality. Current studies on GAA mainly center on pigs and chickens, with limited reports on its effects on sheep. In our study, we used weaned Hu sheep as subjects. We aimed to explore the impact of dietary GAA supplementation on production performance, serum biochemistry, meat quality and rumen fermentation. This study provides a theoretical foundation for utilizing GAA in sheep meat production. Our findings indicate that GAA enhances growth performance, rumen fermentation and fat accumulation. In addition, GAA might enhance the quality of sheep meat, which presents a promising prospect for meat sheep breeding.Abstract Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) can effectively improve the metabolism of energy and proteins by stimulating creatine biosynthesis. We present a study exploring the impact of GAA on production performance, serum biochemistry, meat quality and rumen fermentation in Hu sheep. A total of 144 weaned male Hu sheep (body weight 16.91 +/- 3.1 kg) were randomly assigned to four groups with three replicates of twelve sheep in each group. The diets were supplemented with 0 (CON), 500 (GAA-1), 750 (GAA-2) and 1000 mg/kg (GAA-3) of GAA (weight of feed), respectively. After a comprehensive 90-day experimental period, we discovered that the supplementation of GAA had a remarkable impact on various muscle parameters. Specifically, it significantly enhanced the average daily growth (ADG) of the animals and improved the shear force and fiber diameter of the muscle, while also reducing the drip loss and muscle fiber density. Furthermore, the addition of GAA to the feed notably elevated the serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total protein (TP) and globulin (GLB), as well as the enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Concurrently, there was a decrease in the levels of triglycerides (TG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the serum. In addition, GAA decreased the pH and the acetate-to-propionate ratio and increased the total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) and ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N) levels of rumen fluid. Additionally, GAA upregulated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) gene expression in the Hu sheep's muscles. In conclusion, our findings suggest that GAA supplementation not only enhances muscle quality but also positively affects serum biochemistry and ruminal metabolism, making it a potential candidate for improving the overall health and performance of Hu sheep.

AB  - Benthic foraminiferal morphogroups near the Permian Guadalupian-Lopingian (GLB) reveal their responses to palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological changes in the eastern Sichuan Basin, China. According to the shell forms, coiling modes, and life positions linked to the life styles and feeding strategies, seven types of benthic foraminiferal morphogroups were recognized in Guadalupian and lower Wuchiapingian carbonate rocks from four lithological profiles. During the Guadalupian Epoch, highly diversified and large number of benthic foraminifera and their various feeding strategies indicated sufficient trophic resources for food. However, the foraminiferal assemblages dropped dramatically after the end-Guadalupian extinction event, reflecting remarkable changes in the nutrient sources and oxygen conditions in the ocean. In the early Wuchiapingian Epoch, nutrient input and plant debris decreased rapidly, while terrigenous detritus increased. As a result, the number of herbivores significantly declined, and suspension feeders and detritivores dominated. Changes in foraminiferal morphogroups in the eastern Sichuan Basin confirmed the existence of a end-Guadalupian extinction event. Surviving benthic foraminifera in Wuchiapiangian, such as Codonofusiella and Eotuberitina, prefer epiphytism, multiple feeding strategies, and low oxygen concentrations, which helped them sustain in a severe ecological environment. The dominant Wuchiapingian foraminifera has changed to other genera, which had to alter their living habits by enlarging the bottom contact area to resist waves and expanding semi-shells to increase feeding capacity. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages from adjacent regions (south China, Tibet, Iran, and Greece) were consistent with our investigation of the morphogroups and showed a similar response to the endGuadalupian extinction event.

AB  - Wild ungulates are expanding in range and number worldwide leading to an urgent need to manage their populations to minimize conflicts and promote coexistence with humans. In the metropolitan area of Barcelona (MAB), wild boar is the main wildlife species causing a nuisance, from traffic accidents to health risks. Selective harvesting of specific sex and age classes and reducing anthropogenic food resources would be the most efficient approach to dealing with overpopulation. Nonetheless, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the age and sex selectivity of the capture methods currently applied in the MAB for wild boar population control. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the performance and age and sex bias of different hunting and capture methods and the seasonal patterns in their performance (number of captured individuals per event). From February 2014 to August 2022, 1454 wild boars were captured in the MAB using drop net, teleanaesthesia, cage traps, night stalks, and drive hunting. We applied generalized linear models (GLM) to compare the performance of these methods for the total number of wild boars, the wild boars belonging to each age category (i.e., adult, yearling, and juvenile), and for each season. The studied capture methods showed age -class bias and sex bias in adults ( >2 years). Drive hunting and drop net removed mainly adult females and yearlings (1 - 2 years), with drive hunting having the highest performance for adult males. Instead, cage traps and drop net were the best methods to capture juveniles ( <1 year). Overall, global performance was higher in summer, decreasingly followed by autumn and spring, winter being the worst performing season. Wildlife managers and researchers should consider the different performance and sex and age bias of each hunting and capture method, as well as the associated public cost, to improve efficiency and achieve the best results in wild boar population management.

AB  - The genus Noctiliostrebla Wenzel (Diptera: Streblidae) stands out for its high degree of specificity exhibited in relation to bat species of the genus Noctilio Linnaeus and provides an exciting system for understanding the history behind host-parasite associations. Here, we present a phylogeny of Noctiliostrebla based on an analysis of DNA sequences and morphological characters, along with cophylogenetic and biogeographical analyses. Our results strongly support the monophyly of Noctiliostrebla, but with uncertainties within the genus. With a low frequency of cospeciation events explaining the associations between hosts and parasites, cophylogenetic analyses did not show an overall congruence between the host and parasite phylogenies. Indeed, two parallel histories were recovered in the host-parasite associations, which might indicate that niche segregation is determined evolutionarily, facilitating the coexistence of parasites and promoting diversification. Biogeographical analysis showed a strong spatial congruence between disjunct distributions of Noctiliostrebla and major river basins in South America and with areas of higher elevation, which might be associated with the glacial periods throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene. Overall, our findings suggest an agreement with the expectations of the 'Stockholm paradigm' framework, in which biogeographical events and ecological factors act as important components to explain the associations, instead of cospeciation events.

AB  - Regenerative Rangeland Management (RRM) is emerging as one of the most promising approaches to achieving sustainability of animal production at economic, social and environmental levels. The current bottleneck in RRM is a slow adoption rate, as the farmers' views are still poorly studied and considered. We conducted individual surveys with 33 Spanish RRM farmers that collected multiple variables regarding general characteristics of farms, productive parameters, rangeland management and opinions around perceptions. We performed associative tests in order to detect the most important drivers of economic profitability and personal satisfaction. Among a wide diversity of farms, we found no features or management types associated with higher profitability, but rather a link to the level of intensification and degree of experience. About 93% of the farmers were mostly satisfied with RRM, even though they face difficulties - highlighting bureaucratic ones. To overcome such hurdles, we encourage improving the dialogue between farmers, researchers and institutions. This is the first state-level study on RRM in Spain, and one of the first analyses collecting farmers' perceptions on this topic.

AB  - Simple Summary
   We tested whether the milk yield capacity and composition of mixed-breed goats on rangeland in northern Mexico during the dry season affects body weight gain and weaning weight of their progeny. Maternal body weight positively influenced milk yield and milk components (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). Lactose and solids-non-fat content of milk differed (p < 0.05) between goats with different milk yield capacity, whereas milk protein content tended to differ (p = 0.08) and milk fat content did not (p > 0.05). Milk yield and composition throughout 105-d lactation did not influence body weight gain and weaning weight of the offspring.
   We tested whether the milk yield capacity of mixed-breed goats on a Chihuahuan desert rangeland in northern Mexico during the dry season affects milk composition, body weight gain, and weaning weight of their progeny. Milk yield and composition, and progeny postnatal growth performance, were recorded weekly. One week after kidding, mixed-breed goats (a mixture of Criollo x dairy breeds; n = 40) were allotted into medium (MP) or low (LP) milk yielding groups (20 goats per group). Mean 105-d total milk yield for MP and LP goats was 45.2 +/- 12.5 and 20.7 +/- 5.2 L, respectively. Milk lactose (4.3 vs. 4.2%) and solids-non-fat (SNF; 8.2 vs. 8.0) differed (p < 0.05) between MP and LP goats; milk protein content tended to differ (p = 0.08) between MP and LP goats with no difference for milk fat content (p > 0.05). Maternal body weight was positively associated with milk yield, milk lactose, and SNF content (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). Goats giving birth to males produce more milk than goats giving birth to females, but milk fat percentage was higher in goats bearing females (p < 0.001). Milk yield and composition throughout lactation did not influence body weight gain (47.8 vs. 48.7 g/day for kids from MP and LP goats) and weaning weight (6.7 vs. 6.7 kg from MP and LP goats) of the offspring (p > 0.05). Birth weight and weaning weight of the progeny were positively related to maternal body weight (p <= 0.05). The postnatal growth of the kids was reduced, extending the time to reach market weight. Nevertheless, non-supplemented mixed-breed goats reared on semi-arid rangeland of northern Mexico have the potential for moderate milk production. Therefore, due to the limited nutrients ingested by grazing goats during the dry season, a nutritional supplement is necessary to keep up milk production and adequate growth of kids.

AB  - Simple Summary The ruminant microbiome is considered a specific ecosystem found within the gastrointestinal tract. A balanced intestinal microbiota is important not only for maintaining gut homeostasis, but also for regulating immune function and has a direct impact on the gut-brain axis. Factors, such as pregnancy, age, or genetics, can influence the microbial composition of the digestive system. The results of the study suggest that the parity, as well as the age of the animals, may affect the level of microorganisms in the digestive system. During pregnancy and parturition, the homeostasis of the body is disturbed, and the immune system is undermined, which is associated with hormonal changes within the body. Recently, it has also been suggested that physiological and hormonal changes associated with pregnancy may affect the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the composition of the microbiome in the third month of pregnancy in sheep in their first and second parity. Eighteen females in total were selected for the experiment, and they were divided into two groups: primiparous (aged 1 year) and multiparous ones (aged 2 years). The animals were fed the same fodder, and did not show any disease symptoms. Fecal samples were collected individually from each female (n = 20), and then bacterial DNA isolation and real-time PCR were performed for the main bacterial phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria) and families (Lactobacillaceae and Clostridia). The obtained results showed the differentiation in the microbiome between the primiparous and multiparous ewes with respect to the following groups: Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria-the level was higher in the case of the primiparas. These results suggest that the parity and age of the females may affect the gastrointestinal microbiome, but further studies are recommended.

AB  - Predation by large predators on livestock is one of the main concerns in species conservation as it elicits prompt and effective retaliations. Therefore, conflict mitigation is essential to ensure long-term coexistence of predators with humans. We performed aversive conditioning (AC) with rubber bullets on one collared wolf that had become particularly bold toward a transhumant shepherd and had preyed on livestock. By exploiting the unique fine-resolution location data available before and after the AC event, alongside careful retrospective field investigations, we were able to analyse the effects of AC on wolf behaviour. Our study revealed that after just a single AC event, the wolf modified its spatial and predatory behaviour: the wolf changed its use of space by increasing distance from humans and ceased to attack farms in the following 2 months; actually, the only livestock preyed after AC was represented by a sheep and two goats lost by shepherds that had left alpine pastures. This study represents a first step to increase knowledge on AC effect on the wolf. Additional researchers are encouraged to conduct and publish findings on this topic in order to provide a useful and widely tested array of tools to promote wolf conservation in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - The fish incidence, particularly notothenioids and myctophids, in the diet of non-breeding male Arctocephalus gazella in the western Antarctic Peninsula (AP) region is widely variable according to the studied locality. We made a comparative diet analysis on 158 fecal samples collected in summer 2005 at Hope Bay (HB), AP and at Stranger Point (SP), South Shetland Islands (SSI). The frequency of occurrence of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and fish as prey was similar at HB, whereas krill was predominant at SP. For each fish species identified based on the otoliths found, their relative importance in the diet was evaluated using the IRI index. Notothenioid fish prevailed at HB, Pleuragramma antarctica being the most important prey. Contrarily, the myctophids Gymnoscopelus nicholsi and Electrona antarctica predominated at SP. Both benthopelagic and pelagic fish species were represented at HB, while the latter were more important at SP. Demersal nototheniid species (e.g., Trematomus spp.) were scarcely represented and only at HB, which might be related to a preference of fur seals for the more abundant pelagic prey there. At SP, demersal nototheniids were not represented in the scats. The fish species consumption was higher in diversity at SP in comparison with HB but low in overlap between the two sites. We surmise that the differences found in the dietary composition of fur seals from both sites could be related to 1-different topographical and hydrological conditions associated to the study areas; 2-historical finfish fisheries, which took place during the late 1970s at the SSI, but not in the AP. Our findings are compared with studies from other localities of the AP and the Scotia Arc.

AB  - The paracalanid copepod, Bestiolina amoyensis, is a widely distributed species occurring in subtropical inshore waters across the Pacific Ocean. Its small size, herbivorous feeding habit, and high adaptability make the species one of the most promising candidates as potential live feed for hatchery larval rearing. This study investigated effects of different feeding density of microalgae Isochrysis spp. (1 x 10(5), 2 x 10(5), 3 x 10(5), 4 x 10(5), and 5x 10(5) cells ml(-1)) and photoperiod (8L:16D, 12L:12D, and 16L:8D) on productivity-related parameters, including egg production, female life expectancy and population dynamics of B. amoyensis. Results showed that total egg output over female lifespan, final population size and intrinsic rate of population of 12L:12D photoperiod treatments were always the highest among three photoperiod conditions, especially at the food concentration of 4 x 10(5) cells ml(-1), indicating B. amoyensis had high reproductive performance and the population was in a more stable status. The number of nauplii from 4 x 10(5) cells ml(-1) algal concentration treatment accounted for 75% of the population, and the ratio of females to males approaching 1:1 when photoperiod was 12L:12D; female life expectancy was 10.5 x 0.6 days. In conclusion, our results showed that Isochrysis spp. is a suitable feed for B. amoyensis with an optimal concentration at 4 x 10(5) cells mL (-1); the optimal photoperiod for B. amoyensis rearing is 12L:12D. The relatively long reproductive lifespan and high intrinsic population increase rate make B. amoyensis a good candidate to develop culture techniques for hatchery larval rearing.

AB  - Environmental pollution is widespread and poses significant risks to both human populations and diverse animal species. As part of conservation initiatives, many endangered animals are housed in zoos and breeding centers close to human activities, potentially exposing them to health threats arising from environmental contamination, such as mercury (Hg). By analyzing non-invasive fecal samples from 13 Chinese zoos, we assessed total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) exposure in two non -human primate species: the endangered species golden snub-nosed monkey ( Rhinopithecus roxellana ), and the most widely distributed rhesus macaque ( Macaca mulatta ). The concentration of THg in golden snub-nosed monkeys (mean +/- s.d.: 76.7 +/- 35.6 ng/g; median: 71.8 ng/g, range: 11.2 - 200.0 ng/g, n = 71) was significantly higher than that in rhesus macaques (mean +/- s.d.: 32.3 +/- 54.7 ng/g; median: 17.5 ng/g, range: 7.4 - 409.0 ng/g, n = 98). No significant differences were observed in both MeHg and MeHg % between these two species. Age and sex did not predict fecal Hg. Among adults, approximately 85 % of sampled individuals exhibited hazard quotient (HQ) values exceeding 1, indicating mercury poses a health risk to captive primate populations. The average HQ for golden snub-nosed monkeys was 2.98 +/- 1.68 (range: 0.46 - 8.21, n = 43), while for rhesus macaques was 1.84 +/- 1.64 (range: 0.61 - 12.49, n = 71). Our findings suggest that conservation efforts for captive primates may be compromised by Hg pollution, particularly in golden snub-nosed monkeys. Further investigation and ongoing biomonitoring from an ecotoxicological perspective, are crucial to ensuring the health of captive primate populations.

AB  - Bloom (BLM) helicase plays an important role in DNA replication and the maintenance of genome integrity. BLM protein deficiency, which plays a vital role in the sperm-egg union and germ-cell development during reproduction, can lead to severe DNA damage in goats. However, the effect of BLM protein deficiency on goat litter size has not been reported. Herein, we studied the association between the genetic variation in the BLM gene and the number of kids per litter in Guizhou white goats. We explored differences in the expression of the BLM protein in the follicles of single and multi-kid nanny goats. We also analyzed the effects of dysregulated BLM gene expression on the proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells and the expression of genes related to follicle development in goats. Five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci, including the non-synonymous mutations g.38179 A > G, g.40626 G > C and g.89621 T > G; the intron synonymous mutation g.56961 G > A and the exon synonymous mutation g.65796 C > T were found in the BLM gene. All SNPs loci were in HardyWeinberg equilibrium, and correlation analysis showed that the g.65796 C > T and g.89621 T > G loci polymorphism was strongly associated with litter size in the first three litters (P < 0.05). The diplogenotype Hap 2/2 (AAGGAACCTT) showed no significant difference in litter size between different births, indicating that the diploid genotype is stable in different litter sizes. Bioinformatics analysis showed that three non-synonymous mutation loci (p.T488A, p.A662S, and p.S1373A) could affect BLM protein stability, and mutations in p. T488A and p.S1373A led to changes in amino acid polarity and associated interactions. qPCR results showed that the expression level of the BLM gene in the uterus and ovaries of TT genotype nanny goats was significantly higher than that of GG genotype nanny goats. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IF) showed that the BLM protein was significantly overexpressed in both the primordial and growing follicles of nanny goats with multiple kids (P < 0.01). Disrupting BLM gene expression in the ovarian granulosa cells down-regulated the expression of the Cyp19A1 gene. It also significantly inhibited the proliferation of follicles and induces early apoptosis of the granulosa cells. These findings confirm that polymorphism in the BLM gene is closely related to the littering traits of Guizhou white goats, and it affects the reproductive performance of nanny goats by regulating the development of the oocytes and granulosa cells. This work provides new evidence on the regulatory effect of the BLM gene on the litter size of nanny goats.

AB  - Tibetan antelopes (Pantholops hodgsonii) migrate great distances to specific delivery and calving areas. In the current study, we investigated calving site selection and vigilance behaviour during delivery and nursing in migratory female Tibetan antelopes at Zonag Lake. According to observations and analysis, the females were distributed south of Zonag Lake, where vegetation was abundant. We determined their dates of migration (crossing the Qinghai-Tibet Highway observation site), showing a shift of one month during the period from June in 2008 to May 2021. Results also showed that 81.4% of females expressed high vigilance behaviour during calving and nursing compared to those without calves (7.1%). From delivery until calf standing, females were highly vigilant and spent considerable time scanning, with 96% of females showing vigilance behaviour. Females with calves (average 9.94 & PLUSMN; 0.62 s) spent more time on vigilance behaviour than females without calves (average 6.25 & PLUSMN; 1.38 s). Females with newborns spent the greatest amount of time being vigilant (average 51.63 & PLUSMN; 4.24 s). These results not only identify basic Tibetan antelope calving behaviour, but also provide scientific analysis and evidence for further ethological research on female Tibetan antelopes.

AB  - Moxidectin (MOX) is used to control helminth parasites in ruminant livestock. It is released through feces and remains in the environment for a long period. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of faeces excreted by moxidectin-treated sheep on soil biodiversity (coprophagous insects, soil microbial biomass, and activity) to establish environment-related guidelines regarding the use of MOX in sheep livestock. The study consisted of two experiments. In the first one, faeces from MOX-treated (subcutaneous dose of 0.2 mg center dot kg-1 body weight) and nontreated rams were placed on an animal-free pasture field, protected or not against rain, for 88 days. Then, coprophagous insects were captured, identified, and counted, and faeces degradation was evaluated by measuring dry weight and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents over time. Diptera, Hymenoptera, Isoptera, and Coleoptera were equally encountered in faeces from MOX-treated and nontreated animals. Faecal boluses of MOX-treated animals (with higher N content) not protected against rain degraded faster than faecal boluses of nontreated animals (with lower N content). In the second experiment, faeces from nontreated animals were amended with increasing amounts of MOX (75 to 3,000 ng center dot kg-1 faeces), mixed with soil samples from animal-free pasture (1.9 to 75 ng center dot kg-1 soil), and incubated in a greenhouse for 28 days. Increasing concentrations of MOX did not prevent the growth of cultivable bacteria, actinobacteria, or fungi in culture media. However, even the lower MOX concentration (1.9 ng center dot kg-1 soil) abruptly decreased soil microbial biomass, basal respiration, and N mineralization. Thus, the results indicate that faeces excreted from sheep treated with MOX under the experimental conditions of this study are not harmful to the coprophagous insects. However, adding MOX to faeces from drug-free sheep had a negative impact on soil microbial activity and biomass.

AB  - Wildlife and natural resources constitute an integral part of the ecosystem, whereas human interventions dismantled the living conditions of the wildlife. This is testified in the Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary (DWS) where the habitats of Asian elephants have changed due to human intervention and deforestation over the decades. The present study aimed to assess the elephant habitat suitability in the DWS of Jharkhand state (India) using the geospatial parameters such as forest density, degree of slope, proximity to water bodies, land use land cover, proximity to agricultural land, built-up density, and road density. The analytical hierarchical process technique was utilized to determine habitat preference and selection of relevant factors to categorize criteria. The study revealed that about 6.7% (26.74 km2) of the area is very highly suitable for elephant habitat, while 52.26% (208.49 km2) of the forest area was found highly suitable. The most suitable habitat was identified in the core parts of the forest, while the least suitable areas were found in the southern part, where the presence of roads, built-up, and agricultural land was prominent. It was also observed that most human-elephant conflicts were exhibited in the low and very low suitable areas, while 90% of the elephant movement was witnessed in the high and very high suitable areas. Among the four identified corridors, three are inactive, and their location corresponds with low to very low suitable habitats. The study identified the migratory corridor routes inside the sanctuary where effective management is required for the conservation of elephant habitats and minimizing conflicts.

AB  - Herbivore insects have strong impacts on leaf gas exchange when feeding on the plant. Leaf age also drives leaf gas exchanges but the interaction of leaf age and phloem herbivory has been largely underexplored. We investigated the amplitude and direction of herbivore impact on leaf gas exchange across a wide range of leaf age in the apple tree-apple green aphid (Aphis pomi) system. We measured the gas exchange (assimilation and transpiration rates, stomatal conductance and internal CO2 concentration) of leaves infested versus non-infested by the aphid across leaf age. For very young leaves up to 15 days-old, the gas exchange rates of infested leaves were similar to those of non-infested leaves. After few days, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate increased in infested leaves up to about the age of 30 days, and gradually decreased after that age. By contrast, gas exchanges in non-infested leaves gradually decreased across leaf age such that they were always lower than in infested leaves. Aphids were observed on relatively young leaves up to 25 days and despite the positive effect on leaf photosynthesis and leaf performance, their presence negatively affected the growth rate of apple seedlings. Indeed, aphids decreased leaf dry mass, leaf surface, and leaf carbon content except in old leaves. By contrast, aphids induced an increase in leaf nitrogen content and the deviation relative to non-infested leaves increased with leaf age. Overall, the impacts of aphids at multiple levels of plant performance depend on leaf age. While aphids cause an increase in some leaf traits (gas exchanges and nitrogen content), they also depress others (plant growth rate and carbon content). The balance between those effects, as modulated by leaf age, may be the key for herbivory mitigation in plants.

AB  - Simple Summary Liquid preserved boar semen is a perishable product, and many environmental influences can affect sperm quality during transport from the boar station to the sow farm. Previous studies have shown that vibration emissions have a negative effect on spermatozoa, however, there has been no documentation of the vibrations spermatozoa are exposed to during transport. To answer this question, several breeding companies worldwide were interviewed about their delivery process. As it turns out, environmental influences are only rarely recorded, and vibrations are not monitored at all. To record and to evaluate vibrations that occur during transport, we have developed a measurement system and investigated vibration intensities in standardized road trials. We were able to show that both speed and road surface significantly influence the produced vibrations. Furthermore, the occurrence of the vibrations on a reference delivery from a German boar stud was studied. In the future, it is recommended that in order to avoid negative influences during transport, the transport of boar semen should be permanently monitored. In the modern pig reproduction system, artificial insemination (AI) doses are delivered from AI centers to sow farms via logistics vehicles. In this study, six breeding companies in three countries (Brazil, Germany, and the USA) were interviewed about their delivery process. It was found that there is currently no comprehensive monitoring system for the delivery of semen. The entire process "shipping of boar semen" was documented using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Although it is not currently known which vibrations occur at all, it is suspected that vibration emissions affect the quality of boar semen. For this reason, a prototype of a measuring system was developed to calculate a displacement index (D-i), representing vibration intensities. Vibrations were analyzed in standardized road trials (n = 120) on several road types (A: smooth asphalt pavement, B: rough asphalt pavement, C: cobblestone, and D: dirt road) with different speeds (30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 km/h). A two-way ANOVA showed significant differences in mean D-i, depending on road surface and speed as well as an interaction of both factors (p < 0.001). A field study on a reference delivery from a German AI center to several sow farms indicated that 33% of the observed roads are in good quality and generate only a few vibrations (D-i <= 1), while 40% are of a moderate quality with interrupted surfaces (D-i = 1-1.5). However, 25% of the roads show markedly increased vibrations (D-i >= 1.5), as a consequence of bad conditions on cobblestones or unpaved roads. Overall, more attention should be paid to factors affecting sperm quality during transport. In the future, an Internet of Things (IoT) based solution could enable complete monitoring of the entire transport process in real time, which could influence the courier's driving behavior based on road conditions in order to maintain the quality of the transported AI doses.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal, prion disease of cervids that was first detected in Alberta in 2005. Transmission of CWD by direct contact with infected individuals plays a major role in the early phases of an outbreak. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) comprise 85% of CWD-infected animals in the province, and we investigated the seasonal effects of grouping patterns and landscape heterogeneity on direct, pair-wise contacts (distance of 3 m) within and between sex-specific (same or mixed sex) groups of mule deer in east-central Alberta. We determined seasonal contacts of mule deer based on proximity loggers that alter GPS schedules to record contact locations. We modeled the relative risk of contact between sex-specific dyads both within and between social groups based on landscape characteristics at the location of contact. We then assessed the support for 5 hypotheses that linked locations of seasonal contacts to occurrence of CWD on the landscape. Disease occurrence on the landscape was derived by comparing locations of CWD-infected and CWD-uninfected deer collected as part of the Alberta's CWD hunter-harvest surveillance program. We found that contacts in winter occurred in areas where deer use was concentrated, whereas in summer, contact locations were less constrained in space where patterns of landscape characteristics at contact locations varied between sex-specific dyads. Contact probabilities of within and between-group male dyads in winter and between-group female dyads in summer were the best predictors of CWD risk in east-central Alberta. Our results relate habitat specific, social behaviors between conspecific mule deer to potential routes of CWD transmission and contribute to CWD research that guides management strategies for an emergent wildlife disease.

AB  - The lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) is an aquacultural species in China and has important economic and ornamental value. However, the species is affected by disease, which restricts their large-scale cultivation. In 2021, a disease was observed in cultured seahorses in Tianjin, China, with a cumulative mortality rate of 20%. The symptoms observed in the moribund seahorse included a weak swimming capacity, discolored body surface, enlarged liver and kidneys, and numerous white nodules in the parenchymatous organs. The strains HM-2021-1 and HM-2021-2 were isolated from diseased seahorses and were identified as being responsible for the disease. It demonstrated the potential to infect seahorse, and the cumulative mortalities of the seahorses artificially infected with strains HM-2021-1 and HM-2021-2 were 93.3% and 90.0%. The pathogen was identified as Mycobacterium chelonae based on physiological and biochemical tests, and 16S rDNA, rpoB, and Hsp65 gene sequence analysis. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of M. chelonae associated with diseased seahorses in China.

AB  - Little is known about the interdependencies between livestock production and biodiversity. The swine sector is characterized by a diversity of extensive and intensive production practices, which rely on a wide range of natural and manmade activities (e.g., different use of the land) that can reduce its adverse effects on biodiversity. The Nero d'Abruzzo pig is a black domestic pig from the Abruzzo region, Italy, that is reared with extensive practice. This study using a proteomics approach aimed to investigate breed differences between the autochthon Nero d'Abruzzo and commercial-hybrid pigs commonly used by the industry. The comparison of the protein profile of muscle exudate obtained following centrifugation from the diaphragm of the two pig breeds highlight significant differences in the protein expression of a large pool of proteins. Among the proteins that were upregulated or downregulated differently in the two pigs, three-fatty acid synthase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase-may contribute in part to explaining, according to their functions, the phenotypic differences between the pigs. This work has identified a cohort of proteins that can be potentially useful to define new molecular phenotypes for novel applications in pig breeding programs and are of great interest for future work.
   Capital-driven animal husbandry systems undertaken in the last century led to the abandoning of many pig breeds that were not profitable. These local pig breeds and their respective production systems have great potential as they are able to respond to the high criteria and needs of modern society concerning some environmental aspects, animal-welfare, healthiness, etc. This is the case of the black pigs of Italy. The Apulo-Calabrese is a breed of black pig, known by many other names such as Nero d'Abruzzo. In order to further understand the biological differences between different types of porcine genetics (Nero d'Abruzzo and commercial-hybrid) we used a label-free LC-MS strategy and Western-blot to characterize the proteomes of muscle-exudate collected from these pigs. This proteomics approach identified 1669 proteins of which 100 changed significantly in abundance between breeds. Bioinformatics functional analysis indicated that differentially expressed proteins were involved in several biological processes related to energy-metabolism and response to oxidative stress, suggesting that these functions might distinguish between these pigs. Fatty-acid synthase, catalase and glutathione-peroxidase, involved in enzymatic activity were found to be more represented in samples obtained from the Nero d'Abruzzo. This biological information can potentially provide new biological factors that could determine the different production performances of these pigs, distinguished by their different genetic backgrounds.

AB  - Features varying more between than within individuals are considered as potential cues for individual recognition. According to the source-filter theory of vocal production, the fundamental frequency of mammals' vocalizations depends on the characteristics of vocal folds, while Formants are determined by the characteristics of the vocal tract. Goat mothers and their kids (Capra hircus) display mutual recognition, and both source-related parameters (f0) and filter-related ones (Formants) have been shown to be individualized. Here, we aimed to identify if f0 and Formants are used by goat kids to recognize their mother's vocalizations. To do this, we independently modified these parameters in calls of goat mothers to different degrees (within or exceeding the range of natural intra-individual variability), and we played back these modified calls to their kids. We found no effect of f0 or Formants modification on the kids' reactions. Further analyses revealed that goat kids emitted fewer calls when modifications to f0 resulted in higher values of the first energy quartile, suggesting a role of the distribution of energy in the spectrum in maternal recognition. We propose that either: (i) f0 and Formants are not involved in goats' maternal recognition; (ii) goat kids have a tolerance for variation when recognizing their mother's calls that exceeds the performed shifts in these parameters; or (iii) goat kid maternal recognition is based on a combination of features and might be more flexible than previously thought, such that when one feature is modified, kids focus on other features. The effect of the spectral energy distribution modification on the kid responses, which depends both on f0 and Formant heights, suggests that (iii) is a likely explanation. Our findings support the hypothesis of complex individual acoustic recognition from the early stages of development in ungulates.

AB  - Simple Summary Subacute rumen acidosis (SARA) often causes significant losses on commercial farms. SARA is mainly caused by endotoxin (LPS) produced by the lysis of Gram-negative bacteria, which causes an inflammatory response. To alleviate the inflammatory response mediated by LPS, it is important to improve animal production performance. Tea tree oil (TTO) is a plant extract that possesses good bactericidal and anti-inflammatory effects. According to this study, LPS can significantly induce inflammatory responses in goat rumen epithelial cells (GRECs), while the addition of TTO could markedly mitigate inflammatory responses mediated by LPS in GRECs. Therefore, it may be useful for the treatment of SARA. In subacute rumen acidosis (SARA), the rumen epithelium is frequently attacked by endotoxin (LPS), which is caused by the lysis of dead Gram-negative bacteria. However, the rumen epithelium innate immune system can actively respond to the infection. Previous studies have demonstrated that tea tree oil (TTO) has good bactericidal and anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of TTO on the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory cytokines in goat rumen epithelial cells (GRECs) triggered by LPS. Our study shows that rumen epithelial cells isolated from goat rumen tissue can be cultured in vitro in 0.25% trypsin for a long time. These cells were identified as epithelial cells by the expression of cytokeratin 18, monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), Na[+]/H[+] hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1), putative anion transporter 1 (PAT1), vH(+) ATPase B subunit (vH(+) ATPase), and anion exchanger 2 (AE2). The mRNA expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, TLR-2, NF-kappa B, CXCL6 and CXCL8 genes was significantly increased when LPS was used compared to untreated controls. In addition, mRNA expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, TLR-2, NF-kappa B, CXCL8, CXCL6 and interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) genes was also significantly higher in the LPS group compared to the 0.05% TTO group. However, the expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, TLR-2, CXCL6 and IFIT3 genes was significantly lower in the LPS and 0.05% TTO group compared to the 1 mu g/mL LPS group. These results suggest that TTO can inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines expression in GRECs.

AB  - The study aims to analyze morphological variations and spatial distribution patterns of Krascheninnikovia compacta (Losinsk.) Grubov communities across 12 sampling areas at different elevations in the Tibetan antelope breeding grounds of the western Kunlun Mountains. Additionally, it projected the future climatically suitabie habitats of K. compacta under climate change scenarios, aiming to elucidate its community characteristics, spatial distribution dynamics, and the impacts of global warming on its growth. Integrated GIS, remote sensing, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were used to investigate K. compacta communities. The Pearson correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between crown diameter, as well as between plant height and environmental factors. The redundancy analysis (RDA) results indicated that multiple environmental factors jointly explained the variation in plant height and crown diameter of K. compacta. Point pattern analysis, using the g(r) function combined with two null models, demonstrated changes in plant distribution during scale transitions. Additionally, the MaxEnt model was employed to project the potential suitable habitats of K. compacta under future climate scenarios. Overall, as the elevational gradient increases, the plant height of K. compacta gradually decreases while the crown diameter expands. Mean annual temperature (MAT) dominates the morphological variations in crown diameter and plant height, with lower temperatures correlating to shorter plant height and larger crown diameter. The complete spatial randomness (CSR) model indicates that across all elevations, the distribution patterns of plants transition sequentially from uniform to random, then clustered, and back to random as spatial scale increases. The heterogeneous Poisson (HP) model suggests that habitat heterogeneity is the primary driver of shifts in plant distribution patterns at larger scales. The MaxEnt model revealed distinct changes in suitable habitat areas of K. compacta under future climate scenarios. During 2061 to 2080s, its suitable habitats under the SSP126 and SSP585 pathways significantly contracted and expanded markedly, respectively.

AB  - Aerobic composting, especially semipermeable membrane-covered aerobic fermentation, is known to be an effective method for recycling and reducing vegetable waste. However, this approach has rarely been applied to the aerobic composting of vegetable waste; in addition, the product characteristics and GHG emissions of the composting process have not been studied in-depth. This study investigated the effect of using different structural ventilation systems on composting efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions in a semipermeable membrane-covered vegetable waste compost. The results for the groups (MV1, MV2, and MV3) with bottom ventilation plus multichannel ventilation and the group (BV) with single bottom ventilation were compared here. The MV2 group effectively increased the average temperature by 19.06% whilst also increasing the degradation rate of organic matter by 30.81%. Additionally, the germination index value reached more than 80%, 3 days in advance. Compared to those of the BV group, the CH4, N2O, and NH3 emissions of MV2 were reduced by 32.67%, 21.52%, and 22.57%, respectively, with the total greenhouse gas emissions decreasing by 24.17%. Overall, this study demonstrated a multichannel ventilation system as a new method for improving the composting efficiency of vegetable waste whilst reducing gas emissions.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of composite alkali-stored spent Hypsizygus marmoreus substrate (SHMS) on carcass quality, rumen fermentation, and rumen microbial diversity in goats. Twenty-four 6-month-old Chuanzhong black goats with similar body weights (20 +/- 5 kg) were selected and randomly divided into four groups (n = 6 per group) and received four treatments: 0% (control group, CG); 20% (low-addition group, LG); 30% (moderate-addition group, MG); and 40% (high-addition group, HG) of SHMS-replaced silage corn and oat hay. The experiment lasted for 74 days (including a 14 d adaptation period and a 60 d treatment period). The results of this study showed that MG and HG significantly improved the marble score of goat meat (p < 0.05). The flesh color score significantly increased in each group (p < 0.05). The fat color scores significantly increased in LG and MG (p < 0.05). There were no significant effects on the pH value or shear force of the longissimus dorsi in each group (p > 0.05). The cooking loss in MG was higher than that in CG (p < 0.05). The histidine and tyrosine contents in each group of muscles significantly increased (p < 0.05), with no significant effect on fatty acids (p > 0.05). The rumen pH of MG significantly decreased (p < 0.05), while the total volatile fatty acids (TVFAs) and ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N) increased by 44.63% and 54.50%, respectively. The addition of the SHMS altered both the alpha and beta diversities of the rumen microbiota and significant differences in the composition and structure of the four microbial communities. The dominant bacterial phylum in each group were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with Prevotella 1 as the dominant bacterial genus. Correlation analysis revealed that rumen bacteria are closely related to the animal carcass quality and rumen fermentation. In the PICRUSt prediction, 21 significantly different pathways were found, and the correlation network showed a positive correlation between the Prevotella 1 and 7 metabolic pathways, while the C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism was positively correlated with nine bacteria. In summary, feeding goats with an SHMS diet can improve the carcass quality, promote rumen fermentation, and alter the microbial structure. The research results can provide a scientific reference for the utilization of SHMS as feed in the goat industry.

AB  - Organic and mineral fertilizers are important sources of ammonia (NH3) emissions from agricultural fields. The objectives of this study were (a) to evaluate how different cover crop (CC) residues (i.e., rye [Secale cereale L.], white mustard [Sinapis alba L.], and bare soil as control) in combination with different application methods of digestate (surface broadcast vs. shallow injection) affect NH3 volatilization before planting maize (Zea mays L.) and (b) to assess the residual effect of previous CCs on NH3 volatilization after urea top-dress application at the V5-V6 phonological stage of maize. Ammonia volatilization was measured using semi-static chambers for 14 d (335 h) after planting and for 6 d (150 h) at the V5-V6 stage. Overall, NH3 emissions decreased by 67-77% with digestate injection compared with surface broadcasting. However, the reduction in NH3 volatilization using the injection method was significantly lower with mustard residue (6.72 kg NH3-N ha(-1)) than with rye residue (14.15 kg NH3-N ha(-1)), which allowed for more volatilization by increasing the exposure of digestate to the air. Broadcast digestate method did not affect the cumulative NH3-N losses obtained with different CC types. After urea top-dressing at the V5-V6 stage of maize, the cumulative losses of NH3 (during 150 h) were 2.99 kg NH3-N ha(-1) with rye as previous CC and 2.49 kg NH3-N ha(-1) with mustard. Our study shows that digestate injection before maize planting and urea top-dressing application followed immediately by irrigation (15 mm) could be considered as useful strategies to mitigate NH3 volatilization and increase N use efficiency in maize.

AB  - This study examined the role of gut bacteria in Spodoptera litura, identifying gamma-Proteobacteria and Bacilli as dominant classes. Larvae mainly hosted Acinetobacter lwoffii; among adult moths, males harbored Enterococcus mundtii, Priestia megaterium, and Citrobacter freundii, while females carried Bacillus tequilensis and A. tjernbergiae. With respect to detoxification enzyme production: C. freundii produced CarEs, GSTs, and CYPs; B. tequilensis produced GSTs (delta, epsilon, theta), CYPs, and CarEs. P. megaterium produced only esterases. Tetracycline showed strong binding to detox enzymes and significantly reduced enzyme activity in treated moths, indicating its potential to disrupt microbial-mediated detoxification in S. litura.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) pigs are characterized by long-term growth failure, metabolic disorders, and intestinal microbiota imbalance. The characteristics of the negative effects of IUGR at different growth stages of pigs are still unclear. Therefore, this study explored through multi-omics analyses whether the IUGR damages the intestinal barrier function and alters the colonization and metabolic profiles of the colonic microbiota in growing-finishing pigs. Seventy-two piglets (36 IUGR and 36 NBW) were allocated for this trial to analyze physiological and plasma biochemical parameters, as well as oxidative damage and inflammatory response in the colon. Moreover, the colonic microbiota communities and metabolome were examined using 16s rRNA sequencing and metabolomics technologies to reveal the intestinal characteristics of IUGR pigs at different growth stages (25, 50, and 100 kg). IUGR altered the concentrations of plasma glucose, total protein, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Colonic tight junction proteins were markedly inhibited by IUGR. IUGR decreased plasma T-AOC, SOD, and GSH levels and colonic SOD-1, SOD-2, and GPX-4 expressions by restraining the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway. Moreover, IUGR increased colonic IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels while reducing IL-10, possibly through activating the TLR4-NF-kappa B/ERK pathway. Notably, IUGR pigs had lower colonic Streptococcus abundance and Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio at the 25 kg BW stage while having higher Firmicutes abundance at the 100 kg BW stage; moreover, IUGR pigs had lower SCFA concentrations. Metabolomics analysis showed that IUGR increased colonic lipids and lipid-like molecules, organic acids and derivatives, and organoheterocyclic compounds concentrations and enriched three differential metabolic pathways, including linoleic acid, sphingolipid, and purine metabolisms throughout the trial. Collectively, IUGR altered the nutrient metabolism, redox status, and colonic microbiota community and metabolite profiles of pigs and continued to disrupt colonic barrier function by reducing antioxidant capacity via the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway and activating inflammation via the TLR4-NF-kappa B/ERK pathway during the growing-finishing stage. Moreover, colonic Firmicutes and Streptococcus could be potential regulatory targets for modulating the metabolism and health of IUGR pigs.

AB  - Leaf shelter construction by herbivorous insects can improve leaf quality, sometimes changing resultant herbivory. In two experiments in a Missouri (USA) deciduous forest we quantified the impact of leaf tie construction and changes to leaf quality on subsequent leaf damage. First, using eight Quercus species, we compared damage to single leaves versus experimental leaf ties that had been stocked with either Pseudotelphusa quercinigracella (Gelechiidae) or Psilocorsis cryptolechiella (Depressariidae) to determine how initial leaf quality (total phenolics) influenced damage caused by shelter inhabitants. Skeletonization by leaf tying caterpillars and leaf edge chewing by free feeding species were 12.2x and 1.3x greater on tied than on non-tied leaves, respectively. July and September leaf phenolic content had a slight positive effect on the probability of skeletonization, none on the probability of edge damage, and a weakly positive or negative effect on the intensity of skeletonization and edge damage, depending on leaf position. Second, we created experimental leaf ties, protected from herbivores, on the same Quercus species to determine whether tie formation changes leaf quality (total phenolics, nitrogen, water, toughness). Tie formation decreased phenolics, but this change was predicted to add only 0.8% leaf area loss. Synthesis. Herbivory increased dramatically when leaves were in ties, with the effect mostly due to the tie itself rather than a change in leaf quality. We predict that the advantages of building and using leaf ties in this system are more likely to be escape from natural enemies and changes in abiotic factors.

AB  - This epidemiological study was conducted to compare the climatic conditions of four different districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, in terms of the prevalence of parasitic infection Paramphistomum in cows and buffaloes. A total of 2400/cows and buffaloes (200/per month and 50/per district) fecal samples were collected. The samples were examined for Paramphistomum egg contamination by direct microscopic examination and sedimentation methods. The infectivity ratio was 17.5% in cows and 17% in buffaloes; the higher rate of infection was recorded in autumn with 41% in cows and 36% in buffaloes. Whereas the lowest ratio was 6.5% in cows and 7% in buffaloes recorded during spring. It was also noted that a high rate of prevalence was recorded in older animals (higher than 2 years of age) than younger (less than 2 years of age), while gender-wise, it was observed that male animals were more affected than females. Prevalence was higher in cows in Mardan district (19.30%) followed by Nowshera (19.10%) and Swabi (17.80%) districts while lowest in Charsadda district (13.80%) where in buffaloes the higher prevalence was recorded in Swabi (18.80%) followed by Mardan (18.60%) then Charsadda (16.80%) while lowest in Nowshera (13.80%).

AB  - Population density estimates are important for wildlife conservation and management. Several camera trapping-based methods for estimating densities have been developed, one of which, the random encounter model (REM), has been widely applied due to its practical advantages such as no need for species-specific study design. Nevertheless, most of the studies in which REM has been assessed against referenced methods have sampled one population, precluding evaluation of the circumstances under which REM does or does not perform well. At this point, a review of all REM assessments could be useful to provide an overview of method reliability and highlight the main factors determining REM performance. Here we used a combination of literature review and empirical study to compare the performance of REM with independent methods. We reviewed 34 studies where REM was applied to 45 species, reporting 77 REM-reference density comparisons; and we also sampled 13 populations (ungulates and lagomorphs) in which we assessed REM performance against independent densities. The results suggested that appropriate procedures to estimate REM parameters (namely day range, detection zone and encounter rate) are mandatory to obtain unbiased densities. Deficient estimates of day range and encounter rate lead to an overestimation of density, while deficient estimates of detection zone conducted to underestimations. Finally, the precision achieved by REM was lower than reference methods, mainly because of the high levels of spatial aggregation observed in natural populations. In this situation, simulation-based results suggest that c. 60 camera placements should be sampled to achieve acceptable precision (i.e. coefficient of variation below 0.20). The wide range of situations and scenarios included in this study allow us to conclude that REM is a reliable method for estimating wildlife population density when using appropriate estimates of REM parameters and sampling designs. Overall, these results pave the way to wider application of REM for monitoring terrestrial mammals.

AB  - Seahorses are valuable species for their use in traditional Chinese medicine, as well as for the aquarium trade as ornamentals and curiosities. To balance market demand and reduce pressure on wild populations, many countries have undertaken commercial seahorse cultivation. Skeletal development plays a crucial role in fish fry culture, affecting external morphology, feeding, and movement. This study investigated the ontogeny allometry, timing, and progression of skeletal development in H. abdominalis from DAB (day after birth) 1 to DAB 100 under mass-scale captive breeding conditions in north China. The results of this study revealed the growth rate was significantly increased between DAB 30 and DAB 54. Allometry analysis revealed that in the early stage, the head, trunk, and tail demonstrated almost isometric growth. However, in the later stage, the head and trunk exhibited negative isometric growth, whereas the tail displayed positive isometric growth. Skeletal staining results showed that newborn seahorses do not have ossified bones until DAB 11 (SL 28.14 +/- 2.94 mm). Ossification was primarily observed in the jaw region and the tubular nasal structure of the cranium, which indicated the importance of the early development of feeding organs. The initial formation of ossified vertebral columns was observed at DAB 13 (SL 26.48 +/- 0.63 mm), with the complete ossification of all vertebrae occurring by DAB 45 (SL 54.87 +/- 4.70 mm). Furthermore, the cranium, rings, and plates were all fully ossified by DAB 30. Ossification of the fins began at DAB 23 (SL 31.27 +/- 4.05 mm). However, neither of them were fully ossified by DAB 100. The pelvic fin and the complete structure of the caudal fin were not observed, possibly because of caudal fin ray structure degeneration within the pouch. In addition, no skeletal deformities were observed in all the tested samples. The results of this study provide valuable information on the developmental biology of H. abdominalis, enriching our understanding of their growth and offering insights for optimizing fish fry breeding technologies.

AB  - Even after decades of research on diversification in the Neotropics, our understanding of the evolutionary processes that shaped Neotropical clades is still incomplete. In the present study, we used different divergence times and likelihood-based methods to investigate the influence of biogeography and host plant associations on the diversification of the most species-rich psyllid genus Melanastera (Liviidae) from the Neotropics as a model group of herbivorous insects. We used molecular phylogenetic data from seven gene fragments (four mitochondrial and three nuclear). The putatively monophyletic group of Neotropical Melanastera species has an estimated crown node age of 20.2 Ma (ML, CI 20.2-30.6) or 23.2 Ma (BI, 95 % HPD 16.6-32.6), with diversification occurring mainly in the Upper Miocene, although some species groups diversified in the Pliocene or Pleistocene. Biogeographic analysis suggests that the Neotropical Melanastera originated from the Pacific region of South and Central America. We detected a shift in diversification rates that likely occurred either at the time of origin of Melanastera or during the main colonisation of the Atlantic and Amazon Forests, followed by a subsequent slowdown in speciation rates. State-dependent speciation and extinction models revealed a significant relationship between this diversification shift and the shift of Melanastera to the plant families Melastomataceae and Annonaceae, reflecting the impact of host switching on speciation rates in this group. This period also coincides with several independent dispersal events from the Atlantic and Amazon Forests to other parts of the Neotropics. Taken together, the results of the current study suggest that diversification of Melanastera was facilitated by shifts to new host families, which may have promoted the dispersal of Melanastera into new adaptive zones with subsequent processes of local speciation.

AB  - Understanding the morphotypical masculinization gradient and its impact on social behavior in a natural animal model is essential for unraveling sexual differentiation dynamics and their ecological implications. In this study, we examined the presence of a morphotypical masculinization gradient in female wild cavies (Cavia aperea) and its association with social behavior. Experimental colonies in four enclosures with different initial population densities were established. Between October 2017 and June 2018, we collected two datasets. The first dataset included body mass and anogenital distance (AGD) from 48 females, collected every 15-30 days. Simultaneously, focal behavioral observations were carried out during the intervals between recaptures. The behavioral dataset encompassed 65 marked cavies (males and females); 50 in high-density and 15 low-density conditions. Behavioral data were utilized to construct a focal association index matrix. Social centrality by spatial proximity measures were calculated using eigenvector analysis. Using the AGDI as a proxy for masculinization, we categorized females into three groups based on their AGDI values: low, middle, and high. The AGDI demonstrated high repeatability, underscoring its stability as a metric. Morphotype analysis revealed distinct distributions of AGDI values across varying initial density conditions. No significant associations were found between AGDI values and social centrality. These findings enhance our understanding of social dynamics in C. aperea and emphasize the significance of accounting for morphotypical variability in ecological research.

AB  - Marine mammal watching is a non-consumptive wildlife-oriented tourism practice. Trichechus manatus manatus (hereinafter - Antillean manatee) belongs to the charismatic marine megafauna and is subject to this practice at many places. Here we investigated the Antillean manatee watching in Brazil, focusing on mapping this activity across the country, identifying hotspot areas, analysing the potential seasonality of this practice, and assessing the interactions between people and Antillean manatees. We used a social network as data source since this species often appears on social media. The species is charismatic and have characteristics, which attract public affection such as large body size, gentle behaviour, and distinct physical appearance. We detected Antillean manatee watching in 91 localities distributed across 19 municipalities and nine states in northern and north-eastern Brazil. We considered six localities as Antillean manatee watching hotspots because of their high number of associated images. Five of the hotspots were located within three Protected Areas for sustainable use. We found up to 23 people depicted in a single manatee-related picture posted on social network, but up to five people appeared in most posts (photos and videos). Furthermore, images were significantly posted mostly during the summer months, indicating seasonality in Antillean manatee watching. We classified the manatee-watching interactions collected as either prohibited or permitted by the Brazilian law. Permitted interactions were significantly more frequent, but the occurrence of prohibited interactions reveals the current lack of compliance with Brazilian regulations. We suggest that tourism management strategies prioritise Antillean manatee watching hotspot areas, focusing on reinforcing compliance with local regulations and preferably involving local residents to ensure the sustainability of this practice in Brazil.

AB  - Due to the increased production and release of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the environment, the concerns about the possibility of toxicity and oxidative damage to plant ecosystems should be considered. In the present study, the effects of different concentrations of AgNPs (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 g/L) synthesized using the extract of camelina (Camelina sativa) leaves on the growth and the biochemical traits of camelina seedlings were investigated. The results showed that AgNPs significantly increased Ag accumulation in the roots and shoots which decreased the growth and photosynthetic pigments of camelina seedlings. The highest decrease in the height and total dry weight was observed by 53.1 and 61.8% under 4 g/L AgNPs, respectively over control plants. AgNPs application over 2 g/L enhanced the accumulation of proline, malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide and methylglyoxal, and up-regulated the activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase) and glyoxalase (glyoxalase I and II) system which indicates oxidative stress induction in camelina seedlings. Moreover, AgNPs reduced ASA and GSH contents and increased DHA and GSSG contents, hence disrupting the redox balance. These results showed that AgNPs at 4 g/L had the most toxic effects on the camelina growth. Therefore, increasing oxidative stress markers and the activity of antioxidant enzymes and enzymes involved in glyoxalase system indicated the oxidative stress induced by AgNPs treatments over 2 g/L as well as the induction of antioxidant defense systems to combat AgNPs-induced oxidative stress.

AB  - The Periptychidae, an extinct group of archaic ungulates ('condylarths'), were the most speciose eutherian mammals in the earliest Paleocene of North America, epitomizing mammalian ascendency after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction. Although periptychids are mostly known from fragmentary gnathic remains, the Corral Bluffs area within the Denver Basin, Colorado, has yielded numerous exceptionally well-preserved mammalian fossils, including periptychids, from the earliest Paleocene. Here we describe a partial cranium and articulated dentaries plus an additional unassociated dentary fragment of a small-bodied (similar to 273-455 g) periptychid from ca. 610 thousand years after the K-Pg mass extinction (Puercan 2 North American Land Mammal 'age') at Corral Bluffs. Based on these new fossils we erect Militocodon lydae gen. et sp. nov. The dentition of M. lydae exhibits synapomorphies that diagnose the Conacodontinae, but it is plesiomorphic relative to Oxyacodon, resembling putatively basal periptychids like Mimatuta and Maiorana in several dental traits. As such, we interpret M. lydae as a basal conacodontine. Its skull anatomy does not reveal clear periptychid synapomorphies and instead resembles that of arctocyonids and other primitive eutherians. M. lydae falls along a dental morphocline from basal periptychids to derived conacodontines, which we hypothesize reflects a progressive, novel modification of the hypocone to enhance orthal shearing and crushing rather than grinding mastication. The discovery and thorough descriptions and comparisons of the partial M. lydae skull represent an important step toward unraveling the complex evolutionary history of periptychid mammals.

AB  - Yaks are a rare and unique animal species inhabiting the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; they are renowned for their remarkable ability to thrive in harsh environments. Milk-derived exosomes, tiny vesicles containing various biological molecules, play crucial roles in numerous pathological and physiological processes, including cell growth, development, and immune regulation. This study delved into the microRNA expression profiles of yak milk-derived exosomes collected from both high- and low-altitude populations using small RNA sequencing. These miRNAs were found to be implicated in pathways associated with mammary gland inflammation, virus infection regulation, and heat stress response. Functional enrichment analyses, utilizing GO and KEGG databases, revealed that the target genes of these differentially expressed miRNAs are enriched in signaling pathways crucial for Th17 cell differentiation and the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway. In conclusion, this research illuminates the adaptive mechanisms of yaks through the differential expression of miRNAs in their milk-derived exosomes across varying environmental conditions. These findings provide a valuable foundation for future investigations into yak resilience and the potential of milk-derived exosomes as tools for disease management and immune modulation.

AB  - Background and aims - A plant's tolerance of herbivory depends on its ability to endure and compensate for damage so as to lessen the impact that herbivores have on the plant's performance (e.g. its growth, reproduction, or fitness). While tolerance of herbivory is beneficial to plants, it is rarely complete, and individuals in plant populations tend to vary in their levels of tolerance. The goal of this study was to investigate potential costs associated with tolerance of leaf and floral herbivory in horsenettle (Solanum carolinense), a perennial herbaceous weed that is often subjected to high levels of damage from a diversity of herbivores.
   Material and methods - We exposed 96 potted individuals across eight genets of horsenettle to factorial treatments of leaf herbivory by lace bugs and simulated floral herbivory by weevils. We quantified tolerance for each plant genet for both types of herbivory in terms of the impact of damage on the number of flowers opened, number of seeds produced, and root biomass (i.e. paternal, maternal, and vegetative tolerance, respectively).
   Key results - Plant genets ranged widely in their ability to compensate for leaf and flower damage. While there was little evidence for tradeoffs in tolerance through the different routes, there was strong evidence of tradeoffs in genets' abilities to tolerate herbivore damage to leaves and damage to flowers.
   Conclusion - Tolerance is a useful defence strategy to cope with damage caused by herbivores, but its evolution may be constrained by concomitant costs and tradeoffs. The evolutionary role of the tradeoffs identified in this study are likely to be greater the more species of herbivores a plant hosts, and the more that herbivore levels vary both spatially and temporally.
