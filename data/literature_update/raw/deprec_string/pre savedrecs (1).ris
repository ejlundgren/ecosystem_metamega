AB  - Grazing pressure is increasing in the northern Gulf of Mexico due to tropicalization (i.e. range expansion of tropical species) and conservation efforts. Populations of herbivorous parrotfish, green turtles and manatees are all increasing in this region, and overgrazing can lead to loss of foundation species and their associated ecosystem services. With environmental conditions changing rapidly and seagrass abundance declining in many regions globally, understanding mechanisms that promote seagrass resilience to stressors (e.g. grazing) will be crucial for managing and restoring seagrass meadows and the valuable ecosystem services they provide. Diverse communities often exhibit higher resilience due to positive interactions and increased response diversity (i.e. differing reactions to environmental change), indicating that diversity may provide a tool for enhancing seagrass resilience. To investigate how macrophyte species richness influences resilience to increased grazing pressure, we simulated green turtle grazing events every 2 weeks for 8 weeks in plots that naturally varied in species richness. We recorded macrophyte metrics between the simulated grazing events and after a longer 4-week recovery period. Both species identity and species richness impacted response to simulated herbivory. Four weeks after the last simulated grazing event, plots with higher species richness had recovered macrophyte shoot density better than plots with lower species richness, indicating that species richness may increase resilience. The grazing events had the strongest negative impact on the persistent species (i.e. longer-lived species with slower shoot turnover), Thalassia testudinum, reducing T. testudinum density and dominance and indicating that areas dominated by this species may be the most negatively impacted by increased grazing pressure. Synthesis: Our results showed a positive impact of species richness on resilience and indicated that persistent seagrass species may have reduced dominance following repeated disturbances. Diverse seagrass beds can, therefore, improve ecosystem stability by allowing opportunistic species to replace species that are most negatively impacted by disturbances. These findings can be used to incorporate resilience into ecosystem management and identify seagrass beds that may be less resilient to changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Stem-mapped forest stands offer important opportunities for investigating the fine-scale spatial processes occurring in forest ecosystems. These stands are areas of the forest where the precise locations and repeated size measurements of each tree are recorded, thereby enabling the calculation of spatially-explicit metrics of individual growth rates and of the entire tree community. The most common use of these datasets is to investigate the drivers of variation in forest processes by modeling tree growth rate or mortality as a function of these neighborhood metrics. However, neighborhood metrics could also serve as important covariates of many other spatially variable forest processes, including seedling recruitment, herbivory and soil microbial community composition. Widespread use of stem-mapped forest stand datasets is currently hampered by the lack of standardized, efficient and easy-to-use tools to calculate tree dynamics (e.g. growth, mortality) and the neighborhood metrics that impact them. We present the forestexplorR package that facilitates the munging, exploration, visualization and analysis of stem-mapped forest stands. By providing flexible, user-friendly functions that calculate neighborhood metrics and implement a recently-developed rapid-fitting tree growth and mortality model, forestexplorR broadens the accessibility of stem-mapped forest stand data. We demonstrate the functionality of forestexplorR by using it to investigate how the species identity of neighboring trees influences the growth rates of three common tree species in Mt Rainier National Park, WA, USA. forestexplorR is designed to facilitate researchers to incorporate spatially-explicit descriptions of tree communities in their studies and we expect this increased diversity of contributors to develop exciting new ways of using stem-mapped forest stand data.

AB  - Both bottom-up and top-down processes modulate plant communities. Fungal and oomycete pathogens are most common in global grasslands, and due to differences in their physiology, function, host range, and life cycles, they may differentially affect plants (in both intensity and direction). However, how fungal and oomycete pathogens regulate bottom-up and top-down effects on plant community biomass remains unclear. To this end, we conducted a 3-year field experiment in an alpine meadow incorporating mammalian herbivore exclosure, fungicide/oomyceticide application, and nitrogen addition treatments. We arranged 12 blocks with half randomly assigned to be mammalian herbivore exclosures (fenced to exclude grazing sheep), and the other half were fenced most of the year but not in winter (winter grazing control). Six 2.5 x 2.5 m square plots were established in each block, with each of the six plots assigned as control, nitrogen addition, fungicide application, oomyceticide application, nitrogen addition + fungicide application, and nitrogen addition + oomyceticide application. We found that fungicide application significantly increased plant community biomass (mainly Poaceae species) under nitrogen addition and promoted the bottom-up effect of nitrogen addition on plant community biomass by altering the community-weighted mean of plant height (via species turnover). Meanwhile, oomyceticide application significantly increased plant community biomass (mainly Poaceae species) when mammalian herbivores were excluded and weakened the top-down effect of winter grazing on plant community biomass by driving intraspecific variation in plant height. Our results highlight that fungal and oomycete pathogens play important (but differing) roles in mediating the effects of nutrient availability and higher trophic levels on plant community biomass. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that plant pathogen-related modulation of plant community biomass is achieved by alterations to plant height. Overall, this study combines both community and disease ecology to reveal complex interactions among higher trophic levels and their potential impacts on terrestrial ecosystem functioning under human disturbance.

AB  - Mountains harbour a disproportionate amount of biodiversity that is explained by both biotic and abiotic factors. Understanding the ultimate factors that shape these gradients including the interaction between trophic levels is important to highlight management practices that may help maintain biodiversity. Here we report an experiment carried out in a Pyrenean valley where a transhumant cattle herd grazes every year subalpine grasslands in a 700 m altitudinal range (1300-2000 m). In 2018 we measured species richness and abundance of plants and two groups of herbivorous insects (butterflies and grasshoppers) in 20 plots, and then we established 10 exclusion plots to study the effect of grazing during 2019 and 2020. Our results show that there were differences among the relative weight of abiotic and biotic factors that shape biodiversity gradients. Overall, the elevation gradient strongly affected plant, butterfly and grasshopper richness, as well as insect abundances. Plant and butterfly richness's were correlated via a cascading trophic effect while the slope played a very important role for grasshoppers. Livestock exclusion had a negative effect on plant richness through rapid growth of grass species but there were almost no changes in insect community composition after two years. The intra-annual effects of grazing showed early grazing to be positive for butterflies flying later during the season, as seen for a subset of plots within a narrow altitudinal range. In grazed plots, butterfly richness and abundance increased over the summer when the herd moved to alpine environments and exceeded those of non-grazed plots, indicating that a traditional transhumance management system can help sustain biodiversity in subalpine grasslands as a type of extensive grazing.Implications for insect conservation.Traditional grazing by transhumance systems allows grasslands maintenance in subalpine areas, which helps sustain butterfly and grasshopper populations.

AB  - Protected areas are the best strategy to conserve native biodiversity around the world. In Southeast Asia, most of the pristine tropical forest habitats are limited to terrestrial protected areas such as national parks and wildlife reserves. Endau Rompin National Park (ERNP) is one of undisturbed biodiversity-hotspots in the southern region of Peninsular Malaysia but surrounded by industrial oil palm plantations and threatened by habitat fragmentation. To date, little is known about the distribution and habitat requirement of wildlife, including those conservation priority species in the ERNP. This study aims to investigate the mammal distribution in the ERNP by estimating the probability of occurrence of a species among sampled sites. At 24 camera-trapping sites, we used passive infrared camera traps to detect the forest wildlife. We estimated wildlife occupancy by using singleseason occupancy analysis while considering of imperfect detection and relating it to stand- and landscapelevel variables. We detected 26 species of native wild animals in the study area including several conservation priority species such as Asian elephant, Asian tapir, and Malayan tiger. The site occupancy of conservationpriority species attests to ERNP's status as an important regional biodiversity hotspot. The detection probabilities of wildlife species were highly sensitive to specific ecological variables at stand- and landscape-level. Our data indicated that tree canopy cover, forest edges, adjacent human settlements, and riparian habitats (e.g., stream and river) are crucial for the persistence of the native wildlife species. Our results suggest that pristine forest habitat such as those typical to the ERNP are critical for wildlife conservation. We suggest that the standand landscape-level ecological variables are considered in the conservation planning to protect the forest biodiversity and ecological integrity of the national park and other terrestrial protected areas in the tropics.

AB  - Extensive research has elucidated the effects of plant diversity on small invertebrate consumers; however, the corresponding impacts on large generalist herbivores remain comparatively under-explored. This gap is particularly notable in the context of dietary variations across different species of sympatric large generalist herbivores. Given the prevalence and crucial role of domestic herbivores in grassland ecosystems, our study experimentally investigated the dietary variation, either in terms of partitioning or overlap, between cooccurring cattle and sheep across a range of plant diversity gradients. Our results demonstrated a significant expansion in the dietary niche breadth of cattle and sheep with increased plant diversity. However, the dietary expansion of the two large herbivore species with available plant diversity did not increase interspecific overlap. Rather, cattle and sheep mainly exploited the same resources in different proportions by this augmented plant diversity, leading to significantly reduced dietary niche overlap and thereby facilitating dietary partitioning between them. Our results underscore the critical role of preserving high plant diversity in facilitating dietary partitioning among large herbivores. This could enhance the synergistic effects of cattle and sheep grazing on plant communities. Our study also has important implications for the management of livestock grazing, suggesting that adopting mixed grazing of cattle and sheep in grasslands with high plant diversity could be more beneficial than in low-diversity grasslands.

AB  - To predict species responses to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change, it is reasonable to use species with high sensitivity to such factors. Snow sheep (Ovis nivicola) could represent a good candidate for this; as the only large herbivore species adapted to the cold and alpine habitats of northeastern Siberia, it plays a crucial role in its ecosystem. Despite having an extensive geographical distribution among all ovine species, it is one of the least studied. In this study, we sequenced and analysed six genomes of snow sheep in combination with all other wild sheep species to infer key aspects of their evolutionary history and unveil the genetic basis of their adaptation to subarctic environments. Despite their large census population size, snow sheep genomes showed remarkably low heterozygosity, which could reflect the effect of isolation and historical bottlenecks that we inferred using the pairwise sequential Markovian coalescent and runs of homozygosity. F-4-statistics indicated instances of introgression involving snow sheep with argali (Ovis ammon) and Dall (Ovis dalli) sheep, suggesting that these species might have been more widespread during the Pleistocene. Furthermore, the introgressed segments, which were identified using mainly minimum relative node depth, covered genes associated with immunity, adipogenesis and morphology-related traits, representing potential targets of adaptive introgression. Genes related to mitochondrial functions and thermogenesis associated with adipose tissue were identified to be under selection. Overall, our data suggest introgression as a mechanism facilitating adaptation in wild sheep species and provide insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying cold adaptation in snow sheep.

AB  - Livestock grazing is often perceived as being detrimental to the quality and functioning of dryland ecosystems. For example, a study in a semiarid Kenyan savanna proposed that cattle form bare spaces throughout the landscape, which indicate ecosystem degradation. Other studies, conducted in north-eastern Spain, where climatic conditions range between semiarid and Mediterranean subhumid, reported that sheep and goat trails have increased the emergence of rill erosion processes. Sometimes, this negative perception is extended to include wild, large ungulate herbivores as well. Here, we challenge this perception by highlighting the generally nonadverse and even ameliorative impacts of moderate animal rate on geoecosystem functioning of hilly drylands. Specifically, trampling routes (also known as treading paths, livestock terracettes, cattle trails, migration tracks, cowtours, etc.) formed across hillslopes by grazing animals-being either domesticated livestock or native large herbivores-transform the original two-phase vegetation mosaic of shrubby patches and interpatch spaces into a three-phase mosaic. The animal routes increase the complexity of ecosystem, by strengthening the spatial redistribution of water and soil resources at the patch scale and decreasing hydrological connectivity at the hillslope scale. As a consequence, the animal routes improve functioning of hilly drylands and increase their resilience to long-term droughts and climatic change. Therefore, instead of viewing the animal routes as degraded spots, they should be perceived at a wider perspective that allows to properly understand their overall role in sustaining dryland geoecosystems.

AB  - Understanding the effects of habitat heterogeneity on the functioning of macrobenthic communities is essential to the conservation of biodiversity in coastal ecosystems. However, the effects of habitat heterogeneity on the functional trait composition and diversity of seagrass bed macrobenthos are as scarce. In the present study, functional diversity indices (i.e., functional dispersion, functional richness, and Rao's quadratic entropy), RLQ analysis, and fourth-corner analysis indicated that macrobenthic functional trait composition and diversity differ among seagrass bed microhabitats (interior, edge, and bare sediment). More specifically, functional traits were more evenly distributed in the seagrass bed interior and edge habitats, when compared to bare sediment, and functional diversity was significantly higher (p < 0.01). Functional trait distributions were influenced by envi-ronmental parameters (e.g., total organic carbon, organic matter, and grain size). Suspension-feeding and bur-rowing bivalves preferentially inhabited bare sediment with high sand content and low TOC, whereas herbivorous, small, and sensitive species mainly inhabited muddy sediments with higher organic supply.

AB  - Drought frequency and severity have notably increased in the Mediterranean basin throughout the 20th century, thereby impacting freshwater sources and forest regrowth, which are crucial for woodland mammal survival. We used camera trapping data collected from a mountain range in NE Spain from 2018 to 2023 (coinciding with an extreme drought event) to test whether freshwater sources, such as ponds and springs, act as biodiversity refuges for woodland mammals during extreme drought. Meteorological conditions during the study, such as accumulated precipitation, air temperature anomalies, air humidity and Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), were used to predict mammal activity, richness and diversity using linear mixed-effect models. We detected eight common species including wild boar (Sus scrofa, 48% of all detections), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus, 28%) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes, 10%). Contrary to our expectation, mammal activity was unaffected by the presence of freshwater sources. Our findings show that the presence of freshwater sources did not generally alleviate negative effects of drought on animal activity and diversity. These results may emerge because traditionally permanent freshwater sources in Mediterranean ecosystems (such as springs and ponds) have dried up during the extreme 2021-2023 drought, halting its function as biodiversity refugia for woodland mammals. Our results highlight the impact of extreme weather conditions on mammal activity and will help managers create more effective conservation strategies for mammals under increasingly dry conditions.

AB  - Domestic animals have immense economic, cultural, and practical value and have played pivotal roles in the development of human civilization. Many domesticates have, among their wild relatives, undomesticated forms representative of their ancestors. Resurgent interest in these ancestral forms has highlighted the unclear genetic status of many, and some are threatened with extinction by hybridization with domestic conspecifics. We considered the contemporary status of these ancestral forms relative to their scientific, practical, and ecological importance; the varied impacts of wild-domestic hybridization; and the challenges and potential resolutions involved in conservation efforts. Identifying and conserving ancestral forms, particularly with respect to disentangling patterns of gene flow from domesticates, is complex because of the lack of available genomic and phenotypic baselines. Comparative behavioral, ecological, and genetic studies of ancestral-type, feral, and domestic animals should be prioritized to establish the contemporary status of the former. Such baseline information will be fundamental in ensuring successful conservation efforts.

AB  - Although grazing is the most common use of grassland, the ecological function of grassland far exceeds its productivity. Therefore, the protection of plant diversity is of the utmost importance and cannot be ignored. Existing research on the effect of grazing on grassland mainly focuses on grazing intensity and the type of livestock, but the consequences of the timing of the grazing on the vegetation community remains unclear. We investigated plant community characteristics of winter pastures in alpine meadow with different grazing termination times (grazing before and during the grassland greenup periods) in Maqu County, eastern QTP. The results showed that vegetation height, coverage, aboveground biomass and Graminoid biomass were lower in grassland when grazing happened during the greenup period compared to grassland where grazing was terminated before the greenup period. However, the total plant species richness and forbs richness were higher in grassland with grazing during the greenup period compared to grassland without grazing during the greenup period. Our structural equation modeling reveals a potential indirect implication for the total plant species richness and forbs richness of winter pastures mainly through a decrease in the vegetation coverage and grass biomass abundance. Our findings imply that grazing during the grassland greenup period may facilitate the maintenance of plant diversity in winter pastures. These findings have important implications for grassland ecosystem functioning and for the conservation of plant diversity.

AB  - Musk deer ( Moschus spp.) are widely known for its musk and are globally endangered as a result of poaching, habitat loss, and fragmentation. To facilitate restoration of the alpine musk deer (M. M. chrysogaster) ) in existing areas, reliable estimates of population size and influencing factors are essential to assess effectiveness of conservation interventions, particularly for isolated musk deer populations in patches. In this paper, we used line transect and camera trap data collected from 2020 to 2022 in the Helan mountains to assess the population status and characterized the influencing factors of alpine musk deer. Our findings indicate that musk deer are patchily distributed in three areas of high elevation, with the population limited to less than 200 individuals, remaining below historic levels (compared to 1995). There was a significant positive correlation between the role of sympatric species on musk deer, with red fox ( Vulpes vulpes), ), badger ( Meles meles) ) and blue eared-pheasant ( Crossoptilon auritum) ) having a significant effect on the out-modeled pathway. Variable but insignificant effects of anthropogenic activities were observed across all species categories, which could be due to mutual adaptation over time. Our results imply that the recovery of sensitive population in island-like habitats remains challenging and may be exacerbated by limited environment and resources. Our study underscores the necessity of establishing ecological corridors to enhance habitat connectivity for alpine musk deer, undertaking conservation genetics research on isolated populations, controlling stray dogs to maintain interspecific balance, and implementing electronic fencing to mitigate human disturbance and resource competition. This study provides basic information for understanding the population status of alpine musk deer and offers insights for conservation efforts.

AB  - Despite continued interest in mixed-species groups, we still lack a unified understanding of how ecological and social processes work across scales to influence group formation. Recent work has revealed ecological correlates of mixed-species group formation, but the mechanisms by which concomitant social dynamics produce these patterns, if at all, is unknown. Here, we use camera trap data for six mammalian grazer species in Serengeti National Park. Building on previous work, we found that ecological variables, and especially forage quality, influenced the chances of species overlap over small spatio-temporal scales (i.e. on the scales of several metres and hours). Migratory species (gazelle, wildebeest and zebra) were more likely to have heterospecific partners available in sites with higher forage quality, but the opposite was true for resident species (buffalo, hartebeest and topi). These findings illuminate the circumstances under which mixed-species group formation is even possible. Next, we found that greater heterospecific availability was associated with an increased probability of mixed-species group formation in gazelle, hartebeest, wildebeest and zebra, but ecological variables did not further shape these patterns. Overall, our results are consistent with a model whereby ecological and social drivers of group formation are species-specific and operate on different spatio-temporal scales. This article is part of the theme issue 'Mixed-species groups and aggregations: shaping ecological and behavioural patterns and processes'.

AB  - The Cerrado confronts threats such as fire and frost due to natural or human-induced factors. These disturbances trigger attribute changes that impact biodiversity. Given escalating climate extremes, understanding the effects of these phenomena on ecological relationships is crucial for biodiversity conservation. To understand how fire and frost affect interactions and influence biological communities in the Cerrado, our study aimed to comprehend the effects of these two disturbances on extrafloral nectar (EFN)-bearing plants (Ouratea spectabilis, Ochnaceae) and their interactions. Our main hypothesis was that plants affected by fire would grow again more quickly than those affected only by frost due to the better adaptation of Cerrado flora to fire. The results showed that fire accelerated the regrowth of O. spectabilis. Regrowth in plants with EFNs attracted ants that proved to be efficient in removing herbivores, significantly reducing foliar herbivory rates in this species, when compared to the species without EFNs, or when ant access was prevented through experimental manipulation. Post-disturbance ant and herbivore populations were low, with frost leading to greater reductions. Ant richness and diversity are higher where frost precedes fire, suggesting that fire restores Cerrado ecological interactions better than frost, with less impact on plants, ants, and herbivores.

AB  - We studied the effects of vegetation species richness, diversity, and structure on grassland arthropod communities of 23 sites in northeastern South Dakota and southeastern North Dakota. Sites were selected to represent a vegetation species diversity gradient, and three vegetation cover types, including native unseeded grassland, low-diversity seeding known as dense nesting cover (DNC) for waterfowl, and high-diversity seed mix. During July of 2016, pan traps and sweep nets were used to survey the grassland arthropod community. A total of 25,521 arthropods representing 107 taxonomic families were collected. Richness, diversity, and biomass of arthropods did not differ among cover types. Vegetation richness and diversity, cover type, percent live vegetation and native cover, and litter depth were important predictors of arthropod community measures, and multivariate analysis of the arthropod community indicated significant differences between native and DNC study sites; explained by differences in vegetation richness, percent forb cover, and litter depth. Results of our study suggest that species richness of grassland restoration seeding mixes likely impacts arthropod richness and diversity, and DNC does not produce arthropod communities similar to native prairie. Additionally, because vegetation structural variables were important determinants of arthropod community measures, grassland management practices will influence the resulting arthropod community and influence the success of grassland restoration using high-diversity seed mixes. Results of our study promote the potential for successful restoration outcomes using high-diversity seed mixes, and indicate that low-diversity, non-native seed mixes, such as DNC, do not fully restore native grassland arthropod communities.

AB  - The dung microbiome is a complex system that is highly influenced by species and diet. This study characterized the dung bacterial and fungal communities of five herbivore species inhabiting the National Park Zuid-Kennemerland, the Netherlands. The five selected herbivore species were rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.), cow (Bos taurus L.), horse (Equus ferus caballus L.), fallow deer (Dama dama L.), and European bison (Bison bonasus L.). We explored the effects of distinct digestive physiology (ruminants vs. non-ruminants) and diverse dietary preferences on the microbial community composition of herbivore dung. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were dominant bacterial phyla in the dung of all five herbivore species, and Ascomycota was the predominant fungal phylum. Verrucomicrobiota and Mucoromycota were more present in horse dung and Proteobacteria were more abundant in rabbit dung than the three ruminant dung types. There were few significant differences in the microbial community structure among the three ruminant dung types. The alpha and beta diversity of dung microbial communities significantly differed between ruminants and non-ruminants, especially in bacterial communities. Based on MetaCyc pathways, we found that the primary functions of bacteria in herbivore dung were focused on biosynthesis, various super pathways, and degradation, with a few differences between ruminant and non-ruminant dung. FUNGuild analysis showed that horse dung had more saprotrophic fungi, while the fungi in fallow deer dung had more symbiotrophic properties, with the fungal functions of bison, cow, and rabbit dung somewhere in between. There was also a correlation between microbial community and nutrient composition of the substrate in herbivore dung. Understanding the dung microbial community composition of these herbivore species can enrich the database of mammalian gut microbiomes for studying the mechanisms of microbial community variation while preparing for exploring a new perspective to study the impact of herbivores on ecosystems through dung deposition.

AB  - Recent global declines of pollinator populations have highlighted the importance of pollinators, which are undervalued despite essential contributions to ecosystem services. To identify critical knowledge gaps about pollinators, we describe the state of knowledge about responses of pollinators and their foraging and nesting resources to historical natural disturbances and new stressors in Great Plains grasslands and riparian ecosystems. In addition, we also provide information about pollinator management and research needs to guide efforts to sustain pollinators and by extension, flowering vegetation, and other ecosystem services of grasslands. Although pollinator responses varied, pollinator specialists of disturbancesensitive plants tended to decline in response to disturbance. Management with grazing and fire overall may benefit pollinators of grasslands, depending on many factors; however, we recommend habitat and population monitoring to assess outcomes of these disturbances on small, isolated pollinator populations. The influences and interactions of drought and increasingly variable weather patterns, pesticides, and domesticated bees on pollinators are complex and understudied. Nonetheless, habitat management and restoration can reduce effects of stressors and augment floral and nesting resources for pollinators. Research needs include expanding information about 1) the distribution, abundance, trends, and intraregional variability of most pollinator species; 2) floral and nesting resources critical to support pollinators; 3) implications of different rangeland management approaches; 4) effects of missing and reestablished resources in altered and restored vegetation; and 5) disentangling the relative influence of interacting disturbances and stressors on pollinator declines. Despite limited research in the Great Plains on many of these topics, consideration of pollinator populations and their habitat needs in management plans is critical now to reduce future pollinator declines and promote recovery.

AB  - Semi-arid vegetation is predominant in Mexico, and the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve is considered one of the most biodiverse semiarid protected areas in the country. The objectives of our study were to evaluate the diversity of ground-dwelling birds through the opportunistic use of camera traps set for monitoring mammal species, and to determine the relationship between bird diversity and 4 environmental variables (distance to rivers, tree cover, shrub cover, and environmental heterogeneity) and 5 anthropogenic variables (distance to roads, human settlements, and agricultural zones, and numbers of cows, donkeys, goats, and people) within the La Canada region, located inside this reserve. We used bird records from 93 camera-trapping stations taken over the period 2011-2016.111 order to evaluate the relationship of bird diversity with environmental variables, a subgroup of 36 camera traps was selected and analyzed using generalized linear models. We recorded a total of 30 bird species in >1,368 photographic records collected over 33.000 camera-trap-days. These birds belonged to 14 orders, 22 families, and represented 23% of the total number of species known to occur in La Cafiada. A Clench species accumulation model estimated 38.5 ground-dwelling birds. Record frequency varied significantly among vegetation types and was greater in the crassicaule scrub and tropical deciduous forest (79% of the records). The diversity indices were higher closer to the rivers, and in areas with greater tree coverage and low human activity. High environmental heterogeneity positively influenced the higher diversity of ground-dwelling birds compared to that of sites at greater distance from water bodies or with little vegetation cover. Noninvasive techniques, such as camera-trapping, could be a complementary method for evaluating ground-dwelling bird activity, occupancy, and habitat use. We also recommend that similar opportunistic data of considerable biological and ecological value be published rather than simply archived.

AB  - Home range and home range overlap can be used to describe use of space and movement of wildlife. During the last years, advancements in technology have greatly improved our understanding of animal movement, especially among large herbivores. Wild ungulate abundance and distribution have increased in temperate areas. Moreover, their diseases-including sarcoptic mange in the Iberian Ibex (Capra pyrenaica)-have become a cause of concern for livestock, public health, and wildlife conservation. In this study, we first reviewed existing literature on the home range of species in the genus Capra. We then analyzed data from 52 GPS-GSM-collared Iberian ibexes, of which 33 were healthy and 19 were affected by sarcoptic mange from 3 different populations in the southeastern Iberian Peninsula to analyze: (1) differences in size and characteristics of home ranges obtained by the 3 most commonly used methodologies-minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimation, and Brownian bridges movement models (BBMMs); and (2) the impact of endemic sarcoptic mange on Iberian Ibex home range. The literature review revealed that available information on spatial behavior of Capra spp. was based only on 3 species, including the Iberian Ibex, estimated through a diversity of methods which made it difficult to compare results. We found positive correlations among the different home range estimation methods in the Iberian Ibex, with BBMMs proving to be the most accurate. This study is the first to use BBMMs for estimating home range in this species, and it revealed a marked seasonal behavior in spatial use, although sarcoptic mange smoothed such seasonal pattern. The seasonal overlaps obtained suggest that core areas of the Iberian Ibex change within wider home range areas, which are ecological parameters relevant to identifying key areas for species management and conservation.
   Scientific literature regarding spatial behavior of ibex species revealed that estimations were developed through a diversity of methods which made it difficult to compare results. For our study species, Iberian Ibex, we found positive correlations among the different home range estimation methods. Iberian Ibex showed a marked seasonal behavior in spatial use, and sarcoptic mange slightly affected this behavior.

AB  - The overpopulation of large herbivorous mammals degrades understory vegetation and hence promotes soil erosion in some northern hemisphere forests. Topsoil removal via erosion reduces soil water and nitrogen (N) content as well as exposes tree roots. However, whether topsoil removal inhibits tree growth through water and N uptake limitations has not been examined. This study aimed to measure the vertical length from exposed roots surface to the soil surface (exposed root height; ERH) under degraded forest understory vegetation and to evaluate its influence on tree growth. Specifically, we examined the relationships between ERH and beech growth and identified the timing of growth reduction based on annual tree-ring analysis at the individual scale. Furthermore, we discussed the effects of water and N limitations on beech growth reduction. We studied 12 Japanese beech trees on Mt. Sanpo, southern Kyushu Island, Japan, where understory vegetation was degraded and lost due to herbivory by Japanese sika deer from 1980 to 2003. Lower amounts of leaf production and relative growth rates of stem basal area increment (BAI) were observed in beech trees with higher ERH. Segmented regression analysis, which detects the changing time of a temporal trend (i.e., break-point), revealed that the BAI has resulted in a decreasing trend after 1997.6 +/- 9.0 (yr), which coincided with the field obser-vations on understory degradation in the study site. After the break-point of the BAI, the BAI of each study tree was negatively related to intrinsic water use efficiency, an integrated index of water limitation. These results suggest that soil erosion after the degradation of understory vegetation reduced beech growth, possibly because of the water limitations associated with root exposure. Reduced beech growth will reduce the supply of the litter layer that prevents topsoil erosion, which may enhance further soil erosion and tree growth reduction.

AB  - The Argentine Puna is an example of rewilding of the herbivore community, with wild camelids recovering (mainly vicun similar to as, Vicugna vicugna and guanacos Lama guanicoe) while livestock decreases. Peatlands are the most diverse ecosystem in the region and are key resources for herbivores. Here, we tested the hypothesis that her-bivore rewilding is associated with higher biodiversity of three biological groups: plants, aquatic macro-invertebrates, and birds. We sampled 50 peatlands distributed in the Argentine Puna, along an elevation range from 3200 to 4700 m asl. Using Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), we developed a "wilderness index" that combines different proxies of pastoral use (herbivore feces, "puestos", accessibility to human set-tlements, field counts of herbivores). In general, the diversity of the different groups was negatively correlated with elevation and positively correlated with peatland area, thus we used the residuals of a model to control for these two variables and test for the correlation between biodiversity patterns (Shannon index and richness) and peatland wilderness index. Contrary to our expectations, diversity of plant and macroinvertebrate communities' showed slightly negative statistically significant correlations with wilderness, while birds showed no statistical association. Potential explanations for this pattern include (1) diversity of microhabitats generated by a more diverse herbivore's community associated with livestock (e.g., different trampling, browsing, and movement patterns, effects on water quality through feces), (2) management of hydrological regimes and stocking rates to provide stability, (3) herbivory dynamics that promote the dominance of certain plants. Overall, the results reject the hypothesis that herbivore rewilding automatically results in biodiversity gains, and emphasize the impor-tance of understanding the socio-ecological mechanisms by which human land use (including exotic livestock) contributes to the biodiversity maintenance in these key ecosystems.

AB  - Carrion can have disproportionally large effects on ecological processes and community dynamics. During decomposition, the influx of growth-limiting nutrients can create small-scale disturbances with high soil cover known as 'cadaver decomposition islands' (CDIs). Such disturbances can allow for altered plant species composition, increased biomass production or provide microsites for regeneration. Carcasses also provide a resource for omnivorous scavengers, which have the potential to direct endozoochorous seed dispersal towards developing CDIs. In this study, we investigated functional links between the scavenger community, carcass-induced disturbances in vegetation and the seedling establishment of berry-producing ericaceous species. We experimentally placed out 30 vertebrate carcasses of various species in a boreal forest ecosystem, each paired with a control and a mechanically disturbed plot to track vertebrate animal activity (i.e. dispersal vectors), vegetation changes (i.e. recruitment windows) and seedling establishment. We hypothesized that carcass size and season of experimental deposition would affect (H1) scavenger community composition and (H2) formation of CDIs, and that (H3) seedling establishment of ericaceous species is more abundant at CDIs compared with control or disturbed plots without carcass deposition. We found that carcass presence effectively created a spatiotemporal hotspot of animal activity and that 94% of observations of vertebrates at carcasses were of species with the potential for ericaceous seed dispersal. Larger carcasses (e.g. moose, reindeer) attracted similar and abundant vertebrate communities, whereas observations at small carcasses (e.g. red fox) resembled those at control plots (H1). Only larger carcasses led to CDI formation (i.e. potential recruitment microsites), while plots with small carcasses resembled control plots (H2). Surprisingly, the season of carcass deposition did not influence vertebrate composition at carcass plots or CDI formation (H1-2). Seedlings were significantly more abundant in CDIs compared with mechanical disturbance and control plots (H3). Overall, CDIs contained about 4 and 19 times more seedlings compared with disturbed and controls, respectively. Our study demonstrates how individual carcasses in a boreal forest landscape can facilitate sexual reproduction in ericaceous keystone species. We suggest that this pathway also occurs in other ecosystems and that it may contribute to the genetic diversity of plant populations.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Plant-insect interactions play a crucial role in shaping terrestrial ecosystems, influencing abundance and distribution of plant species. In the present study, we investigated leaf-mining patterns on fossil leaves from Pliocene strata of the Mahuadanr Valley, Jharkhand, eastern India, deposited under a seasonal tropical climate, and reported complex interactions between plants and insects. We identified 11 distinct mining morphotypes. These morphotypes were mainly found on Dipterocarpaceae, Fabaceae, Lauraceae, and Moraceae; similar mining traces were also observed in the contemporary vegetation surrounding the fossil site. Although mining richness was relatively high, only 2.6% of all leaves in the fossil assemblage were mined. We compared mining richness and abundance values with previously reported values for galling. While richness was slightly lower for galling, almost 50% of all fossil leaves were galled. A literature survey on mining and galling patterns in modern vegetation suggests that there is no global explanation for richness of mining or gall-inducing insects. Thus, low nutrient availability in the ancient forest, dominance of semideciduous leaves with hard texture, and different habitats in the same forest ecosystem, such as well-drained forests and riparian stands, may all have favored different types of specialized plant-insect interactions.
   We investigated mining diversity in a Pliocene leaf assemblage of India and compared it to galling diversity; both functional feeding groups were relatively rich, but mining was much less abundant. Among possible factors determining the observed high galling intensity, we emphasized the role of semideciduous leaves with a hard texture, typical of tropical dry deciduous forests, as suitable hosts for gall-inducing insects.image

AB  - Anthropogenic activities such as cattle grazing and forest clearing have led to the establishment of early successional grass layers in some native forests, which may inhibit or entirely prevent native tree regeneration. We hypothesize that increased grass coverage reduces or eliminates the establishment of native tree seedlings by limiting water availability to seeds and seedlings. This study aims to evaluate the impact of grass cover on tree seedling survival under varying levels of soil water stress. We conducted a field experiment using 36 experimental exclosures in two northwest Patagonian valleys, representing a regional gradient in altitude, rainfall, and tree canopy openness. Additionally, a greenhouse experiment was performed with 36 pots, manipulating four levels of grass cover and three levels of water stress. Results from both experiments showed similarities: in the field, the likelihood of finding a live tree seedling was approximately 2.78 times higher in areas without grass compared with grass-covered sites. In the greenhouse, the presence of grass reduced the final number of established seedlings by an average of 43% across all irrigation levels, indicating significant water competition. These findings suggest that management practices promoting grass invasion could severely hinder tree regeneration in forests not adapted to large herbivore intensive grazing. Such situation may be exacerbated in regions suffering water limitation in the growing season or where the climate change would intensify water stress.

AB  - Fires and grazing disrupt the diversity and composition of biological organisms and their functions in the savannas. In the current study, we assessed the impact of fire and grazing intensities on the abundance, species richness and assemblages of eight functional groups of arthropods in Kruger National Park. Pitfalls and active searches were used to collect arthropods at the experimental burnt plots (EBPs) and grazed plots that were undisturbed, minimally or heavily disturbed in Mopane and Skukuza regions. Omnivores constituted the highest proportion (40 %) of individuals, whilst detritivores, granivores, hematophagous, herbivores, nectarivores, predators and scavengers constituted between 0.5 % and 31.4 %. The abundance, species richness and assemblages of different functional groups significantly varied among EBPs and grazed sites in Mopane and Skukuza. The abundance and species richness of arthropods were higher at EBPs compared to grazed plots in Mopane and Skukuza. Furthermore, abundance was higher at the undisturbed compared to disturbed plots and a contrary pattern was observed for species richness. Results showed a distinct variation in the assemblage of detritivores, nectarivores, omnivores and predators between EBPs and grazed plots, with a clear separation between Mopane and Skukuza. However, the composition of granivores and herbivores was neither influenced by fires nor grazing in the Mopane and Skukuza. The intensity of disturbances by fire and grazing failed to drive arthropod assemblages within different functional groups. We conclude that fire and grazing are potent drivers of assemblages of arthropod functional groups in Afrotropical savannas requiring evidence-based manipulation for the conservation of key species.

AB  - The Late Upper Palaeolithic of Europe, particularly the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: 26-19 kyr cal BP), was a time of dramatic climatic changes. Fauna, and the humans that preyed on them, were forced to adapt their behaviours in response to climate changes to survive. The Cantabrian Region of northern Spain was continuously inhabited during this period when many other areas of Europe were inhospitable. The site of Las Caldas (Asturias) was repeatedly occupied by hunter-gatherers during the Solutrean (26.1-20.3 kyr cal BP) and Magdalenian (18.5-14.3 kyr cal BP). This paper uses delta C-13 and delta N-1(5) stable isotope analysis of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) remains to reconstruct past environments, ungulate niches and habitats, and to understand how this impacted on their availability as a prey source. Results show that during the Solutrean, cold and potentially wet LGM conditions were experienced and ibex lived in lower altitudes, likely due to reduced vegetation, and even small glaciers on the higher mountain slopes. Improved environmental conditions in the Magdalenian allowed ibex to live in their preferred habitat of higher altitudes. Ameliorated Late Glacial conditions correspond with changing economic hunting strategies at the site. Humans exploited wider ecological zones, over larger distances, which coincides with population growth, and greater connectivity across the Cantabrian region. This research highlights the importance of characterising the complex interactions between humans, animals and environments during the Late Pleistocene and how they responded to rapidly changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Declining temperate forest biodiversity is a global challenge to future sustainability and resilience. Canopy tree diversity has declined in northern hardwood forests (NHFs) of the Great Lakes region since European colonization, with current tree regeneration patterns suggesting this trend may continue. However, regional (10(6) ha) patterns and drivers are underexplored. We used data from 141 managed NHF stands, Michigan, USA, to examine diversity indices across tree size classes (seedling, sapling, and canopy); stand-level drivers of regeneration (seedling and sapling) diversity and individual species density; and patterns among species in relative abundances across size classes. Diversity was similar across size classes (mean asymptotic species richness of 6-7 species and <3 effective common species); however, some species contributing to sapling diversity are unlikely to contribute to future canopy diversity (Fraxinus americana and Fagus grandifolia, insect/pathogen limited; Ostrya virginiana, small maximum size). For the 11 most common species, conspecific canopy density (+, seedlings, significant for 10 species) and stand basal area (-, saplings, 3 species) most consistently associated with density; deer use, site quality, and substrate were less predictive. Patterns of relative density by size class among 18 species present on >10% of sites were consistent with species life history strategy and/or establishment/recruitment barriers. For seven species (including Tsuga canadensis, Betula alleghaniensis), relative density was lowest in the seedling layer, suggesting seedling establishment substrate and/or early shade mortality limitations. For two species (Acer saccharum, Quercus rubra), reduced sapling relative density compared with seedling or canopy strata suggests a sapling recruitment bottleneck from deer browsing/shade, whereas six species (e.g., F. grandifolia, O. virginiana, Pinus strobus) had highest relative density for saplings, suggesting sapling to canopy recruitment limitations. Lastly, seedlings were relatively most dense for Acer rubrum and Prunus spp., indicating disproportionally high seedling establishment, if not sapling or canopy recruitment, and for F. americana, consistent with recent pest-related canopy mortality. Collectively our analyses suggest sustained low diversity and shifting composition are driven by limited local seed availability, limited seedling establishment substrate, deep shading, and abundant deer. Management aimed at overcoming these limitations may be necessary to promote future NHF resilience.

AB  - The interspecific plant interactions along grazing and aridity stress gradients represent a major research issue in plant ecology. However, the combined effects of these two factors on plant-plant interactions have been poorly studied in the northeast of Iran. To fill this knowledge gap, 144 plots were established in 12 study sites with different grazing intensities (high vs. low) and climatic characteristics (arid vs. semiarid) in northeastern Iran. A dominant shrub, Artemisia kopetdaghensis, was selected as the model species. Further, we studied changes in plant life strategies along the combined grazing and aridity stress gradients. In this study, we used relative interaction indices calculated for species richness, Shannon diversity, and species cover to determine plant-plant interactions using linear mixed-effect models (LMM). The indicator species analysis was used to identify the indicator species for the undercanopy of shrub and for the adjacent open areas. The combined effects of grazing and aridity affected the plant-plant interactions and plant life strategies (CSR) of indicator species. A. kopetdaghensis showed the highest facilitation effect under high stress conditions (high grazing, high aridity), which turned into competition under the low stress conditions (low grazing, low aridity). In the arid region, the canopy of the shrub protected ruderals, annual forbs, and grasses in both high and low grazing intensities. In the semiarid region and high grazing intensity (low aridity/high grazing), the shrubs protected mostly perennial forbs with C-strategy. Our findings highlight the importance of context-dependent shrub management to restore the vegetation damaged by the intensive grazing.

AB  - Deer overpopulation is occurring worldwide, and deer-induced soil runoff into streams increases levels of sus-pended sediment and fine sedimentation. While deer-induced fine sedimentation in depositional habitats including first-and fourth-order streams is known to alter macroinvertebrate communities, effects of drifting suspended sediment in erosional habitats between the stream orders are poorly understood. Here, habitat and macroinvertebrate community structures in first-to third-order streams were compared between deer-excluded and grazed catchments of a Japanese headwater system. Fine sediment cover on the streambed was significantly greater in the grazed catchments than the deer-excluded catchment only for first-order streams, while macro-invertebrate community structure differed distinctly between the deer-excluded and grazed catchments at all stream orders. Burrowing collector-gatherers, which inhabit fine streambed sediments, were less abundant in first-order streams in the deer-excluded catchment than the grazed catchments, while clinging collector-filterers, which are vulnerable to suspended sediment inputs, were more abundant in second-and third-order streams of the deer-excluded catchment than the grazed catchments. These results suggest that the effect of deer exclusion on stream ecosystems varies with longitudinal changes in sediment deposition and transport capacity. Hydro-geomorphological processes are thus fundamental to assessing the restoration of forest-stream ecosystems, particularly in spatiotemporally dynamic headwater systems.

AB  - Amphibian larvae can affect the structure and functioning of freshwater ecosystems, but their effects have been little explored although amphibian biodiversity is rapidly declining. Given that larvae of different amphibian species belong to different trophic levels, their effects on freshwater communities and processes can be expected to differ, with herbivores likely having direct effects on algae and predators having indirect effects through trophic cascades. We explored this question through a mesocosm experiment conducted in montane ponds, using an anuran and a urodele species affected by emergent diseases. We used different scenarios of reduction and loss of one or both species, and compared them to a control scenario representing a typical amphibian community in the study area composed of four species, with total larval density held constant. Loss of the anuran resulted in lower chlorophyll concentration and algal density, likely due to replacement by more efficient grazers. Loss of the urodele produced similar trends but weaker, possibly due to an increase of invertebrate grazing activity in the absence of this predator. Our study shows how the loss of amphibian species can alter the structure of montane ponds, but also how the mechanisms involved and the intensity of effects differ for different species.

AB  - Invertebrate herbivores are important and diverse, and their abundance and impacts will likely shift under climate change. Yet, past studies of invertebrate herbivory have documented highly variable responses to changing temperature, making it challenging to predict the direction and magnitude of these shifts. One explanation for these responses is that changing environmental conditions drive concurrent changes in plant communities and herbivore traits. The impacts of changing temperature on herbivory might therefore depend on how temperature combines and interacts with characteristics of plant and herbivore communities. To test this, we surveyed damage to leaves by invertebrate herbivores on 4400 plant individuals in 220 sampling plots along a 1101 m elevational gradient. Increasing temperature drove community-level herbivory via at least three overlapping mechanisms: increasing temperature directly reduced herbivory, indirectly affected herbivory by reducing plant-community phylogenetic diversity, and indirectly affected herbivory by altering the effects of plant-community functional and phylogenetic diversity on herbivory. Consequently, increasing plant functional diversity reduced herbivory in colder environments while increasing plant phylogenetic diversity increased herbivory in warmer environments. Moreover, different herbivore feeding guilds varied in their response to temperature and plant community composition. These results indicate that, even along a single elevation gradient in a single year, a variety of mechanisms can concurrently drive herbivory, thereby supporting the hypothesis that a universal response of herbivory to changing environmental conditions is unlikely to exist. Instead, our results highlight the importance of considering both plant and herbivore community context to predict how climate change will alter invertebrate herbivory.

AB  - Understanding how the community structures and functions of soil microbes respond to environmental changes is essential for predicting the dynamics of ecosystem functions. Elevational gradients are an ideal setting for "natural experiments" on the relationships between soil microbes and environmental factors. However, little is known about elevational patterns of soil microbial functions and their interactions with aboveground vegetation. We examined community structures and nitrogen cycling gene abundance of soil bacteria in 20 vegetation survey quadrats in cool-temperate and sub-alpine forests along an elevational gradient (1050-2000 m above sea level) in central Japan. The diversity of soil bacterial communities was investigated based on terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP) in the 16S rRNA gene. The abundance of soil bacteria and key functional groups involved in nitrogen cycling was determined by quantifying the 16S rRNA and bacterial genes related to nitrogen fixation (nifH), ammonia oxidation (amoA), and denitrification (nosZ). The terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) richness of soil bacteria showed no relationship with elevation, but was negatively associated with soil nitrate-nitrogen and the species richness of understory vegetation. The abundance of all bacteria and nitrogen functional groups showed hump-shaped relationships with elevation, and was positively associated with soil water content and understory stem density. These results highlight that community structures and nitrogen cycling gene abundance of soil microbes along the elevational gradient can be explained by soil properties associated with understory vegetation. This suggests that vegetation decline caused by environmental changes, such as climate warming, land use change, and increased herbivore density, may deteriorate soil ecosystem functions through aboveground-belowground interactions.

AB  - Livestock grazing intensity gradients associated with sheep holder shelters influenced the longevity of rangelands vegetation. This study aimed to examine the effects of livestock grazing pressure on vegetation structure and diversity with distance from herder shelters. Six shelters were sampled. From each herder shelter, a grazing gradient was set aligned to the contour lines. Along each grazing gradient, we surveyed seven 100-m transects between 10 and 800 m from the herder shelter. The standing crop biomass (dry matter = DM) along the gradient from the shelters, bare soil, cover of vegetation functional groups and plant species diversity were determined using the point intercept method along each transect. Bare soil cover increased as we approached herder shelter. The total standing crop biomass (DM) (in g DM m(-2)) increased with the distance from the shelter. Shrub biomass decreased when approaching shelters, as so did the percentage of shrub cover. Cover of perennial forbs and grass also increased with distance from shelter, whereas annual cover increased as we approached the shelter. Species richness and diversity increased when moving away from the shelter. Changes in vegetation structure were not linear. Strong changes were detectable within the first 200 m, whereas little responses were found behind this threshold. The 200 m threshold should be used to monitor the main keystone species that preserved these rangelands.

AB  - Ongoing habitat loss and species extinctions require managers to implement and quantify the effectiveness of conservation actions for protecting biodiversity. Fencing, when done properly, is an important management tool for conservation in landscapes where wildlife and domestic animals co-occur, potentially enhancing habitat use through selective exclusion of domestic species. For instance, the fencing of forest patches in the Neotropics is expected to reduce the degradation of understory vegetation by cattle, releasing these resources for the native community of browsers and fruit consumers. Here, we implemented an ecological experiment using a before-after control-impact design to quantify the effect of cattle exclusion on encounter probability of the native community of browsers and fruit consumers, and percent ground cover in multifunctional landscapes of the Colombian Orinoqu & iacute;a. We built 14 km of wildlife-permeable fences along forest edges in four forest patches (i.e. blocks) containing control and fenced (treatment) sites. We installed 33 camera traps to obtain information about wildlife and cattle encounter probabilities, before and after the fences were constructed. We used Bayesian generalised linear mixed effects models to quantify the effect of fences via the interaction between the time period (before and after the fences were built) and treatment (control or fenced sites). Fencing was effective at reducing encounter probabilities of cattle in the treated sites, and it had a positive impact on relative encounter probabilities of four of seven studied wildlife species (herbivores including the black agouti [dry season only], lowland tapir [dry season only] and spotted paca [both seasons] and an omnivore, the South American coati [rainy season only]). The effect of fencing was negative for the collared peccary but only during the dry season. No statistically significant effect was detected for the white-lipped peccary or white-tailed deer. Synthesis and applications: We provide experimental evidence that fences are effective at selectively excluding cattle and increasing encounter rates of wild browsers and fruit consumers in forest patches where these species co-occur with cattle. Our results highlight an important application of fencing ecology in Neotropical forests, where the implementation of wildlife-permeable fences is feasible due to smaller body sizes of wildlife compared to domestic animals such as cattle.

AB  - Understanding the effects of variation in resource availability and habitat disturbance on the ecology of mammals is vital for successful conservation management. In this study, we examined how human disturbances, resource availability and elevation gradients influence mammal assemblages in both managed coffee forest and natural forest of the Belete-Gera National Forest Priority Area, southwestern Ethiopia. We surveyed mammals using motion-detecting infrared camera traps in 90 locations for a total of 4142 camera days. We measured distance from main roads and settlements as disturbance factors, and distance from water sources, key grazing sites, and forest edges and woody plant diversity as resource variables. We assessed the mammal assemblages in coffee forest and natural forests using generalized linear models. Further, we used linear modelling to compare the relationships of mammal detection rates by feeding guilds and body size to resource variables. In total, we recorded 8815 videos identifying 23 different mammal species. The mammal assemblages in coffee forests were negatively associated with increasing distances from key grazing sites, water sources, and elevation. In contrast, the association with increasing distance from the road and woody plant diversity was positive. In addition, herbivores and large (25-200 kg) and very large (>= 200 kg) mammals, were all negatively associated with increasing distance from the natural forest edges. With the conversion of natural forest to coffee forest and the intensification of coffee forest management, sustainable management of key grazing sites, water sources, and diverse woody plant species will be essential to the conservation of mammals. In addition, to ensure mammal conservation, adjacent natural forests around coffee forests should also be protected.

AB  - Research on Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems (MCEs; 30-150 m) has grown exponentially in the last few decades, highlighting their rich diversity and extensive distribution. However, they are still largely underexplored compared to shallow-water coral reefs and frequently remain under-protected and under-represented in marine spatial planning. One reason for the imbalance between the high ecological value of MCEs and the limited levels of protection may be that baseline data on MCEs are largely missing to date, yet are crucial to provide evidence-based information for management actions. Here, we present data on the alpha and beta diversity of the benthic communities within MCEs in the Chagos Archipelago, Indian Ocean. Using imagery collected from Remotely Operated Vehicle surveys, benthic invertebrate megafauna were surveyed along the entire depth gradient from shallow to lower mesophotic depths (15-160 m). The diversity of the benthic communities decreased with increasing depth, from shallow water to the lower mesophotic zone. Nevertheless, the deepest parts of MCEs in the Archipelago displayed higher species richness values than several other shallow subtropical regions. In addition, the benthic communities showed high dissimilarity along the depth gradient, indicating that the key driver of community composition change with depth is species turnover (species replacement), revealing the uniqueness of MCEs. This study presents novel findings on MCEs in the central Indian Ocean, demonstrating that they host a high and unique benthic diversity, and highlighting the need to protect these ecosystems to preserve the overall biodiversity of coral reefs.

AB  - Growing white-tailed deer populations in Canada's boreal forest are linked to declines of threatened boreal caribou populations. Recent work by Dickie et al. (2024) shows that climate plays a stronger role than anthropogenic habitat alteration in impacting deer white-tailed deer density, however we contend that these findings are not robust due to insufficient data and the analysis used is sensitive to data scaling approach. We demonstrate approximately equal but opposite effects of climate and alteration on white-tailed deer population density, and emphasize the importance of robust analyses involving contentious conservation issues.

AB  - Background and aimsDominant plants shape belowground communities, which in turn influences ecosystem functioning. Similarly, herbivores affect belowground communities through physical disturbance and redistribution of organic inputs, but also through their interactions with plants themselves. However, we know little about how grazing moderates the effects of dominant plants on belowground organisms.MethodsWe established a three-year shrub removal experiment in a grazed and an ungrazed alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau to assess how grazing moderates the effects of a dominant plant, Dasiphora fruticosa, on nematode communities. We used piecewise structural equation modelling to assess how grazing moderates the direct effects of dominant plants and, indirect effects via changes in edaphic variables and microbial pathways.ResultsWe found that 1) grazing significantly decreased nematode diversity mainly due to a reduction in omnivores; 2) there was a significant grazing by shrub interaction effect on nematode diversity, whereby shrub had a positive direct effect on nematode diversity only in the grazed meadow; 3) in the ungrazed alpine meadow, microbial diversity was a strong predictor of nematode, while in the grazed meadow, grazing suppressed the microbial pathways of shrub presence.ConclusionThe study shows that grazing decreases the diversity of soil communities and suppresses the interactions among soil biota, while shrub presence plays a vital role in alleviating the negative effects of grazing on understory communities. Therefore, the findings further highlight herbivory in inducing facilitation of dominant shrubs on understory community stabilization and ecosystem functioning in alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.

AB  - In polygynous ungulates, males may achieve fertilization through the use of alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs), discrete phenotypic variations evolved to maximize fitness. ARTs are often associated with different male spatial strategies during the rut, from territoriality to female-following. Although variation in space use patterns of rutting male ungulates is known to be largely affected by the spatial distribution of females, information on the year-round habitat selection of alternative reproductive types is scant. Here, we investigate the seasonal variation in habitat choice of a large mammal with ARTs (territoriality and nonterritoriality), the Northern chamois Rupicapra rupicapra. Global Positioning System (GPS) data on 28 adult males were collected between February 2010 and December 2013 in the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy) and used to fit resource selection functions to explore the ART-specific use of key topographic features, such as elevation, aspect, and slope, and vegetation phenology expressed as NDVI values. Territorial and nonterritorial chamois profoundly differed in their habitat selection not only during the rutting season. Compared to nonterritorial males, territorial males used lower elevations in summer and autumn, preferred southern slopes in spring and summer, and used steeper areas in summer but not in winter. We found no difference in seasonal selection of NDVI values between males adopting ARTs. Our results suggest that territorial males tend to occupy warmer, lower-food-quality habitats in late spring and summer, whereas nonterritorial males are free to follow and exploit vegetation phenology and more favorable temperatures. Different patterns of habitat selection may reflect different trade-offs between the optimization of energy balances throughout the year and the increase of mating opportunities during the rut in males adopting alternative reproductive tactics.

AB  - Monitoring soil erosion in the Arctic tundra is complicated by the highly fragmentated nature of the landscape and the limited spatial resolution of even high-resolution satellite data. The expansion of shrubs across the Arctic has led to substantial changes in vegetation composition that alter the spectral reflectance and directly affect vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is widely applied for environmental monitoring. This change can mask soil erosion if datasets with too coarse spatial resolutions are used, as increases in NDVI driven by shrub expansion can obscure concurrent increases in barren land cover. Here we created land cover maps from a multispectral uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) and land cover survey and assessed satellite imagery from PlanetScope, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 for several areas in north-eastern Iceland. Additionally, we used a novel application of the Shannon evenness index (SHEI) to evaluate levels of pixel mixing. Our results show that shrub expansion can lead to spectral confusion, which can obscure soil erosion processes and emphasize the importance of considering spatial resolution when monitoring highly fragmented landscapes. We demonstrate that remote sensing data with a resolution < 3 m greatly improves the amount of information captured in an Icelandic tundra environment. The spatial resolution of Landsat data (30 m) is inadequate for environmental monitoring in our study area. We found that the best platform for monitoring tundra land cover is Sentinel-2 when used in combination with multispectral UAV acquisitions for validation. Our study has the potential to improve environmental monitoring capabilities by introducing the use of SHEI to assess pixel mixing and determine optimal spatial resolutions. This approach combined with comparing remote sensing imagery of different spatial and time scales significantly advances our comprehension of land cover changes, including greening and soil degradation, in the Arctic tundra.

AB  - Silvicultural regeneration methods focus on manipulating the forest canopy, but success can depend on the use of site preparation to control competing vegetation, including the density of advance regeneration, and create suitable microsite conditions for germination and seedling establishment. Tip-up mounds are known to provide favorable conditions for some tree species, but the creation of tip-up mounds as a method of site preparation has scarcely been investigated. We assessed effects of artificial tip-up mounds on tree seedling composition across a gradient of regeneration methods and residual over -story densities 2-4 years post-implementation. We found that tree seedling communities on mounds in some treatments were compositionally distinct from untreated reference plots. However, no tree species exhibited a strong affinity for mounds when analyzed independently from the regeneration method, and much of the difference in composition was associated with lower dominance of maples (Acer spp. L.) on mounds. As maples are strong competitors in forests regenerated with selection sys-tems, reduced maple competition on artificial mounds could advantage desired under-represented species and aid in natural regeneration over time. Therefore, in stands where promoting tree species diversity is desirable, implementing artificial tip-up mounds as part of a long-term strategy may be beneficial.

AB  - The Montado is a silvopastoral system with a tree cover of predominantly Quercus suber but also Quercus rotundifolia, where cattle or sheep graze the understory. It occupies more than one million hectares in southern Portugal, and a similar landscape, the Dehesa, covers ca. three million hectares in Spain. These silvopastoral systems can simultaneously benefit the environment and socio-economic activities by providing a bundle of ecosystem services (ESs). However, an ongoing trend of decline in tree density and the covered area is threat-ening such provision. Policies are needed to motivate farmers to secure the ESs that they provide. One possible format is the development of a results-based model (RBM) for agri-environment schemes (AES), implemented under the Common Agricultural Policy. In an RBM, farmers are paid when they deliver specific environmental results (ERs) (e.g. healthy and functional soils), that are linked with the provision of different (and often mul-tiple) ESs. This study defines possible ERs for the Montado and details how these results are linked to the pro-vision of ESs. It then considers management actions that can allow the achievement of these ERs and the costs of these actions. Our methodological approach is based on a transdisciplinary dialogue involving researchers, practitioners (i.e farmers), public authorities and policy makers. The results of the process include the identi-fication of four main ERs: a healthy soil ecosystem, a biodiverse native-Mediterranean pasture, an oak tree layer where regeneration exists (i.e. trees of different ages), and preserved or enhanced landscape elements, for example riparian galleries with vegetation. These ERs increase the supply of provisioning services (e.g. cork production), of regulating services, (e.g. carbon sequestration), and cultural services (e.g. aesthetic inspiration). RBMs allow farmers to use any management practice they choose as the focus is on the results. Nonetheless, to estimate costs we identified 12 potential strategic management practices (and their cost) along with the technical support that farmers would need. We conclude that an RBM could be an affordable solution for public policies in the Montado system, given the limited government budget for supporting AES.

AB  - Dominance often indicates one or a few species being best suited for resource capture and retention in a given environment. Press perturbations that change availability of limiting resources can restructure competitive hierarchies, allowing new species to capture or retain resources and leaving once dominant species fated to decline. However, dominant species may maintain high abundances even when their new environments no longer favour them due to stochastic processes associated with their high abundance, impeding deterministic processes that would otherwise diminish them.Here, we quantify the persistence of dominance by tracking the rate of decline in dominant species at 90 globally distributed grassland sites under experimentally elevated soil nutrient supply and reduced vertebrate consumer pressure.We found that chronic experimental nutrient addition and vertebrate exclusion caused certain subsets of species to lose dominance more quickly than in control plots. In control plots, perennial species and species with high initial cover maintained dominance for longer than annual species and those with low initial cover respectively. In fertilized plots, species with high initial cover maintained dominance at similar rates to control plots, while those with lower initial cover lost dominance even faster than similar species in controls. High initial cover increased the estimated time to dominance loss more strongly in plots with vertebrate exclosures than in controls. Vertebrate exclosures caused a slight decrease in the persistence of dominance for perennials, while fertilization brought perennials' rate of dominance loss in line with those of annuals. Annual species lost dominance at similar rates regardless of treatments.Synthesis. Collectively, these results point to a strong role of a species' historical abundance in maintaining dominance following environmental perturbations. Because dominant species play an outsized role in driving ecosystem processes, their ability to remain dominant-regardless of environmental conditions-is critical to anticipating expected rates of change in the structure and function of grasslands. Species that maintain dominance while no longer competitively favoured following press perturbations due to their historical abundances may result in community compositions that do not maximize resource capture, a key process of system responses to global change.
   The ability of plant species to maintain dominance following environmental perturbations can govern further changes in ecosystem functions. The authors detail the conditions that promote the maintenance of dominance following fertilization and loss of vertebrate herbivores. They found that species with higher initial relative cover are able to maintain dominance for longer time periods even when they eventually decline.image

AB  - Grazing by large mammalian herbivores impacts climate as it can favor the size and stability of a large carbon (C) pool in the soils of grazing ecosystems. As native herbivores in the world's grasslands, steppes, and savannas are progressively being displaced by livestock, it is important to ask whether livestock can emulate the functional roles of their native counterparts. While livestock and native herbivores can have remarkable similarity in their traits, they can differ greatly in their impacts on vegetation composition which can affect soil-C. It is uncertain how these similarities and differences impact soil-C via their influence on microbial decomposers. We test competing alternative hypotheses with a replicated, long-term, landscape-level, grazing-exclusion experiment to ask whether livestock in the Trans-Himalayan ecosystem of northern India can match decadal-scale (2005-2016) soil-C stocks under native herbivores. We evaluate multiple lines of evidence from 17 variables that influence soil-C (quantity and quality of C-input from plants, microbial biomass and metabolism, microbial community composition, eDNA, veterinary antibiotics in soil), and assess their inter-relationships. Livestock and native herbivores differed in their effects on several soil microbial processes. Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) was 19% lower in soils under livestock. Compared to native herbivores, areas used by livestock contained 1.5 kg C m(-2) less soil-C. Structural equation models showed that alongside the effects arising from plants, livestock alter soil microbial communities which is detrimental for CUE, and ultimately also for soil-C. Supporting evidence pointed toward a link between veterinary antibiotics used on livestock, microbial communities, and soil-C. Overcoming the challenges of sequestering antibiotics to minimize their potential impacts on climate, alongside microbial rewilding under livestock, may reconcile the conflicting demands from food-security and ecosystem services. Conservation of native herbivores and alternative management of livestock is crucial for soil-C stewardship to envision and achieve natural climate solutions.

AB  - The Earth has lost approximately half of its large mammal species (>45 kg, one-third of species >9 kg) over the past 120,000 years, resulting in depauperate megafauna communities worldwide. Despite substantial interest and debate for over a century, the reasons for these exceptionally high extinction rates and major transformation of the biosphere remain contested. The predominant explanations are climate change, hunting by modern humans (Homo sapiens), or a combination of both. To evaluate the evidence for each hypothesis, statistical models were constructed to test the predictive power of prehistoric human and hominin presence and migration on megafauna extinction severity and on extinction bias toward larger species. Models with anthropic predictors were compared to models that considered late-Quaternary (120-0 kya) climate change and it was found that models including human factors outperformed all purely climatic models. These results thus support an overriding impact of Homo sapiens on megafauna extinctions. Given the disproportionate impact of large-bodied animals on vegetation structure, plant dispersal, nutrient cycling and co-dependent biota, this simplification and downsizing of mammal faunas worldwide represents the first planetary-scale, human-driven transformation of the environment.

AB  - Native bees are diverse and efficient pollinators that have been studied in many forested regions of the United States. However, such studies are rare in the inland Pacific Northwest. To address this gap, we examined 1) how blooming plant and bee communities differed between two forest types (warm-dry and cool-moist) in spring and summer and 2) how a suite of environmental conditions influenced these communities each season. We collected 4,469 bees from 122 species/morphospecies over two years. Bees were typically twice as abundant in warm-dry versus cool-moist forests. In addition, bloom and bee species composition in each forest type and season were distinct. Canopy density was negatively related to bloom responses in spring and summer. Heat load had a positive effect on bees in both seasons. Surprisingly, the presence of elk was positively associated with bee responses in summer. Groundcover and bloom availability effects on bees varied seasonally. Blooming plant and native bee communities of inland Pacific Northwest forests vary over relatively small spatiotemporal scales, implying that forest type and season are important considerations when planning management actions for achieving pollinator conservation goals in these forests. Our study broadly suggests that various common forest management practices that influence canopy coverage (e.g., fuel reduction thinning, restoration) and large herbivore densities will likely influence blooming plants and bees. In many cases, forest management may operate synergistically with native bee conservation. Still, a high priority for future research is understanding how blooming plant and bee communities respond directly to management actions.

AB  - Fungicides are central for global plant production strategies. Even though, direct and indirect effects on plant health were identified, they were hardly assessed, particularly not for riparian ecosystems. Known unintended side effects of fungicides are changes in soil microbial (including soil fungal) diversity and activity, but detailed surveys are rare. Here, we assessed changes in soil bacterial and fungal community structure and their carbon processing in terms of CO2 and CH4 emission under increasing fungicide concentrations crossed with four tree species, namely field maple (Acer campestre L.), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.), common oak (Quercus robur L.) and horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L). RNA metabarcoding uncovered that the alpha diversity of fungal communities were more affected by increasing fungicide concentrations than bacterial communities. Tree species, besides fungicide concentration, also revealed to have an impact on fungal community structure, as reflected by carbon emissions. At the same time, fungicides directly negatively affected tree height and perimeter of all four tree species. Additionally, indirect effects on plant growth through changes in the soil microbial community are possible. Being at the fringe of terrestrial to aquatic systems, riparian zones must fulfil a gatekeeper's functions. If their functioning is weakened, matter exchanges will be less controlled.

AB  - Nutrients and herbivores are well-known drivers of grassland diversity and stability in local communities. However, whether they interact to impact the stability of aboveground biomass and whether these effects depend on spatial scales remain unknown. It is also unclear whether nutrients and herbivores impact stability via different facets of plant diversity including species richness, evenness, and changes in community composition through time and space. We used a replicated experiment adding nutrients and excluding herbivores for 5 years in 34 global grasslands to explore these questions. We found that both nutrient addition and herbivore exclusion alone reduced stability at the larger spatial scale (aggregated local communities; gamma stability), but through different pathways. Nutrient addition reduced gamma stability primarily by increasing changes in local community composition over time, which was mainly driven by species replacement. Herbivore exclusion reduced gamma stability primarily by decreasing asynchronous dynamics among local communities (spatial asynchrony). Their interaction weakly increased gamma stability by increasing spatial asynchrony. Our findings indicate that disentangling the processes operating at different spatial scales may improve conservation and management aiming at maintaining the ability of ecosystems to reliably provide functions and services for humanity.

AB  - Reconstructing the demographic history of endangered taxa is paramount to predict future fluctuations and disentangle the contributing factors. Extinct taxa or populations might also provide key insights in this respect by means of the DNA extracted from museum specimens. Nevertheless, the degraded status of biological material and the limited number of records may pose some constraints. For this reason, identifying all available sources, including private and public biological collections, is a crucial step forward. In this study, we reconstructed the demographic history based on cytochrome-b sequence data of the Pyrenean ibex (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica), a charismatic taxon of the European wildlife that became extinct in the year 2000. Moreover, we built a database of the museum specimens available in public biological collections worldwide and genotyped a privately owned 140-year-old trophy from the Spanish Pyrenees to confirm its origin. We found that the population of the Pyrenean ibex underwent a recent expansion approximately 20,000 years ago, after which trophy hunting and epizootics triggered a relentless population decline. Our interpretations, based on the genetic information currently available in public repositories, provide a solid basis for more exhaustive analyses relying on all the new sources identified. In particular, the adoption of a genome-wide approach appears a fundamental prerequisite to disentangle the multiple contributing factors associated with low genetic diversity, including inbreeding depression, acting as extinction drivers.

AB  - Context. Rates of habitat destruction are increasing globally, and recent years have seen a growing focus on returning lands degraded through anthropogenic activities to functional and sustainable ecosystems. Animals provide a range of services critical to healthy ecosystems, yet in assessments of restoration progress they are often assumed to return passively following the reinstatement of native flora and vegetation. Aims and methods. We used remote sensing camera traps to assess the impact of early stage habitat restoration on the structure and diversity of fauna communities on a mine site in the Mid West region of Western Australia. We aimed to assess whether early stage habitat restoration supports animal communities with similar diversity and community structure (foraging guilds) to those found in reference, unmined vegetation. Key results. Although early stage habitat restoration facilitated the establishment of animal communities with similar diversity to that of the reference vegetation; the foraging guilds using restoration vegetation differed significantly from those in the reference vegetation. Early stage restoration was particularly attractive to herbivores but may lack some key resources, for example leaf litter, course woody debris, and appropriate refuge sites, necessary for the return of granivores, insectivores, and omnivores. Conclusions and implications. It is unlikely that early stage habitat restoration will support a similar species composition to established restoration, but it is crucial to monitor restoration along a trajectory to ensure efforts do not ultimately fail. Assessing the responses of fauna from a range of guilds and trophic levels is critical to determining whether habitat restoration is effectively returning functional and self-sustaining animal communities.

AB  - Some insect populations are experiencing dramatic declines, endangering the crucial ecosystem services they provide. Yet, other populations appear robust, highlighting the need to better define patterns and underlying drivers of recent change in insect numbers. We examined abundance and biodiversity trends for North American butterflies using a unique citizen-science dataset that has recorded observations of over 8 million butterflies across 456 species, 503 sites, nine ecoregions, and 26 years. Butterflies are a biodiverse group of pollinators, herbivores, and prey, making them useful bellwethers of environmental change. We found great heterogeneity in butterfly species' abundance trends, aggregating near zero, but with a tendency toward decline. There was strong spatial clustering, however, into regions of increase, decrease, or relative stasis. Recent precipitation and temperature appeared to largely drive these patterns, with butterflies generally declining at increasingly dry and hot sites but increasing at relatively wet or cool sites. In contrast, landscape and butterfly trait predictors had little influence, though abundance trends were slightly more positive around urban areas. Consistent with varying responses by different species, no overall directional change in butterfly species richness or evenness was detected. Overall, a mosaic of butterfly decay and rebound hotspots appeared to largely reflect geographic variability in climate drivers. Ongoing controversy about insect declines might dissipate with a shift in focus to the causes of heterogeneous responses among taxa and sites, with climate change emerging as a key suspect when pollinator communities are broadly impacted.

AB  - Despite being key conservation instruments, the ecological effectiveness of protected areas (PAs) is contested. To assess the ecological effectiveness of PAs in the Katavi-Rukwa Ecosystem (KRE) in western Tanzania, we investigated temporal changes in land-use and population densities of six large mammal target species (elephant, buffalo, giraffe, zebra, topi, and hartebeest) across areas with different conservation category, ranging from unprotected to strictly protected. During six survey periods between 1991 and 2018, we analyzed data from remote sensing and aerial wildlife surveys to derive (i) spatiotemporal patterns of cropland cover in relation to protection category; (ii) population densities of the six-target species; and (iii) distribution of these species across protection category, land-use and environmental variables. During the surveyed period, cropland increased from 3.4 % to 9.6 % on unprotected land and from <= 0.05 % to <1 % on protected land. Wildlife densities of most, but not all target species declined across the entire landscape, yet the onset of the observed wildlife declines occurred several years before the onset of cropland expansion. Logistic regression models indicated that target species preferred the national park over less strictly PAs and areas distant to cropland. As our data do not support a direct link between land-use change and wildlife densities, additional factors may explain the apparent ecosystem-wide decline in wildlife. To bolster wildlife conservation in the KRE, we recommended proactive strategies to reduce direct threats to wildlife and cropland expansion toward wildlife dispersal areas and migratory corridors.

AB  - In Alberta, Canada, mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestations overlap with threatened caribou and grizzly bear ranges. While MPB is a natural part of the ecosystem, increased intensity of infestation due to fire suppression and a changing climate has required mitigating actions in the form of MPB control treatments, including accelerated forest harvesting, prescribed burns, and single-tree cut and burn. However, little is known on how MPB and MPB treatments affect understory shrub and forb forage taxa important to threatened caribou and grizzly bear populations. Using data collected in west-central and north-west Alberta, we investigated how the occurrence and abundance of 25 shrub and forb taxa varied among MPB kill, MPB treatments: single-tree cut and burn, harvesting, fire, and uncut forest strata. We determined that MPB kill and MPB treatments impacted 13 forage taxa preferred by threatened caribou and grizzly bear populations. These caribou and grizzly bear forage taxa generally had a positive response to MPB kill and single-tree cut and burn, a positive response to fire, or a positive response to MPB kill, single-tree cut and burn, and fire. Our results suggest that less-intensive MPB treatments like single-tree cut and burn might balance the threat of MPB against maintaining food re-sources and habitat for threatened species. As MPB continues to be a significant problem in Alberta and across the boreal forest, the results from our study, combined with ongoing assessments on the impact of MPB on wildlife species will provide essential information for evidence-based landscape management.

AB  - Wild boar (Sus scrofa) population increases have been spectacular in many countries, including France. Wild boar can substantially affect many ecosystem components, including birds, but indicators to monitor such effects are currently lacking. We examined the usefulness of monitoring wild boar foraging traces resulting from rooting behaviour to evaluate wild boar disturbance on ground-nesting birds and developed a simple indicator of kilometric foraging (Ikf). This study measured the effect of wild boar on bird abundance, taking into account vegetation characteristics. Using standardised spot counts, we found ground-nesting bird abundances negatively correlated with Ikf. Our results showed a significant decrease of 45% in ground-nesting bird abundance in areas strongly foraged and disturbed by wild boar. By contrast, the abundance of birds depending on ground or trees for food resources but nesting out of reach of wild boar were not correlated to rooting behaviour traces. Thus, we conclude that Ikf may be a simple and suitable indicator that managers can use on a large scale to monitor wild boar potential disturbance and ecological footprint on ground-nesting birds and other taxa. Further studies are needed to test and validate this new indicator in areas other than the Sainte-Baume Regional Park.

AB  - While some species rapidly decline, compromising vital ecosystem services, others are stable or even increasing in abundance. We studied shifts in species richness and abundance of moths over five decades in Central Sweden and examined whether and how changes were associated with phenotypic traits. We combined information from captures in a light trap in historical time (the 1970s) and contemporarily (2019) with provincial colonisation records. Both community species richness and the abundance of moths increased between the time periods. A large fraction (38%) of the 410 species were not present in both periods, 101 species had colonised the area (an estimated influx of about 2.5 new species per year), and 51 species had disappeared (an estimated local extinction rate of about 1.16 species per year). Abundance increased with an increasing number of host plants and with increasing colour pattern variation. The composition of the community shifted towards species characterised by smaller wingspan and larger ranges. The functional trait variability of the moth community was homogenised from the historical to the contemporary period, in line with reports from other species communities in modern landscapes. However, our finding of a concomitant increase in species richness and total abundance differs from the results of many recent studies of insect communities in other geographic regions.Implication for insect conservationWe conclude that the entire boreal moth fauna is undergoing a substantial biogeographical shift, changing to the moth species historically occurring at more southern latitudes. The alterations in species composition, overall abundance, and community-wide trait distribution described here may cascade up and down in the ecosystem because moths are important pollinators, herbivores, and prey.

AB  - For most of the Democratic Republic of the Congo quantitative data on bushmeat exploitation are scarce. We conducted focus group discussions on preferred species for household consumption and income generation in 24 villages around Lomami National Park, created in 2016. We also carried out a bushmeat market survey in Kindu, a major town in the study area, to estimate annual sales volumes and retail values. Villagers reported household consumption of 22 mammal species, with the most important being the African brush-tailed porcupine, Peters's duiker, bay duiker and red river hog. The latter three were also the most important for income generation. A greater number of smaller species were consumed at the household level, compared with those traded. A total of 17 mammal and one reptile species were traded in Kindu. Those traded in greater numbers were the African brush-tailed porcupine, blue and bay duiker, red river hog, red-tailed monkey and the sitatunga. We estimated > 40,000 carcasses were traded in Kindu annually, with a retail value of USD 725,000. Several species of conservation concern, such as the bonobo, were mentioned or observed. Few rodents and numerous large animals were traded in Kindu, suggesting resources have not yet been depleted. However, both villagers and urban vendors perceived a decline of many species and reported an increase in the use of firearms and the number of foreign hunters in the area. Among other interventions, we discuss how local communities could be encouraged to help preserve wildlife in the Park's buffer zone.

AB  - North American tallgrass prairie evolved with regular fire set by Indigenous people and grazing from large herbivores, including the plains bison (Bison bison). In contrast to uniform effects of prescribed fire, bison graze selectively, creating increased heterogeneity on the landscape. We examined plant community responses to reintroduced bison grazing in high-diversity native and restored tallgrass prairie in Illinois, USA. We evaluated plant community diversity and structure in paired grazed and ungrazed (fenced) plots. After 5 y of grazing at a relatively low target stocking rate of 1 animal unit per 5.2 ha (13 acres), there were no differences in plant community diversity, composition, nonnative:native species ratio, or visual obstruction readings between grazed and ungrazed plots. An interaction exists (or was found) between plant community type and grazing in which grazed savanna plots had greater grass relative abundance compared to ungrazed plots. Ongoing monitoring will evaluate long-term trends.

AB  - Animals provide services such as pollination and pest control in cacao agroforestry systems, but also disservices. Yet, their combined contributions to crop yield and fruit loss are mostly unclear. In a full-factorial field experiment in northwestern Peru, we excluded flying insects, ants, birds and bats from cacao trees and assessed several productivity indicators. We quantified the contribution of each group to fruit set, fruit loss and marketable yield and evaluated how forest distance and canopy closure affected productivity. Fruit set dropped (from 1.7% to 0.3%) when flying insects were excluded and tripled at intermediate (40%) compared to high (greater than 80%) canopy cover in the non-exclusion treatment. Fruit set also dropped with bird and bat exclusion, potentially due to increased abundances of arthropods preying on pollinators or flower herbivores. Overall, cacao yields more than doubled when birds and bats had access to trees. Ants were generally associated with fruit loss, but also with yield increases in agroforests close to forest. We also evidenced disservices generated by squirrels, leading to significant fruit losses. Our findings show that several functional groups contribute to high cacao yield, while trade-offs between services and disservices need to be integrated in local and landscape-scale sustainable cacao agroforestry management.

AB  - Hydrologic management of shallow lakes is often undertaken to prevent fluctuations in lake level, and to ensure sufficient water volume for economic, domestic, and recreational uses, but there is inconsistent evidence of whether lake-level stabilisation through hydrological management promotes or hinders eutrophication. Here we used multi-proxy paleolimnological assessments of water quality (sedimentary carbon, nitrogen, total phosphorus, fossil pigments), and zooplankton community ecology (fossil Cladocera assemblages), combined with Landsat-derived estimates of lake surface area in two shallow eutrophic lakes, in the Prairies of southern Saskatchewan, Canada, to quantify how 8 decades of contrasting hydrological management strategies (continuous or intermittent) affect primary production and phytoplankton composition. Analysis revealed that irregular hydrological management of Pelican Lake led to sharp increases in primary production concomitant with lake-level decline. In contrast, continuously managed Buffalo Pound Lake, a drinking water reservoir for regional cities, exhibited slow, persistent eutrophication over decades despite active regulation of water levels. In both lakes, strong correlations of delta 15N values with pigments from diazotrophic cyanobacteria (canthaxanthin) showed that N2-fixation increased during eutrophication irrespective of the timing of change. Finally, variation in fossil cladoceran density and composition reflected changes in pelagic and littoral habitats (e.g., reduced macrophyte cover) due to changes in both lake level and water quality. Basin comparison shows that while hydrologic management can moderate water quality degradation due to lake-level change, it does not prevent eutrophication when nutrient influx remains high. Given that regional water availability is forecast to decline in coming decades, we anticipate that continued hydrological management will be unavoidable and will be unable to improve water quality unless nutrient influx is also controlled.

AB  - Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are a valued game species across their range in North America. At higher latitudes mule deer inhabit the Northern Forests ecoregion, where the winter season poses challenging conditions. We studied resource selection during winter by mule deer in northwest Montana, USA, focused on the effects of snow and canopy cover on deer behavior. Specifically, we assessed the effects of land cover type, terrain characteristics, snow accumulation, percent canopy cover, solar radiation, and forage biomass on resource selection by 126 mule deer captured during 2017-2019 in 3 partially migratory subpopulations. We collected pellet samples and conducted diet analyses to assess forage species by individual and study area. Deer displayed a shift from nitrogen-rich forbs and shrubs in summer to nutrient-poor evergreens like conifers in winter. Deer avoided areas with deeper snow and sought more closed canopy forests for their snow-intercept advantages. Weather and vegetative variation among and within study areas resulted in disparities in selection for attributes such as land cover. Similarly, mule deer diets varied spatiotemporally as a function of snow, with some deer favoring coniferous species in deep snow, whereas others less constrained by snow had more diverse diets with more shrub species. Additional analyses revealed annual individual survival correlated with changes in snow depth, suggesting fitness consequences as snow accumulated. These differences suggest locally adapted behaviors as mule deer reflect energetic constraints of winter landscapes.

AB  - Current forest management aims to reduce the economic and environmental impact of pests on forest ecosystem productivity and to develop sustainable control approaches. The enemies hypothesis states that more diverse plant communities support a greater number and diversity of predators and parasitoids leading to a reduction in pest damage via top-down control. In forests, research on the enemies hypothesis typically focuses on tree species diversity. Here, we modify this hypothesis to determine how structural complexity of the forest understorey, as mediated by management, influences the abundance of predators and predation events on potential forest insect pests. To test this, we studied Eucalyptus sp. plantations managed under two approaches of tree establishment, hypothesising that those managed under the less disturbed system of regrowth (regeneration from clear cut stumps) will have greater vegetation structural complexity, predator abundance and predation events (as an indirect measure of predation rate) than the more disturbed seedling planting system. In six stands of each management type, we measured vegetation understorey layers (ground-, shrub- and sub-canopy cover), predator abundance (insectivorous birds, spider web counts) and predation events (artificial larvae attacks, spider web prey items). Vegetation structural complexity, abundance of insectivorous birds and spider webs, and artificial larvae attacks and web prey items were all greater in the regrowth than in the seedling stands. Path analysis evidenced direct support for our modified enemies hypothesis for birds, the regrowth management with low disturbance levels after clearcutting promotes both predator abundance and predation events via increased vegetation structural complexity. However, for spiders the increase in web abundance and predation events was directly and positively associated with regrowth management, but there was no indirect link via vegetation structural complexity, suggesting other factors driven by forest management are important.Manipulative experiments explicitly exploring the cause-and-effect relationship between predation rates and herbivory rates and consideration of the economic implications of the different approaches are required before changes to management are implemented. Our study agrees with the overarching paradigm in sustainable forest management that promotion of structural complexity will be beneficial to biodiversity, ecosystem function and resilience.

AB  - Globally, the effective protected area network is one of the last resorts for conserving biodiversity. The nature of protected areas depends on the land ownership of the respective countries including India. The landholding in the northeastern states of India remains with native people, thus, 'Community Reserve' (CR) was introduced in 2003. Considering the high number of CR in Meghalaya that are home to many threatened primates, understanding their role in conserving the primates was crucial. We conducted day and night trail surveys in 32 CR of Meghalaya, and a questionnaire survey of local people for their perception of primates. We sampled basal area, tree density, canopy cover, canopy height, bamboo density, and human activity in each CR to test their influence on the occupancy of primates. We recorded the Western hoolock gibbon Hoolock hoolock, capped langur Trachypithecus pileatus, Northern pig-tailed macaque Macaca leonina, Assamese macaque Macaca assamensis, Rhesus macaque Macaca mulatta, and Bengal slow loris Nycticebus bengalensis. The primate richness and abundance were higher in the CR of Garo Hills than in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills. The gibbons had the highest patch occupancy, which was followed by capped langur, Assamese macaque, and pig-tailed macaque. Large-sized CR determined the occupancy of gibbons and Assamese macaques. Canopy cover positively influenced the occupancy of three primates except the Assamese macaque, whereas the canopy height had a positive association with three species of primates. The basal area, and tree density, negatively affected the occurrence of Assamese macaque, northern pig-tailed macaque, and capped langur. Macaques were the most hunted primates. The differential occurrence and abundance in different hill systems may be due to hunting and habitat size rather than habitat quality. Habitat restoration would improve the habitat quality with the involvement of communities to assist in retaining and avoiding the local extinction of primates.

AB  - Biodiversity can have cascading effects throughout ecosystems. While these effects are better understood at coarser taxonomic scales of biodiversity, there has been a resurgence in investigating how biodiversity within species may have cascading effects on communities and ecosystems. We investigate the broader trophic implications of intraspecific variation in the riparian tree, Alnus rubra, where immediately local or 'home' litter decomposes faster than 'away' litter in aquatic and terrestrial systems. With climate change shifting the distributions of plants across the globe, it is essential to understand how shifts in the intraspecific traits of leaf litter may have reverberating effects throughout ecosystems. Here, we find that intraspecific variation in leaf litter has fitness implications for invertebrate consumers, including the algivorous Dicosmoecus and detrivorous Psychoglypha caddisflies, which exhibited increased body size and muscle nitrogen content when incubated within in-situ river mesocosms supplied with local A. rubra litter. Litter source altered caddisfly gut microbiomes by increasing relative abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs among the non-local treatment group. Additionally, Dicosmoecus supplied with non-local litter may have shifted their diet towards a higher proportion of algae, as inferred from shifts in gut microbiome composition and isotopic ratios of muscle tissue. Overall, our study demonstrates that shifting distributions of plant genotypes across the globe may cause plant-microbe mismatches that will disrupt patterns of decomposition and may have consequences on the fitness and foraging behavior of consumers.

AB  - Litter decomposition is critical for maintaining productivity and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Large herbivores play an essential role in determining the processes of nutrient cycling. Asian temperate forests are becoming degraded and fragmented by the widespread intensification of anthropogenic activities, including excessive livestock grazing. However, the effects of livestock grazing and wild ungulates on forest litter decomposition remain less explored. In this study, we used a litterbag experiment to investigate the effects of the addition of cattle (Bos taurus) and sika deer (Cervus nippon) feces on litter decomposition. The study was conducted in Northeast China from July 2022 to October 2023. We found that the addition of deer feces significantly reduced litter decomposition, but the addition of cattle feces greatly increased litter decomposition. The presence of cattle and deer excrement significantly accelerated the release of C after 1 year of litter decomposition. Compared with the results of the control group (no addition of feces), the addition of cattle and sika deer feces increased C release by 37.45% and 22.69%, respectively. Fecal addition increased the release of N; however, for the three treatment groups, the maximum accumulation of N occurred in the middle of litter decomposition, which may have been due to the initial chemical quality of the leaves and snow melt as well as nutrient limitations at the sites. Compared with the results of the control group, P release in the feces of cattle increased by 4.35%, but P release in the feces of deer decreased by 27.55%. This work highlights that feces deposition by large herbivores (e.g., wild or domestic) in the forest has nonequivalent effects on litter decomposition. Such effects may further alter the nutrient cycling in temperate forest ecosystems, with far-reaching effects on the ecosystem that deserve closer attention. We suggest that conservation managers should seek evidence-based interventions to optimize livestock use of forest habitats shared with wildlife.

AB  - Species interactions are known to structure ecological communities. Still, the influence of climate change on biodiversity has primarily been evaluated by correlating individual species distributions with local climatic descriptors, then extrapolating into future climate scenarios. We ask whether predictions on arctic arthropod response to climate change can be improved by accounting for species interactions. For this, we use a 14-year-long, weekly time series from Greenland, resolved to the species level by mitogenome mapping. During the study period, temperature increased by 2 degrees C and arthropod species richness halved. We show that with abiotic variables alone, we are essentially unable to predict species responses, but with species interactions included, the predictive power of the models improves considerably. Cascading trophic effects thereby emerge as important in structuring biodiversity response to climate change. Given the need to scale up from species-level to community-level projections of biodiversity change, these results represent a major step forward for predictive ecology.

AB  - Food webs can be conceptualized as being powered by energy derived from living and dead vegetation, respectively. Most food web research has focused on "green food webs " which begin with the consumption of living vegetation by herbivores. However, "brown food webs " which stem from the consumption of senescent vegetation by detritivores are also an important channel of energy transfer. In theory, herbivores have the potential to disrupt brown food webs by consuming plant material before it can senesce and become available for detritivores. Here we investigate the effects that grazing by kangaroos, whose population had irrupted partly due to the absence of an apex predator, has on the brown food web in an arid environment. We compared the cover of living and dead vegetation, the abundances of detritivorous termites and their predators inside one ha herbivore exclosures and nearby control plots. Results show there was more cover of living and dead vegetation inside the exclosures. Similarly, abundances of termites and small vertebrate predators of termites were greater inside the exclosures. Our study provides evidence that consumption of plant material by irruptive herbivores can disrupt the functioning of the brown food web by reducing the flow of energy from plant biomass to termites which in turn translates to reduced abundances of termites and small vertebrates that feed on termites. Our findings have implications for conservation and management because they shed light on a previously unconsidered threat to the functioning of arid ecosystems, disruption of brown food webs by irruptive herbivores.

AB  - The increased pressures generated by human activities in form of climate change and habitat fragmentation have caused serious threats for Sindh ibex (Capra aegagrus blythii). Balochistan, recognized as one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change in Pakistan, has limited data on the distribution and population status of this species. To address this gap, our study aims to assess the spatial and temporal distribution and population trend of Sindh ibex in the Khuzdar and Lasbela districts of Balochistan. The study covered an area of approximately 45,123.97 km(2). It involved a double-observer survey at ten sites from 2019 to 2022, using the BBRecapture package in the R programming language to estimate ibex population trend and dispersion. We provided a comprehensive update of the species geographic range, along with estimates of its current abundance and population trends. Over the course of four years, the ibex population fluctuated. The ibexes detected dropped from 720 (male to female ratio 1:1.21) and 710 (male to female ratio 1:1.08) in 2019 and 2020, respectively, to 550 (male to female ratio 1:1.35) and 548 (male to female ratio 1:1.09). Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the population trends, gender ratios, habitat preferences, and density of Sindh ibex in Balochistan over the four-year period. These findings contribute significantly to the baseline data on the species ecology and will further help in the conservation of these species at local scale.

AB  - Yellow-headed caracara is well known for its habit to pick ticks and botfly larvae from cattle, capybaras, and tapirs. The caracara and the mammals exemplify a mutualistic interaction in which the mammals get rid from ticks and the bird obtains food. Less known is this type of mutualistic relationship involving four other tick-picking birds: black vulture, Southern caracara, smooth-billed ani, and cattle tyrant. Among native mammals, capybara is a favoured tick supplier for these five diurnal birds. Besides occurring in natural habitats, this mutualistic interaction is common in urban parks and reserves where capybaras live or forage. We report on a local extinction of this mutualism at an urban reserve in a large city in South-eastern Brazil. The extinction was gradual and likely began with a culling event that caused the remaining capybaras to partly adopt nocturnal habits, which started the extinction of the mutualistic relationship with the birds. The capybara numbers gradually dwindled and currently they are essentially absent from the reserve for eight successive years. The absence (or nocturnal habits) of capybaras led to extinction of the mutualistic interaction with five tick-picking birds. This extinction caused biodiversity loss and altered the ecosystem functions based on this partnership.

AB  - The rapid expansion of invasive wild pig (Sus scrofa) populations over the past several decades has resulted in an increased distribution of damage to native systems throughout their introduced range. Despite the extent of wild pig damage and growing concerns among land managers, there is limited published data regarding the variability of damage in relation to season and fine-scale land cover attributes. We assessed wild pig rooting damage during the winter (January-March) and summer (June-August) of 2020 along 36 km of 10-m-wide transects on the Savannah River Site (SRS) and 34 km of 10-m-wide transects on privately owned agricultural (POA) properties in South Carolina, USA. We recorded fine-scale land cover attributes at damage and control sites to determine the factors that were most closely associated with wild pig rooting damage. We reported 6,825.5 m2 of rooting damage over 36 km of survey transects on the SRS and 3,146.9 m2 of rooting damage over 34 km of survey transects on the POA properties over winter and summer seasons. The average depth of rooting damage was 11.8 cm on the SRS and 11.2 cm on the POA properties. Our modeling results suggested rooting by wild pigs was more likely to occur in earlier winter months, in hardwood stands, proximal to water, and in areas with less ground vegetation and greater stem density, and less likely to occur in areas with greater tree density and near roads. Our results can help facilitate early detection of wild pig expansion by highlighting key areas to monitor for wild pig presence.

AB  - Aim Temperate forests are currently facing multiple stresses due to climate change, biological invasions, habitat fragmentation and fire regime change. How these stressors interact with each other influences how, when and whether ecosystems recover, or whether they adapt or transition to a different ecological state. Because forest recovery or collapse may take longer than a human lifetime, predicting the outcomes of different stressor combinations remains difficult. A clearer vision of future forest trajectories in a changing world may be gained by examining collapses of forests in the past. Here, we use long-term ecological data to conduct a post-mortem examination of the decline of maritime pine forests (Pinus pinaster Ait.) on the SW Iberian Peninsula 7000-6500 years ago.
   Location Portugal and Spain.
   Methods We compared four palaeoecological records-two with pine declines and two without-using a multiproxy approach. Bioclimatic differences between the four sites were explored. Proxies for past vegetation and disturbance (fire and grazing) were compared with independent palaeoclimatic records. We performed functional traits analysis and used phase plots to examine the causes of pine decline.
   Results The pine decline represents a critical transition in SW Iberia, which lies close to maritime pine's bioclimatic limits. Prolonged drought likely killed trees and suppressed the fires that normally stimulate pine germination and pinewood recovery. Increased grazing pressure facilitated the rapid spread of resprouter shrubs. These competed with pine trees and ultimately replaced them. Our data highlight complex interactions between climate, fire, grazing and forest resilience.
   Main Conclusions The pine decline occurred at least a century after post-fire resprouters overtook obligate seeders in the vegetation, constituting an early-warning signal of forest loss. Fire suppression, resprouter encroachment and grazing may threaten the persistence of Mediterranean forests as droughts become more frequent and extreme.

AB  - Grazing and fire are both independently important drivers of plant community dynamics; however, their interactive effects may be even more influential. Little is known about prefire grazing effects on postfire plant community dynamics. We investigated the effects of dormant-season, moderate prefire grazing by cattle on postfire plant community response in the imperiled Artemisia (sagebrush) steppe. Treatments were moderately grazed or not grazed by cattle for 5 yr before fire. The first yr post fire, shrub density was 4 xgreater in grazed areas, demonstrating fire-induced mortality was reduced with grazing. This further suggested that grazing reduced fire severity and postfire large bunchgrass biomass was greater in grazed compared with ungrazed areas. Biomass and abundance of the exotic annual grass, Bromus tectorum L., were substantially greater and plant diversity was lower in ungrazed compared with grazed areas post fire. Five years post fire, perennial herbaceous vegetation still dominated prefire-grazed areas, but ungrazed areas were dominated by B. tectorum, suggesting that a novel ecosystem state had developed. Substantial increases in B. tectorum are concerning because it prevents recruitment of native perennial plants and increases fire frequency, which would further decrease diversity and reinforce an exotic annual-dominated state. Lower diversity in ungrazed areas post fire is concerning because diversity can be important for plant community stability. The importance of livestock as ecological engineers through their influence on fire has largely been overlooked but is clearly substantial and needs to be integrated into conservation and management plans.

AB  - Ice wedges are a common form of massive ground ice that typically occupy 10-30% of the volume of upper permafrost in the Arctic and are particularly vulnerable to thawing from climate warming. In assessing the patterns and rates of ice-wedge degradation in northeastern Alaska, we found degradation was widespread and rapidly transforming the microtopography, hydrology, soils, ground ice, and vegetation of tundra ecosystems through a sequence of degradation and stabilization stages. Across an extensive mapping area (30 km(2)), thermokarst troughs and pits with open water (degradation-advanced) covered 0.7% overall and 1.6% in the oldest terrain in 2018. Within an area (0.5 km(2)) of concentrated thermokarst, undegraded and degraded ice wedges together covered 29% of the area, and all degradation stages combined increased from 2% in 1950 to 19% area in 2018. Initial degradation peaked at 9% in 2000 and initial stabilization was trending upward at 12% area in 2018, indicating slowing degradation and a transition to stabilization. Integration and reorganization of the drainage network as troughs expanded and connected reduced impounded surface water and helped slow degradation. Degradation created large changes in microtopography, trough widths, water depths, depth to wedge ice, pH, soil and ground ice characteristics, and thermal regimes among stages. Community composition completely shifted from dominance of deciduous and evergreen shrubs in tussock tundra in the undegraded stage to dominance of aquatic mosses and forbs in flooded depressions in degradation-advanced stage. Soil slumping along trough margins and rapid colonization by aquatic mosses halted the degradation, and aquatic sedges became dominant in the stabilization-initial stage. In stabilization-advanced, aquatic mosses persisted and the diversity of wet-adapted forbs, sedges, and mosses increased. Recovery back to tussock tundra, however, is unlikely. This decadal-scale transformation has major implications for arctic land cover, tundra productivity, lake expansion and drainage, soil-carbon balance, trace-gas emissions, and caribou and bird populations.

AB  - Widespread changes in the distribution and abundance of plant functional types (PFTs) are occurring in Arctic and boreal ecosystems due to the intensification of disturbances, such as fire, and climate-driven vegetation dynamics, such as tundra shrub expansion. To understand how these changes affect boreal and tundra ecosystems, we need to first quantify change for multiple PFTs across recent years. While landscape patches are generally composed of a mixture of PFTs, most previous moderate resolution (30 m) remote sensing analyses have mapped vegetation distribution and change within land cover categories that are based on the dominant PFT; or else the continuous distribution of one or a few PFTs, but for a single point in time. Here we map a 35 year time-series (1985-2020) of top cover (TC) for seven PFTs across a 1.77 x 10(6) km(2) study area in northern and central Alaska and northwestern Canada. We improve on previous methods of detecting vegetation change by modeling TC, a continuous measure of plant abundance. The PFTs collectively include all vascular plants within the study area as well as light macrolichens, a nonvascular class of high importance to caribou management. We identified net increases in deciduous shrubs (66 x 10(3) km(2)), evergreen shrubs (20 x 10(3) km(2)), broadleaf trees (17 x 10(3) km(2)), and conifer trees (16 x 10(3) km(2)), and net decreases in graminoids (-40 x 10(3) km(2)) and light macrolichens (-13 x 10(3) km(2)) over the full map area, with similar patterns across Arctic, oroarctic, and boreal bioclimatic zones. Model performance was assessed using spatially blocked, nested five-fold cross-validation with overall root mean square errors ranging from 8.3% to 19.0%. Most net change occurred as succession or plant expansion within areas undisturbed by recent fire, though PFT TC change also clearly resulted from fire disturbance. These maps have important applications for assessment of surface energy budgets, permafrost changes, nutrient cycling, and wildlife management and movement analysis.

AB  - Fragmented suburban forests of the northeastern US are challenged by abundant white-tailed deer and nonindigenous plant invasions. Deer browsing/grazing pressure varies among sites, potentially affecting herbivory on nonindigenous plants and their invasion success. We aimed to identify a useful deer pressure indicator for suburban forests and then use it to relate deer pressure to grazing on and abundance of two herbaceous invaders, Microstegum vimineum and Alliaria petiolata. We compared three indicators: fecal pellet accumulation rate, deer browse on indigenous woody plants, and indigenous shrub layer cover. The pellet method produced estimates generally far below the region's known deer density. Browse rates and shrub layer cover were negatively correlated, and correlations of the three indicators with evidence of deer pressure from a subsequent 6.5-year exclosure experiment supported shrub layer cover as the better choice. Using that measure in 10 forests, we detected a weak pattern of more grazed stands under greater deer pressure, but few plants per stand were grazed; any negative influence of deer on these species was limited to individuals, without population effects. Alliaria petiolata abundance was unrelated to deer pressure, but M. vimineum abundance was greater in forests with more deer pressure, suggesting facilitation of its invasion.

AB  - Shoot and root litter are two major sources of soil organic carbon, and their decomposition is a crucial nutrient cycling process in the ecosystem. Altitude and land use could affect litter decomposition by changing the environment in mountain grassland ecosystems. However, few studies have investigated the effects of land use on litter decomposition in different altitudes. We examined how land-use type (mowing vs. grazing) affected shoot and root litter decomposition of a dominant grass (Bromus inermis) in mountain grasslands with two different altitudes in northwest China. Litterbags with 6 g of shoot or root were fixed in the plots to decompose for one year. The mass loss rate of the litter, and the environmental attributes related to decomposition, were measured. Litter decomposed faster in mowing than grazing plots, resulting from the higher plant cover and soil moisture but lower bulk density, which might promote soil microbial activities. Increased altitude promoted litter decomposition, and was positively correlated with soil moisture, soil organic carbon (SOC), and beta-xylosidase activity. Our results highlight the diverse influences of land-use type on litter decomposition in different altitudes. The positive effects of mowing on shoot decomposition were stronger in lower than higher altitude compared to grazing due to the stronger responses of the plant (e.g., litter and aboveground biomass) and soil (e.g., soil moisture, soil bulk density, and SOC). Soil nutrients (e.g., SOC and soil total nitrogen) seemed to play essential roles in root decomposition, which was increased in mowing plots at lower altitude and vice versa at higher altitude. Therefore, grazing significantly decreased root mass loss at higher altitude, but slightly increased at lower altitude compared to mowing. Our results indicated that the land use might variously regulate the innate differences of the plant and edaphic conditions along an altitude gradient, exerting complex impacts in litter decomposition and further influencing carbon and nutrient cycling in mountain grasslands.

AB  - Long-lived organisms are likely to respond to a rapidly changing climate with behavioral flexibility. Animals inhabiting the arid parts of southern Africa face a particularly rapid rise in temperature which in combination with food and water scarcity places substantial constraints on the ability of animals to tolerate heat. We investigated how three species of African antelope-springbok Antidorcas marsupialis, kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros and eland T. oryx-differing in body size, habitat preference and movement ecology, change their activity in response to extreme heat in an arid savanna. Serving as a proxy for activity, dynamic body acceleration data recorded every five minutes were analyzed for seven to eight individuals per species for the three hottest months of the year. Activity responses to heat during the hottest time of day (the afternoons) were investigated and diel activity patterns were compared between hot and cool days. Springbok, which prefer open habitat, are highly mobile and the smallest of the species studied, showed the greatest decrease in activity with rising temperature. Furthermore, springbok showed reduced mean activity over the 24 h cycle on hot days compared to cool days. Large-bodied eland seemed less affected by afternoon heat than springbok. While eland also reduced diurnal activity on hot days compared to cool days, they compensated for this by increasing nocturnal activity, possibly because their predation risk is lower. Kudu, which are comparatively sedentary and typically occupy shady habitat, seemed least affected during the hottest time of day and showed no appreciable difference in diel activity patterns between hot and cool days. The interplay between habitat preference, body size, movement patterns, and other factors seems complex and even sub-lethal levels of heat stress have been shown to impact an animal's long-term survival and reproduction. Thus, differing heat tolerances among species could result in a shift in the composition of African herbivore communities as temperatures continue to rise, with significant implications for economically important wildlife-based land use and conservation.

AB  - A loss of trees in many African savannas has raised concerns over the effects of increasing herbivore populations, particularly African elephants (Loxodonta africana), on the persistence of large tree populations. To assess the potential for tree recovery, we used an herbivore exclosure experiment in Kruger National Park, South Africa, to estimate the effects of herbivores on survival, recruitment, and population growth rates for three common savanna tree species. We individually tagged trees and tracked their demography over three years in mega- and large herbivore exclosures, megaherbivore only exclosures, and open control plots. We found that megaherbivores generally limited tree survival and population growth; however, both mega- and large herbivores had varying effects on tree species with different antiherbivore strategies (i.e., resistance versus tolerance), suggesting they have the potential to shift tree species composition. Herbivores did not influence tree recruitment rates, which were low across treatments and species. Therefore, even with a reduction in megaherbivore pressure and subsequent increase in tree survival, tree populations are unlikely to recover quickly unless conditions conducive to their recruitment are met. Management efforts should focus on implementing strategies that will promote tree recruitment in these landscapes.

AB  - Silvopastoral use (combined livestock and forestry) is widely distributed in South America's native forests. Without medium to long-term planning, this activity may affect the population dynamics of the dominant canopy tree species, resulting in forest degradation. The early stages of tree life cycles are usually the most vulnerable, so the successful establishment and development of seedlings and saplings is a key indicator of the potential for continuity of the tree layer over time. This study evaluated the effect of silvopastoral use intensity (SUI) upon the density and development of dominant tree species -Austrocedrus chilensis and Nothofagus dombeyi -along a gradient generated by spatially and temporally heterogeneous livestock activity and forest harvesting in mixed forests of northwestern Patagonia, Argentina. We monitored the survival and growth of 740 seedlings and saplings over two years (2018-2020) in three medium-sized estates SUI gradients and upland migration of livestock during the summer season. We also evaluated changes in biophysical variables that influence the tree regeneration process: light input, soil moisture, and understory vegetation structure. We found that higher SUI modifies the biophysical environment, increasing light input and horizontal understory cover. The response of saplings and seedlings to SUI was not homogenous; N. dombeyi showed significant changes in its regeneration dynamics, denoted by a decrease in the density of seedlings and an increase in the density and height growth of the saplings along the SUI gradient. Meanwhile, A. chilensis only showed tendencies to deformation by browsing (height: diameter ratio). Thus, in medium-size estates with low stocking rates and which are free of herbivory during summers; fast-growing species (e.g. N. dombeyi) could be favored by the slight canopy openings, compensating for the negative impact of browsing. However, it is necessary to monitor and potentially individually protect A. chilensis saplings until browsing height is exceeded.

AB  - Pectis imberbis is an endangered plant found in the Madrean Archipelago ecoregion of southern Arizona. Numerous, potentially interacting stressors, such as drought, shifting fire regimes, invasive species, and grazing by domesticated and wild ungulates, affect this species and region. We used Integral Projection Models (IPMs) to describe dynamics of the largest documented P. imberbis population. While collecting census data, we quantified impacts of species interacting with P. imberbis, including pollinators, Coues deer (Odocoileus virginianus couesi), and co-occurring vegetation, and evaluated their impact on P. imberbis population vital rates. Despite a large overall size (N= 794), the growth rate for this population was below replacement level (lambda= 0.9519). Browse by Coues deer negatively impacted demographic vital rates. Woody species and perennial grasses afforded protection against browse, especially for small individuals, but in the absence of browse, coincidence with heterospecific vegetation decreased growth, survival, and reproduction of P. imberbis. We observed 12 taxa of invertebrates interacting with P. imberbis flowers, including native bees, flies, and wasps. Seed production by bagged flowers indicated that flowers are self-compatible. In summary, we detected a unique interplay between deer, which negatively impacted P. imberbis populations via browse, and vegetation, which reduced incidence of browse, while simultaneously depressing P. imberbis vital rates when no browse occurred. Findings suggest that shifts in community dynamics, such as introduction of invasive grasses or fluctuations in deer populations, could impact P. imberbis population trajectories. Management actions, including exclusion of herbivores and removal of invasive grasses, should be considered to aid species recovery.

AB  - Most megaherbivores in the Americas went extinct around 10,000 years ago, presumably disrupting the long-distance seed dispersal of large, fleshy-fruited plant species. The neotropical anachronism hypothesis, proposed by Janzen and Martin, suggests that large fruits evolved in response to past selective pressures from now-extinct megafauna. While this explains many key adaptations of 'megafaunal fruit' plants, it lacks robust palaeoecological evidence. Here we use a multiproxy approach that provides evidence of frugivory by the extinct South American proboscidean Notiomastodon platensis. Using a machine learning model that reveals the extinction effects of these megafaunal dispersers in modern ecosystems, we show how losing seed dispersal interactions increased the extinction risk of megafaunal fruit plants in regions across South America lacking smaller surrogate dispersers. Our results imply that current ecosystems may undergo further functional changes under continuing anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - In response to warming temperatures, species worldwide are expanding their range poleward. As these species move into new ecosystems, they interact with novel organisms and may alter food webs. Climate-driven expansions can thus lead to cascading changes in ecological interaction webs, affecting ecosystem function and services. However, climate change rarely acts in isolation. Other anthropogenic stressors, such as pollution and habitat conversion, act in concurrence with the indirect, biotic effects of climate change. In this study, we employed gut content analysis to investigate dietary similarity between sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus) and an expanding tropical congener, sea bream (A. rhomboidalis), in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida (USA). We paired these data with long-term seagrass and macroalgae monitoring data to investigate the effects of a macrophyte cover gradient, as a proxy for eutrophication-driven die-offs, on the diets of these fish species. Sheepshead and sea bream had highly similar diets, dominated by macrophytes. Furthermore, tropical sea bream consumed more seagrass at locations with higher seagrass abundance compared to low seagrass abundance, whereas sheepshead consumed a similar amount across seagrass abundance levels. These results suggest sea bream have the potential to negatively affect future recoveries of currently declining sheepshead populations. Invasion of sea bream may also hinder recovery of imperiled seagrass populations by increasing grazing pressure in this eutrophic, light-limited system. We provide evidence that the indirect effects of climate change and other anthropogenic stressors can interact and influence ecological interactions.

AB  - Geese can profoundly affect arctic ecosystems directly (e.g., by grazing vegetation) and indirectly (e.g. by changing nutrient cycling resulting from faces inputs and by reducing plant litter). In the Arctic, behavior and abundance of geese have changed due to climate and land-use change. While the short-term effects of increased goose populations on tundra ecosystems are known, there is a knowledge gap for long-term consequences of goose population changes on nutrient cycling and plant communities, especially in the High-Arctic. Here, we compared wetland sites where geese have been almost absent for at least 50 years (Pond Inlet), and nearby sites where geese are abundant or sites where they have been excluded experimentally by cages and where the ground has been experimentally fertilized for over 16 years (Bylot Island). Long-term goose disappearance increased inorganic nutrients in wetlands through increased plant litter decomposition and changed community composition, likely by altering competitive relationships between three dominant vascular plant species that are different in terms of nutrient acquisition and use. In experimentally fertilized sites, inorganic nutrients were similarly increased, but fertilization had contrast effects on plant community composition compared with herbivory, released plant species from the nutrient limitation and converted wetland habitats to a dryer state. Overall, our results suggest that the direct effects of goose herbivory on vegetation are more profound than their indirect effects through an alternation of nutrient cycling even in nutrient-limited wetlands of the Arctic. These findings emphasize the need to assess long-term direct impacts of herbivores on vegetation.

AB  - center dot Regenerative management aims to optimize soil microbial function and diversity for enhanced agroecosystem functionality. Understanding the effects of management practices on soil microorganisms is crucial in the context of growing societal interest in this type of management. center dot This study evaluated the short-term effects of two soil conservation practices: sheep grazing and no-till, on abundance, diversity, activity, and network complexity of prokaryotes and fungi in a vineyard soil. Four treatments were applied for 3 years: (1) grazed and tilled, (2) grazed and non-tilled, (3) non-grazed and tilled, and (4) non-grazed and non-tilled. We hypothesized that stacking of conservation practices (grazing and no-till) would increase microbial diversity, function, and network complexity. center dot Grazing had strong effects on microbial function, increasing the alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, cellulase, phosphatase, and beta-xylosidase enzymatic activity by 82%, 48%, 61%, 39%, and 55%, respectively, compared to non-grazed soils, while not causing significant changes in soil microbial diversity. Tillage had strong effects on soil prokaryotic and fungal diversity. For prokaryotes, significant interactions in alpha diversity were found between tillage and grazing, and between tillage and sampling location (tractor row and under vine). Fungal Shannon diversity index was higher in the subsoil (15-30 cm) while a significant interaction between depth, location, tillage, and grazing was found for the Chao-1 index. Microbial network properties were only significantly affected by sampling depth. center dot This study shows that the lack of disturbance in non-tilled and non-grazed soils resulted in a more diverse soil community, while grazing stimulated microbial function, thus showing a decoupling between diversity and function in vineyard soil ecosystems.

AB  - Woody plant encroachment is influenced by interactions between the physical environment and vegetation, which create heterogenous microenvironments some of which favor shrub recruitment through mitigation of the abiotic environment. Encroachment of native shrub, Morella cerifera into grasslands on Hog Island, Virginia has been attributed to warmer winter temperature; however, recruitment of seedlings in grasslands may be impacted by multiple factors at the level of the microhabitat. Our study focuses on a critical gap in understanding factors specifically influencing M. cerifera seedling recruitment and survival. By experimentally planting M. cerifera seedlings at varying dune elevations and grass densities, we tested hypotheses that dune elevation influences the microclimate, soil characteristics and vegetation cover and that grass cover/density is related to shrub establishment. We tested these hypotheses through gathering data from temperature data loggers, conducting soil water content and chloride analyses, and determining percent cover of grasses relative to dune elevation. Results indicate that dune elevation was positively related to moderated temperatures with reduced temperature extremes and vegetation cover/composition that led to favorable locations for M. cerifera establishment and growth. Where dune elevation is > 2 m, we document an upper limit of grass cover on natural seedling establishment, suggesting a switch from facilitative to competitive effects with grass density. Overall, our work demonstrates interactions between dune elevation and medium grass density has a facilitative influence on M. cerifera establishment and can be used for future predictions of shrub growth with rising sea-levels.

AB  - Grazing is well-known to shape plant populations and plant communities and to affect several compartment characteristics of grazed ecosystems. Semi-natural grassland conservation depends on the maintenance of traditional extensive grazing systems which can exist for centuries, even millennia. However, very few studies have concomitantly investigated the effect of grazing management on plant, forage, litter and soil compartments and the implications of their potential interactions for conservation after recent changes in grazing practices.This study thus aimed to identify the concomitant effects of sheep grazing on the latter compartments of Mediterranean grasslands. We further investigated the effects of a recent change from millenia-old traditional herding to contemporary fenced free grazing. We also sought to determine how this change may impact the agronomic and ecological value of these grasslands.Surveys were carried out at 6 different study sites paired by the two different grazing practices in a French Mediterranean sub-steppic vegetation ("Crau" plain in Southeastern France).Using linear models and distance-based redundancy analysis, effects of grazing intensity, grazing practices and their interactions were tested on plant community, forage, litter and soil physicochemical properties. Our results show that, there was a significant effect of grazing intensity on the four studied compartments, with significantly higher species richness and evenness at moderate grazing intensity. Biomass was also significantly higher at moderate grazing intensity. Digestibility of forage, litter quality and soil fertility decreased significantly under less intensive grazing. Significant differences were also found in the relative size of the areas covered by each plant communities. Recent fenced free grazing led to significantly more intensively grazed zones, with more mesophilous/nitrophilous vegetation. Conversely, in zones traditionally less intensively grazed, the contempo-rary free grazing led to higher plant species-richness but again with more mesophilous species. Implications for conservation management are that the legacy of millennia-old traditional herding still compensates partly for the effects of changing practice to contemporary fenced free grazing on plant community composition but not on their relative sizes. This indicates an increase in grazing intensity in the remotest zone which could lead to grassland plant community homogenization.

AB  - Grazing management methods are of great significance to the health of alpine meadow soil in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the sustainable use of grassland. Soil microbes are important indicators of soil health. We designed this experiment to clarify the relationship between grazing management practices and soil microorganisms. We investigated the effects of grazing Tibetan sheep, grazing Tibetan sheep + yak, and grazing yak on the soil microbial composition and microbial structure by measuring the physical properties, chemical properties, and enzyme activities of soils in Tianzhu County, Gansu Province. The results showed that grazing by different livestock changes the structure of bacterial and fungal communities in the soil. In particular, Actinobacteria constituted the highest proportion of bacterial community among the grazing modes. The proportion of Ascomycota was the highest in the fungal community. Grazing by Tibetan sheep significantly increased the bacterial community diversity in the soil, with Shannon and Chao indices showing respective increases of 1.23% and 5.10% compared with the sample grazed by Tibetan sheep + yaks. Grazing by Tibetan sheep + yak significantly increased the Shannon index of the fungal community. Both correlation and structural equation modeling analyses indicated that the bacterial community diversity was influenced by soil enzyme activity, whereas the fungal community diversity was influenced by a combination of enzyme activity and physical properties. Overall, Tibetan sheep grazing was found to be more conducive to the healthy development of soil and the sustainable utilization of alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is associated with decreased species diversity. However, the effects of fragmentation on the processes that maintain diversity, such as enemy-mediated negative conspecific density dependence (CDD), are largely unknown. We examined how negative CDD in seedling survival is influenced by habitat fragmentation. We measured the effect of conspecific density on seedling survival of 30 species for 10 years on 25 islands in an artificially fragmented habitat and took parallel measurements of the potential drivers: soil physical and chemical properties, and insect herbivore communities. Increasing densities of conspecific trees and seedlings reduced seedling survival more on larger and more isolated islands. These processes were linked to increases in insect herbivore richness on larger islands, and less fertile soils on more isolated islands. Synthesis. Our results indicate that shifts in the abiotic and biotic conditions of fragmented habitats can modify the mechanisms thought to maintain species coexistence, perhaps contributing to the long-term decay of fragmented ecosystems, and suggesting approaches for restoration. The relationships between island configuration, and insect herbivore communities and soil properties may vary among ecosystems, which could help explain variation among studies in the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity.

AB  - Outdoor recreation benefits local economies, environmental education, and public health and wellbeing, but it can also adversely affect local ecosystems. Human presence in natural areas alters feeding and reproductive behaviors, physiology, and population structure in many wildlife species, often resulting in cascading effects through entire ecological communities. As outdoor recreation gains popularity, existing trails are becoming overcrowded and new trails are being built to accommodate increasing use. Many recreation impact studies have investigated effects of the presence or absence of humans while few have investigated recreation effects on wildlife using a gradient of disturbance intensity. We used camera traps to quantify trail use by humans and mid- to large-sized mammals in an area of intense outdoor recreation-the Upper East River Valley, Colorado, USA. We selected five trails with different types and intensities of human use and deployed six cameras on each trail for five weeks during a COVID-enhanced 2020 summer tourism season. We used occupancy models to estimate detectability and habitat use of the three most common mammal species in the study area and determined which human activities affect the habitat use patterns of each species. Human activities affected each species differently. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) tended to use areas with more vehicles, more predators, and greater distances from the trailhead, and they were more likely to be detected where there were more bikers. Coyotes (Canis latrans) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were most likely to use areas where their prey species occurred, and foxes were more likely to be detected where the vegetation was shorter. Humans and their recreational activities differentially influence different species. More generally, these results reinforce that it is unlikely that a single management policy is suitable for all species and management should thus be tailored for each target species.

We also conducted seed germination tests to determine germination rates and patterns in S. borealis. Environmental factors affecting seedling recruitment of S. borealis and of overstory trees were analysed using spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed models in the Bayesian framework. center dot We observed gradual temporal changes in the environment, including increasing canopy openness and decreasing maximum height of dead S. borealis culms. The seeds germinated slowly and the emergence of current-year S. borealis seedlings peaked in spring-summer in 2019. The tree seedling density after 2019 increased significantly compared to that before the dieback. The model results suggest that tree seedling establishment was enhanced by increased light availability. center dot Continuous field observation beginning before S. borealis dieback revealed gradually enhanced tree recruitment in response to slow decay of the remaining dead culms and slow recovery of S. borealis. The seedling regeneration pattern of understory bamboo partly contributes to a prolonged opportunity for overstory tree regeneration.

AB  - The success of ecosystem restoration depends on a multitude of factors related to both the properties of the ecosystem and resources available for the restoration. The ecological and management characteristics of the site, including the presence of invasive species or existing and continued management practices, may influence the success of restoration. Key to the ability to assess success of restoration is monitoring, which is increasingly being undertaken using remote sensing technology. In this chapter, we focus on invasive species management to restore intertidal wetland vegetation, and present a case study from North Queensland, Australia, where exclusion fences have been constructed to control feral pigs and restore intertidal vegetation. Physical vegetation sampling using quadrats and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery were used to determine vegetation change at five sites using image classification and ground truthing. Wetlands were fenced in an attempt to prevent feral pigs accessing the sites, but this was ultimately unsuccessful owing to existing management practices allowing cattle to graze in fenced wetlands, which presumably afforded feral pig access. Learnings here suggest that restoration initiatives cannot be implemented without first considering existing land management practices and how the two interact or compete with each other. While the use of UAV technology was useful for monitoring, restoration projects still need to be carefully designed with the ecological and management practices in mind in order to be successful.

AB  - Stipa grandis steppe as one of the main community types of temperate grasslands in Northern China plays important roles in livestock production and ecological security. Current grassland degradation research links climate change and human activities to soil properties, community traits, and ecosystem functions, but the relationships of plant traits, diversity and ecosystem function remain unclear. To achieve sustainable development of temperate grassland ecosystem, there is a fundamental need to explore the current situations of Stipa grandis steppe and the trade-offs of ecological functions during restoration. We conducted experiments on 120 Stipa grandis community plots (5 m x 5 m) at different restoration stages based on field investigation in Inner Mongolia, China. The relationships of plant traits, diversity, plant organic carbon storage and soil organic carbon storage are analyzed, and the trade-offs of related ecological functions during grassland restoration are explored. The results show that (1) Enclosure effectively promotes plant organic carbon storage, specific leaf area, specific root length, and soil organic carbon concen-tration of Stipa grandis. (2) Compared with A1 stage (heavy grazing with 1.8-2.7 sheep ha1 half year-1), enclosure effectively promotes species diversity and functional diversity of Stipa grandis community. (3) Soil carbon storage shows a significant positively correlation with functional diversity in the early stage of grassland restoration, and a significant positively correlation with species diversity in the late stage of grassland restoration. (4) B2 stage (enclosure lasting 8-14 years) has higher function trade-offs and lower functional benefits, which is the critical stage for plant diversity and soil organic carbon storage. Our findings highlight plant traits and community function of Stipa grandis steppe during restoration, which provide scientific basis necessary to promote grassland sustainability and restoration in similar areas.

AB  - Seed production and survival are critical steps in the life cycle of plants, and could become bottlenecks for plant regeneration in case of failure. During regeneration many factors, both abiotic and biotic, intervene and interact with each other. After dispersal, environmental variation affects the success of the plant population, so seedling recruitment can display spatial variability. However, few studies of seed production and availability cover a range of habitat conditions (e.g. mature, transitional and post-fire habitats), which makes it difficult to evaluate the potential of site-production relationships. We study how the heterogeneity of habitat structure and composition affects the phenology, production and availability of acorns, mainly holm oak, in a Mediterranean Natural Park. Our results show that meteorological variables determine the phenology of acorn fall. Habitat types present temporal mismatches in falls since, for example, shrublands required a longer period of time for all seeds to fall. Furthermore, habitats with greater tree density and low understory complexity had higher production but smaller acorns. Lower densities promote higher acorn volume (seedling size) as a consequence of less intraspecific competition and more reserves for germination. The proportion of viable acorns available on the ground also decreased substantially in winter, when the proportion of infested acorns increase because the selective consumption of sound acorns by predators. Acorns from mixed forests and shrublands had less pre-dispersal predation by arthropods and post-dispersal predation by wild boar as a result of oak isolation and understory complexity. Conversely, rodents are more abundant in shrublands, where they find a greater diversity of antipredator refuges and large nutritious acorns available in autumn and winter. Understanding the reproductive constraints imposed by time and space allows us to infer the consequences of environmental changes on population recruitment and persistence. We thus show that habitats with a high density of oak trees, less plant diversity and understory cover had a greater prevalence of infested acorns, thereby reducing recruitment viability. These habitats also had more available acorns on the ground for seed predators. Therefore, habitat type is an important factor affecting acorn production and should be taken into account in future studies.

AB  - A major component of Earth's dry surface is human-managed grassland, making the relationships among management actions, grassland biodiversity and ecosystem services of great ecological interest. Common management practices-fertiliser addition and large herbivore grazing-influence grassland diversity and productivity. The Nutrient Network, a distributed research effort, investigates these relationships across grasslands at a global scale. The Burren contains internationally important grasslands with high biodiversity maintained by traditional farming practices. Using six years of data from the Slieve Carran Nutrient Network site, we examine the effects of fertilisation and large mammal herbivory on plant diversity and biomass in a unique Irish context. We find 1) fertiliser addition and herbivore exclusion both decrease diversity and increase biomass, and 2) independent of our experimental treatments, biomass increased throughout the study. Our findings on treatment effects align with results from the wider Nutrient Network experiment. Additionally, the increase in biomass during the study is consistent with an abandonment effect. This research shows twin pressures of agricultural intensification and abandonment of traditional management practises detrimentally impact Burren grassland biodiversity.This is relevant to future management decisions, as biodiversity provides key ecosystem services in the Burren, including supporting tourism that contributes to local economies.

AB  - Maintaining the resilience and functionality of savannas is key to sustaining the ecosystem services they provide. This maintenance is largely dependent on the resilience of savannas to stressors, such as prolonged droughts. The resilience to drought is largely determined by the interaction of herbivores and the functional composition of vegetation. So far, our understanding and ability to predict the response of savannas to drought under different types of rangeland use and as a function of vegetation composition are still limited. In this study, we used the ecohydrological, spatially-explicit savanna model EcoHyD to determine if the resilience of a savanna rangeland towards prolonged droughts can be enhanced by the choice of rangeland use type (grazer-dominated, mixed-feeders or browser-dominated) and animal density. We evaluated the ability of a Namibian savanna system to withstand droughts and recover from droughts based on its perennial grass cover and the overall species composition. Generally, we determined a low resilience under high grazer densities. Most importantly, we found that functional diversification of herbivores and plants acted as resilience insurance against droughts, leading to greater resistance and recovery of perennial grasses. In particular, a higher proportion of herbivores allowed for higher resilience, probably also due to a short-term switch to more drought-resistant or unpalatable species. In this case, herbivore diversification was of high self-regulatory value by reestablishing trophic complexity, reducing the need for additional management interventions. Synthesis and applications: Savanna systems will be more resistant to drought if (i) a dense perennial grass cover is maintained, protecting the topsoil from heat-induced water losses and erosion, encompassing functionally important species that are particularly well adapted to water stress and that are palatable, if (ii) the grazing pressure is adjusted to the productivity of the system, and (iii) the herbivore community includes browsers.

AB  - The high diversity of insects has limited the volume of long-term community data with a high taxonomic resolution and considerable geographic replications, especially in forests. Therefore, trends and causes of changes are poorly understood. Here we analyse trends in species richness, abundance and biomass of nocturnal macro moths in three quantitative data sets collected over four decades in forests in southern Germany. Two local data sets, one from coppiced oak forests and one from high oak forests included 125K and 48K specimens from 559 and 532 species, respectively. A third regional data set, representing all forest types in the temperate zone of central Europe comprised 735K specimens from 848 species. Generalized additive mixed models revealed temporal declines in species richness (-38%), abundance (-53%) and biomass (-57%) at the regional scale. These were more pronounced in plant host specialists and in dark coloured species. In contrast, the local coppiced oak forests showed an increase, in species richness (+62%), while the high oak forests showed no clear trends. Left and right censoring as well as cross validation confirmed the robustness of the analyses, which led to four conclusions. First, the decline in insects appears in hyper diverse insect groups in forests and affects species richness, abundance and biomass. Second, the pronounced decline in host specialists suggests habitat loss as an important driver of the observed decline. Third, the more severe decline in dark species might be an indication of global warming as a potential driver. Fourth, the trends in coppiced oak forests indicate that maintaining complex and diverse forest ecosystems through active management may be a promising conservation strategy in order to counteract negative trends in biodiversity, alongside rewilding approaches.

AB  - Wind power is a rapidly growing renewable energy sector that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and provides sustainable energy. However, environmental destruction in wind power plant areas, particularly in wind farms within forests, is an emerging issue. This study aimed to analyze the impact of wind-farm roads on terrestrial animals in forested areas. A camera trap survey was conducted to investigate the impact of road management on wildlife behavior. We installed 52 cameras along roads connecting wind turbines for three months (1st October to 30th December 2021) on the Yeongyang-gun wind farm in South Korea and evaluated animal occupancy and detection probabilities using an occupancy model. Factors related to terrain and vegetation were used to estimate the occupancy probability (station use). The detection analysis included the presence or absence of guardrails, wind turbines, shrublands, and retaining walls. Additional variables included camera type, number of camera-operating days, and survey time. During the survey period, seven terrestrial mammals (roe deer, wild boar, water deer, raccoon dogs, badgers, leopards, cats, and martens) were captured using cameras. Based on camera trap records, roe deer was the most dominant species, followed by wild boars, raccoon dogs, and water deer, with fewer badgers and martens. The presence of forests in the road area was a significant factor for most species in terms of use probability, and camera type was significant for detection probability. Detecting animals along roads shows that roads are passageways for wildlife, affecting animal behavior during vehicle movement and can cause habitat disconnection. Our results demonstrate that wind farms are indirectly linked to wildlife distribution and welfare. Effective management policies for mitigating wildlife disruption can support sustainable ecosystems and biodiversity. The results of this study can serve as a reference for supporting wildlife conservation, terrestrial ecosystems, and environmental impact assessments.

AB  - Evidence is mounting that vertebrate defaunation greatly impacts global biogeochemical cycling. Yet, there is no comprehensive assessment of the potential vertebrate influence over plant decomposition, despite litter decay being one of the largest global carbon fluxes. We therefore conducted a global meta-analysis to evaluate vertebrate effects on litter mass loss and associated element release across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here we show that vertebrates affected litter decomposition by various direct and indirect pathways, increasing litter mass loss by 6.7% on average, and up to 34.4% via physical breakdown. This positive vertebrate impact on litter mass loss was consistent across contrasting litter types (woody and non-woody), climatic regions (boreal, temperate and tropical), ecosystem types (aquatic and terrestrial) and vertebrate taxa, but disappeared when evaluating litter nitrogen and phosphorus release. Moreover, we found evidence of interactive effects between vertebrates and non-vertebrate decomposers on litter mass loss, and a larger influence of vertebrates at mid-to-late decomposition stages, contrasting with the invertebrate effect known to be strongest at early decomposition stage. Our synthesis demonstrates a global vertebrate control over litter mass loss, and further stresses the need to account for vertebrates when assessing the impacts of biodiversity loss on biogeochemical cycles.
   Across terrestrial and aqueous ecosystems, vertebrates increase litter decomposition, both directly and indirectly, by 6.7% on average, and this effect interacts with but generally occurs at a later stage of decomposition than the effect of invertebrates.

AB  - Elevated nitrogen (N) deposition is changing soil communities around the world and will have unknown consequences for terrestrial ecosystem functions. In this study, we investigated a field experiment that lasted for 13 years to explore the effect of simulated N deposition and seasonal variations on the soil faunal community structure in a temperate natural secondary forest. The experimental design included a control group (0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), CK), low N addition (25 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), LN), and high N addition (50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), HN). The results showed that long-term high N addition reduced the soil pH, C/N ratio, and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and increased the total phosphorus. The soil faunal community structure after high N addition was significantly different from those after the CK and low N addition treatments. The overall trend was that abundance and richness increased under low N addition and decreased under high N addition. Further analysis showed that the abundance of omnivores and detritivores was lowest after high N addition, significantly less than the CK and low N addition. The interaction of N addition and seasonal dynamics had a significant impact on herbivores. We found that these changes were driven by differences in ecological strategies such as food and environmental preferences. Furthermore, temperature, moisture, nutrients, and pH in the soil environment were the key factors driving ecological strategies and environmental factors. Seasonal variations significantly affected the soil faunal community structure, showing the highest abundance, richness, diversity, and functional group abundance and richness of the soil faunal community in September. Nitrogen addition and seasonal dynamics significantly affected the abundance and richness of soil fauna by changing soil nutrient concentrations, MBC, and plant diversity. Our study showed that long-term high N addition reduced the abundance and functional group abundance of the soil fauna in natural secondary forests, while low N addition had a positive effect on soil faunal community structure. Collectively, the results suggest that the seasonal balance of soil fauna is affected after long-term N addition, which increases the seasonal sensitivity of soil fauna.

AB  - Multifunctional landscapes that support economic activities and conservation of biological diversity (e.g., cattle ranches with native forest) are becoming increasingly important because small remnants of native forest may comprise the only habitat left for some wildlife species. Understanding the co-occurrence between wildlife and disturbance factors, such as poaching activity and domesticated ungulates, is key to successful management of multifunctional landscapes. Tools to measure co-occurrence between wildlife and disturbance factors include camera traps and autonomous acoustic recording units. We paired 52 camera-trap stations with acoustic recorders to investigate the association between 2 measures of disturbance (poaching and cattle) and wild ungulates present in multifunctional landscapes of the Colombian Orinoquia. We used joint species distribution models to investigate species-habitat associations and species-disturbance correlations. One model was fitted using camera-trap data to detect wild ungulates and disturbance factors, and a second model was fitted after replacing camera-trap detections of disturbance factors with their corresponding acoustic detections. The direction, significance, and precision of the effect of covariates depended on the sampling method used for disturbance factors. Acoustic monitoring typically resulted in more precise estimates of the effects of covariates and of species-disturbance correlations. Association patterns between wildlife and disturbance factors were found only when disturbance was detected by acoustic recorders. Camera traps allowed us to detect nonvocalizing species, whereas audio recording devices increased detection of disturbance factors leading to more precise estimates of co-occurrence patterns. The collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) co-occurred with disturbance factors and are conservation priorities due to the greater risk of poaching or disease transmission from cattle.

AB  - Extensive cattle ranging is an important economic activity in mountains, with diverse effects on native mammal communities. The effects of cattle Bos taurus can be negative, positive or neutral, mostly depending on the stocking rate. We examined the effect of cattle on the diversity and abundance of native mammalian species in the Austral Yungas region of Argentina, considering environmental variables, land protection status, and human influence. Using 12,512 trap-nights from 167 camera-trap stations over 11 years (2009-2019), we calculated a relative abundance index using camera events and used generalized linear models to estimate the effect of cattle on small mammals, large herbivores, species of conservation concern and felids. Cattle had different effects on each group of native mammals. We observed a lower abundance of large native herbivores and the absence of small mammals in areas with high cattle abundance. The tapir Tapirus terrestris, jaguar Panthera onca and white-lipped peccary Tayassu pecari are rare in the Yungas and therefore potentially vulnerable to extinction there. Conservation of small felids and low cattle abundance could be compatible, but felids are threatened by other anthropogenic influences. Native mammalian diversity and richness were related to land protection status. The entire ecoregion is potentially suitable for cattle, suggesting the potential for further threats, and that cattle should be excluded from strictly protected areas. To ensure extensive cattle ranging is compatible with wildlife conservation in areas where exclusion is not possible, we recommend improved management of cattle and moderate stocking rates.

AB  - In the actual context of global change and biodiversity depletion, soil bioengineering represents an important tool for riparian ecosystem restoration and species conservation. Various techniques have already been implemented, but their adaptation still must be carried out in Caribbean Islands biodiversity hotspots, where suitable species remains unknown. Nitrogen-fixing legumes are particularly relevant for ecological restoration and the diversity of native Caribbean legume trees is promising in the search for suitable species for soil bioengineering. We hypothesized that Caribbean legume tree species present a growth performance and set of biotechnical traits compatible with their use in soil bioengineering. We selected five native legume trees, adapted to riparian environments, in different ecosystems (swamp forest, evergreen seasonal forest, rainforest) based on their ecology, resistance to disturbance and seed production characteristics. We measured root traits relevant for soil bioengineering on nursery grown 3-month-old seedlings. Despite their differences in sensitivity to herbivory and in growth strategies, the selected species have a high potential for use in soil bioengineering, with high seed production, high germination rates-from 88 to 100%-, and 100% survival rates, and are therefore compatible with large scale plant material production. We provided practical guidance tools for their integration into soil bioengineering techniques.

AB  - Climate change and land-use intensification pose increasing threats to biodiversity, with climate change expected to eventually surpass other global environmental change drivers and become the greatest threat to biodiversity in the future. Understanding the combined ecological impacts of multiple global change drivers is crucial to predict future scenarios of biodiversity change. However, experimental evidence for the impacts of land-use intensification under current and future climate scenarios is lacking, even though this is imperative for understanding future trajectories of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We experimentally tested for the simultaneous effects of land-use intensification and climate change on arthropod biodiversity in a field-scale grassland experiment known as the Global Change Experimental Facility (GCEF). Specifically, we tested whether future scenarios of climate change are likely to exacerbate impacts of land-use intensification on arthropod diversity and abundance across different trophic levels by sampling aboveground arthropod communities in low and high land-use intensity grasslands under current and future climatic conditions. We found that climate change reduced total abundances of arthropods and increased evenness of the whole community, while only having trophic level-specific effects on detritivore abundance and evenness. Land-use intensification reduced abundance of the whole community, predators and detritivores, but only eroded species richness of the whole community and herbivores, with the magnitude of declines in predator and detritivore abundance depending on the climate scenario. Additionally, both land-use intensification and climate altered species composition of the whole community and within the predator, herbivore, and detritivore trophic levels. We show that climate change and land use intensification cause simultaneous shifts in arthropod abundance, species richness, and species composition across trophic levels. Changes in arthropod communities as a result of climate change and land-use intensification will likely have profound consequences for ecosystem functioning under future environmental conditions.

AB  - The ongoing loss of large trees and densification of shrubs are two prevalent processes that take place in African savannas, with profound consequences for their structure and function. We evaluated herbivore impacts on savanna woody communities using a long-term exclosure experiment in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, with three treatments: the exclusion of large mammals only (i.e. elephant and giraffe), exclusion of all herbivores larger than a hare, and areas open to all herbivores. We asked three questions: (1) How did variable exclusion of herbivores affect woody density and structure across the catena (i.e. riparian, sodic and crest vegetation)? (2) Did the exclusion of herbivores result in unique woody species composition? (3) Did herbivore exclusion result in a higher proportion of palatable species? After 17 years, we found that herbivores mainly affected the heights and densities of existing species, rather than leading to turnover of woody species assemblages. Although densities of individuals increased in the full exclosure (350 ha(-1)), the change was more moderate than expected. By contrast, mixed mega-and meso-herbivores decreased the number of trees and shrubs (decreases of 780 ha(-1)) via a variety of physical impacts. Meso-herbivores alone, on the other hand, had less impact on individual density (i.e. no change), but limited average height growth and canopy dimensions in certain habitat types. Where elephants are present, they are effective at reducing the density of woody stems to the point of counteracting woody encroachment, but at the same time are actively preventing the persistence of large trees (> 5 m) as well as preventing trees from recruiting to larger size classes. However, the lack of massive recruitment and woody cover increases with elephant exclusion, especially for more preferred species, suggests that factors beyond elephants, such as dispersal limitation, seed predation, and drought, are also acting upon species.

   The sustainable management of the southern African woodlands is closely linked to the livelihoods of over 150 M people. Findings from the Socio-Ecological Observatory for the Southern African Woodlands (SEOSAW) will underpin the sustainability of two of the largest industries on the continent: woodfuels and timber. SEOSAW will also improve our understanding of how human use shapes the biogeography and functioning of these ecosystems.
   Summary
   Here we describe a new network of researchers and long-term, in situ, measurements that will characterize the changing socio-ecology of the woodlands of southern Africa. These woodlands encompass the largest savanna in the world, but are chronically understudied, with few long-term measurements. A network of permanent sample plots (PSPs) is required to: (a) address management issues, particularly related to sustainable harvesting for energy and timber; (b) understand how the woodlands are responding to a range of global and local drivers, such as climate change, CO2 fertilization, and harvesting; and (c) answer basic questions about biogeography, ecosystem function, and the role humans play in shaping the ecology of the region. We draw on other successful networks of PSPs and adapt their methods to the specific challenges of working in southern African woodlands. In particular we suggest divergences from established forest monitoring protocols that are needed to (a) adapt to a high level of ecosystem structural diversity (from open savanna to dry forest); (b) quantify the chronic disturbances by people, fire, and herbivores; (c) quantify the diversity and function of the understory of grasses, forbs, and shrubs; (d) understand the life histories of resprouting trees; and (e) conduct work in highly utilized, human-dominated landscapes. We conclude by discussing how the SEOSAW network will integrate with remote sensing and modeling approaches. Throughout, we highlight the challenges inherent to integrating work by forest and savanna ecologists, and the wide range of skills needed to fully understand the socio-ecology of the southern African woodlands.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands are commonly managed as a grazing resource for domestic livestock but, due to their unique biodiversity, they are also of conservation interest. Numerous drivers have impacted on the status of these grasslands in recent decades, most importantly changing grazing management strategies. These changes have the potential to affect the biodiversity associated with these habitats, including on some rich invertebrate assemblages. Responses, however, are often dissimilar between different invertebrate taxa. We investigated the responses of ground beetles to different grazing regimes within a replicated, controlled, long-term grazing experiment on upland semi-natural grassland in Scotland. Although there was substantial overlap of species composition of ground beetle assemblages in different grazing treatments, species richness, abundance and Shannon diversity of ground beetles were significantly lower in ungrazed plots than in plots subject to high- or low-intensity sheep grazing. Ground beetle abundance (but not species richness or diversity) was lower in ungrazed plots compared to those with low-intensity mixed grazing by sheep and cattle. However, no differences were identified in abundance, species richness or diversity between the three grazed treatments. Our results suggest that ground beetles may show different responses to grazing compared to responses of some other invertebrate groups and demonstrate the difficulty of attempting to manage grazing to optimise conditions for a wide range of invertebrates.

AB  - Large mammals (megafauna) are disproportionately important for ecosystem functioning and biodiversity, but have been lost to disproportionate degrees, mostly in prehistoric times. Against the background of scientific knowledge regarding the state of ecosystems before a man-made wave of extinctions significantly reduced the numbers and diversity of megafauna on most continents, this article examines how (inter)national law and policy relate to efforts to restore large herbivores, omnivores and carnivores to terrestrial ecosystems around the world. Such megafauna rewilding, involving the (re)introduction of vanished species or proxies thereof, poses significant challenges to current laws and policies at national and domestic levels. These tend to have institutionalised a collective amnesia and myopia regarding what is 'natural' and 'indigenous'. The success of future megafauna restoration efforts will partly depend on an understanding of what it takes to navigate, adjust or redesign applicable legal frameworks, and the article tables a research agenda to that end.

AB  - Invasive species are ranked as one of the leading drivers of global biodiversity loss. To mitigate their impact, we must understand the future risks caused by invasive species, particularly to flora of conservation concern. Here we used species distribution modelling (SDM) to project the current and future (RCP45 and RCP85 2050) distributions of four deer species and 13 plant species of conservation concern for the island of Ireland, quantifying changes in distributions and overlap. Large areas of suitable habitat for the deer species were predicted with high accuracy across all counties, with future climate scenarios identifying an expansion in sika deer distributions and a decrease in muntjac and fallow deer distributions. Red deer declined under the moderate climate change scenario but increased under the worst-case projection. Future projections predicted the (local) extinction of six (out of 13) endangered and vulnerable plant species. An expansion in distributions was observed for four plant species; however, these areas had large overlap with the future predictions of deer, placing further pressures on these plant species. These findings suggest that targeted conservation and management measures are required to alleviate the pressures on 'at-risk' plant species due to grazing from native and non-native deer.

AB  - Feral swine (Sus scrofa) as an invasive species in the U.S. have caused severe damage to natural resources through competing for food resources with domestic livestock and destroying habitat by rooting and wallowing. Given their increased population and wide distribution in the southern U.S., feral swine control is becoming an urgent issue for both natural resource managers and landowners. We conducted a three-state mail survey to examine feral swine damage in Arkansas, Louisiana, and East Texas in the western gulf region in 2021. Our results reveal that feral swine activities like rooting and wallowing can cause severe and widespread damage to agriculture and forestry. Among the most reported and concerned damage by feral swine were crops, pastures, livestock, and loss of land value. Soybean damage was the most important agricultural crop damage in both Arkansas and Louisiana while it was hay, silage, and forage crops in East Texas. In terms of livestock damage, beef cattle and calves were the most common and severe damage in all three states. Average economic loss due to feral swine damage was estimated at $67.13/ha, $42.96/ha, $27.31/ha, and $57.54/ha for landowners in the region who owned cropland, forestland, pastureland, and multiple land types, respectively. Those findings could help both landowners and wildlife management personnel understand the negative societal impact of feral swine, and they could also facilitate the comparison between expected benefits and costs of control programs/options for feral swine in the southern states.

AB  - Predator-prey relationships can influence community processes, and a rich prey spectrum is important to favour carnivore conservation, as well as to buffer single prey towards intensive predation. Antipredator behavioural responses can occur and can be dynamic in time and space, which may generate counter-responses in predators. However, data are scarce on their role in modulating carnivore diet and behaviour. Data are especially needed for European landscapes that are largely anthropized and have been recently recolonized by large carnivores. In a protected area in central Italy recently recolonized by the wolf and hosting a rich community of wild ungulates, we studied the interactions between this predator and three ungulate species. At the initial stage of wolf recovery, the fallow deer and the wild boar were the main prey, while the roe deer was a minor food item. Through camera-trapping and predator food habits, we assessed temporal changes in wolf-prey relationships throughout 5 years (2017-2022). Wolf detection rates were spatially associated with those of fallow deer and wild boar, but shrub cover was positively related to predator and negatively to prey, suggesting possible prey avoidance of sites with lower visibility and greater predation risk. Throughout the years, the fallow deer increased its diurnal activity, with a decreasing temporal overlap with the predator. The wolf showed crepuscular/nocturnal activity, with an increased synchronization with the wild boar, which replaced the fallow deer as first prey. No support for major spatiotemporal responses was reported for wild boar and roe deer. With the ongoing recovery of carnivores across Europe, conservation priorities may emphasize the need to maintain an efficient ecological role of predators. Our results support the role of antipredator responses in modulating predator behaviour and diet and emphasize the importance of a diverse spectrum of wild prey to ensure the conservation of the ecological role of carnivores.
   Predator-prey interactions have been suggested to influence community processes, with important implications for ecosystem conservation. We found that prey temporal avoidance towards the wolf can occur more temporally than spatially in a Mediterranean ecosystem. This antipredator behaviour can drive the wolf's prey switching with important implications for conservation and management aims.image

AB  - Buffer zones surrounding protected areas act as interfaces between humans and wildlife, providing sustainable resource utilization while minimizing negative interactions. This study analyzed data from camera trap sampling to understand habitat use and the effects of anthropogenic impacts on medium and large-sized forest-dwelling mammals in the buffer zone of Melghat Tiger Reserve in Central India. The human population in this region is increasing at a rate of 15 % in a decade. There are instances of human death and injury and frequent cattle lifting by carnivores. Crop damage by wild herbivores is common. These factors impede long term conservation goals in the tiger reserve. Camera trap sampling was carried out in the buffer zone for a period of 33 to 46 days. Camera trap data were analyzed using occupancy modeling to estimate habitat use probability (Psi) Psi ) and detection probability (p). p ). Na & iuml;ve estimates of habitat use ranged from 0.11 to 0.64, while Psi values based on occupancy modeling ranged from 0.23 to 0.71. The study showed a fairly high level of habitat use by mammals in the buffer zone of the tiger reserve. Leopards were found to be associated with abundance of large prey species and human presence. Hyena, gaur, and sambar showed an association with forest cover, while nilgai showed association with scrubland. Chausingha and langur showed an association with sloping terrain. Overall, the study showed that the buffer zone plays an important role as a wildlife habitat and provided insights for prioritizing conservation efforts and management strategies in the study area.

AB  - Effective wildlife conservation requires decomposing the drivers of population dynamics for species affected by anthropogenic habitat alterations. Ungulates are often the focus of management actions to restore habitat and maintain connectivity as they are sensitive to landscape disturbances. We used Bayesian proportional hazards models to assess anthropogenic risk factors that could potentially predict landscape-scale survivorship for pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) in the Northern Sagebrush Steppe ecosystem, where extensive habitat alterations occurred from the conversion of native sagebrush grasslands to agricultural lands. Using 170 adult female pronghorn monitored from 2003 to 2011, we tested the importance of linear features (road and fence densities) and forage productivity (maximum decadal normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) for spatiotemporal pronghorn mortality risk, while accounting for a seasonally varying proxy of snow depth. We found moderate support for the effects of linear features on mortality risk as coefficient estimates translated to predicted declines in survivorship of 27.1% over the observed range of road densities (0-1.4 km/km(2)) and 11.8% over the range of fence densities (0-6.1 km/km(2)) encountered by pronghorn. Our results also suggested that agricultural areas could act as ecological traps for pronghorn, based on mortality risk increasing by a factor of 14.3% with every 0.1 increase in maximum decadal NDVI in summer (range = 0.38-0.73). Like our previous findings, we found considerable support for the effects of average depth (in centimeters) of snow water equivalent (SWE; SWE depth = snow depth x snow density/water density) within pronghorn seasonal ranges, with mortality risk increasing by 45.7% with every 1 cm increase in SWE depth (range = 0-5.37 cm). We then developed the first broadscale, spatially explicit map of predicted annual pronghorn survivorship based on anthropogenic features and environmental gradients to identify areas for conservation and habitat restoration efforts. These efforts to highlight anthropogenic risk factors on the landscape will hopefully support conservation and habitat restoration for pronghorn populations at the northern periphery of their range.

AB  - Roads can have diverse impacts on wildlife species, and while some species may adapt effectively, others may not. Studying multiple species' responses to the same infrastructure in a given area can help understand this variation and reveal the effects of disturbance on the ecology of wildlife communities. This study investigates the behavioural responses of four species with distinctive ecological and behavioural traits to roads in the protected Bohemian Forest Ecosystem in central Europe: European roe deer Capreolus capreolus, a solitary herbivore; red deer Cervus elaphus a gregarious herbivore; wild boar Sus scrofa, a gregarious omnivore and Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx, a solitary large carnivore. We used GPS data gathered from each species to study movement behaviour and habitat selection in relation to roads using an integrated step selection analysis. For all species and sexes, we predicted increased movement rates in response to roads, selection of vegetation cover near roads and open areas after road crossings, and increased road avoidance during the day. We found remarkably similar behavioural responses towards roads across species. The behavioural adaptations to road exposure, such as increased movement rates and selection for vegetation cover, were analogous to responses to natural predation risk. Roads were more strongly avoided during daytime, when traffic volume was high. Road crossings were more frequent at twilight and at night within open areas offering food resources. Gregarious animals exposed to roads favoured stronger road avoidance over faster movements. Ungulates crossed roads more at twilight, coinciding with commuter traffic during winter. Despite differences in the ecology and behaviour of the four species, our results showed similar adaptations towards a common threat. The continuous expansion of the global transportation network should be accompanied by efforts to understand and minimise the impact of roads on wildlife to assist wildlife management and ensure conservation.

AB  - Natural enemies play an important role in controlling plant population growth and vegetation dynamics. Tropical rainforests host the greatest diversity of herbivores, from large mammalian ungulates to microscopic pathogens, generating and maintaining plant diversity. By feeding on the same resources, large mammalian herbivores may interfere with plant consumption and leaf damage by important enemy guilds such as invertebrate herbivores and pathogens, triggering indirect trophic cascades. However, the impact of local extinctions of large herbivores on plant-enemy interactions is relatively unknown. We experimentally tested the effects of defaunation of large mammalian herbivores (e.g. peccaries, tapirs and brocket deer; hereafter, large herbivores) on the leaf damage of 3350 understorey plants in tropical rainforests of Brazil. We examined leaf damage in 10,050 leaves from 333 morphospecies by assigning the area consumed or damaged by five guilds of insect herbivores and leaf pathogens within 86 paired open-closed plots and investigating the joint effects of defaunation and plant phylogenetic diversity. Plants released from large herbivores had 9% less leaf damage; this difference was due to the lower leaf pathogens incidence (29%) rather than insect herbivory. Evolutionary distinctness was positively correlated with leaf damage in a similar way in all treatments, suggesting additive effects of defaunation and phylogenetic diversity. Total and pathogenic leaf damage (but not insect damage) decreased with plant richness across treatments, and large herbivores exclusion resulted in increased plant species richness. This suggests that large herbivores exclusion leads to a dilution of total and pathogens' leaf damage by increasing plant species richness. Our results suggest that indirect effects of large herbivores decrease the dilution potential of plant communities against pathogens and rather reinforce their top-down impact on vegetation, demonstrating a previously overlooked cascading effect of large herbivore extinction on forest ecosystems. Synthesis: The extinction of large mammalian herbivores can lead to a decrease in pathogen-driven leaf damage, a previously unknown indirect effect in forest ecosystems, which might have consequences for plant fitness and ultimately for plant diversity. Large herbivores and plant pathogens might have synergistic effects in regulating the diversity of plant communities in some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth.

As florestas tropicais abrigam a maior diversidade de herbivoros do planeta, desde grandes mamiferos ungulados ate patogenos microscopicos, gerando e mantendo a diversidade vegetal. Ao se alimentar dos mesmos recursos que insetos e patogenos, os grandes mamiferos herbivoros podem interferir no consumo de plantas e nos danos as folhas causados por guildas inimigas, tais como herbivoros invertebrados e patogenos, desencadeando efeitos indiretos em cascatas troficas. Entretanto, o impacto das extincoes locais dos grandes herbivoros nas interacoes entre plantas e seus distintos inimigos naturais e pouco conhecido. Testamos experimentalmente os efeitos da defaunacao de grandes mamiferos herbivoros (por exemplo, queixadas, antas e veados-catingueiros; daqui em diante chamados 'grandes herbivoros') nos danos foliares de 3.350 plantas de sub-bosque em florestas tropicais do Brasil. Examinamos os danos foliares em 10.050 folhas de 333 morfoespecies, atribuindo a area consumida ou danificada a cinco guildas de insetos herbivoros e patogenos foliares em 86 parcelas pareadas (abertas e fechadas) e investigamos os efeitos conjuntos da defaunacao e da diversidade filogenetica das plantas. As plantas nao expostas aos grandes herbivoros apresentaram 9% a menos de danos foliares, sendo essa diferenca atribuida a menor incidencia de patogenos foliares (29%) e nao a herbivoria por insetos. A Distincao Evolutiva das plantas se correlacionou positivamente com os danos foliares e de maneira semelhante em todos os tratamentos, sugerindo efeitos aditivos da defaunacao e da diversidade filogenetica. Os danos foliares totais e patogenicos (mas nao os danos por insetos) diminuiram com a riqueza de plantas entre os tratamentos e a exclusao de grandes herbivoros resultou no aumento da riqueza de especies de plantas. Esse fato sugere que a exclusao de grandes herbivoros leva a uma diluicao dos danos foliares totais e causados por patogenos atraves de um efeito indireto mediado pela riqueza de especies de plantas. Nossos resultados sugerem que os efeitos indiretos dos grandes herbivoros diminuem o potencial de diluicao das comunidades vegetais contra os patogenos e reforcam o seu papel de controladores 'de topo' na vegetacao, demonstrando um efeito cascata anteriormente negligenciado da extincao de grandes herbivoros nos ecossistemas florestais (tropicais). Sintese: A extincao de grandes mamiferos herbivoros pode levar a uma diminuicao dos danos foliares causados por patogenos, um efeito indireto ate entao desconhecido nos ecossistemas florestais, que pode ter consequencias para a aptidao das plantas e, em ultima instancia, para a diversidade vegetal. Grandes herbivoros e patogenos de plantas podem ter efeitos sinergicos na regulacao da diversidade de comunidades vegetais em alguns dos mais diversos ecossistemas do planeta.
   The extinction of large mammalian herbivores can lead to a decrease in pathogen-driven leaf damage, a previously unknown indirect effect in forest ecosystems, which might have consequences for plant fitness and ultimately for plant diversity. Large herbivores and plant pathogens might have synergistic effects in regulating the diversity of plant communities in some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth.image

AB  - A significant challenge of global change is the human-mediated movement of pasture grasses and their subsequent impact on ecosystem processes when they become invasive. We must understand invasive grass ecology and their natural enemies in native and introduced ranges to mitigate these impacts. Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) is a pantropically introduced pasture grass that escapes intended areas and invades native ecosystems - threatening biodiversity and ecosystem function. The success of invasive plants has of-ten been attributed to ecological release from stressors, including natural enemies and resource availability. Our objective was to assess Guinea grass functional traits across three different habitat types in native and invaded ranges by documenting ungulate and arthropod abundance, diversity, and feeding guilds. Guinea grass functional traits were assessed in three habitat types: grassland, riparian, and woody thickets around nitrogen-fixing Prosopis glandulosa in its introduced range in Texas, USA, and Senegalia mellifera in its native range in Kenya. We characterized Guinea grass functional traits by measuring plant height, cover, biomass, root-to-shoot ratios, and reproductive traits. We then examined the phytophagous arthropod and ungulate abundance and feeding guild diversity across the three habitat types. We hypothesized that functional trait expression related to invasiveness would be associated with Guinea grass in its introduced range. Also, we hypothesized that the abundance and diversity of phytophagous arthropods and ungulates would be lower in the invaded range. Finally, we hypothesized that Guinea grass functional traits would differ between the three habitat types, given the habitat types' innate differences in resource availability. We found that Guinea grass was 2.5 times taller and 3.3 times more productive and covered 2.5 times more area in its invaded versus native ranges. Introduced Guinea grass had higher reproduction rates with 2.5 times more reproductive tillers, while habitat type drove vegetative reproduction with 15 times more stoloniferous establishment in wooded and riparian sites than grasslands. Texan ungulate communities were less species-rich, less functionally diverse, and less abundant than the Kenyan ungulate community. The phytophagous arthropod diversity on plants was twice as high on Kenyan Guinea grass than on Texan Guinea grass. Total arthropod family richness was nearly double, with 15 families represented in Kenya and 8 in Texas. These results suggest that Guinea grass has escaped a rich assemblage of arthropods and ungulates and likely explains some of its spread in introduced ranges. This study demonstrates how the invasive success of Guinea grass can be understood in terms of its competitive ability and interaction with natural enemies in the introduced and native ranges and may inform future biological control.

AB  - While mycorrhization rates have been studied in different contexts, not much is known about their temporal patterns across seasons. Here, we asked how mycorrhization rates of 10 deciduous trees assessed by microscopy changed from winter to spring to early summer. We made use of a tree diversity experiment on nutrient-rich soil (former farmland) in Central Germany. In the experiment, saplings of host species with a preference for either arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) or ectomycorrhiza (EM) were planted in monocultures, two-species, and four-species mixtures. In addition, mixtures were composed of tree species of only one mycorrhizal type or by AM/EM trees. For almost all species, with the exception of Aesculus hippocastanum and Acer pseudoplatanus (only AM), dual mycorrhization with both types (AM and EM) was found at every sampling time (December, March, and May), although the expected preferences for certain mycorrhizal types were confirmed. The sampling date had a significant influence on mycorrhization rates of both EM and AM tree species. Frequencies of EM and AM were lowest in May, but there were no differences between December and March. The causes of this seasonal variation may be associated with climate-induced differences in carbon allocation to mycorrhizal tree roots in the temperate climate. Within individual trees, mycorrhization rates by AM and EM fungi were not correlated over time, pointing to asynchronous variation between both types and to independent drivers for AM and EM mycorrhization. At the community level, mycorrhiza frequency of either of the two types became more asynchronous from two-species to four-species mixtures. Thus, increased community asynchrony in mycorrhization could be another important mechanism in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships.

AB  - Livestock grazing alters the diversity and composition of plants and soil biota in grassland ecosystems. However, whether and how grazing affects plant-soil biota interactions are limited. Here, we performed a field investigation on the Tibetan grasslands to determine the relationships between plant community properties (biomass, diversity and richness) and soil biota (abundance, diversity and composition of bacteria, fungi and nematodes) in the long-term yak grazing and ungrazed plots, and responses of plant-soil biota linkages to grazing in alpine meadows and alpine swampy meadows were compared. The results found that grazing did not cause significant changes in plant community properties but increased the soil water content. Further, grazing weakened plant-soil microbes/nematode relationships in alpine meadows. The bacterial and fungal abundances were correlated with plant belowground biomass and Simpson index in the ungrazed plots of alpine meadows, while the correlation was not significant under grazing. Bacterial composition was correlated with plant richness only in the ungrazed meadows. Plant-soil nematode linkages were more sensitive to grazing than plant-microbes linkages. Grazing decoupled the relationships between the abundances of nematode trophic groups and plant aboveground biomass, richness and Simpson index in alpine meadows, while the decoupling phenomenon is less evident in alpine swampy meadows. The SEM results indicate that grazing altered the plant above- and belowground biomass to affect the soil nematode community, while influenced soil microbes only through alterations of plant belowground biomass. The findings highlight the importance of grazing in influencing the interactions between aboveground plant communities and soil biological communities in Tibetan grasslands.

AB  - Mountain biking (MTBing) has become one of the most popular recreational activities and this trend is further amplified with the enhanced use of electrically assisted mountain bikes (eMTBing). While increasing user frequencies are intensifying social and environmental conflicts, the consequences of MTBing in and for the environment are insufficiently understood. The aim of this review is to outline the ecological impacts of conventional mountain biking and to highlight potential differences and consequences arising with the use of eMTBs. The results systematically summarise how MTBing can lead to immediate responses of animals, changes in habitat use and diurnal activity patterns of wildlife, a reduced reproductive success, seed dispersal, trampling damage on flora, vegetation changes in areas adjacent to trails, as well as soil compaction, exposure and erosion. The increasing use of eMTBs will cause a larger frequency and spatial cover by bikers and therefore a rising number of trails. Wildlife will be more affected when off-trail riding increases or when the use of so far less frequented areas or times will intensify. Vegetation and soil will be more affected, when new trails are created. Both aspects are more likely with the switch to eMTBing as steep slopes are climbed faster and more frequently. However, these direct effects of MTBing may not be associated with negative long-term consequences for ecosystems as those depend on the specific species or subjects of protection, the environmental context and possible interactions with other human activities. Overall, long-term consequences for plants and animals are difficult to assess and thus general patterns of how the direct effects of (e)MTBing translate into consequences for population dynamics are yet missing. It is essential to improve the knowledge regarding long-term effects of (e)MTBing on the population and ecosystem level and societal debates regarding (e)MTBing need to differentiate effects relevant for animal welfare from implications for nature conservation.

AB  - Several studies have predicted a loss of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) from many western landscapes, but other studies have suggested that aspen persistence is driven by local site factors. Increased frequency of acute drought has been implicated as an important factor driving overstory mortality and reduced regeneration densities in the region. We investigated the relationship between aspen regeneration and site moisture availability potential using ecosystem type as a proxy. We hypothesized that aspen stands growing along perennial-flowing streams would support higher aspen regeneration densities than upland aspen stands. We compared stand structure, groundcover composition, and regeneration densities of nine riparian aspen stands with nine paired upland aspen stands in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest. Aspen regeneration densities were significantly higher in the riparian aspen stands (845.3 + 318.7 stems ha(-1)) compared to the upland aspen stands (249.1 + 74.1 stems ha(-1)) for regeneration shorter than 1 m (p = 0.0391). Riparian stands also exhibited significantly higher forb (p < 0.001) and graminoid (p < 0.001) cover compared to upland aspen stands, suggesting that riparian sites provided higher site moisture availability. We suggest that riparian areas may provide refugia for aspen in the future considering projections of increased incidence of acute drought.

AB  - We monitored ground-layer vegetation in permanently marked plots in a temperate grassy woodland/sclerophyll forest mosaic, after the removal of sheep, but with continuing macropod grazing. Data collection over 15 years encompassed extremes of drought and high rainfall. Plots were stratified to sample 13 subhabitats reflecting variations in vegetation type and landscape position. Species composition varied with: (i) site productivity (grassy vs sclerophyll forest), (ii) soil moisture (landscape position) and (iii) presence of tree canopies in open grassland. After 15 years, most subhabitats retained their distinctiveness, with net changes suggestive of nutrient decline under tree canopies and increasingly mesic conditions on higher slope positions. Analysis of species richness of 18 origin and life-form groups over time revealed three types of responses: (i) stable, (ii) linear increase and (iii) a quadratic response. The latter was identified for native and exotic species in all habitats, specifically for annuals and short tussocks. There were sustained linear increases in the species richness of three native life forms (geophytes, subshrubs and leafy herbs) suggesting improvements in conservation status, while most native perennial groups were stable. Large perennial native grasses (Themeda triandra, Rytidosperma pallidum, Poa sieberiana and Aristida ramosa) maintained their initial dominance, while that of Lomandra filiformis and Melichrus urceolatus increased. The level of dominance of exotics was largely sustained, although exotic annuals fluctuated in response to seasonal conditions. The frequency of exotic perennial dicots increased slightly, despite intensive control efforts. We attribute the persistence of biomass under severe drought to the high dry matter content of many ground-layer dominants, which served to protect soil and provide refuge to palatable geophytes and native herbs. Our findings are consistent with ecological models that predict that cessation of fertiliser inputs and heavy livestock grazing will promote vegetation with ecosystem attributes resistant to climate extremes.

AB  - Tropical peat swamp forests provide many important ecosystem services, especially their function as global carbon sinks. These carbon-rich wetlands are widespread in South America, yet few studies have examined carbon stocks or losses due to land use change. In the lower Amazon, they are being converted to pastures largely utilized by domestic water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). We quantified carbon stocks in intact peat forests and recently converted pastures (<10 years) at the Lago Piratuba Biosphere Reserve (LPBR) in the lower Amazon of Brazil. The soils of intact forests were typified by shallow organic (peat) horizons at the soil surface. The mean total ecosystem carbon stock (TECS) in intact forests was 354 +/- 28 Mg C ha(-1). In contrast, the TECS of disturbed sites was significantly lower (p = 0.02) with a mean of 248 +/- 17 Mg C ha(-1). We estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from water buffalo (due to enteric fermentation and manure deposition) to be 7.5 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) year(-1). Considering GHG emissions from this land use, the social carbon costs (SCCs) arising from the degradation of coastal Amazon peatlands are as high as US$2742 ha(-1) year(-1). The SCC of meat produced from this land use is as high as US$100/kg of meat produced, which far exceeds the economic returns from livestock. Based on the estimated numbers of water buffalo for the southern portion of the LPBR and the time since initial disturbance, the annual GHG emissions from this land use are estimated to be 602,846 Mg CO(2)e year(-1) with an SCC as high as US$111,526,524 million year(-1). This land use also eliminates opportunity values and services of carbon storage and biodiversity that would be possible from a regenerating biosphere reserve.

AB  - Plant diversity is an important driver of many ecosystem processes within and among trophic levels. There is growing evidence that the strength of plant diversity effects depends on the biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. Plant and soil history may be underlying mechanisms of an observed strengthening of biodiversity effects in aging biodiversity experiments. Temporal changes in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships have been observed primarily for plants, while dynamics of higher trophic levels are little studied. However, similar patterns can be expected for higher trophic levels because of the close links between producers and consumers. Here, we compare the effects of plant diversity on consumer communities (richness, abundance, diversity, and community composition) and consumer-mediated functions (herbivory and predation) in plant communities with different plant and soil histories. Across six study years, plant diversity had a positive effect on consumer richness, abundance, diversity, and herbivory, whereas the level of predation was not significantly affected by plant diversity. Furthermore, consumer community composition shifted significantly with increasing diversity of plant communities. In addition, consumer abundance, composition, and consumer functions (herbivory and predation) differed between plant communities of different histories. However, contrary to our expectations, plant and soil history caused no significant change in the effects of plant diversity on consumer communities and functions, indicating that these history effects do not provide a mechanistic explanation for plant diversity effects on aboveground invertebrate communities. Thus, our results suggest that plant diversity is a major driver of aboveground invertebrate communities and functions across grassland ages and should be maximized to protect and restore multitrophic biodiversity.

AB  - Mountain birch forests (Betula pubescens Ehrh. ssp. czerepanovii) at the subarctic treeline not only benefit from global warming, but are also increasingly affected by caterpillar outbreaks from foliage-feeding geometrid moths. Both of these factors have unknown consequences on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and biogeochemical cycles. We measured SOC stocks down to the bedrock under living trees and under two stages of dead trees (12 and 55 years since moth outbreak) and treeless tundra in northern Finland. We also measured in-situ soil respiration, potential SOC decomposability, biological (enzyme activities and microbial biomass), and chemical (N, mineral N, and pH) soil properties. SOC stocks were significantly higher under living trees (4.1 +/- 2.1 kg m(2)) than in the treeless tundra (2.4 +/- 0.6 kg m(2)), and remained at an elevated level even 12 (3.7 +/- 1.7 kg m(2)) and 55 years (4.9 +/- 3.0 kg m(2)) after tree death. Effects of tree status on SOC stocks decreased with increasing distance from the tree and with increasing depth, that is, a significant effect of tree status was found in the organic layer, but not in mineral soil. Soil under living trees was characterized by higher mineral N contents, microbial biomass, microbial activity, and soil respiration compared with the treeless tundra; soils under dead trees were intermediate between these two. The results suggest accelerated organic matter turnover under living trees but a positive net effect on SOC stocks. Slowed organic matter turnover and continuous supply of deadwood may explain why SOC stocks remained elevated under dead trees, despite the heavy decrease in aboveground C stocks. We conclude that the increased occurrence of moth damage with climate change would have minor effects on SOC stocks, but ultimately decrease ecosystem C stocks (49% within 55 years in this area), if the mountain birch forests will not be able to recover from the outbreaks.

AB  - Fire occurrence affects the distribution of key resources for fauna in natural ecosystems worldwide. For fire management strategies adequate for biodiversity conservation, the understanding of how species respond to fire-induced changes is essential. In this study, we investigated the role of fire regimes on spaces used by medium and large mammals at multiple spatial scales (0.8 ha to 78.5 ha) in a fire-prone savanna ecosystem (Brazilian Cerrado). We sampled mammals using 60 camera traps distributed in 30 sampling units located in grassland and typical savanna formations. We applied single-species occupancy models and AIC-based model selection to assess how mammals use the space in response to pyrodiversity (both diversity of fire frequencies and diversity of fire ages), the proportion of recently burned area, and the proportion of long-unburned area while accounting for detectability. Our results showed that fire regime variables affected the study species differently. Deer species used the space regardless of mosaic pyrodiversity and the proportion of specific fire ages. Fire-related variables, however, affected space use by tapirs and maned wolves. Tapirs preferred to use fire mosaics with lower diversity of fire frequencies, whereas maned wolves more intensively used mosaics with high fire age diversity and a high proportion of recently burned areas. Based on our findings, we recommend that fire management targeting specific mammal species should not necessarily focus on maximum pyrodiversity. Instead, we suggest a management strategy combining "patch mosaic burning" with the maintenance of specific fire-age patches suitable for different species' requirements.

AB  - Proliferations of zoantharians along tropical and subtropical regions are increasingly common and usually associated with anthropogenic impacts and ecosystem degradation. In the Canary Islands, we studied how the dominance in the substrate of Palythoa caribaeorum and Zoanthus pulchellus affected fish communities. For that purpose, we recorded the composition and biodiversity of fish assemblages associated to both zoantharian and macroalgae dominated habitats. In general terms, we found significant reductions of total fish abundance and richness at P. caribaeorum dominated habitats compared with macroalgae stands. However, in terms of trophic structure, there were significant changes within both zoantharian habitats depending on their coverages of the substrate. Herbivores and small invertebrate feeders, which are more adapted to forage in the macroalgae canopy, were less abundant in zoantharian habitats. This study demonstrates that the increasing dominance of zoantharians throughout the archipelago restructure the ecosystems and impact the native fish communities, that may offer a positive feedback for invasive tropical species to thrive.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are the predominant type of mycorrhizal fungi in roots and rhizosphere soil of grass species worldwide. Grasslands are currently experiencing increasing grazing pressure, but it is not yet clear how grazing intensity and host plant grazing preference by large herbivores interact with soil- and root-associated AMF communities. Here, we tested whether the diversity and community composition of AMF in the roots and rhizosphere soil of two dominant perennial grasses, grazed differently by livestock, change in response to grazing intensity. We conducted a study in a long-term field experiment in which seven levels of field-manipulated grazing intensities were maintained for 13 years in a typical steppe grassland in northern China. We extracted DNA from the roots and rhizosphere soil of two dominant grasses, Leymus chinense (Trin.) Tzvel. and Stipa grandis P. Smirn, with contrasting grazing preference by sheep. AMF DNA from root and soil samples was then subjected to molecular analysis. Our results showed that AMF alpha-diversity (richness) at the virtual taxa (VT) level varied as a function of grazing intensity. Different VT showed completely different responses along the gradient, one increasing, one decreasing, and others showing no response. Glomeraceae was the most abundant AMF family along the grazing gradient, which fits well with the theory of disturbance tolerance of this group. In addition, sheep-grazing preference for host plants did not explain much of the variation in AMF alpha-diversity. However, the two grass species exhibited different AMF community composition in their roots and rhizosphere soils. Roots exhibited a lower alpha-diversity and higher beta-diversity within the AMF community than soils. Overall, our results suggest that long-term grazing intensity might have changed the abundance of functionally diverse AMF taxa in favor of those with disturbance-tolerant traits. We suggest our results would be useful in informing the choice of mycorrhizal fungi indicator variables when assessing the impacts of grassland management choices on grassland ecosystem functioning.

AB  - The Asian tapir is a primitive mammal whose habitat is heavily fragmented due to human activities. Studies on the Asian tapirs in Sumatra are very few, thereby basic information for developing tapir conservation programmes is limited. This study aimed to develop the species distribution model to map the potential distribution of tapirs in Batang Gadis National Park (BGNP), investigate the characteristic of tapir habitat, and identify tapir feed plants around BGNP. The model was developed using the Maximum Entropy (Maxent) approach, based on the existing information on tapir occurrence in BGNP and environmental variables. Vegetation characteristics in different land cover (primary forests, secondary forests, and open fields) were investigated using the strip transect method. This study found that zonal classification, temperature and precipitation have the greatest percentage contribution to the model. The model estimated that around 24.45% of BGNP areas are suitable for tapir habitat, and tapirs distribute near community gardens. Our results also showed that plant diversity at study sites was categorised as moderate-high. About 23 plant species dominated by the Moraceae family were identified as feed plants for tapirs. In developing tapir conservation programmes, BGNP management needs to consider tapir distribution that is closed to community gardens. We propose BGNP to enrich feed plants in open fields of the wilderness and traditional zones; reduce the canopy cover in the wilderness and utilisation zones to stimulate the growth of feed plants; facilitate local people to live harmoniously with tapirs; involve local communities in tapir conservation programmes; encourage local communities to plant non-palatable crops for tapirs; and provide a compensation scheme.

AB  - The 'metalliferous ring' of Iglesiente was for centuries the most important mining district of Italy. After a marked decline in mining activities, alternative management strategies were proposed to face issues mainly related to unemployment and environmental pollution. We focused on the coastal section of the mining district, in order to evaluate the development of vegetation after disturbance and assess the conservation value of the study area. The floristic composition in terms of species richness, number of endemics, evenness, life form diversity, vegetation and cryptogamic covers were analysed for 96 vegetation samples. Three main plant assemblages with 227 vascular plant species and 18 endemics were described. The most influential variable in determining species composition was the herbivory, which negatively affects species richness, endemic species richness and life form diversity and, positively, the evenness. Other influential variables were elevation, positively associated with species and endemic species richness, and the degree of debris/rock flow, which negatively influences species richness and life form diversity. Soil grain size positively influences evenness and negatively life form diversity and vegetation cover. The number of years of mining inactivity was only positively influencing life form di-versity. Each identified community, especially those characterised by perennial herbs and small shrubs, can provide surrogate habitats for many endemic plants, which can be in turn used for phytostabilization and remediation. Further indications for strategic management of these mining environments, where policy and long-term monitoring are necessary interrelated strategies, were provided.

AB  - Dredging and rainbowing techniques are commonly used to replenish sandy beaches and protect the coast against erosion. Since 2003, such operations have been conducted every other year on Pyla Beach, Arcachon Bay (French Atlantic Coast). The evolution of macrobenthic communities subjected to regular disturbance was analyzed once in springtime at dredging and disposal sites, as well as in a control area, over 21 years. The overall benthic community was dominated by the same few species. The dredged area harbors a benthic community whose characteristics suggest the maintenance of a disturbed status, compared to the control area, whose community follows a trajectory possibly influenced by the general decrease of organic matter in the sediment. Regarding the disposal site, species richness is slowly declining. In both disturbed areas, the community was dominated by species able to recolonize rapidly (polychaetes, peracarid crustaceans), while the control area rather favored bivalves.

AB  - The magnitude of facilitation by shelter-building engineers on community structure is expected to be greater when they increase limited resources in the environment. We evaluated the influence of local environmental context on the colonisation of leaf shelters by arthropods in a Mexican evergreen tropical rainforest. We compared the species richness and abundance of arthropods (total and for different guilds) colonising artificially rolled leaves in habitats differing in understory heterogeneity (forest edge > old-growth forests > living fences). Arthropod abundance of the most representative arthropod taxa (i.e., Araneae, Blattodea, Collembola and Psocoptera) colonising the rolled leaves was greater at forest edge, a trend also observed for average arthropod abundance, and for detritivore and predator guilds. In addition, fewer arthropod species and individuals colonised the rolled leaves in the living fence habitat, a trend also observed for most arthropod guilds. As forest edge is expected to have a greater arthropod diversity and stronger density-dependent interactions, a greater limitation of refuges from competitors or predators may have determined the higher colonisation of the rolled leaves in this habitat. Our results demonstrate that local environment context is an important factor that affects the colonisation of arthropods in leaf shelters.

AB  - Aims The general effects of grazing by large herbivores on plant species composition and productivity are well known. Meanwhile, how different livestock species affect community structure is not fully understood. In northern China, livestock species composition is changing rapidly and hence, it is imperative to understand the resulting effects on grassland productivity and composition. Location Xilingol, Inner Mongolia, China. Methods We studied how grazing by three major livestock species affects typical steppe dominated by Leymus chinensis, Stipa grandis, Cleistogenes squarrosa and Carex korshinskyi, in a 4-year field experiment using a random block-design with four treatments (sheep, goat, cattle, no grazing), under summer grazing at moderate intensity. We calculated above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and a selectivity index (SI) based on biomass to quantify livestock forage preferences. Result We found that (i) sheep preferred Leymus chinensis and mixed subordinate species, cattle preferred Stipa grandis, and goat preferred Carex korshinskyi and Cleistogenes squarrosa. (ii) Consistent with these preferences, sheep increased the relative biomass of Stipa grandis, but reduced that of Carex korshinskyi; cattle reduced the relative biomass of Stipa grandis and Carex korshinskyi but increased that of mixed subordinate species; and goats reduced the relative biomass of Cleistogenes squarrosa and Carex korshinskyi but increased that of mixed subordinate species. (iii) Overall, grazing significantly increased ANPP, mainly due to an increase in ANPP of Leymus chinensis and subordinate species, at the cost of Stipa grandis. Conclusions Summer grazing by different livestock species at moderate intensity can increase ANPP, while livestock forage preferences can drive divergent changes in species composition. Our results also imply that livestock composition can be used as a mean to manage vegetation dynamics.

AB  - The hybridization phenomenon increases genetic diversity and modifies recombinant individuals' secondary metabolite (SMs) content, affecting the canopy-dependent community. Hybridization events occur when Quercus rugosa and Q. glabrescens oaks converge in sympatry. Here, we analyzed the effect of the genetic diversity (He) and SMs of Q. rugosa, Q. glabrescens and hybrids on the community of gall-inducing wasps (Cynipidae) and their parasitoids on 100 oak canopy trees in two allopatric and two hybrid zones. Eighteen gall wasp species belonging to six genera and six parasitoid genera contained in four families were identified. The most representative parasitoid genera belonged to the Chalcidoidea family. Abundance, infestation levels and richness of gall wasps and their parasitoids registered the next pattern: Q. rugosa higher than the hybrids, and the hybrids equal to Q. glabrescens. Oak host genetic diversity was the variable with the highest influence on the quantitative SMs expression, richness and abundance of gall wasps and their parasitoids. The influence of SMs on gall wasps and their parasitoids showed the next pattern: scopoletin > quercitrin > rutin = caffeic acid = quercetin glucoside. Our findings indicate that genetic diversity may be a key factor influencing the dynamics of tri-trophic interactions that involve oaks.

AB  - In Southeast Asia, conservation of 'Vulnerable' clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa) and 'Endangered' tigers (Panthera tigris) might depend on the management of their preferred prey because large felid populations are limited by the availability of suitable prey. However, the diet of clouded leopards has never been determined, so the preferred prey of this felid remains unknown. The diet of tigers in the region has been studied only from one protected-area complex in western Thailand, but prey preferences were not determined. To better understand the primary and preferred prey of threatened felids, we used DNA-confirmed scats and prey surveys to determine the diet and prey selection of clouded leopards and tigers in a hilly evergreen forest in northern Laos. For clouded leopards, the primary prey was wild pig (Sus scrofa; 33% biomass consumed), followed by greater hog badger (Arctonyx collaris; 28%), small rodents (15%), and mainland serow (Capricornis sumatraensis; 13%; hereafter, serow). For tigers, the primary prey was wild pig (44%), followed by serow (18%), sambar (Rusa unicolor; 12%), and Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus; 10%). Compared to availability, serow was positively selected by both clouded leopards (D = 0.69) and tigers (0.61), whereas all other ungulate species were consumed in proportion to the availability or avoided. Our results indicate that clouded leopards are generalist predators with a wide prey spectrum. Nonetheless, mid-sized ungulates (50-150 kg) comprised nearly half of their diet, and were the preferred prey, supporting a previous hypothesis that the enlarged gape and elongated canines of clouded leopards are adaptations for killing large prey. Because serow was the only ungulate preferred by both felids, we recommend that serow populations be monitored and managed to help conservation efforts for clouded leopards and tigers, at least in hilly evergreen forests of Southeast Asia.

AB  - There is great potential for the use of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to quantify aspects of habitat structure in the study of animal ecology and behaviour. Viewsheds-the area visible from a given position-influence an animal's perception of risk and ability to respond to potential danger. The management and conservation of large herbivores and their habitats can benefit greatly from understanding how vegetation structure shapes viewsheds and influences animal activity patterns and foraging behaviour. This study aimed to identify how woodland understory structure influenced horizontal viewsheds at deer eye height. Mobile TLS was used in August 2020 to quantify horizontal visibility-in the form of Viewshed Coefficients (VC)-and understory leaf area index (LAI) of 71 circular sample plots (15-m radius) across 10 woodland sites in North Wales (UK) where fallow deer (Dama dama) are present. The plots were also surveyed in summer for woody plant size structure, stem density and bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg.). Eight plots were re-scanned twice in winter to compare seasonal VC values and assess scan consistency. Sample plots with higher densities of small stems had significantly reduced VC 1 m from the ground. Other stem size classes, mean percentage bramble cover and understory LAI did not significantly affect VC. There was no difference in VC between summer and winter scans, or between repeated winter scans. The density of small stems influenced viewsheds at deer eye height and may alter behavioural responses to perceived risk. This study demonstrates how TLS technology can be applied to address questions in large herbivore ecology and conservation.

AB  - Ungulate browsing has been studied for several decades in the northern hemisphere. However, studies have mainly focused on just one or two ungulate species, while rarely contrasting the relative effects of summer and winter browsing. This limits our understanding of the dynamics and effects of browsing in landscapes where ungulate species diversity is increasing. We conducted a seasonal exclosure experiment on former clear-cuts in a multi-species ungulate system in Sweden, to investigate the relative impacts of summer and winter browsing on the conifers Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) at the tree species level. We tested for differences in individual conifer growth and demographic responses between Summer browsing, Winter browsing, No browsing, and Control treatment plots over a 4.5 year experimental period. We defined the demographic response as the distribution of conifers among different height classes. Individual growth rates and demographic responses of both conifer species were similar in the plots with No browsing (year-round exclosures) as in the Control plots with year-round browsing. Plots subject to Summer and Winter browsing differed in terms of their demographic response relative to plots with No browsing and Control plots; more stems reached taller height classes in the Summer and Winter browsing plots with slight differences between the conifer species. We discuss the different responses of Scots pine and Norway spruce considering their differences in palatability and their ability to tolerate plant-plant competition in a multi-species ungulate system, in light of potential associational effects. If fencing is intended to be used as a management practice to mitigate the impacts of deer browsing on conifer growth, our results suggest that a total exclusion of deer does not necessarily enhance conifer growth during the first years of regeneration.

AB  - Browsing on tree ferns (Cyathea australis and Dicksonia antarctica) was assessed at Mt Toolebewong, Victoria, Australia, where a population of Sambar (Rusa unicolor), a large deer species, is known to occur and compared with tree fern browsing at Tarra-Bulga National Park, Victoria, where Sambar are uncommon. At Mt Toolebewong, 52% of surveyed tree ferns had been browsed, with most damage occurring on individuals up to 130 cm high and typically involving removal of most or all of a frond to the base of the rachis. In contrast, only 7% of tree ferns had been browsed at Tarra-Bulga, with none browsed above 85 cm and only the frond tips removed. Browsing of whole fronds on mid-size tree ferns at Mt Toolebewong is attributed to the population of Sambar, and the lower intensity of browsing on smaller tree ferns at Tarra-Bulga to native herbivores. Populations of Sambar in wet forests of south-eastern Australia may, therefore, hinder recruitment of tree ferns into larger size-classes, at least at sites where tree ferns are favoured browse. The potential ecological consequences and management implications are discussed. Information is lacking on the severity and spatial scale over which deer impact tree fern populations. Tree fern browsing may be locally severe with site- and height-based browse evidence suggesting that this can largely be attributed to introduced Sambar. Browsing by deer has the potential to decrease growth, reduce survival and prevent recruitment of tree ferns into larger class sizes, with potentially detrimental implications for tree fern populations, associated species such as epiphytic flora, and the structure and function of wet forest ecosystems. Collection of appropriate field data will provide a better understanding of tree fern browsing and identify if and where management intervention is required.

AB  - Pollinators contribute to the establishment of perennial native forages, but little is known about the effect of grazing practices on pollinator abundance and diversity in livestock pasture ecosystems. Grazing reduces floral resources available to bees and other insects, and as a result, may influence their communities. The main objective of this study was to examine the impact of sheep grazing on bees and other non-bee insects in livestock pasture established with seed mixes of native forb/legume/grass and warm season grasses. Each pasture was divided into two halves (in a split-plot design) using an electric fence in which one plot was grazed and the other plot was non-grazed. Blue vane traps and a pair of yellow and blue pan traps were used for sampling bees and non-bee insects. A diverse array of bees (59 species) and non-bee insects (at least 93 species) were found in the livestock pastures. The abundance, diversity, and evenness of bee and non-bee communities were greater in nongrazed plots as compared to grazed plots. However, species richness, as measured by rates of species accumulation relative to sampling effort, was not different among treatments. Results show that a diverse community of bees and non-bee insects may be found in livestock pasture systems, but reduction in bee and non-bee insect diversity in grazed areas highlight the importance of strategic pasture management to support persistence of native forages and sufficient floral resources for pollinators at relevant scales.

AB  - Alpine shrubland not only has significant ecological function and ecological value, but also is a grazing land for Tibetan livestock and a habitat for wild animals. However, the grazing livestock on a long-term scale has caused severe shrubization of the alpine shrubland. How to control the shrubization of grassland is very important. Therefore, the purpose was to explore the effects of long-term grazing and utilization patterns of different livestock on alpine shrubland. In this study, a collective pasture with basically the same grazing history, intensity and vegetation type was enclosed into two sample plots to graze by Cervus elaphus kansuensis (CEK), and mixed grazing by Bos grunniens (yak) and Ovis arses (Tibetan sheep) (YTS) from 1983 to 2019 respectively, and it provides an vital scientific basis for promoting the balanced development of grass and livestock and maintaining ecological balance. The results showed that, in 2018 and 2019, compared with grazing YTS, the biomass of the Salix cupularis in grazing CEK plot was 55.20% and 56.63% lower, the cluster height was 68.36% and 68.36% lower, the crown width was 75.34% and 76.00% lower, the coverage was 80.00% and 78.00% lower, and the difference was significant (P < 0.05). The cluster height of Spiraea alpina was also 47.17% and 44.38% lower; The Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson index and evenness index of the shrub communities in the CEK plot were significantly higher than YTS (P < 0.05); The leaf carbon storage of Salix cupularis in CEK was 26.48% and 18.44% lower, and the root carbon storage was 48.88% and 49.15% higher respectively. The contents of soil organic matter, total phosphorus, total potassium, available nitrogen and available potassium in CEK were higher than those in YTS. In 2018, the soil respiration rate among CEK shrubs was significantly lower than that of YTS by 46.81%; The diversity and wealth of the bacterial community between shrubs, and the wealth index of the fungal community under shrubs in the CEK plot were all lower than those of YTS plot. The relative abundance of saprophytic fungi and bacterial metabolism between and under shrubs in grazing CEK plot were higher than that of YTS, while the relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, animal parasitic bacteria and human-related infectious disease bacteria were lower than YTS. Therefore, moderate long-time grazing of Cervus elaphus kansuensis can effectively inhibit the spread of alpine shrubs, facilitate the growth of herbaceous plants and achieve the balanced development of grass and livestock. It provides a strong support for the rational utilization and management of alpine shrubs.

AB  - Foragers face many variables that influence their food intake, such as habitat structure, time, weather, resource characteristic and food quality, as well as plant defenses. I studied of the foraging behavior of free-ranging common duikers (Sylvicapra grimmia) within the Soutpansberg, South Africa. I measured foraging using giving-up densities (GUDs) and activity using camera-traps to test for habitat utilization and dietary selection by common duikers inhabiting a grassland containing distinct "islands" of woody vegetation. I used GUDs to test for: 1. Spatial and temporal habitat selection during the four lunar phases, 2. selection among triplets of trays with varying food density, and 3. among trays with varying food quality. Foraging was affected by the surrounding vegetation and moon phase. Foraging was highest (GUDs were significantly lower) during the no moon phase and outside the islands of woody vegetation. The duikers' foraging efforts changed with resource density and favored pellets with the highest protein content. The results demonstrated that foraging patterns are affected by habitat assessment and perceptions of risk which alter the overall habitat quality. The methods integrate behavior into wildlife ecology by "asking" the animals to reveal their perspective of the environment. The methods are applicable for predator-prey studies, habitat quality, and for assessing the impacts of heterogeneity on spatial and temporal habitat-use.

AB  - American black bears (Ursus americanus Pallas, 1780) are opportunistic foragers, and across most of their range in North America, their diet is predominantly vegetation with limited consumption of vertebrates and invertebrates. However, they are also predators of ungulates, especially neonates, with regional variation in the amount of predation pressure they exert. We used scat analysis to examine the diet of black bears during the calving season in a moose (Alces alces (Linnaeus, 1758)) - woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) system in the Boreal forest of northern Ontario, Canada. Bears consumed herbaceous plants (46.5%), fruits and (or) seeds (20.0%), moose (3.3% adults; 4.3% calves), American beaver (Castor canadensis Kuhl, 1820; 8.5%), and insects (mostly ants; 4.2%). Bears had the highest consumption of moose and beaver in early spring, before switching to a more vegetation-dominated diet. We did not detect evidence of caribou consumption. Based on our results, black bear consumption of moose, particularly neonates, may warrant further investigation.

AB  - Background and aimsThe influence of assembled livestock grazing on rhizosphere soil microbial communities and the functional genes related to carbon cycling in natural grasslands remains uncertain, as grazing activities have the capacity to modify plant community compositions and soil structures, which consequently leads to shifts in the microbial community compositions and their functional distributions. MethodsThis study utilized metagenomic sequencing to conduct grazing experiments in plots with Yak grazing (YG), Tibetan sheep grazing (SG), Yak-Tibetan sheep mixed grazing (MG), and No grazing (CK). Results(1) Our findings reveal that rhizosphere soil, in contrast to bulk soil, possesses the capability to recruit beneficial microorganisms via interactions with plant roots. Under mixed grazing conditions involving yaks and Tibetan sheep, the microbial diversity within rhizosphere soil exhibits a marked increase compared to ungrazed conditions. The symbiotic network between carbon cycling genes and microorganisms is modularized, and assembled grazing of livestock primarily regulates Carbon decomposition and Fermentation genes by impacting the abundance of Acidobacteriota and Pseudomonadota. Additionally, we observed that soil microbial diversity is directly governed by soil properties, rather than being influenced by microbial biomass or the relative abundance of carbon cycling genes. ConclusionsIn conclusion, mixed grazing with yaks and Tibetan sheep proves more advantageous for sustaining soil microbial diversity, with soil properties playing a predominant role in regulating this diversity.

AB  - Assessing the health status of thicket requires an understanding of the structure, composition and plant diversity of this vegetation type. With the wide variety of herbivores supported by thicket vegetation, factoring in individual species impacts is difficult. This study aims to utilise elephants (since they are umbrella species and ecosystem engineers) to assess the health of the thicket vegetation by comparing various vegetation metrics with elephant densities in the Addo Elephant National Park (AENP). When these metrics were related to the NDVI values obtained in the areas surveyed, the results produced a predictive model that could be used as an effective monitoring tool to assess the health of thicket vegetation within, and outside, the park. Healthy thicket vegetation can be described as having an NDVI range between 0.43 and 0.52, a species richness of 28-41 species, a species diversity (H) of 2.25-2.96, a canopy integrity between 31% and 55% and a total plant cover of 113-172%. In the AENP, this state of healthy thicket vegetation is achieved at an elephant density recommendation of 0.81 elephant/km2. In addition, at this prescribed elephant density, the appropriate plant cover is complemented by diversity - in particular the health of geophyte and succulent components of thicket.

AB  - Livestock grazing is the primary land use of grasslands worldwide. Grazing has been asserted to alter grassland ecosystem functions, such as productivity, nutrient cycling, and biodiversity conservation. However, few studies have focused on the impact of grazing intensity on the ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) of alpine grasslands. We conducted a field experiment of manipulating sheep grazing intensity effects on alpine steppe by surveying plant community characteristics and ecosystem functions. Our results showed that plant community composition was altered with increasing grazing intensity, and the dominant species shifted from grasses and sedges to forbs. EMF was the highest under no grazing (CK) and the lowest under heavy grazing (HG), but there was insignificant difference between CK and HG. HG significantly decreased some indicators that reflected nutrient cycling functions, such as soil available nitrogen, plant leaf nitrogen (PN) and phosphorus content (PP). Furthermore, plant diversity had strong correlations with SOC, total nitrogen (TN), and PN. The results could provide scientific bases for biodiversity conservation and sustainable grazing management of alpine steppe.

AB  - 1. The tropical rainforest elevation gradients, extending from lowlands to treeline, often represent global maxima of biodiversity and are models for community studies.
   2. We surveyed geometrid moths along a complete rainforest gradient from 200 to 3700 m asl. in Papua New Guinea. The 16,424 moths collected with light traps represented 1102 species, a high diversity for such system. We demonstrated the importance of molecular data for taxonomy as COI sequences (DNA barcodes) changed the definition of 19% of morphological species.
   3. The abundance of geometrids did not change with elevation while their species richness peaked at 1200 m asl. The mid-elevation diversity peak is a common, but poorly understood, pattern for geometrids. It was best explained by the species richness of the vegetation. At the same time, the community was exposed to opposing trends in abiotic favourability (decreasing temperature) and biotic favourability (decreasing predation by ants, birds and bats) with elevation, potentially contributing to such unimodal trends in species richness.
   4. Beta diversity of communities separated by 500 m elevation increased with increasing elevation, reflecting decreasing mean elevational range of species-a pattern opposite to that expected under the Rapoport's rule. 5. The total number of species along the elevation gradient corresponded to 280% of the highest local community diversity. This enrichment of species underscores the key role of long elevational gradients in maintaining high regional diversity and makes them a conservation priority, especially as they also allow for redistribution of species in response to climate change.

AB  - Globally, migratory ungulates are affected by fences. While field observational studies reveal the amount of animal-fence interactions across taxa, GPS tracking-based studies uncover fence effects on movement patterns and habitat selection. However, studies on the direct effects of fences and fence gaps on movement behavior, especially based on high-frequency tracking data, are scarce. We used GPS tracking on three common African antelopes (Tragelaphus strepsiceros, Antidorcas marsupialis, and T. oryx) with movement strategies ranging from range residency to nomadism in a semi-arid, Namibian savanna traversed by wildlife-proof fences that elephants have regularly breached. We classified major forms of ungulate-fence interaction types on a seasonal and a daily scale. Furthermore, we recorded the distances and times spent at fences regarding the total individual space use. Based on this, we analyzed the direct effects of fences and fence gaps on the animals' movement behavior for the previously defined types of animal-fence interactions. Antelope-fence interactions peaked during the early hours of the day and during seasonal transitions when the limiting resource changed between water and forage. Major types of ungulate-fence interactions were quick, trace-like, or marked by halts. We found that the amount of time spent at fences was highest for nomadic eland. Migratory springbok adjusted their space use concerning fence gap positions. If the small home ranges of sedentary kudu included a fence, they frequently interacted with this fence. For springbok and eland, distance traveled along a fence declined with increasing utilization of a fence gap. All species reduced their speed in the proximity of a fence but often increased their speed when encountering the fence. Crossing a fence led to increased speeds for all species. We demonstrate that fence effects mainly occur during crucial foraging times (seasonal scale) and during times of directed movements (daily scale). Importantly, we provide evidence that fences directly alter antelope movement behaviors with negative implications for energy budgets and that persistent fence gaps can reduce the intensity of such alterations. Our findings help to guide future animal-fence studies and provide insights for wildlife fencing and fence gap planning.

AB  - Sympatric species inhabiting similar ecological niches can coexist by partitioning aspects of available ecological resources, such as temporal, spatial, and nutritional niches. Ungulates often coexist in the same habitat, resulting in temporal partitioning and divergence in foraging strategies and spatial utilization. To understand the temporal patterns of ecological differentiation and coexistence mechanisms among sympatric ungulates, we analyzed the monitoring data in Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve, Guizhou, China, from 2017 to 2022. Kernel density estimation was used to scrutinize disparities in diurnal activity patterns among four ungulates [tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus), Reeves' muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and mainland serow (Capricornis milneedwardsii)] as well as the interspecies variances during different seasons, at diverse altitudes, and between breeding and non-breeding periods. Daily activity patterns differed significantly among four species, with those of tufted deer, Reeves' muntjac, and wild boar affected significantly by season and breeding cycle. In addition, the daily activity rhythms of four species were affected by altitude. Thus, the daily activity rhythms of these ungulates were resulted from a combination of environmental factors and interspecific competitive interactions, as well as the reproductive cycle of each species. Our results provided a scientific reference for the effective management of wildlife and forest ecosystems, and we suggest that knowledge of temporal dynamics should be integrated into conservation planning for these sympatric species.

AB  - In the context of global climate change mitigation, carbon storage in woody vegetation plays a crucial role. Recognising the value of the i-Tree Eco model for carbon storage in urban and forestry settings, this study aimed to explore its applicability to rewilded landscapes. Using direct measurements from destructively sampled scrub from the Knepp Estate, our goal was to determine the model's suitability to this landscape.Our findings reveal that these methods are not appropriate for multi-stemmed trees below browsing height, as we observed no significant relationship between stem basal diameter and height. The i-Tree tool's assumption of below-ground biomass being 26% of above-ground biomass may not be applicable to herbivore-influenced landscapes. Additionally, we found that, on average, scrub at Knepp had more biomass below the ground than above, with a root:shoot ratio of 1.07, which is more than four times the amount predicted by current models using the 0.26 estimate ratio.This study underscores the need for novel allometric approaches that consider species-specific biomass and the impact of external factors, such as herbivory, on carbon storage. Accurate carbon accounting in future rewilding projects is essential for their contribution to both biodiversity enhancement and climate change mitigation.While the i-Tree Eco model provides valuable insights for many ecosystems, our findings suggest that its applicability may be limited in scrubland ecosystems, especially in rewilded landscapes where natural processes create semi-stable scrub and open wood pastures. Nonetheless, with suitable adjustments or when complemented with other methods, the i-Tree Eco model could be a valuable tool for specific scrub or rewilding scenarios.
   Our study at the Knepp Estate challenges existing models by revealing that scrublands in rewilded areas allocate more carbon to belowground biomass than previously understood, with a root: shoot ratio significantly higher than i-Tree Eco model estimates. This discrepancy highlights the necessity for developing refined allometric equations that account for the unique structural complexities and herbivory impacts in rewilded landscapes. Accurate carbon quantification in such ecosystems is vital for their recognised role in biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.image

AB  - 1. The Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning (BEF) literature proposes that ecosystem functioning increases with biodiversity because of complementarity in resource-use among species, associated with functional diversity. In this study, we challenge the trait-based ecology framework by comparing congeneric exotic (European) and native (North American) tree species showing similar resource-use functional trait values. The trait-based framework suggests that two functionally equivalent species should play similar roles in a community, resulting in similar interactions and performances. However, several studies showed that when growing in mixtures, exotic species that are functionally equivalent to native species benefitted from enemy release, resulting in a reduced apparent competition. We hypothesize that exotic species should be more productive than native species because the exotic species benefit from reduced apparent competition due to enemy release rather than from possessing more competitive resource-use functional traits.
   2. We study a diversity experiments, part of the International Diversity Experiment Network with Trees (IDENT), composed of two identical sites, each with two orthogonal diversity gradients: species richness and functional diversity. The functional gradient consists of species combinations of equal richness but increasing functional diversity, using different combinations of species provenance to assess the relationship between productivity, functional diversity and species provenance, independently of species richness. We grew a total of 12 species (six native and six exotic) in different combinations of one-, two- and six-species mixtures. The exotic species were selected based on their functional equivalence to their native congeneric species.
   3. Eight years after planting, we found that exotic species were more productive than native species, but only at high functional diversity. Results indicate that exotic species overall benefit from a reduced apparent competition, and that exotic-increased productivity at high functional diversity is consistent with the enemy release hypothesis.
   4. After 8 years, exotic species were more productive overall than their native counterparts, but only in the most functionally diverse communities. This study represents a first step in understanding the relative importance of complementarity in resource-use and apparent competition in a context of an exotic tree species invasion.

AB  - Resilience of plant communities to disturbance is supported by multiple mechanisms, including ecological legacies affecting propagule availability, species' environmental tolerances, and biotic interactions. Understanding the relative importance of these mechanisms for plant community resilience supports predictions of where and how resilience will be altered with disturbance. We tested mechanisms underlying resilience of forests dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana) to fire disturbance across a heterogeneous forest landscape in the Northwest Territories, Canada. We combined surveys of naturally regenerating seedlings at 219 burned plots with experimental manipulations of ecological legacies via seed addition of four tree species and vertebrate exclosures to limit granivory and herbivory at 30 plots varying in moisture and fire severity. Black spruce recovery was greatest where it dominated pre-fire, at wet sites with deep residual soil organic layers, and fire conditions of low soil or canopy combustion and longer return intervals. Experimental addition of seed indicated all species were seed-limited, emphasizing the importance of propagule legacies. Black spruce and birch (Betula papyrifera) recruitment were enhanced with vertebrate exclusion. Our combination of observational and experimental studies demonstrates black spruce is vulnerable to effects of increased fire activity that erode ecological legacies. Moreover, black spruce relies on wet areas with deep soil organic layers where other species are less competitive. However, other species can colonize these areas if enough seed is available or soil moisture is altered by climate change. Testing mechanisms underlying species' resilience to disturbance aids predictions of where vegetation will transform with effects of climate change.

AB  - Animal movement is a fundamental mechanism that shapes communities and ecosystems. Ungulates alter the ecosystems they inhabit and understanding their movements and distribution is critical for linking habitat with population dynamics. Predation risk has been shown to strongly influence ungulate movement patterns, such that ungulates may select habitat where predation risk is lower (refugia), adjust movement rates, temporal patterns, or selection of cover variables in areas with greater predation risk. We evaluated potential predation avoidance behavior in a population of plains bison inhabiting the north rim of Grand Canyon National Park (GRCA) and adjacent Kaibab National Forest (KNF). The KNF has year-round hunting managed by Arizona Game and Fish Department, whereas hunting is not allowed in GRCA. Human-maintained water sources on the KNF are particularly important resources for bison wherein they may be exposed to higher predation risk to access these resources. We used 2-h GPS locations for three years from 31 bison (n = 9 males; n = 22 females), and integrative step selection analysis to test four hypotheses about the potential for bison to reduce their risk from human predation by avoiding areas of high predation risk; moving faster in areas with high predation risk; entering high-risk areas at night when risk is reduced; and entering high-risk areas in habitats that provide cover (coniferous forest). The highest performing model indicated bison movement was 1.3 times faster per 2-h step interval than in areas with no hunting across all vegetation classes (coniferous forest, shrub, quaking aspen, grass-forb meadow) and across all topography classes (valley, slope, ridge). Bison moved more slowly in grass-forb meadows than all other vegetation types, and in valleys relative to slopes and ridges. Several radio-collared individuals had no GPS locations in KNF for the duration of the study. Bison avoided predation risk using two strategies: moving faster while in the KNF, and fully avoiding high-risk areas by remaining within GRCA. Management that manipulates or reduces timing of hunting seasons may reduce perceived predation risk and encourage bison to distribute into the KNF and across a broader range of available habitat.

AB  - Despite the growing population of European bison (Bison bonasus), it is necessary to plan the reintroduction of these animals to new areas. Reintroduction of European bison often requires the improvement of natural conditions. Such preparatory activities allow European bison to more easily adapt to new places, but also impact the functioning of animals from other taxa. The aim of the presented study was to examine the impact of waterholes for European bison on the development of local populations of amphibians and dragonflies (Odonata), as well as the creation of new feeding grounds for bats. We examined 15 reservoirs in the Augustow Forest District located in northeastern Poland, of which five were waterholes for European bison built in 2013-2014, four were semi-natural reservoirs transformed into waterholes for European bison in 2018, and six were natural reservoirs. Dragonflies were studied in 2021-2022; amphibians in 2018 and 2020; and bats in 2018, 2019, and 2020. In total, 24 species of dragonflies (Odonata), 10 species of amphibians, and 13 species of bats were found. The results of the inventory of three taxonomic groups using different comparative variants indicate a significant impact of the construction of waterholes for European bison on the biodiversity of the forest ecosystem. We concluded that the waterholes for European bison present better resistance to drying out than natural reservoirs. In addition, waterholes warm up more quickly, supporting better conditions for amphibians. The surface of the reservoirs and their exposed surroundings are favorable for insects (including dragonflies), and these are a source of food for bats, becoming attractive feeding grounds for them.

AB  - Agroforestry systems provide important ecosystem functions and services. They have the potential to enrich agricultural monocultures in central Europe with structural elements otherwise absent, which is expected to be accompanied by a surplus of ecosystem functions. Here we used quantitative measures derived from terrestrial laser scanning in single-scan mode to describe the structural complexity, the canopy openness, the foliage height diversity and the understory complexity of four common agroforest systems in central Europe. We accessed silvopasture systems with grazing ponies and cattle as well as fellow deer, short rotation forests with agricultural use between the tree rows, tree orchards with grazing sheep and Christmas tree plantations on which chickens forage. As a reference, we used data for 65 forest sites across Germany, representing different forest types, various dominant tree species, stand ages and management systems. We found that overall stand structural complexity is ranked as follows: forest > silvopasture systems > short rotation forest > tree orchard > Christmas tree plantation. Consequently, if overall structural complexity of an agricultural landscape shall be enriched, there is now strong evidence on how this may be achieved using agroforests. However, if the focus lies on selected structures that serve specific functions, e.g. dense understory to provide animal shelter, specific types of agroforests may be chosen and the ranking in overall structural complexity may be less important.

AB  - Apex predators play a critical role in ecosystem dynamics, exerting top-down control over prey populations and influencing biodiversity. The current study focused on the distribution, diet menu and human conflict of Snow leopard (Panthera uncia), one of the apex predators in the Khunjerab National Park (KNP), Gilgit-Baltistan. We used camera trapping as well as field survey techniques for determining the distribution of the species in the study area. The diet of snow leopard was investigated through scat analysis while human conflict was investigated through self-designed questionnaires. Results showed that snow leopards are distributed in different areas of the park at various elevations ranging between 3075 m(lowest) and 6293 m (highest). The camera traps captured a total of 20 capture "events or encounters" of snow leopard, among overall 550 photographs taken at various sites. Analysis of these capture data revealed that the activity pattern of snow leopard was bimodal, and it showed peak activity during dawn and dusk times. Scat analysis revealed that snow leopards take 72 % of their diet from wild prey, of which Himalayan Ibex makes up a large portion, and the remaining 28 % from the domestic prey, of which Yak is consumed at a high rate. Questionnaire data analysis revealed that depredation by snow leopard on livestock mostly occurs in the valley locations (88.5 %), with grazing areas accounting for 11.4 % of the total. The attacks occur mostly at night, and in the months of May and June, respectively, In the KNP, apex predators attack yaks by 82.2 %; while depredation rates for sheep, goats, and cows were 8.3 %, 6.25 %, and 3.12 %, respectively. The study concludes that depredation on livestock is the main cause of conflict between humans and the snow leopard in the study area, and it is the biggest challenge for conservationists.

AB  - In Europe, over a third of the agricultural area is grass meadows used for livestock grazing and fodder production. Grass meadows provide a food source for wild ungulates causing human-wildlife conflicts due to forage removal. Few experimental studies have quantified biomass loss with enough replicates to determine how surrounding environments influences level of biomass removal. Using an exclosure experiment on 57 grassland meadows over five years at the northwest coast of Norway covering 10 650 km2, we quantified biomass removal by red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) and how environmental factors impacted biomass loss (Study 1). Furthermore, we examined development of biomass loss and crude protein concentration in five fields throughout the growing season (Study 2). The average predicted biomass loss to red deer grazing was 16% for the first harvest, and 7.3% for the second harvest (Study 1). Biomass loss increased with red deer density from 0% at the lowest density (0.6 red deer harvested/km2) to 31% at the highest density (4 red deer harvested/km2). Biomass loss increased from 12% to 32.8% as terrain ruggedness index (TRI) rose from 2.1 to 7.1. Absolute biomass loss increased towards time of grass harvest (Study 2). Crude protein concentration was higher in unfenced plots during the period before first harvest, but not between first and second harvest (Study 2). The quantification of biomass removal at a large spatial scale over several years in this study provides a better understanding of factors causing variation in losses.

AB  - Soil fertility management through the application of synthetic fertilizer or livestock manures is crucial to maintaining the productivity and profitability of cropping systems. Little, however, is known about the response of weed communities to different livestock manure nutrient sources. As weed communities with increased diversity are considered part of more sustainable agroecosystems, it is necessary to find management practices that result in diverse weed communities of acceptable densities without negative impacts on crop productivity. Here, we monitored the effect of five nutrient sources, with similar goals for nitrogen (N) management, including synthetic fertilizer, liquid pig manure, two types of solid pig manure, and solid dairy manure on the weed community in a five-year (2008-2012) study. The abundance, species richness, Simpson's diversity, Simpson's evenness, and species turnover in weed communities were assessed over time. Crop biomass, mid-season plant-accessible soil nitrate-N, and pre-season soil phosphorus were determined. The application of liquid pig manure or synthetic fertilizer enhanced crop biomass likely through increased crop accessibility to N. The continued use of these sources of nutrients over time, contributed to low density, low species richness, and low diversity weed communities, particularly through the decline of broadleaf weed species. Liquid pig manure and synthetic fertilizer treatments were lower in weed density and diversity than solid manures. Solid manure treatments were associated with increased weed densities and reduced crop biomass; however, these nutrient source treatments resulted in more diverse weed communities. Regardless of the nutrient treatments, we observed drastic declines in weed community abundance, species richness, and diversity in drier years. Our study suggests that a management practice that increases the accessibility of N to the crop, possibly through a mixture of solid manures and synthetic fertilizers or liquid pig manure, may be ideal for promoting a profitable cropping system with decreased densities and improved diversity in weed communities. Technological advances that provide more precise placement of solid manures to increase the accessibility of N to the crop, may further contribute to achieving such profitable and multifunctional agroecosystems.

AB  - Plant quantity and quality can independently affect the diversity of the entire arthropod communities and multiple arthropod taxa in grassland ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how these effects on arthropod taxa at one trophic level propagate through food web to influence the diversity of higher trophic levels. We performed a monoculture experiment with 15 herbaceous species in the Inner Mongolian grassland to investigate how natural variations in plant productivity and host leaf traits affect herbivore taxon richness, which, in turn, affects predator taxon richness. For herbivores, plant productivity indirectly promoted herbivore taxon richness by increasing herbivore biomass, which was attributed to the increases in the richness of dominant sucking herbivores and endophytes with high food requirements. However, the high plant quality indicator (e.g. high leaf protein, phosphorus and water contents, and high leaf protein to carbohydrate ratio) directly increased, whereas the low plant quality indicator (e.g. high leaf lignin content) directly decreased herbivore taxon richness. Taxon richness of chewing and sucking herbivores with specific feeding modes (tearing or sucking mouthparts) showed strong positive responses to increasing plant quality. For predators, herbivore taxon richness, rather than herbivore biomass, mainly mediated the positive effects of plant productivity and the high plant quality indicator, but the negative effect of the low plant quality indicator, on predator taxon richness. At the feeding guild level, the taxon richness of parasitoids, other predators and spiders exhibited positive responses to different herbivores, which was attributed to their different diet preferences. Predator diversity could be promoted by prey partitioning among predator guilds facilitating species coexistence. At the family level, the taxon richness of most predator families was positively correlated with that of more than one herbivore family, suggesting that high predator diversity may be caused by balanced diets owing to high prey diversity. Synthesis. Natural variations in plant quantity and quality can substantially affect the diversity of herbivores and cascade up the food web to affect predators. Specificity and mechanisms of feeding have a large impact on the responses of arthropod guilds at each trophic level.

AB  - Alberta's boreal forest is extensively dissected by different energy sector activities, especially the creation of linear features such as seismic lines, pipelines, and transmission lines. Linear features vary substantially from one another in terms of time since disturbance, vegetation recovery, and levels of human use. Linear feature width has great potential to influence songbirds but is not currently incorporated into provincial-scale bird models used for regulatory decision making. We conducted passive acoustic bird surveys for three types of soft linear features (n = 156): seismic lines (width: 4-8 m) and pipelines and transmission lines (width: 15 to similar to 100 m) in upland deciduous and mixedwood forests. We assessed responses of individual bird species and changes in species richness using generalized linear models and evaluated community composition and structure with non-metric multidimensional scaling. Wider linear features (e.g., pipelines and/or transmission lines) had higher species richness compared to areas with narrow linear features, such as seismic lines. Species composition on wider linear features was dominated by early seral species and species that prefer shrubby vegetation and open habitats relative to narrow features. Species have a range of different threshold responses, such that the abundance of some species increases or decreases beyond certain threshold widths. We concluded that linear feature width is an important driver in shaping songbird communities, and highlight the importance of considering width in understanding and managing the impacts of energy sector linear features on boreal songbirds.

AB  - Single-species conservation management is often proposed to preserve biodiversity in human-disturbed landscapes. How global change will impact the umbrella value of single-species management strategies remains an open question of critical conservation importance. We assessed the effectiveness of threatened boreal caribou as an umbrella for bird and beetle conservation under global change. We combined mechanistic, spatially explicit models of forest dynamics and predator-prey interactions to forecast the impact of management strategies on the survival of boreal caribou in boreal forest. We then used predictive models of species occupancy to characterize concurrent impacts on bird and beetle diversity. Landscapes were simulated based on three scenarios of climate change and four of forest management. We found that strategies that best mitigate human impact on boreal caribou were an effective umbrella for maintaining bird and beetle assemblages. While we detected a stronger effect of land-use change compared to climate change, the umbrella value of management strategies for caribou habitat conservation were still impacted by the severity of climate change. Our results showed an interplay among changes in forest attributes, boreal caribou mortality, as well as bird and beetle species assemblages. The conservation status of some species mandates the development of recovery strategies, highlighting the impor-tance of our study which shows that single-species conservation can have important umbrella benefits despite global change.

AB  - Genetic variation in foundation tree species can strongly influence communities of trophic-dependent organisms, such as herbivorous insects, pollinators, and mycorrhizal fungi. However, the extent and manner in which this variation results in unexpected interactions that reach trophic-independent organisms remains poorly understood, even though these interactions are essential to understanding complex ecosystems. In pinyon-juniper woodland at Sunset Crater (Arizona, USA), we studied pinyon (Pinus edulis) that were either resistant or susceptible to stem-boring moths (Dioryctria albovittella). Moth herbivory alters the architecture of susceptible trees, thereby modifying the microhabitat beneath their crowns. We tested the hypothesis that this interaction between herbivore and tree genotype extends to affect trophic-independent communities of saxicolous (i.e., growing on rocks) lichens and bryophytes and vascular plants beneath their crowns. Under 30 pairs of moth-resistant and moth-susceptible trees, we estimated percent cover of lichens, bryophytes, and vascular plants. We also quantified the cover of leaf litter and rocks as well as light availability. Four major findings emerged. (1) Compared to moth-resistant trees, which exhibited monopodial architecture, the microhabitat under the shrub-like susceptible trees was 60% darker and had 21% more litter resulting in 68% less rock exposure. (2) Susceptible trees had 56% and 87% less cover, 42% and 80% less richness, and 38% and 92% less diversity of saxicolous and plant communities, respectively, compared to resistant trees. (3) Both saxicolous and plant species accumulated at a slower rate beneath susceptible trees, suggesting an environment that might inhibit colonization and/or growth. (4) Both saxicolous and plant communities were negatively affected by the habitat provided by susceptible trees. The results suggest that herbivory of moth-susceptible trees generated litter at high enough rates to reduce rock substrate availability, thereby suppressing the saxicolous communities. However, our results did not provide a causal pathway explaining the suppression of vascular plants. Nonetheless, the cascading effects of genetic variation in pinyon appear to extend beyond trophic-dependent moths to include trophic-independent saxicolous and vascular plant communities that are affected by specific tree-herbivore interactions that modify the local environment. We suggest that such genetically based interactions are common in nature and contribute to the evolution of complex communities.

AB  - Detection of spatial and temporal changes in vegetation cover are essential for a better understanding of the state and abundance of resources in a region. This study focuses on the evaluation of the changes and the recovery of the vegetation cover of Guadalupe Island, affected by the presence of feral goats, eradicated in 2007. The change analysis was based on the calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), using high-resolution multispectral satellite images of the QuickBird and WorldView-2 satellites, from 2004 and 2013, corresponding to the stage before and after the eradication of goats, respectively. The change in the surface and the rate of change in the coverage of the plant communities were evaluated. According to the results obtained, the cypress, pine and palm forest cover were easily identified, with an increase in biomass for 2013. Similarly, it was found that the grassland doubled its surface coverage, and there was a decrease in bare soil for 2013. However, the NDVI had limitations in determining changes in scrub cover due to the low and medium density of vegetation for both years; therefore, the analysis of SAVI coverage was deepened, with better results and a sustained increase in post-eradication values. The changes indicate a recovery for almost all communities by 2013.

AB  - Widespread woody encroachment is a prominent concern for savanna systems as it is often accompanied by losses in productivity and biodiversity. Extensive ecosystem-level work has advanced our understanding of its causes and consequences. However, there is still debate over whether local management can override regional and global drivers of woody encroachment, and it remains largely unknown how encroachment influences woody community assemblages. Here, we examined species-level changes in woody plant distributions and size structure from the late 1980s to the late 2000s based on spatially intensive ground-based surveys across Kruger National Park, South Africa. This study region spans broad gradients in rainfall, soil texture, fire frequency, elephant density, and other topographic variables. Species-level changes in frequency of occurrence and size class proportion reflected widespread woody encroachment primarily by Dichrostachys cinerea and Combretum apiculatum, and a loss of large trees mostly of Sclerocarya birrea and Acacia nigrescens. Environmental variables determining woody species distributions across Kruger varied among species but did not change substantially between two sampling times, indicating that woody encroachers were thickening within their existing ranges. Overall, more areas across Kruger were found to have an increased number of common woody species through time, which indicated an increase in stem density. These areas were generally associated with decreasing fire frequency and rainfall but increasing elephant density. Our results suggest that woody encroachment is a widespread but highly variable trend across landscapes in Kruger National Park and potentially reflects an erosion of local heterogeneity in woody community assemblages. Many savanna managers, including in Kruger, aim to manage for heterogeneity in order to promote biodiversity, where homogenization of vegetation structure counters this specific goal. Increasing fire frequency has some potential as a local intervention. However, many common species increased in commonness even under near-constant disturbance conditions, which likely limits the potential for managing woody encroachment in the face of drivers beyond the scope of local control. Regular field sampling coupled with targeted fire management will enable more accurate monitoring of the rate of encroachment intensification.

AB  - Introduced fauna threaten Australia's native species via herbivory, predation, and competition. After fire, these effects can be amplified.
   Post-fire impacts from introduced animals can cause mortality in the months following fire to exceed mortality caused during the fire. The impacts of introduced animals can persist years after the fire event - for example, if fires allow expansion of introduced species into new areas.
   Introduced herbivores influence the greatest range of native species post-fire, affecting plants (consumption, trampling), terrestrial animals (competition, removal of cover), and aquatic animals (trampling riparian vegetation, fouling streams).
   Some introduced species are a particular threat for specific taxa. For example, introduced terrestrial predators threaten many mammals, and introduced fish threaten native fish.
   Control programs for introduced species began quickly after the 2019-20 wildfires, and at increased scales. The open post-fire canopy improved visibility over extensive areas, briefly allowing aerial shooting and baiting to occur in places where such techniques are not usually feasible. The wildfires also reduced populations of introduced species, providing opportunities to achieve suppression.
   Extensive, severe fires provide opportunities to expand introduced species control, such as preventing the reinvasion of introduced fish into streams where they have been extirpated by fire-related sediment pulses; or by delaying apiary activities in forests recovering from fire, so that native species recolonise tree hollows before feral bees.
   Predicting the outcomes of interactions between introduced species and wildfire is crucial for shaping effective and efficient management in future fires, but such predictions will remain challenging until long-term monitoring programs are established that track how populations of introduced and native species respond to wildfires, and if/how management of introduced species supports recovery.

AB  - With steep climatic gradients over short distances, montane ecosystems provide exceptional opportunities to study ecological responses to climate and other environmental changes. Here we present a summary and synthesis of 10 years of research on this theme in a protected area in southern Quebec, Canada (Parc National du Mont Megantic), with ecological conditions closely similar to the northern Appalachians. During the similar to 150 years since European settlement, anthropogenic disturbance has reduced the abundance of certain taxa (e.g., Picea [spruce]), while favoring other taxa that thrive during succession (e.g., Betula [birch], Acer [maple]). In more recent decades, climate warming (similar to 0.21 degrees C per decade) appears to have prompted upward elevational range shifts for many plant species, although such responses lag behind changes in climate itself. Experimental studies with seeds and seedlings of Acer saccharum (Sugar Maple) suggest that upward range expansion might be constrained by non-climatic factors such as belowground properties and seed predators, while escape from insect herbivores might actually accelerate range expansion. Similar studies with understory plants have not revealed clear evidence of non-climatic constraints on range limits, although some preliminary data presented here suggest a possible role of a lack of microsites with rich, moist soil at high elevation. Current studies focus on the lower elevational range limits of species restricted to mountaintops, such as certain lichens. Vegetation and flowering phenology are also sensitive to climate, and we have found that earlier springs are associated with decreased potential gene flow across populations at different elevations; ongoing studies will determine how differential sensitivity of herbs vs. trees might influence the duration of a high light period in spring in the understory. Overall, we have found clear signals of plant responses to long-term anthropogenic disturbances and recent climatic warming, but considerable uncertainty remains about how climatic and non-climatic factors will interact to determine the future of this montane ecosystem.

AB  - Tree plantings have the potential to increase species diversity and sequester carbon, yet planting failure and early mortality pose significant barriers to their success. Biodiversity-ecosystem function theory suggests that diverse tree plantings could improve survival outcomes through either the portfolio or facilitation effect, yet there remain few tests of this hypothesis. Here, we use a large-scale tree-diversity experiment (BiodiversiTREE), with monitoring of nearly 8,000 individual trees to test whether (1) tree species diversity increases survival rates, (2) tree diversity stabilizes the risk of planting failure, and/or (3) diversity effects are important relative to other common drivers of seedling mortality (e.g. herbivory and soil moisture). We found that only species identity significantly impacted the likelihood of survival, not plant functional diversity nor plot species richness nor phylogenetic diversity. There were minor effects of elevation and soil moisture on survival, but both explained a very small amount of variation in the data (r(marg)(2) <= 0.011). Higher tree diversity did, however, strongly reduce variation in survival across plots, with nearly 2-fold higher coefficients of variation in monocultures (30.4%, 28.4-32.6% 95% bootstrapped confidence interval) compared to 4- (16.3%, 13.8-18.7%) and 12-species plots (12.8%, 10.8-14.7%). Ultimately, our results suggest that employing diverse species can lower the risk of planting failure (i.e. the portfolio effect), but that species selection still plays a large role in early establishment.

AB  - Although generally given little attention in vegetation studies, ground-dwelling (terricolous) lichens are major contributors to overall carbon and nitrogen cycling, albedo, biodiversity and biomass in many high-latitude ecosystems. Changes in biomass of mat-forming pale lichens have the potential to affect vegetation, fauna, climate and human activities including reindeer husbandry. Lichens have a complex spectral signature and terricolous lichens have limited growth height, often growing in mixtures with taller vegetation. This has, so far, prevented the development of remote sensing techniques to accurately assess lichen biomass, which would be a powerful tool in ecosystem and ecological research and rangeland management. We present a Landsat based remote sensing model developed using deep neural networks, trained with 8914 field records of lichen volume collected for > 20 years. In contrast to earlier proposed machine learning and regression methods for lichens, our model exploited the ability of neural networks to handle mixed spatial resolution input. We trained candidate models using input of 1 x 1 (30 x 30 m) and 3 x 3 Landsat pixels based on 7 reflective bands and 3 indices, combined with a 10 m spatial resolution digital elevation model. We normalised elevation data locally for each plot to remove the region-specific variation, while maintaining informative local variation in topography. The final model predicted lichen volume in an evaluation set (n = 159) reaching an R2 of 0.57. NDVI and elevation were the most important predictors, followed by the green band. Even with moderate tree cover density, the model was efficient, offering a considerable improvement compared to earlier methods based on specific reflectance. The model was in principle trained on data from Scandinavia, but when applied to sites in North America and Russia, the predictions of the model corresponded well with our visual interpretations of lichen abundance. We also accurately quantified a recent historic (35 years) change in lichen abundance in northern Norway. This new method enables further spatial and temporal studies of variation and changes in lichen biomass related to multiple research questions as well as rangeland management and economic and cultural ecosystem services. Combined with information on changes in drivers such as climate, land use and management, and air pollution, our model can be used to provide accurate estimates of ecosystem changes and to improve vegetation-climate models by including pale lichens.

AB  - Subfossil remains of the Quaternary megafauna from two Ukrainian natural history collections stored at Kaniv Nature Reserve and the National Museum of Natural History NAS of Ukraine were examined. Most of the bones were collected in 1965-1966, in the building pit and the gateway of the Kaniv hydroelectric power plant. The fauna is represented at least by ten taxa (Gulo gulo, Mammuthus trogonterii chosaricus, Mammuthus intermedius, Coelodonta antiquitatis, Megaloceros giganteus, Alces alces, Bison priscus, Cervus elaphus, Capra cf. ibex, and Equus ferus). Skeletal parts are represented mainly by skulls, long bones, horns, and tusks. Based on the species composition of proboscideans, at least part of the faunal assemblage is dated by the end of the Middle Pleistocene (Dnieper Stage = Saale, Warta, MIS 6), but majority of bones could be older or younger (Late Pleistocene and Holocene age) due to the alluvial origin of accumulation.

AB  - Background and research aim: In the anthropogenic landscapes where historically wildlife existed, there can be a potential for rewilding to reverse extinction. However, there is limited literature providing approaches to achieve successful rewilding. The current study aimed at providing empirical based methodological procedures for successful rewilding of the University ofDodoma (UDOM) and nearby degraded landscape by assessing past and current vegetation and large mammal species' occurrence.
   Methodology: The past occurrence of mega-herbivores and their habitat was assessed using systematic literature survey, past vegetation maps and key informant interviews. EBSCOhost database and Google Scholar search engine were used for literature searching. A survey was conducted at UDOM area which is one of the remaining habitat patches in central Tanzania to examine present plant diversity.
   Results: The baseline vegetation map of 1960 indicated that the study area was mainly Savanna woodland. Literature suggested that anthropogenic activities resulted into Land-Use Land-Cover Changes (LULCC) leading into wild animals' extirpation leaving remnant populations in the surrounding protected areas. While the key informant interviews verified local loss of megaherbivores, field data collected at UDOM campus in 2022 indicated the vegetation transformation to bushland dominated by Dichrostachys cinerea. The area's past vegetation composition was 33% grasses, 29% herbs, 21% shrubs and 17% trees while the current was 18% grasses, 42% herbs, 30% shrubs and 10% trees.
   Conclusion: The study revealed that central Tanzania hosted spectacular large mammal populations that interacted with the savanna which has recently been transformed to bushland. However, observed evidence on past existence of large mammals and recent elephants' sightings at UDOM area indicate great potential for rewilding.
   Implication for conservation: Reconstructing historical information of ecosystems is crucial for successful rewilding. Such information can guide conservation efforts aiming at reversing extinction and reestablishing connectivity of large herbivore population across ecosystems.

AB  - One of the important antipredator benefits of group living for prey species is collective vigilance that enhances early predator detection. Within the group, individuals monitor the behavior of others to gauge the level of risk in the environment. The nearest-neighbor distance is important as the information travels quickly and easily from the nearest individuals. I examined the vigilance behavior of free-ranging chital deer (Axis axis, Gir Protected Area, India) in response to the group size, nearest neighbor distance, and habitat structure (open versus dense vegetation). The vigilance behavior showed a weak negative response to increases in group size. Overall, the vigilance levels were significantly higher for animals that had distant neighbors. There was a significant interaction effect of habitat structure and the nearest neighbor distance on vigilance levels of chitals. However, this effect was only significantly different for individuals living in dense vegetation. Chitals respond more strongly to conspecific vigilance from their nearest companion in the denser mixed forest than open acacia grasslands. The results indicate that nearest neighbor distance and habitat structure interact in determining the vigilance behavior of group living ungulates and transmission of information within a social group.

AB  - The Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) is a wild goat species that inhabits the Sahara and Arabian deserts and is adapted to extreme ambient temperatures, intense solar radiation, and scarcity of food and water resources. To investigate desert adaptation, we explored the possible role of copy number variations (CNVs) in the evolution of Capra species with a specific focus on the environment of Capra nubiana. CNVs are structural genomic variations that have been implicated in phenotypic differences between species and could play a role in species adaptation. CNVs were inferred from Capra nubiana sequence data relative to the domestic goat reference genome using read-depth approach. We identified 191 CNVs overlapping with protein-coding genes mainly involved in biological processes such as innate immune response, xenobiotic metabolisms, and energy metabolisms. We found copy number variable genes involved in defense response to viral infections (Cluster of Differentiation 48, UL16 binding protein 3, Natural Killer Group 2D ligand 1-like, and Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3), possibly suggesting their roles in Nubian ibex adaptations to viral infections. Additionally, we found copy number variable xenobiotic metabolism genes (carboxylesterase 1, Cytochrome P450 2D6, Glutathione S-transferase Mu 4, and UDP Glucuronosyltransferase-2B7), which are probably an adaptation of Nubian ibex to desert diets that are rich in plant secondary metabolites. Collectively, this study's results advance our understanding of CNVs and their possible roles in the adaptation of Nubian ibex to its environment. The copy number variable genes identified in Nubian ibex could be considered as subjects for further functional characterizations.

AB  - Plant invasion and habitat fragmentation have a detrimental effect on biodiversity in nearly all types of ecosystems. We compared the direct and indirect effects of the invasion of the common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) on biodiversity patterns in different-sized Hungarian forest-steppe fragments. We assessed vegetation structure, measured temperature and soil moisture, and studied organisms with different ecological roles in invaded and non-invaded sites of fragments: plants, bees, butterflies, flower-visiting wasps, flies, true bugs, and spiders. Temperature and soil moisture were lower in invaded than in non-invaded area. Milkweed had a positive effect on plant species richness and flower abundance. In contrast, we mainly found indirect effects of invasion on arthropods through alteration of physical habitat characteristics and food resources. Pollinators were positively affected by native flowers, thus, milkweed indirectly supported pollinators. Similarly, we found higher species richness of herbivores in invaded sites than control sites, as species richness of true bugs also increased with increasing plant species richness. Predators were positively affected by complex vegetation structure, higher soil moisture and lower temperature. Furthermore, increasing fragment size had a strong negative effect on spider species richness of non-invaded sites, but no effect in invaded sites. Especially, grassland specialist spiders were more sensitive to fragment size than generalists, whereas generalist spider species rather profited from invasion. Although milkweed invades natural areas, we did not identify strong negative effects of its presence on the diversity of the grassland biota. However, the supportive effect of milkweed on a few generalist species homogenises the communities. The rate of invasion might increase with increasing fragmentation, therefore we recommend eliminating invasive plants from small habitat fragments to preserve the native biota. Focusing also on generalist species and revealing the indirect effects of invasions are essential for understanding the invasion mechanisms and would support restoration efforts.

AB  - Habitat loss is often the ultimate cause of species endangerment and is also a leading factor inhibiting species recovery. For this reason, species-at-risk legislation, policies and plans typically focus on habitat conservation and restoration as mechanisms for recovery. To assess the effectiveness of these instruments in decelerating habitat loss, we evaluated spatiotemporal habitat changes for an iconic endangered species, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). We quantified changes in forest cover, a key proxy of caribou habitat, for all caribou subpopulations in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada. Despite efforts under federal and provincial recovery plans, and requirements listed under Canada's Species at Risk Act, caribou subpopulations lost twice as much habitat as they gained during a 12-year period (2000-2012). Drivers of habitat loss varied by ecotype, with Boreal and Northern Mountain caribou affected most by forest fire and Southern Mountain caribou affected more by forest harvest. Our case study emphasizes critical gaps between recovery planning and habitat management actions, which are a core expectation under most species-at-risk legislation. Loss of caribou habitat from 2000 to 2018 has accelerated. Linear features within caribou ranges have also increased over time, particularly seismic lines within Boreal caribou ranges, and we estimated that only 5% of seismic lines have functionally regenerated. Our findings support the idea that short-term recovery actions such as predator reductions and translocations will likely just delay caribou extinction in the absence of well-considered habitat management. Given the magnitude of ongoing habitat change, it is clear that unless the cumulative impacts of land-uses are effectively addressed through planning and management actions that consider anthropogenic and natural disturbances, we will fail to achieve self-sustaining woodland caribou populations across much of North America.

AB  - AimsWhile plot-based vegetation surveys provide means to precisely track changes in plant species abundance and distribution, ecosystems are continuously influenced by numerous drivers, confounding interpretation of monitoring results. Following the making of Iceland's largest hydropower reservoir in 2006, a decadal vegetation monitoring was set up. Relating our results to those of different types of environmental monitoring associated with the hydropower project, we aimed to gain insights into the forces driving the spatio-temporal vegetation pattern.LocationSubarctic-alpine area near Halslon reservoir, East Iceland.MethodsAt the time of its making, we conducted a baseline plant survey in a total of 72 plots, spread around Halslon reservoir's vicinity (each containing ten 0.25 m2 subplots). Plots were located in three different habitat types (heathlands, wetlands, poorly vegetated land), at three different sites regarding direction and distance from the reservoir. A decade later, we resurveyed the plots and reviewed the results of other environmental monitoring projects in the area, mostly presented in the gray literature.ResultsTemporal changes in vegetation were mostly inconsistent between and within habitat types, but some general trends were noticed, that is, decreased lichen and fern cover in heathlands. Distance from the reservoir did not significantly affect changes in vegetation cover. The greatest overall changes were detected where great changes in herbivore land usage had been recorded during the study.ConclusionsDirect effects of Halslon reservoir on vegetation in our study plots were not noticed. Most likely, the reservoir indirectly impacted vegetation in our study through loss of grazing area, affecting herbivore land usage, coupled with an unrelated population growth of two of the area's main wild herbivores before and during the study period. Response to climate change was not detected, potentially concealed by substantial land-use change and a short study period.
   Resurvey of vegetation monitoring in a subarctic-alpine area near Iceland's largest hydropower reservoir revealed that after a decade, changes were mostly inconsistent between and within habitats. Direct effects of the reservoir and climate change were not found but rather, indirect effects of altered herbivory behavior, partly influenced by anthropogenic activities.image

AB  - The Faroe Islands, an isolated North Atlantic archipelago, are characterized by a grassland vegetation, which is shaped by strong winds and, since human settlement, also by intensive sheep grazing. This study, conducted in August 2023, investigated terrestrial gastropod fauna across 46 sites on six islands: Vagar, Streymoy, Eysturoy, Kunoy, Boroy, and Vioy. We found 26 gastropod species, including two new species for the archipelago (Euconulus fulvus and Vertigo angustior). Several rare species were found at new locations, including Lauria cylindracea, previously only known from a single site on Suuoy, now documented at two additional sites on Vagar and Streymoy. Species richness at the sites varied between 1 and 16 species, with an average of five species. The fauna is notably slug-dominated, as on average more slug species were found at a site than snail species. Our results illustrate the effects of overgrazing by sheep, which limits gastropod diversity to refuges such as steep rocky outcrops, tall riparian vegetation in narrow canyons, and less disturbed wetlands. The snail fauna of the Faroes is relatively species-poor (31 species in total) and is dominated by introduced generalists and non-native slugs, while micro-snails, which are common in other insular areas with similar climates, are notably absent.

AB  - The presence of exotic herbivores can have detrimental effects on insular ecosystems because it usually involves the introduction of a previously absent functional group. Understanding feeding behavior is crucial to manage potential impacts, as it provides valuable information on which species may be most susceptible to the actions of these herbivores. We estimated diet selection of introduced red deer (Cervus elaphus) and goats (Capra hircus) in western Isla de los Estados, Argentina. We conducted floristic surveys to assess plant composition and forage availability at the landscape level. We evaluated the diet of both ungulates through microhistological analysis of feces during two spring-summer seasons. Overall, we detected 44 plant taxa in their feces, representing 67.7% of the plant richness detected in the field. Diet composition was similar between species, including a wide range of vascular plants and two groups of non-vascular plants, though both were dominated by a few species of shrubs and forbs. Nonetheless, both species select grasses, predominantly found in marine tussock grasslands, and trees mainly found as seedlings and sapling in forests and stunted trees in wetlands. Our results suggest that the introduced species exhibit overlapping forage selection, possibly having negative synergic effects on forest and grassland regeneration. This is concerning as these grasslands are of great importance for seabirds' reproduction. Our findings provide valuable information to develop management plans for the conservation of this unique island ecosystem.

AB  - Recent and dramatic declines of barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) in northern Canada have been associated with the effects of climate change, natural population fluctuations, and human disturbance. Past research has revealed that caribou were displaced by industrial activities. These broad-scale distributional changes imply fine-scale behavioral and stress responses. In the central Northwest Territories, Canada, diamond mines and their supporting infrastructure, including winter roads, lie across much of the winter range of a number of populations of caribou. We investigated the fine-scale, mechanistic effect of these disturbance features on the behavior and stress physiology of caribou adjacent to an ice road used to transport industrial materials. We modeled the relationship between the prevalence of observed behavioral category as well as glucocorticoids extracted from fecal pellets and a variety of environmental and disturbance variables, including the distance to the ice road. Proximity to the road was associated with a decrease in time spent foraging and an increase in walking behavior. We did not find a relationship between levels of glucocorticoids in fecal pellets and proximity to the road. These results contribute to efforts to understand and manage the effect of industrial disturbance, including ice roads, on barren-ground caribou.

AB  - AimsLand use modifies natural forest herbivore assemblages by cattle introduction and structural alteration that impact invertebrate diversity. This land use and herbivory combined effect is particularly relevant for woody plant juveniles, which are key stages for regeneration. We aimed to understand how herbivory on juvenile woody plants is affected by land use. In this study, we analyzed how vertebrate and invertebrate herbivory patterns on seedlings and saplings change between land uses in winter and summer seasons.LocationSouthernmost Gran Chaco region, C & oacute;rdoba province, central Argentina.MethodologyWe assessed the invertebrate and vertebrate herbivory on seedlings and saplings of woody species during summer and winter seasons at four different land use types of a Chaco dry forest. Land use types were classified according to the increasing intensity of disturbance (logging and grazing) they are subjected to: Conserved Forest (CF; no disturbance), Secondary Forest (SF; low disturbance), Closed Species-rich Shrubland (CS; intermediate disturbance), and Open Shrubland (OS; high disturbance).ResultsWe found that total herbivory was consistently higher in SF and CS in both seasons. Vertebrate herbivory was higher than invertebrate herbivory in winter (except in CF), with the inverse pattern in summer. Differences between seedling and sapling stages were scarce, with not consistent patterns of herbivory between seasons.ConclusionsThis study shows a pronounced effect of land use on seasonal herbivory patterns and dynamics. The vegetation structure of communities under low and intermediate disturbance intensities would promote diversity of invertebrate herbivores, which, combined with cattle introduction, could result in herbivory complementation and additivity. Understanding how environmental filters, like anthropic activities and herbivory, interplay and affect early growth stages is crucial to achieving land use practices that do not compromise forest resilience and regeneration.

AB  - Aims: Landscapes of Middle Asia are exposed to human influence due to long-lasting pastoral tradition, and now are largely dominated by non-forest vegetation. Graminoids perform key ecosystem functions, and constitute an important feed source for livestock. We studied the distribution patterns of graminoids cover under climatic and grazing pressure gradients in different open vegetation types. Study area: Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan. Methods: 1,525 vegetation plots representing five open vegetation types (mires, salt marshes, tall-forb communities, pseudosteppes and steppes) were extracted from the Vegetation of Middle Asia Database. We assessed the relative cover of graminoid species in each vegetation type. The importance of mean annual temperature, sum of annual precipitation, aridity and livestock density as drivers of relative cover of graminoids contribution patterns in the five vegetation types were explored with use of polynomial functions and commonality analysis. Results: Open ecosystems of Middle Asia are characterized by different graminoid contributions. The highest relative cover of graminoids was found for steppes, pseudosteppes and mires. Comparison of model fits for relationship between the graminoids cover, climatic parameters and livestock pressure indicated advantage of polynomial models. The best-fitting models for pseudosteppes were for mean annual temperature, Aridity Index and livestock density, for steppes mean annual temperature and Aridity Index, and for salt marshes mean annual temperature. For mires and tall-forb communities, the models showed a poor fit or no effect of the variables studied. Conclusions: Our study shows that climate and livestock pressure have an impact on the contribution of graminoids in open vegetation types, but a general pattern is difficult to describe. Ongoing climate change may influence the share of graminoids in salt marshes, steppes and pseudosteppes. Grazing (with a common effect of climatic factors) is the most important factor influencing graminoids contribution on pseudosteppes, confirming the secondary origin of this vegetation type. Taxonomic reference: The nomenclature of the vascular plants follows Plants of the World Online (POWO 2022) and problematic taxonomic issues were based on The World Flora Online (WFO 2022). Nomenclature of Stipa spp. follows Nobis et al. (2020).

AB  - Lowland grassland fragments in southeast Australia are valued for both sheep grazing and conservation. Many fragments are now rarely burnt, despite being shaped by millennia of Aboriginal fire-use. Restoring fire could potentially reduce fuels, control exotic plant species, promote native species and renew Aboriginal cultural burning. However, this requires understanding of how fire and large herbivores, both native and exotic, are coupled and influence vegetation. We implemented a single round of low-intensity experimental burns in an area of remnant grassland and patchy eucalypt woodlands in Tasmania that is managed for conservation, albeit intermittently grazed by sheep, as well as by native and exotic wild herbivores. We compared herbivore activity between burnt and unburnt areas over 2 years using cameras and scat transects, and assessed how fire and herbivory influenced herbaceous biomass and the cover of broad vegetation classes with and without herbivore exclusion. Contrary to expectations, burnt areas did not disproportionately attract the main herbivores: domestic sheep, introduced deer and native wallabies. In the predominant grassy sward, grazing and fire both reduced herbaceous biomass but we found no support for our hypothesis that grazing reduces biomass more strongly after burning. This contrasts with isolated patches of Poa tussock grassland, where fire reduced biomass much more strongly than grazing, and grazing effects on biomass were more pronounced following burning. The cover of broad vegetation classes was little affected by burning, but excluding herbivores increased exotic grass cover in both burnt and unburnt plots. Practical implication. In degraded fragments of lowland native grassland, burning and grazing do not necessarily act as strongly synergistic disturbances. Grazing by sheep and wild herbivores can help to control exotic grasses and reduce herbaceous biomass, although burning is much more effective than grazing for reducing biomass of unpalatable Poa tussock grassland. Our results suggest that returning occasional low-intensity fires to our study system, and other degraded grassland-woodland fragments, can be compatible with livestock production and conservation goals, but this requires caution and adaptive management.
   Conserving and restoring southeast Australia's degraded remnant lowland grasslands is a priority, but many are used for sheep grazing and rarely burnt, despite being shaped by Indigenous fire-use. We returned fire to a degraded grassland fragment in the Tasmanian midlands that is used for sheep grazing, and assessed how this influenced; (i) sheep and wild herbivore activity; (ii) vegetation biomass and (iii) broad vegetation composition. The results suggest grazing is an important control on exotic grasses in degraded grassland fragments, and that restoring fire can be compatible with livestock production and conservation goals.image

AB  - PurposeLivestock dung deposition significantly impacts the greenhouse gas emissions, soil nutrient dynamics, soil microbial biomass, and enzyme activities of grasslands. As a typical process of microbial community coalescence, dung deposition may also affect grassland ecosystems by changing soil microbiomes. However, its effects on alpine grassland soil microbial abundance, diversity, and community profiles remain largely unexplored. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the influences of dung deposition-mediated community coalescence on alpine grassland soil microbiomes.MethodsSoils were collected from 40 pairs of yak dung-covered patches and their adjacent grasslands along a transect on the Tibetan Plateau. Quantitative PCR and amplicon high-throughput sequencing were employed to determine the abundance, diversity, and community composition of soil microbes.ResultsDung deposition-mediated community coalescence significantly altered multiple soil properties and the composition of soil microbial communities. Specifically, the relative abundance of diazotrophs, photoautotrophs, nitrifiers, pathogens, and lichens significantly decreased due to dung-soil microbial community coalescence, while the proportions of methanogens, denitrifiers, saprotrophs, cellulolytic microbes, and chemoheterotrophs showed opposite change trends. Soil microbial community structures were closely correlated with multiple soil and plant properties (e.g., nutrient contents and plant aboveground biomass) in both control and dung-covered soils. Additionally, dung deposition-mediated community coalescence dramatically decreased the complexity of soil microbial co-occurrence patterns but exerted negligible effects on network stability.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that yak dung deposition has the potential to increase greenhouse gas emissions, but it can also improve soil nutrient contents and decrease plant disease risks. This study highlights the dual effects of dung deposition on grassland ecosystems and provides critical information for guiding alpine grassland management.

AB  - Wildlife population dynamics are modulated by abiotic and biotic factors, typically climate, resource availability, density-dependent effects, and predator-prey interactions. Understanding whether and how human-caused disturbances shape these ecological processes is helpful for the conservation and management of wildlife and their habitats within increasingly human-dominated landscapes. However, many jurisdictions lack either long-term longitudinal data on wildlife populations or measures of the interplay between human-mediated disturbance, climate, and predator density. Here, we use a 50-year time series (1962-2012) on mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) demographics, seasonal weather, predator density, and oil and gas development patterns from the North Dakota Badlands, USA, to investigate long-term effects of landscape-level disturbance on mule deer fawn fall recruitment, which has declined precipitously over the last number of decades. Mule deer fawn fall recruitment in this study represents the number of fawns per female (fawn:female ratio) that survive through the summer to October. We used this fawn recruitment index to evaluate the composite effects of interannual extreme weather conditions, energy development, and predator density. We found that density-dependent effects and harsh seasonal weather were the main drivers of fawn fall recruitment in the North Dakota Badlands. These effects were further shaped by the interaction between harsh seasonal weather and predator density (i.e., lower fawn fall recruitment when harsh weather was combined with higher predator density). Additionally, we found that fawn fall recruitment was modulated by interactions between seasonal weather and energy development (i.e., lower fawn fall recruitment when harsh weather was combined with higher density of active oil and gas wells). Interestingly, we found that the combined effect of predator density and energy development was not interactive but rather additive. Our analysis demonstrates how energy development may modulate fluctuations in mule deer fawn fall recruitment concurrent with biotic (density-dependency, habitat, predation, woody vegetation encroachment) and abiotic (harsh seasonal weather) drivers. Density-dependent patterns emerge, presumably due to limited quality habitat, being the primary factor influencing fall fawn recruitment in mule deer. Secondarily, stochastic weather events periodically cause dramatic declines in recruitment. And finally, the additive effects of human disturbance and predation can induce fluctuations in fawn fall recruitment. Here we make the case for using long-term datasets for setting long-term wildlife management goals that decision makers and the public can understand and support.

AB  - Polymetallic nodules increase habitat heterogeneity in some abyssal benthic ecosystems by providing hard substrate. Besides their important role in structuring ecosystems, polymetallic nodules have high grades of valuable minerals and are a target of likely future exploitation, particularly in the Pacific Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ). Mining activities will remove hard substrate and sediment and cause sediment plumes potentially affecting faunal communities over large areas. Long-lived megafaunal assemblages may be particularly vulnerable but data are lacking on the density, biodiversity and community structure in many areas of the CCZ. This study aims to provide megabenthic community baseline data from two physically similar areas (B6S02 and B4S03) located in the contract area of Global Sea Mineral Resources N.V. (GSR). Seafloor images, obtained by an autonomous underwater vehicle are used to characterise the large areas required for robust evaluation of sparse megafauna. Higher altitude images cover a larger area for the same effort but have reduced resolution compared to images obtained closer to the seafloor, leading to difficulties in detecting and identifying individuals. Our comparison of images obtained at different altitudes shows that images taken above 8m altitude underestimate the megafauna density by almost 50%, so images <8m were used for further analysis. We also used multiobserver agreement analysis to improve the megafaunal annotation consistency, and the quality and robustness of the data in this study. The two GSR areas were significantly different in nodule coverage and megafauna composition and a general positive relationship between nodule coverage and megafauna abundance was observed. Differences in the megafaunal composition were primarily caused by differences in echinoderms (asteroids, echinoids, ophiuroids and holothuroids), representing almost 70% of the megafauna.

AB  - Mithun (Bos frontalis) or gayal and Indian Bison or wild gaur (Bos gaurus) are listed among the rare and endangered bovine species of India. The remote location of mithun in four North Eastern Hill states (Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram), scattered population size, and non-availability of genetic diversity status are major limitations towards devising a suitable breeding and conservation policy of these species. Since several studies have demonstrated the successful applicability of microsatellite/SSR markers across related genera/families in both crop plants and animal species, 30 FAO recommended cattle microsatellites were utilized for the assessment of the genetic diversity of Indian mithun, bison, and local Tho-tho cattle. Mitochondrial transmembrane protein coding cytochrome B (CYTB) complete sequence data of 71 bovine samples from India were also used to reinforce the study. Population structuring clustered the all bovines into three subgroups as per geographical location and species. Bottleneck analysis indicated a mode shift in the allelic frequency distribution of gaur, indicating minor genetic bottleneck events in the past, while no bottleneck was found in mithun and Tho-tho cattle. To our knowledge, this study represents the first report of molecular genetic characterization showing the population structure and status of genetic diversity in rare Indian bovines, namely, Mithun, Gaur, and Tho-tho cattle.

AB  - Over a quarter of the world's land surface is grazed by cattle and other livestock, which are replacing wild herbivores and widely regarded as drivers of global biodiversity declines. The effects of livestock presence versus absence on wild herbivores are well documented. However, the environmental context-specific effects of cattle stocking rate on biodiversity and livestock production are poorly understood, precluding nuanced rangeland management recommendations. To address this, we used a long term exclosure experiment in a semi-arid savanna ecosystem in central Kenya that selectively excludes cattle (at different stocking rates), wild mesoherbivores, and megaherbivores. We investigated the individual and interactive effects of cattle stocking rate (zero/moderate/high) and megaherbivore (>1,000 kg) accessibility on habitat use (measured as dung density) by two dominant wild mesoherbivores (50-1,000 kg; zebra Equus quagga and eland Taurotragus oryx) across the "wet" and "dry" seasons. To explore potential tradeoffs or co-benefits between cattle production and wildlife conservation, we tested for individual and interactive effects of cattle stocking rate and accessibility by wild mesoherbivores and megaherbivores (collectively, large wild herbivores) on the foraging efficiency of cattle across both seasons. Eland habitat use was reduced by cattle at moderate and high stocking rates across both dry and wet seasons and regardless of megaherbivore accessibility. We observed a positive effect of megaherbivores on zebra habitat use at moderate, but not high, stocking rates. Cattle foraging efficiency (g dry matter step(-1) min(-1)) was lower in the high compared to moderate stocking rate treatments during the dry season, and was non-additively reduced by wild mesoherbivores and high cattle stocking rates during the wet season. These results show that high stocking rates are detrimental to wild mesoherbivore habitat use and cattle foraging efficiency, while reducing to moderate stocking rates can benefit zebra habitat use and cattle foraging efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that ecosystem management and restoration efforts across African rangelands that involve reducing cattle stocking rates may represent a win-win for wild herbivore conservation and individual performance of livestock.

AB  - Unlike the top-down cascading effects driven by apex predators, the bottom-up effects on biological interactions originating from herbivory by large mammals, especially within mammalian assemblages, have received less attention. This study aimed to identify the multifaceted impacts driven by sika deer (Cervus nippon) during midwinters, when their herbivory impacts were expected to be strong due to deficient dietary resources. We focused on interference and exploitative competition caused by deer on the habitat use of four sympatric mammal species, namely two herbivores (Japanese serow, Capricornis crispus, and Japanese hare, Lepus brachyurus angustidens) and two mesocarnivores (red fox, Vulpes vulpes, and Japanese marten, Martes melampus melampus). To estimate the wintering behaviors of these mammals and deer herbivory pressure, we performed snow tracking and counted the fresh feeding marks of deer during midwinter in 2022 and 2023. We conducted surveys on 201-km transects with different stages of deer population recovery (i.e., different deer population densities) in heavy snowfall regions of Japan. We then systematically quantified the deer-driven effects on sympatric mammals using piecewise structural equation modeling (SEM). We recorded 1700 tracks of target mammals and 1327 trees with deer feeding marks. Based on these records, we constructed an SEM with acceptable performance (Fisher's C = 27.1, P = 0.30). The SEM suggested some possibilities that exploitative competition mediated by deer herbivory constrained the habitat use of mammals with dietary habits similar to that of deer, i.e., serow (effect size, -0.13) and hares (-0.14). In addition, through constricting the habitat use of hares, the deer-driven cascading effects reduced the occurrence of their key predators, i.e., foxes (-0.12) and martens (-0.10). Thus, our observations provide novel evidence that food webs are regulated by herbivore-driven bottom-up cascading effects in cases where plant primary productivity is limited by heavy snowfall.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation has far-reaching negative impacts on the environment, resulting in biodiversity loss, soil quality degradation and alteration of water availability. In addition, fragmentation can disrupt ecological processes, potentially facilitating the establishment and spread of invasive plants, which can further harm native arthropod communities and alter their ecosystem dynamics. However, the exact nature of these impacts may vary depending on local conditions. We investigated the impact of fragmentation and milkweed invasion on invertebrate communities in sandy grasslands of forest-steppe habitats in Hungary. We selected 30 grasslands in forest-steppe fragments, varying in size (0.2 to 8.7 ha) and connectivity (Hanski's connectivity index: 0 to 705). We sampled ground-dwelling arthropods, mainly herbivores (true bugs) and predators (spiders), with pitfall traps and pollinators (wild bees) by direct observations along transects in invaded vs. non-invaded patches (min. of 500 m2) of each fragment. We considered arthropod species' body size (all groups), dispersal ability and feeding (herbivores and predators) and nesting location and social habit (wild bee) traits in our analyses. In non-invaded patches, the number of monophagous herbivores showed an increasing trend, whereas in invaded fragments, there were more polyphagous individuals with increasing connectivity and fragment size. The dispersal ability of predators was lower as connectivity increased in non-invaded patches but higher in patches invaded by milkweed. We found more ground nesting bees in the invaded patches of small fragments than in large fragments, however, we did not find significant effect in non-invaded patches. In summary, we often found interacting effects of the studied variables, fragmentation and invasions, generally modifying each other's effect by filtering for opposite trait levels. The primary objective of restoration projects should be restoring habitat of appropriate size and connectivity and eradicating invasive species while concurrently supporting the revival of native species and their ecological relationships. It is essential to employ adaptive management techniques, including continuous monitoring, to effectively tackle the interaction between fragmentation, invasion, and the preservation of biodiversity.

AB  - Foraging selectivity by domestic herbivores is a critical factor affecting plant community structure and functioning of rangeland. However, there is rather limited knowledge of whether and how foraging selectivity of different herbivore species varies with plant diversity. Here, we experimentally investigated the foraging selectivity of co-grazing cattle and sheep across 15 plots with varying plant diversity gradients in a meadow steppe. The results showed that the foraging selectivity of sheep significantly increased with increased plant diversity, while that of cattle did not change. This effect was still present after accounting for the effect of plant community protein. Increased plant diversity also resulted in more traveling steps for sheep, but had no effect on cattle. Further, the foraging selectivity of sheep was stronger than that of cattle at higher plant diversity levels, but weaker at lower diversity levels. Our results indicate that sheep and cattle can have completely different impacts on grassland plant communities and dynamics, depending on the context of plant diversity, due to their distinct and varying foraging selectivity. Sheep behave more sensitively to changes in plant diversity. We thus suggest that sheep should be used with caution on grasslands with high plant diversity due to strong diet selectivity. Instead, cattle, with stable behaviors, should be a relatively conservative management tool to conserve plant diversity.

AB  - The outcomes of species interactions can vary greatly in time and space with the outcomes of some interactions determined by priority effects. On coral reefs, benthic algae rapidly colonize disturbed substrate. In the absence of top-down control from herbivorous fishes, these algae can inhibit the recruitment of reef-building corals, leading to a persistent phase shift to a macroalgae-dominated state. Yet, corals may also inhibit colonization by macroalgae, and therefore the effects of herbivores on algal communities may be strongest following disturbances that reduce coral cover. Here, we report the results from experiments conducted on the fore reef of Moorea, French Polynesia, where we: (1) tested the ability of macroalgae to invade coral-dominated and coral-depauperate communities under different levels of herbivory, (2) explored the ability of juvenile corals (Pocillopora spp.) to suppress macroalgae, and (3) quantified the direct and indirect effects of fish herbivores and corallivores on juvenile corals. We found that macroalgae proliferated when herbivory was low but only in recently disturbed communities where coral cover was also low. When coral cover was <10%, macroalgae increased 20-fold within 1 year under reduced herbivory conditions relative to high herbivory controls. Yet, when coral cover was high (50%), macroalgae were suppressed irrespective of the level of herbivory despite ample space for algal colonization. Once established in communities with low herbivory and low coral cover, macroalgae suppressed recruitment of coral larvae, reducing the capacity for coral replenishment. However, when we experimentally established small juvenile corals (2 cm diameter) following a disturbance, juvenile corals inhibited macroalgae from invading local neighborhoods, even in the absence of herbivores, indicating a strong priority effect in macroalgae-coral interactions. Surprisingly, fishes that initially facilitated coral recruitment by controlling algae had a net negative effect on juvenile corals via predation. Corallivores reduced the growth rates of corals exposed to fishes by similar to 30% relative to fish exclosures, despite increased competition with macroalgae within the exclosures. These results highlight that different processes are important for structuring coral reef ecosystems at different successional stages and underscore the need to consider multiple ecological processes and historical contingencies to predict coral community dynamics.

AB  - Increasing threats to seamount ecosystems potentially from fishing and seabed mining are creating an urgent demand for research on megafauna to inform conservation and management. We surveyed the community structure of benthic megafauna on the Weijia Seamount, which is covered by cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. A multidisciplinary dataset was generated from video recordings taken by a human occupied vehicle (HOV) and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) along transects and bathymetry-derived environmental variables. The spatial variation of community structure and its environmental and spatial factors impacting the community were then explored. A total of 2779 individuals of the megabenthos (from depths of 1533-2763 m, covering 24.4 km in distance and with a maximum of 109 individuals per 100 m by linear observation), was counted and classified into 76 morphospecies, which was dominated by crinoids, ophiuroids, hexactinellids and octocorals. Moderately abundant and diverse megafauna, high beta diversity and distinct assemblages were present in the Weijia Seamount, suggesting a highly patchy pattern within a single seamount. Six clusters of megafauna were revealed, with significant differences in species composition and biodiversity. The results of statistical analyses showed that the megafaunal community was impacted by at least eight environmental variables (latitude, depth, slope, curvature, rugosity, bathymetric position index, topography type, and substrate type), and excluding aspect. Among these variables, the topography and substrate types played key roles in the occurrence of small-scale aggregations of hexactinellids; depth-related variables were key factors, but no gradual depth-related change in terms of abundance, richness or species turnover was observed. This case study on the megabenthic community of the Weijia Seamount can serve as an environmental baseline, providing a reference status for seamount conservation and management.

AB  - Tropical forests are notable for their high species diversity, even on small spatial scales, and right-skewed species and size abundance distributions. The role of individual species as drivers of the spatial organization of diversity in these forests has been explained by several hypotheses and processes, for example, stochastic dilution, negative density dependence, or gap dynamics. These processes leave a signature in spatial distribution of small trees, particularly in the vicinity of large trees, likely having stronger effects on their neighbors. We are exploring species diversity patterns within the framework of various diversity-generating hypotheses using individual species-area relationships. We used the data from three tropical forest plots (Wanang-Papua New Guinea, Barro Colorado Island-Panama, and Sinharaja-Sri Lanka) and included also the saplings (DBH >= 1 cm). Resulting cross-size patterns of species richness and evenness reflect the dynamics of saplings affected by the distribution of large trees. When all individuals with DBH >= 1 cm are included, similar to 50% of all tree species from the 25- or 50-ha plot can be found within 35 m radius of an individual tree. For all trees, 72%-78% of species were identified as species richness accumulators, having more species present in their surroundings than expected by null models. This pattern was driven by small trees as the analysis of DBH >10 cm trees showed much lower proportion of accumulators, 14%-65% of species identified as richness repellers and had low richness of surrounding small trees. Only 11%-26% of species had lower species evenness than was expected by null models. High proportions of species richness accumulators were probably due to gap dynamics and support Janzen-Connell hypothesis driven by competition or top-down control by pathogens and herbivores. Observed species diversity patterns show the importance of including small tree size classes in analyses of the spatial organization of diversity.

AB  - Plant invasions substantially alter both aboveground and belowground communities. Invasive species modify habitats, directly and indirectly affecting soil biota and functions. Soil nematodes, the most diverse and abundant faunal groups in the soil food web, play a crucial role in shaping plant-soil feedback mechanisms. Using a DNA metabarcoding approach, we conducted the first in-depth analysis to examine the relationship between nematode assemblages and the dominance of the aggressive exotic species, Canadian goldenrod (Soli-dago canadensis), by comparing invaded and uninvaded (control) plot pairs in a protected urban meadow over two consecutive growing seasons. In Solidago stands, nematode taxonomic diversity declined, particularly at the ASV level, with herbivores and fungivores contributing most to this decline. In contrast, bacterivore genus richness was higher in invaded soils compared to control soils. Although overall functional diversity declined, herbivorous nematodes were functionally more diverse in invaded soils. Community composition differed significantly between invaded and uninvaded soils, with influences from soil moisture and season. Bacterivore frequency (mainly enrichment opportunists) was higher, while herbivore frequency (particularly facultative endoparasites) was lower in invaded soils. These changes led to a simplification of network structure, reducing herbivore connections and increasing the roles of bacterivores and predator-omnivores. Our results suggest that the invasion strategy of S. canadensis relies mainly on two key plant-soil feedback mechanisms: (1) release from herbivory pressure, and (2) enhanced nutrient acquisition or supply via bacterial pathways. By integrating taxonomic, trait-based, and network approaches, this study highlights how plant invasions can reshape belowground biodiversity and alter ecosystem functioning.

AB  - 1. Ungulate herbivores shape grassland plant communities at multiple scales, ultimately affecting ecosystem function. However, ungulates have complex effects on grasslands, including defoliation, trampling, excreta return and their interactions. Moreover, the effects of ungulate density on grasslands are regulated by these three mechanisms. Nevertheless, how these three mechanisms affect biodiversity at multiple scales and community assembly remains poorly understood.
   2. Here, we conducted a 4-year novel field experiment to disentangle the effects of defoliation, trampling, and excreta return by ungulates on plant community assembly in a temperate grassland in Inner Mongolia, China. This experiment set two different scenarios: moderate ungulate density (Moderate, characterised by selective defoliation and moderate trampling) and high ungulate density (Intense, characterised by non-selective defoliation and heavy trampling), including different combinations of defoliation, trampling and excreta return in each scenario.
   3. We found that defoliation and trampling increased stochasticity in community assembly and promoted alpha and beta diversity under both scenarios. Specifically, defoliation promoted the coexistence of species with multiple resource acquisition strategies ( higher functional trait diversity) by reducing interspecific competition; trampling tended to facilitate random species colonisation. Conversely, excreta return favoured grasses, promoting deterministic assembly and impacting species coexistence. Notably, selective defoliation in the Moderate scenario led to a dominance of stochastic processes during community assembly, whereas non-selective defoliation still did not change the dominance of deterministic processes. Further, communities subject to selective defoliation were insensitive to changes in soil properties caused by trampling and excreta return, maintaining a high-level beta diversity and the stochastic of community assembly.
   4. Synthesis: Our study provides important insights into the mechanisms by which ungulate herbivores influence plant community assembly, suggesting that defoliation and trampling have the potential to drive stochastic processes, while excreta return plays the opposite role. Our study also suggests that selective foraging by ungulates acts as stronger stochastic forces during community assembly compared to non-selective defoliation. These results imply that considering ungulate feeding preferences and foraging behaviour in grassland management will help prevent biodiversity loss and biotic homogenisation.

AB  - Animal movement models can be used to understand species behavior and assist with implementation of management activities. We explored behavioral states of an invasive wild pig (Sus scrofa) population that recently colonized central Michigan, USA, 2014-2018. To quantify environmental factors related to wild pig movement ecology and spatio-temporal landscape use, we predicted wild pig behavioral states relative to land cover type, landscape structure (i.e., edge and patch cohesion), and weather conditions. We used global positioning system (GPS)-collars and monitored 8 wild pigs from 2014-2018. We fit local convex hulls and calculated movement metrics revealing 3 wild pig behavioral states (resting, exploratory, and relocating) and constructed a 3-level model to predict behavioral state probabilities relative to biotic and abiotic conditions. Probabilities of exploratory and resting behaviors were higher nearer to riparian and open herbaceous cover types (oftentimes emergent marsh), indicating that these cover types provided security cover during activity and bedding. Hard mast cover types had a strong positive association with relocating behaviors. More cohesive patches of agriculture and shrub cover types were associated with higher probabilities of exploratory behaviors, while resting was more likely in continuous patches of agriculture (mostly mid-summer corn). The probability of exploratory behaviors increased exponentially with warming ambient temperature. Our results may be used by managers to develop control strategies conducive to landscape and environmental conditions where the likelihood of encountering wild pigs is highest or targeting wild pigs when in a behavioral state most vulnerable to a particular removal technique.

AB  - 1. Many pathogens can infect several host species, which complicates the management of wildlife diseases. Even for generalist pathogens, hosts are not equally competent, and variable niche overlap between hosts leads to different exposure levels within hosts when compared with that between hosts. Hence, the processes determining spillover risk and the subsequent transmission dynamics within and between species differ.
   2. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a contagious prion disease of the cervids detected across expanded geographic ranges over the last few decades. Multihost management has become topical with CWD detection among reindeer Rangifer tarandus in Europe, with an immediate spillover risk to sympatric species. Here, I argue for the use of a community epidemiological framework that distinguishes between-and within-host dynamics arising from host competence and exposure processes.
   3. In CWD, host competence is mainly determined by how variants of the prion protein gene (PRNP) affect susceptibility. The exposure level is not only linked to the density of infected and susceptible hosts both within and between species but also to the spatiotemporal niche overlap between species and social organization within species.
   4. Mule deer Odocoileus hemionus and white--tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus are highly susceptible and expected to show true multihost dynamics; however, mule deer have a higher CWD prevalence in sympatric areas, indicating only partially linked dynamics. Moose Alces alces a re h ighly s usceptible, but cases of CWD-infected moose are few and appear to be spillover events with subsequent epidemic die outs. Elk Cervus canadensis have less susceptible PRNP variants and low levels of prion shedding in lymphoid tissues, indicating lower contagiousness. CWD prevalence in elk is lower and appears to result from spillover and subsequent within-species emergence, which is partially independent of sympatric deer.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Stronger awareness of the different expected CWD dynamics within and between species may facilitate effective surveillance and management. Surveillance should consider the potential lack of linked dynamics between species when designing sampling. Multihost management can target niche overlap at different scales to limit spillover risk: (1) geographic distribution ranges, (2) density reductions in overlap zones and (3) co-use of transmission hot spots.

AB  - Although rivers are of immense practical, aesthetic, and recreational value, these aquatic habitats are particularly sensitive to environmental changes. Increasingly, changes in streamflow and water quality are resulting in blooms of bottom-attached (benthic) algae, also known as periphyton, which have become widespread in many water bodies of US national parks. Because these blooms degrade visitor experiences and threaten human and ecosystem health, improved methods of characterizing benthic algae are needed. This study evaluated the potential utility of remote sensing techniques for mapping variations in algal density in shallow, clear-flowing rivers. As part of an initial proof-of-concept investigation, field measurements of water depth and percent cover of benthic algae were collected from two reaches of the Buffalo National River along with aerial photographs and multispectral satellite images. Applying a band ratio algorithm to these data yielded reliable depth estimates, although a shallow bias and moderate level of precision were observed. Spectral distinctions among algal percent cover values ranging from 0 to 100% were subtle and became only slightly more pronounced when the data were aggregated to four ordinal levels. A bagged trees machine learning model trained using the original spectral bands and image-derived depth estimates as predictor variables was used to produce classified maps of algal density. The spatial and temporal patterns depicted in these maps were reasonable but overall classification accuracies were modest, up to 64.6%, due to a lack of spectral detail. To further advance remote sensing of benthic algae and other periphyton, future studies could adopt hyperspectral approaches and more quantitative, continuous metrics such as biomass.

AB  - The Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus; serow) is a protected territorial ungulate native to Japan. However, locally overabundant serow populations can damage forest plantations and agriculture through browsing. Despite government permitted annual culling of serows on forest lands of Gifu Prefecture, Japan, browse damage continues to be reported in hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa; cypress) plantations. Sika deer (Cervus nippon; deer), which are co-located with serows can also browse cypress, but their impacts have never been evaluated. The objective of our research was to evaluate the involvement of each species in browse damage and to establish the damage-causing mechanisms after serow culling at selected study sites (T1 [0.3 ha], T2 [0.2 ha], and T3 [1.1 ha]) in 3 cypress plantations in Takayama City, Gifu Prefecture, where serow culling was conducted. In 2019 and 2020, 2 and 2 serows were culled in T1, 3 and 0 in T2, and 1 and 1 in T3, respectively. Forestry workers also applied a chemical repellent (ziram-based fungicide) to some stands in T3 in October 2019 and May 2020. Between December 2018 and September 2020, we used camera traps to monitor activity patterns of serows and deer and the replacement of territorial serows before and after culling. We also investigated seasonal browsing impacts between August 2019 and June 2020 by thoroughly checking for browsing marks on the terminal shoot. Serows and deer accounted for 79% and 21% of camera-trap videos, respectively. Despite annual culling, serows were recorded at all browsed sites before the next growing season. Browse damage was higher in autumn and winter, but in T3 it was reduced when the repellent was applied. Management of ungulate browse damage to cypress will require accurate identification of species causing the damage, monitoring serow activity before and after culling, and a using repellent immediately before browsing seasons.

AB  - Mountain areas are sensitive to changes in precipitation and temperature, which significantly impact traditional pastoralist communities, their economy, and their lifestyle. Alarming climate change scenarios justify the investigation of the ecological and socioeconomic vulnerabilities that characterize Portugal's mountain regions. This work explores how the traditional production systems of small ruminants-sheep and goats-could adapt in the Montesinho mountain range as it changes over the next 2 decades. Land use-land cover maps from 1995 and 2018 show how the pastoral landscape has changed and indicate trends for a future scenario. Documented landscape grazing patterns are used to determine sheep and goat landscape preferences under different climatic conditions. Finally, we identify the near-future constraints on traditional sheep and goat systems, contrasting landscape changes with sheep and goat preferences. Over coming decades, the balance between rangelands and cultivated lands will persist in the Montesinho mountain landscape, despite some trade-offs between both. Woodlands could emerge from scrublands colonizing rangelands, and permanent crops could significantly replace arable lands in agricultural areas. Therefore, it is likely that the agricultural areas preferred for sheep, and rangelands preferred for goats, may not be affected by the forecast landscape changes, but rather be favored by the expansion of permanent crops. However, pasture areas must expand, as they are key to pastoral landscape function in a warming climate scenario. Landscape decision makers and managers should implement a landscape-monitoring system to inform policies and strategies aimed at protecting and safeguarding mountain pastoralism and its vital ecosystem services.

AB  - Bird habitats are becoming increasingly fragmented as a result of rapid urbanization. As one of the essential refuges for urban bird communities, mountain parks are of practical significance for studying the spatial changes of birds, which can inform the future planning of mountain park planning. In this study, we assessed the alpha, beta, and functional diversity of bird communities in mountain parks in Fuzhou, China, at three levels of urbanization (urban, peri-urban, suburban) and explored how diversity (abundance, richness, alpha-diversity, Chao1) varies along the urbanization gradient. A three-month bird survey was conducted using the transect method to examine the impact of urbanization on bird community structures in mountain parks. In addition, we evaluated the functional diversity of bird guilds in order to identify potential indicator species for monitoring different urbanization gradients in mountain parks. The results showed that: (1) During the three bird surveys from December 2021 to February 2022, 96 bird species and 2429 individuals of 9 orders, 34 families, and 63 genera were identified. (2) Urbanization had a significant impact on the overall bird alpha-diversity (p = 0.040) and richness (p = 0.024) but not on the overall bird abundance (p = 0.056). (3) The results of non-metric multidimensional scaling showed significant variations among overall birds in mountain parks along with three urbanization levels (stress = 0.155, p = 0.027). Similarly, significant differences were observed in the upper-stratum guild (stress = 0.183, p = 0.049) but not in other diet and vertical foraging stratum guilds. (4) Five species were identified as potential candidates for monitoring the trends of urban gradients. Moreover, compared to insectivorous or omnivorous guilds, most carnivorous and herbivorous guilds may not be suitable for monitoring the negative effects of urbanization in mountain parks. Our findings can help inform urban mountain park management or restoration strategies intended to mitigate the adverse impacts of urbanization.

AB  - Polymetallic nodule fields, at 3000-6000 m depth, harbour some of the most diverse seabed communities in the abyss. In these habitats, nodules are keystone structures for many sessile species that require hard substrate for growth. The combination of exposed nodules and background sediment increases the heterogeneity of these habitats compared to nodule-free fields, and thereby potentially influences the assembly of animal communities across space. Polymetallic nodule patches can vary in size, shape and nodule density; however, the effect of these variations on benthic communities remains largely unclear. Understanding the role of nodule-habitat type (defined by nodule size and density) and seabed heterogeneity on biodiversity is urgently needed to accurately assess the impacts of potential nodule removal in areas like the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a region targeted for deep-sea mining. Here, we explored variations in benthic invertebrates (megafauna > 10 mm) across space and nodule-habitat types within an abyssal seascape. We quantified changes in megafaunal density, diversity and community structure using quantitative seabed imagery in four study areas. Study areas were separated by distances of 1-110 km and exhibited varying levels of seabed heterogeneity, as defined by the proportions of different nodule-habitat types present in each area. We found that different nodule-habitat types harboured distinct assemblages. Areas with higher nodule coverage supported higher megafaunal densities, while areas with larger, sparsely distributed nodules had higher diversity. Higher species richness and distinct community structure were associated with the most heterogeneous study area, which had multiple nodule-habitat types and nodule-free sediment patches. These results suggest that type of nodule habitat and degree of seabed heterogeneity are important drivers of local benthic megafaunal diversity patterns in abyssal nodule fields. By establishing a baseline prior to human disturbance, our study provides essential insights that should inform future monitoring programmes, mining regulations and biodiversity conservation in this area.

AB  - Invasive axis deer (Axis axis) currently thrive along the Parana and Uruguay River watersheds in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. There is little information on axis deer ecology in its introduced range. We assessed seasonal and spatial variation in selected dietary items of axis deer, and tested whether the consumption of invasive woody plants and bait deployed for hunting purposes was related to their spatial availability at El Palmar National Park, home to the threatened Butia yatay palm tree. We identified macroscopically the rumen contents of 197 deer culled by controlled shooting over bait in winter and summer and by spotlighting from slow-moving vehicles in winter. Rumen contents by volume mostly contained grass and leaves in winter (95.3%) and summer (69.9%), followed by fruits/seeds of palm trees (in summer only) and invasive woody plants (mostly in winter), including honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), chinaberry (Melia azedarach), Chinese (Ligustrum sinense) and glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum), and firethorn (Pyracantha atalantoides). Permutational analysis of variance confirmed that axis deer dietary composition varied significantly between seasons and hunting methods. The proportion of bait-fed deer culled by controlled shooting increased significantly with an increasing amount of bait (soybean or dry maize) deployed at each blind. The consumption of each invasive woody species was spatially aggregated and matched their core area of occupancy, suggesting localized feeding and limited short-term movement consistent with deer philopatric behavior. By providing the deer with cover, water and nutrient-dense food items, the riverine forest gains special relevance for integrated management efforts targeting both exotic woody species and exotic ungulates.

AB  - Intraguild predation (IGP), defined as killing and eating among potential competitors, is commonly observed in shallow lakes and is predicted to dampen trophic cascades and affect ecosystem properties (e.g. phytoplankton biomass or primary production). We tested this hypothesis by manipulating the density of two common lake predators, the small-sized fish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco (the intraguild predator) and the shrimp Exopalaemon modestus (the intraguild prey), in outdoor mesocosms containing natural phytoplankton and zooplankton communities.
   In single predator treatments, both predators induced a strong trophic cascade, as evidenced by extinction of the key herbivore, Daphnia pulex, and increasing phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a concentration.
   When the two predators were added together, however, the strength of collective predator effects on zooplankton and the cascading effects on phytoplankton growth were weaker than the sum of the individual predator effects. We attributed this antagonism among predators to intraguild predation as demonstrated by the lower shrimp catch per unit effort in the presence of fish.
   Our study suggests that common predators in subtropical shallow lakes may act antagonistically and thereby dampen trophic cascades in food webs. Thus, when implementing biomanipulation efforts to suppress algal growth via enhancing zooplankton herbivory, both the quantity and diversity of lake predator assemblies should be considered.

AB  - Identifying patterns and understanding the processes associated with Marine and Coastal Protected Areas (MCPAs) (local scale) are essential for developing specific hypotheses about trophic interactions and potential cascading effects of local and global changes. This can also serve as an initial step in the identification of biodiversity patterns and biological interactions on a regional scale. This study characterized a set of species/taxa composed of four subcommunities featuring macrobenthic infauna, epibenthic megafauna, birds, and mammals observed between 2019 and 2021 in the estuarine and marine system of the Pitipalena-An similar to ihue ' MCPA in Chilean Patagonia. Biodiversity patterns were analyzed using multidimensional models and indices.A pool of 276 taxa were observed within the studied subcommunities, and reproduction was confirmed for several bird and mammal species (mostly on islets). The results indicate a system with several types of habitats, where the sea lion Otaria flavescens was dominant among the group of marine mammals. Notably, birds and epibenthic megafauna showed differences between the marine and estuarine environment. The observed biodiversity patterns can be attributed to environmental heterogeneity, as well as anthropic effects (including invasive species, fishing, and aquaculture). This work proposes a synthesized spatial distribution scheme of the main taxa, complemented by a matrix of hypothetical trophic interactions. Along with demonstrating the current lack of available information, this matrix offers an opportunity to assess the ecosystem's sensitivity, identify relevant information gaps, and develop hypotheses about specific trophic interactions (scalable to the region) and the potential cascading effects of ocean changes.

AB  - Tigers (Panthera tigris) are an endangered species facing severe threats of population decline worldwide, and understanding their spatio-temporal activity patterns and habitat use in different forest management regimes is crucial for their conservation and management. We analyzed systematically collected camera trap data using occupancy modelling and kernel density functions to assess the spatio-temporal activity patterns of tigers across three forest management regimes in Nepal: Parsa National Park (PNP), its buffer zone, and adjoining national forests. Each of these three forest management regimes are differentially influenced by prey availability, habitat condition, and anthropogenic disturbances. We found that highest spatio-temporal overlap of tigers occurred with gaur (Bos gaurus) and spotted deer (Axis axis) in PNP. On the other hand, tigers highly overlap with wild boar (Sus scrofa), spotted deer (Axis axis) and barking deer (Muntiacus muntjac) in buffer zone and national forests. Mixed forest, grassland and riverine forest were the highly used habitat by the tigers, and domestic animals had a greater adverse impact on tigers than humans. Our findings showed that prey availability, habitat class and domestic animals significantly influence tiger presence, while, forests of every management regime are important for tiger conservation. Tiger conservation could be improved with greater collaboration and coordination between and across different forest management regimes.

AB  - Aim: Several large-mammal species in Europe have recovered and recolonized parts of their historical ranges. Knowing where suitable habitat exists, and thus where range expansions are possible, is important for proactively promoting coexistence between people and large mammals in shared landscapes. We aimed to assess the opportunities and limitations for range expansions of Europe's two largest herbivores, the European bison (Bison bonasus) and moose (Alces alces).Location: Central Europe.Methods: We used large occurrence datasets from multiple populations and species distribution models to map environmentally suitable habitats for European bison and moose across Central Europe, and to assess human pressure inside the potential habitat. We then used circuit theory modeling to identify potential recolonization corridors.Results: We found widespread suitable habitats for both European bison (> 120,000 km(2)) and moose (> 244,000 km(2)), suggesting substantial potential for range expansions. However, much habitat was associated with high human pressure (37% and 43% for European bison and moose, respectively), particularly in the west of Central Europe. We identified a strong east-west gradient of decreasing connectivity, with major barriers likely limiting natural recolonization in many areas.Main conclusions: We identify major potential for restoring large herbivores and their functional roles in Europe's landscapes. However, we also highlight considerable challenges for conservation planning and wildlife management, including areas where recolonization likely leads to human-wildlife conflict and where barriers to movement prevent natural range expansion. Conservation measures restoring broad-scale connectivity are needed in order to allow European bison and moose to recolonize their historical ranges. Finally, our analyses and maps indicate suitable but isolated habitat patches that are unlikely to be colonized but are candidate locations for reintroductions to establish reservoir populations. More generally, our work emphasizes that transboundary cooperation is needed for restoring large herbivores and their ecological roles, and to foster coexistence with people in Europe's landscapes.

AB  - Depending on the plant species, animal trampling significantly affects vegetation by affecting seed burial in marl soil (MS). Soil seed bank dynamics (SSBDs) and seedling characteristics were investigated under light, moderate, and heavy grazing intensities in a MS and non-marl soil (NMS). Considering the seed characteristics and appendages, SSBDs and seedling characteristics significantly changed under grazing intensities (p < 0.05) where the greatest change was observed in MS (more than NMS). Seed size and seed sphericity index showed a significant positive relationship with seed burial depth under heavy grazing, while the seed length and width and the presence of appendages had the strongest negative correlation with seed burial under exclosure/light grazing (p < 0.05). Depth of 4-6 cm had the most seed numbers under heavy grazing. Moreover, heavy grazing reduced the diversity index in SSB by 34%, while the diversity index in vegetation has decreased by 41% compared to control.

AB  - Mountain environments pose challenges for accurately assessing the population size of ungulates, which may hamper confidence in using abundance estimates for decision-making. Thus, evaluations of the accuracy of methods using known-size populations are valuable. Here, we tested the accuracy of direct counts and distance sampling to assess the size of a fenced population of Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) of known size. We evaluated the influence of observer expertise (beginners and experts) on the detection error of female and male ibexes and whether training improved accuracy. The ibex population comprised 18 individuals (ten males and eight females) living in a 17-ha enclosure in northeastern Spain. After 27 surveys, experts detected 16% more ibexes than beginners. Male ibexes were similar to 13% easier to detect than females, and experts were more accurate than beginners in sexing individuals. Additionally, the detection error in absolute counts was similar among beginners but different among experts (> 10%). Despite reducing detection error over subsequent surveys, under-detection was > 50% in all events (> 85% and > 67% for beginners and experts, respectively). Our data indicate a systematic underestimation of direct counts of our mountain ungulate populations and the contribution of expertise to improving accuracy. Our results show that managers assessing mountain ungulate populations for management purposes should consider alternative methods.

AB  - Plant litter decomposition is critical for carbon and nutrient cycling globally. However, the effect of large herbivore grazing on litter decomposition and its mechanisms remain less explored. Here, 1203 paired observations and 381 independent experiments were analyzed to determine how litter decomposition and nutrient cycling respond to changes in grazing intensity. Grazing significantly increased litter decomposition rate by 14.08 % and litter carbon release by 5.03 %, and this effect was observed in grasslands and croplands but not in forests. The positive grazing effect was also found under sheep and cattle/yak grazing. Moderate grazing advanced the homefield advantage effect but inhibited under heavy grazing for grazed litters. The grazing effect was larger for high quality litter than for low quality litter. Litter decomposition slowed under >10 years heavy grazing but accelerated under moderate grazing. The effects of large herbivore grazing on litter decomposition were jointly influenced by grazing intensity, livestock type, climate condition, decomposition duration, litter quality, and soil properties. Our results demonstrated that large herbivore grazing accelerates litter decomposition globally and emphasized the significance and importance of grazing intensity on litter decomposition, which should be integrated into terrestrial ecosystem models.

AB  - Land-use changes are a main driver of modifications in tropical ecosystems, leading to the loss of species and ecological traits and affecting key ecological functions. Although much attention has been given to predict the effects of species loss on ecological processes, information on the large-scale effects of land-use changes over ecological functions is scarce. Here, we detected erosion in the prevalence of ecological functions performed by mammals in response to land-use changes in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. By analyzing the loss of different ecological functions (vertebrate and invertebrate predation, seed dispersal, seed depredation, herbivory) performed by mammal assemblages in a deforestation gradient, we observed that vulnerable functions (performed by sensitive species, such as browsing, seed depredation, medium and large vertebrate predation) were positively related to patch size and forest cover and negatively related to anthropogenic cover. These relationships were reversed for persistent functions (performed by resilient species, such as grazing, small seed dispersal, small vertebrate and invertebrate predation). Vulnerable functions were virtually restricted to large forest remnants, while persistent functions were prevalent in human-modified landscapes. Disturbed forests are not necessarily empty of mammal species, but there is a substantial loss of ecological functions across most of the Atlantic Forest. Five out of ten ecological functions lose prevalence in small forest remnants. Nonetheless, these small remnants serve as refuges for the remaining biodiversity and are on the verge of the functional extinction of important processes. The erosion of ecological functions provided by mammals compromise the persistence of Atlantic Forest's biodiversity. (C) 2021 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

AB  - Competition for resources and space can drive forage selection of large herbivores from the bite through the landscape scale. Animal behaviour and foraging patterns are also influenced by abiotic and biotic factors. Fine-scale mechanisms of density-dependent foraging at the bite scale are likely consistent with density-dependent behavioural patterns observed at broader scales, but few studies have directly tested this assertion. Here, we tested if space use intensity, a proxy of spatiotemporal density, affects foraging mechanisms at fine spatial scales similarly to density-dependent effects observed at broader scales in caribou. We specifically assessed how behavioural choices are affected by space use intensity and environmental processes using behavioural state and forage selection data from caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) observed from GPS video-camera collars using a multivariate discrete-choice modelling framework. We found that the probability of eating shrubs increased with increasing caribou space use intensity and cover of Salix spp. shrubs, whereas the probability of eating lichen decreased. Insects also affected fine-scale foraging behaviour by reducing the overall probability of eating. Strong eastward winds mitigated negative effects of insects and resulted in higher probabilities of eating lichen. At last, caribou exhibited foraging functional responses wherein their probability of selecting each food type increased as the availability (% cover) of that food increased. Space use intensity signals of fine-scale foraging were consistent with density-dependent responses observed at larger scales and with recent evidence suggesting declining reproductive rates in the same caribou population. Our results highlight potential risks of overgrazing on sensitive forage species such as lichen. Remote investigation of the functional responses of foraging behaviours provides exciting future applications where spatial models can identify high-quality habitats for conservation.
   We used an animal observation and modelling framework to test fine-scale density-dependent foraging in subarctic caribou.Caribou were more likely to eat shrubs as shrub cover and space use intensity of caribou increased in summer, but less likely to eat lichen. Insects reduced the overall probability of eating. Caribou also exhibited functional responses in foraging where they selected more of each food type as its availability increased. Remote investigations provide exciting applications to identify high-quality habitats for conservation.image

AB  - Invasive species can have complex direct and indirect impacts on ecosystems. The impacts of invasive prey species on native prey can be difficult to observe if the latter migrate seasonally, and when the interaction is indirect. We hypothesize that invasive lagomorphs and snow dynamics indirectly drive predation risk for guanaco by puma. We employed camera-trapping data collected over multiple years and seasons in an altitudinal gradient in the Andes of Central Chile. We predicted a high spatial and temporal association between puma and lagomorph detections, given these prey species comprise most of puma diet in the area. We also expected a higher spatiotemporal association between guanaco and puma detections towards higher snow cover in the study area, because of downward altitudinal migration of the ungulate. We obtained 4863 mammalian detections. Our data shows that the detection of puma was positively associated with hare capture rate year-round. In addition, puma detection was positively associated with the interaction of snow cover and guanaco capture rate. Puma temporal activity strongly overlapped with hare, whereas puma apparently increased diurnal activity with an increase in guanaco capture rate. Predation risk for guanaco increased when snow cover was higher and decreased when guanaco migrated to higher altitudes during dryer months. We conclude it is of conservation concern that lagomorphs may be subsidizing pumas and modifying patterns of consumptive and non-consumptive effects of the predator on native prey populations.

AB  - Ozegahara Mire is the largest alpine mire in Japan. The mire has been preserved as the precious peatland ecosystem with high ecological diversity. After the late 20th century, the mire has been exposed to ecosystem disturbance by mire flooding due to heavy rain as well as invaded Sika deer. Especially, browsing and digging of the mire vegetation by invaded Sika deer have caused considerable impacts on not only vegetation but also physicochemical properties of the mire peat soil. Little information has been published on the effect of flooding and Sika deer disturbance on greenhouse gas emission from the mire. This study aims to provide investigation about the effects of Sika deer disturbance on the soil physicochemical properties and the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from Ozegahara Mire. Soil and gas samples were collected at 14 fixed plots on 5 sites with and without mire disturbance by Sika deer at eastern Naka-tashiro of Ozegahara Mire through 5 months of 2019 (June to October). Groundwater levels at the study sites were measured each month using hand measurements and continuously using water level loggers. Soil samples were collected with a trowel and gas samples were collected in cylindrical polyvinyl chloride chambers installed on the study sites. Subsequent physicochemical analysis of the soil samples and the gas chromatographic analysis of the gas samples were conducted at the laboratory. Groundwater level displayed similar seasonal change in two sites, being affected by precipitation. The concentrations of NH4+ nitrogen in the disturbed sites were higher than those in the undisturbed sites. Mechanical disturbance of the peat soils by deer resulted in mineralization of organic matter. CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the disturbed sites were lower than those from the undisturbed sites where highest fluxes were recorded in August. Negative correlation was found between CO2 and groundwater level (r = -0.327, p < 0.05), suggesting the importance of groundwater level in greenhouse gas flux. These results indicate the marked influences of the mire disturbance by Sika deer on physicochemical properties of the peat soils and greenhouse gas fluxes at Ozegahara Mire.

AB  - Environmental heterogeneity is widely thought to promote biodiversity, yet its variable effects limit its predictive power. This variability can be better understood by considering key mediating factors: different forms of local heterogeneity, organismal groups and their associated traits, and the broader environmental context (e.g. latitude). To address these factors, we analysed 144 studies (24 412 data points and 2815 effects) from rocky reefs worldwide. Heterogeneity was defined as spatial variability, and heterogeneity metrics were grouped into facets such as three-dimensional (3D) structure (e.g. substrate rugosity), complexity (e.g. fractal dimension) and feature variability (e.g. mussel size classes). All facets promoted biodiversity, but effects were context-dependent, with 3D structures having the strongest impact, likely owing to increased niche provision and substrate area. Responses also varied across organismal groups, with small-bodied and mobile species benefiting the most. Additionally, heterogeneity reduced grazing and enhanced recruitment, helping promote biodiversity. Effects were strongest on biogenic substrates, at lower latitudes and in more stressful intertidal zones. Overall, the influence of local heterogeneity depends on how it is generated and measured, organisms' traits, and prevailing environmental conditions. These insights inform the development of a conceptual model predicting heterogeneity's context-dependent effects on biodiversity across systems.

AB  - Many coral reefs throughout the world continue to decline in health and resilience. In the Caribbean, much of this decline has been attributed to increases in algal cover due to the loss of herbivores such as herbivorous fishes, especially large parrotfish, and the sea urchin Diadema antillarum. In recent years, the combination of protections and natural recovery has helped these herbivores, particularly parrotfishes, to recover in some areas. This recovery has led to questions about how different herbivores affect both the overall benthic cover of macroalgae and the specific composition of algal communities. Toward that end, we designed a caging experiment in Little Cayman to manipulate density and type of grazers. Treatments included full cages (1.27 cm wire mesh) with 4 D. antillarum/m2 added, full cages with 1 D. antillarum/m2, lidless cages (fences) open to herbivorous fishes without D. antillarum, full cages (herbivore exclosures) that excluded most fishes and urchins and open cageless controls. Benthic cover was quantified to assess differences in percent cover and community structure of macroalgae and benthic invertebrates throughout the 5-month study. As the experiment proceeded, both percent algal cover and algal community structure in the full herbivore exclosures, treatments open to fishes (open plots and fences), and treatments with D. antillarum (both densities) diverged. No changes were observed in percent cover of corals or other benthic invertebrates. Overall, reductions in percent algal cover were greater in the high density (4/m2) D. antillarum treatment compared to the low density (1/m2) D. antillarum treatment or those treatments where fishes were allowed access. As expected, greater densities of sea urchins reduced algal cover more quickly. However, these high density treatments also affected the D. antillarum themselves. The condition of the urchins (assessed as ratio of mass to test diameter) at the conclusion of the experiment declined in the 4 D. antillarum/m2 treatment compared to urchins in the 1 D. antillarum/m2 treatment and natural populations. Moreover, high densities of D. antillarum were better able to reduce the abundance of the brown macroalgae Lobophora spp. and Dictyota spp. compared to natural assemblages of herbivorous fishes. These findings suggest that these different types of herbivores, i.e., fishes and D. antillarum, exert different pressures on available algae. Their relative abundances will likely dictate macroalgal community structure on Caribbean coral reefs, and thus the suitability of a reef for the settlement of vital sessile organisms, especially corals.

AB  - Biomonitoring is vital for establishing baseline data that is needed to identify and quantify ecological change and to inform management and conservation activities. However, biomonitoring and biodiversity assessment in arid environments, which are predicted to cover 56% of the Earth's land surface by 2100, can be prohibitively time consuming, expensive, and logistically challenging due to their often remote and inhospitable nature. Sampling of environmental DNA (eDNA) coupled with high-throughput sequencing is an emerging biodiversity assessment method. Here we explore the application of eDNA metabarcoding and various sampling approaches to estimate vertebrate richness and assemblage at human-constructed and natural water sources in a semi-arid region of Western Australia. Three sampling methods: sediment samples, filtering through a membrane with a pump, and membrane sweeping in the water body, were compared using two eDNA metabarcoding assays, 12S-V5 and 16smam, for 120 eDNA samples collected from four gnammas (gnamma: Australian Indigenous Noongar language term-granite rock pools) and four cattle troughs in the Great Western Woodlands, Western Australia. We detected higher vertebrate richness in samples from cattle troughs and found differences between assemblages detected in gnammas (more birds and amphibians) and cattle troughs (more mammals, including feral taxa). Total vertebrate richness was not different between swept and filtered samples, but all sampling methods yielded different assemblages. Our findings indicate that eDNA surveys in arid lands will benefit from collecting multiple samples at multiple water sources to avoid underestimating vertebrate richness. The high concentration of eDNA in small, isolated water bodies permits the use of sweep sampling that simplifies sample collection, processing, and storage, particularly when assessing vertebrate biodiversity across large spatial scales.

AB  - The Greater Mahale Ecosystem (GME) in western Tanzania hosts high faunal biodiversity, including charismatic species such as elephants and chimpanzees. Across the GME, habitat occurs in differently administered, unprotected and protected areas, including village land, forest reserves, and national parks. Areas of lower protective status are prone to deforestation and land cover changes. These land cover changes influence suitable habitat itself as well as the connectivity between habitat patches, but the impact on different mammal species in this region is unknown. In this study, we investigated changes in habitat availability by creating species distribution models for 11 medium-large mammal species based on species occurrence data collected from 2008 to 2020. We tested habitat associations for each species and evaluated the importance of the static predictor variables elevation, slope, aspect and terrain-ruggedness and the dynamic predictor variables distance to deforestation, percent forest, vegetation intensity, and vegetation variability, retrieved through remotely sensed data analysis. Our models suggest habitat declined for most, but not all species. Whilst elephants and buffalo lost more than 50 % of available habitat during this period, primates exhibited habitat stability. Habitat losses were pronounced in the southeast of the GME. Slope, elevation and median tasseled-cap wetness index (vegetation intensity) and distance to deforestation were the most important predictor variables. Our study presents a spatially and temporally explicit estimation of habitat changes in a critically important, biodiverse region undergoing drastic land cover changes. We call for consideration in land-use planning to foster connectivity and landscape integrity to protect and conserve wildlife across the ecosystem.

AB  - Earlier snowmelt, warmer temperatures and herbivory are among the factors that influence high-latitude tundra productivity near the town of Utqiagvik in northern Alaska. However, our understanding of the potential interactions between these factors is limited. MODIS observations provide cover fractions of vegetation, snow, standing water, and soil, and fractional absorption of photosynthetically active radiation by canopy chlorophyll (fAPARchl) per pixel. Here, we evaluated a recent time-period (2001-2014) that the tundra experienced large interannual variability in vegetation productivity metrics (i.e. fAPARchl and APARchl), which was explainable by both abiotic and biotic factors. We found earlier snowmelt to increase soil and vegetation cover, and productivity in June, while warmer temperatures significantly increased monthly productivity. However, abiotic factors failed to explain stark decreases in productivity during August of 2008, which coincided with a severe lemming outbreak. MODIS observations found this tundra ecosystem to completely recover two years later, resulting in elevated productivity. This study highlights the potential roles of both climate and herbivory in modulating the interannual variability of remotely retrieved plant productivity metrics in Arctic coastal tundra ecosystems.

AB  - The stability of grassland is pivotal in maintaining the grassland functioning and services. However, the knowledge about the consequences of grazing on stability of grassland productivity is limited. Based on a 3-year manipulated experiment with two grazing regimes (i.e., continuous grazing and rotational grazing) along four levels of grazing-intensity (0, 4, 6, and 8 sheep per hectare) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we researched the responses of temporal stability of plant community and functional groups of alpine grasslands to different grazing management regimes. We found that grazing regimes, intensity and their interaction affected the temporal stability of aboveground net primary productivity of alpine grassland (ANPP), and intermediate rotational grazing significantly reduced the temporal stability of ANPP, whereas increased the stability of productivity of functional group of forbs. The response species to continuous grazing and rotational grazing are different, for grasses and forbs respectively. Rotational grazing and intermediate continuous grazing increased the diversity of response species. Structural equation modeling further revealed that functional groups asynchrony stabilized the productivity of the alpine grassland ecosystem under grazing in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. These results showed that the rotational grazing and intermediate continuous grazing can maintain the productivity stability, and highlighted importance of regulating the relationships among functional groups for promoting the stability of alpine grassland under grazing management.

AB  - Brandt's vole ( Lasiopodomys brandtii ), a typical rodent in the eastern Eurasian Steppe, has unclear impacts on ecosystem stability. In our field study in the Hulun Buir steppe, a multifunctional grazing ecosystem in this region, we used burrow entrance area and burrow density as alternative disturbance indices to derive a Disturbance Index (DI) for quantifying disturbance levels from rodents, and employed generalized linear mixedeffects model and the N-dimensional hypervolume framework to assess the influence of Brandt's vole disturbance on plant and soil functions, and then on the ecosystem functional stability. Our findings unequivocally illustrate that various plant functions including vegetation cover (Cover), aboveground biomass (ABG) and shoot carbon (ShootC) significantly declined with increasing disturbance, while shoot nitrogen (ShootN) and root nitrogen (RootN) show significantly positive responses. Soil functions such as soil nitrogen (SoilN), soil phosphorus (SoilP) and soil organic carbon (SoilC) showed significantly negative responses. Notably, the burrow entrance area exerts a more pronounced impact on both plant and soil functions in comparison to burrow density. Additionally, both disturbance indicators have a more significant influence on plant functions than on soil functions. Overall, the ecosystem functional stability progressively decreases with intensified disturbance, with varying response patterns for plant and soil functions, the former exhibited heightened stability as disturbance intensified, while the latter proved more stable at moderate disturbance levels. Our findings suggest that plant functions were more susceptible to disturbance by Brandt's vole compared to soils. Additionally, an ecosystem destabilization was synchronized with increasing Brandt's vole disturbance, although alterations in the functional stability of plants and soil show a different pattern.

AB  - Camellia sinensis is a significant economic and medical plant. The plant is short and thrives in shaded environments, making it suitable for cultivation under forest canopies. However, the mechanisms governing the growth of C. sinensis in understory conditions need to be fully understood. The study aims to delve into the growth regulatory mechanisms of C. sinensis in understory mode and the impact of the environment on its growth efficiency and bioactive compound synthesis. Through physiological measurements, transcriptomics, metagenomics, and machine vision analysis, a systematic investigation of C. sinensis characteristics in different environments was conducted. Transcriptome data comparisons unveiled key gene expression changes, and the role of these genes in biosynthetic pathways was validated using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). Concurrently, metagenomic analysis of soil microbial communities revealed the environmental effects on microbial diversity. C. sinensis in understory mode exhibited higher stomatal density and smaller pore sizes under low light and humidity conditions; phenolic and flavonoid compounds were identified as the main regulatory pathways, with enhanced expression of key genes such as Dihydroflavonol-4-Reductase (DFR), Anthocyanidin Reductase (ANR), and Leucoanthocyanidin Reductase (LAR), which promoted the synthesis of tea polyphenols and lignin, the abundance of Acidobacteria might be related to the growth of C. sinensis in understory mode. Furthermore, machine vision models indicated that C. sinensis displayed higher growth efficiency in the understory mode environment. This research discovered the characteristics of C. sinensis in understory mode and elucidated its growth efficiency in understory mode by modulating phenolic and flavonoid metabolism key genes and promoting the accumulation of secondary metabolites. Differences in soil microbial communities could also affect vegetation coverage and other aspects. These findings provide a scientific basis for optimizing understory mode cultivation and highlight the crucial importance of multidisciplinary approaches in understanding plant adaptability.

AB  - Context The guanaco (Lama guanicoe) is one of the four species of South American camels, and is the largest native mammal inhabiting arid and semi-arid environments in South America. Although the guanaco was abundant and widely distributed in the past, currently its density and distribution range are substantially reduced, inhabiting mainly Southern Patagonia in small isolated groups. The decline in guanaco populations is most likely related to the Anthropocene defaunation process that is affecting large mammals in developing countries worldwide, but the extent and causes of these changes are not well understood.Aims To explore both the changes in the distribution of guanaco populations in Northwest Patagonia and the environmental and anthropic factors that shaped the distribution patterns, by employing a long-term perspective spanning from the end of the Late Holocene to present times (i.e. the last 2500 years).Methods We combine archaeological information, ethnohistorical records and current observations and apply Species Distribution Models using bioclimatic and anthropic factors as explanatory variables.Key results Guanaco spatial distribution in Northwest Patagonia changed significantly throughout time. This change consisted in the displacement of the species towards the east of the region and its disappearance from northwest Neuqu & eacute;n and southwest Mendoza in the last 30 years. In particular, the high-density urban settlements and roads, and secondly, competition with ovicaprine livestock (goats and sheep) for forage are the main factors explaining the change in guanaco distribution.Conclusions Guanaco and human populations co-existed in the same areas during the Late Holocene and historic times (16th to 19th centuries), but during the 20th century the modern anthropic impact generated a spatial dissociation between both species, pushing guanaco populations to drier and more unproductive areas that were previously peripheral in its distribution.Implications As with many other large mammal species in developing countries, Northwest Patagonia guanaco populations are undergoing significant changes in their range due to modern anthropic activities. Considering that these events are directly related to population declines and extirpations, together with the striking low density recorded for Northwest Patagonia guanaco populations, urgent management actions are needed to mitigate current human impacts.

AB  - Parasitic plants and herbivores show similarities in their interactions with host plants. Herbivore-induced resistance/susceptibility in plants can scale up to the arthropod community. Similar evidence regarding parasitic plants is scarce. We evaluated the indirect effects initiated by the mistletoe Tristerix aphyllus on the arthropod community of the cactus Echinopsis chiloensis in the Chilean coastal desert. Field observations suggested that a stem-borer beetle bores more brood chambers in mistletoe-parasitised cacti than in non-parasitised cacti, and that arthropods colonise these chambers. We compared tissue toughness, chamber density and morphology in mistletoe-parasitised and non-parasitised cacti. We also compared richness, total abundance, abundance per taxa, diversity and composition of the colonising arthropod community. Parasitised cacti showed a 14% reduction in tissue toughness. Chamber density in parasitised cacti was four times greater and chambers were larger: 35% more volume, an entrance-opening area 30% greater, and twice the area of the maximum-width section. Arthropod species richness and diversity were higher in chambers of parasitised cacti. Arthropod community composition was different in chambers of parasitised and non-parasitised cacti. Thus, spiders and moths were more abundant in parasitised cacti, and pseudoscorpions, scolopendras, ants and flies were exclusively present there, while non-parasitised cacti had no exclusive taxa. Mistletoe infection results in a richer, more diverse and distinct arthropod community on its cactus host, which occurs through induced susceptibility to stem-borers whose brood chambers are colonised by arthropods. Tristerix aphyllus could be a key-stone species in these arid ecosystems, where arthropod diversity is relatively low.

AB  - In an Afrotropical region experiencing massive deforestation, restoration approaches should provide sustainable solutions for recovering biodiversity. Arthropods are a sensitive taxonomic group for habitat alteration by deforestation and can be good indicators for restoration studies. Ground-dwelling arthropods provide important ecosystem functions, such as predation or organic matter decomposition, thereby contributing to ecosystem functionality. The consequences of post-mining management on arthropods in the Afrotropical region remain understudied. We carried out a comprehensive sampling of ground-dwelling arthropods in the dry and wet seasons across four land-use types in the semi-deciduous forest zone of Ghana. We then analysed whether the specific tree communities, vegetation structure and seasonal differences affected arthropod communities in the restored post-mining forest compared to the dominant alternative land-use type (agroforestry plantation), a natural reference (natural forest) or an unmanaged former mining area (gravel mine). In total, 43,364 arthropods were sampled and assigned to 78 taxonomic groups representing 14 order/sub-order, 28 beetle families, 25 spider families, 5 hunting guilds of spiders and 6 trophic groups of beetles. Overall, Araneae, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Orthoptera all had higher activity densities in the wet season. The vegetation structure of the three land-use types with trees supported a greater overall activity density of arthropods and a more diverse functional composition compared to the unmanaged gravel site. Pronounced variation between the dry and wet seasons further influenced the taxonomic and functional composition. The active forest restoration of this post-mining area is a promising approach to drive arthropod communities towards a comparable state observed in the natural forest.

AB  - Habitat suitability models have become a valuable tool for wildlife conservation and management, and are frequently used to better understand the range and habitat requirements of rare and endangered species. In this study, we employed two habitat suitability modeling techniques, namely Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) and Maximum Entropy (Maxent) models, to identify potential suitable habitats for the endangered mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni) and environmental factors affecting its distribution in the Arsi and Ahmar Mountains of Ethiopia. Presence points, used to develop our habitat suitability models, were recorded from fecal pellet counts (n = 130) encountered along 196 randomly established transects in 2015 and 2016. Predictor variables used in our models included major landcover types, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), greenness and wetness tasseled cap vegetation indices, elevation, and slope. Area Under the Curve model evaluations for BRT and Maxent were 0.96 and 0.95, respectively, demonstrating high performance. Both models were then ensembled into a single binary output highlighting an area of agreement. Our results suggest that 1864 km(2) (9.1%) of the 20,567 km(2) study area is suitable habitat for the mountain nyala with land cover types, elevation, NDVI, and slope of the terrain being the most important variables for both models. Our results highlight the extent to which habitat loss and fragmentation have disconnected mountain nyala subpopulations. Our models demonstrate the importance of further protecting suitable habitats for mountain nyala to ensure the species' conservation.

AB  - 1. Understanding fire effects on multitrophic levels is critical to the context of changes in fire regime and climate. Insects located at higher trophic levels, like parasitoids, are more vulnerable to habitat changes than insect herbivores because they need well-established populations of their hosts to survive. Currently, fire effects on parasitoids and their interactions with their hosts are unknown.2. Our aim was to study the changes in abundance, richness and species composition, as well as the food web structure in a system involving parasitoids and galling insects under different fire scenarios. We asked whether potential changes in abundance, species richness and composition of parasitoid communities are explained by galled plant abundance, species richness and composition of galling insects, and how fire affects the structure of galling insect-parasitoid food webs.3. The highest parasitoid richness was found in the 9 years after fire scenario, whereas parasitoid abundance was not affected by fire. The parasitoid species composition in the 9 years after fire scenario was different from that in the unburned and 3 years after fire scenarios. Parasitoid communities were modulated by galled plant abundance, species richness and composition of galling insect communities. Vulnerability was significantly higher in 9 years after fire scenarios, but it increased with increasing network size.4. Fire affects the community of parasitoids through changes in their host communities. Differences in exclusivity to fire scenarios and diet specialisation of parasitoid species and galling insect richness may explain the patterns found. Our study supports evidence that fire creates habitats heterogeneous in the availability of hosts shaping the parasitoid communities, with a bottom-up effect in food webs. Additionally, in burned areas were recorded unique galling insect-parasitoid interactions.

AB  - The relationships and linkages between biodiversity and ecosystem processes are critical issues in ecology. Manure removal is an ecosystem process related to several ecological functions performed by dung beetles. However, there is little information on manure removal by beetles in temperate ecosystems of Mexico. Using a linear model based on species biomass, here we estimated the amount of manure that can be potentially removed by dung beetle species in temperate forests and grasslands with sheep herding. Then, we related the estimated amount of manure removed with attributes of dung beetle communities: species richness, diversity, evenness and functional diversity in forest and grasslands sites. We compared the amount of manure potentially removed at each habitat by all species of dung beetles and by beetle's food relocation strategies. Also, we used Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to test the relationships between manure removal and community attributes. Our model estimated that five species remove most of the manure, and tunneler beetles remove higher amounts of manure in grasslands than in forest sites. GAMs revealed that manure removal is related to dung beetle species richness and evenness, but not to functional diversity. Therefore, it is relevant to promote rich dung beetle communities to maintain optimal ecosystem functions, both in native forest and livestock areas.

AB  - Context. The bourgeoning carbon economy is creating novel ways to incentivise conservation management activities that have the co-benefits of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and social inequality. Aim. To estimate the monetary value of carbon credits that landowners could generate by reducing ecologically destructive feral populations of the Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) in northern Australia. Methods. First, we estimated buffalo enteric emissions based on the population structure of feral buffalo in northern Australia, and discounted the reduction of fire emissions due to the consumption of grassy fuel by feral buffalo. We then predicted the change in buffalo population size across the South Alligator River region of Kakadu National Park under four buffalo management scenarios: (1) no buffalo control; (2) low-intensity buffalo control; (3) moderate-intensity buffalo control; and (4) high-intensity buffalo control. We quantified the reduction of GHG emissions under the three buffalo control scenarios, relative to the scenario of no buffalo control, while discounting the GHG emissions that directly result from buffalo control actions (e.g. helicopter emissions). Key results. All three buffalo control scenarios substantially reduced the estimated GHG emissions that would otherwise have been produced. The low-intensity buffalo control scenario was predicted to abate 790 513 t CO2-e over the 20-year simulation, worth USD15 076 085 (or USD753 804 year-1). Our high-intensity buffalo control scenario had the greatest reduction in GHG emissions, with a total net abatement of 913 231 t CO2-e, worth USD17 176 437 (or USD858 822 year-1). Conclusions. The potential value of carbon credits generated by controlling feral buffalo populations in northern Australian savannas far exceeds the management costs. Implications. The management of feral ruminants could be incentivised by the generation of carbon credits. Such management could simultaneously avoid GHG emissions, generate income for landowners and offer significant ecological benefits.

AB  - Changes in precipitation due to climate change will have consequences for plant and herbivorous insect communities alike. Multiple hypotheses explain how changes in plant diversity and productivity can lead to changes in herbivore community composition. Yet as rainfall patterns change, the bottom-up effects on the relationships between plant and herbivore communities are less well understood. Using a long-term rainfall manipulation experiment in a remnant patch of Garry oak (Quercus garryana) savanna, we examined how plant diversity and productivity have responded to variation in soil moisture over 6 years. This highly endangered ecosystem is predicted to experience significantly wetter springs and drier summers by 2080. We also investigated plant-mediated, indirect effects of manipulated rainfall on herbivore diversity and abundance, drawing on multiple hypotheses describing the relationships between plant and herbivore communities. For example, the more individuals hypothesis predicts that increased plant productivity results in increased herbivore abundance which, in turn, results in increased herbivore diversity. We found that plant productivity was influenced by soil moisture, but the direction and magnitude of the response varied across years, and found no support for plant diversity influencing productivity. We also found that the cover and productivity of grasses increased significantly with increasing precipitation. In addition to a direct negative effect on herbivore diversity, soil moisture had an indirect negative effect on herbivore abundance, via the negative effect of plant productivity on abundance, contradicting the more individuals hypothesis. Synthesis. Our results highlight that not only can drought result in significant reductions in plant productivity in this threatened ecosystem, but that these changes will also result in increases in herbivore abundance. In contrast, where soil moisture is higher, grasses will become more dominant resulting in decreased herbivore abundance. Ultimately, predicting how this system responds to changes in precipitation will depend on the ability to predict whether growing season soil moisture will be consistently drier or wetter in the future, a significant challenge. Going forward, investigating how variation in precipitation due to climate change affects the links between trophic levels, including how herbivores affect plant communities, remains critical for understanding ecosystem processes and stability.

AB  - In Africa, burgeoning human populations promote agricultural expansion and the associated demand for water. Water abstraction for agriculture from perennial rivers can be detrimental for wildlife, particularly when it reduces water availability in protected areas. Ruaha National Park (Ruaha NP) in southern Tanzania, one of the largest parks in Africa, contains important wildlife populations, including rare and endangered species. The Great Ruaha River (GRR) is the main dry season water source for wildlife in the Park. Water offtake from this river for large-scale irrigation and livestock production up-stream of the Park has caused large expanses of this formerly perennial river within the Park to dry out during the dry season. The dry season distribution of a species in relation to surface water is considered an indicator of its dependence on water and ability to cope with the loss of surface water. We investigated how diminishing surface water availability during three dry seasons (2011-2013) affected herbivores' distance to water in Ruaha NP. The distance held by herbivores to water is shaped by a range of factors including dietary category. We determined changes in the locations of available surface water throughout the dry season using standardized ground transects, close to and leading away from the GRR, to map the locations of nine herbivore species. Functional responses of herbivores, i.e. their change in distance to water between early and late dry season, indicated that distance to water was 1) shortest in buffalo and waterbuck (grazers), 2) similar for plains zebra (grazer), elephant and impala (mixed feeders), 3) larger in giraffe and greater kudu (browsers) and 4) largest in generalist feeders (warthog, common duiker). The substantial species' differences in surface water dependence broadly fit predicted species differences in their ability to cope with anthropogenic reduction in surface water in Ruaha NP.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances, including extraction of natural resources and development of alternative energy, are reducing and fragmenting habitat for wildlife across the globe. Effects of those disturbances have been explored by studying populations that migrate through oil and gas fields or alternative energy facilities. Extraction of minerals, including precious metals and lithium, is increasing rapidly in remote areas, which results in dramatically altered landscapes in areas of resident populations of wildlife. Our goal was to examine how a resident population of American pronghorn ( Antilocapra americana ) in the Great Basin ecosystem selected resources near a large-scale disturbance year around. We investigated how individuals selected resources around a large, open-pit gold mine. We classified levels of disturbance associated with the mine, and used a random forest model to select ecological covariates associated with habitat selection by pronghorn. We used resource selection functions to examine how disturbances affected habitat selection by pronghorn both annually and seasonally. Pronghorn strongly avoided areas of high disturbance, which included open pits, heap leach fields, rock disposal areas, and a tram. Pronghorn selected areas near roads, although selection was strongest about 2 km away. We observed relatively broad variation among individuals in selection of resources, and how they responded to the mine. The Great Basin is a mineral -rich area that continues to be exploited for natural resources, especially minerals. Sagebrush -dependent species, including pronghorn, that rely on this critical habitat were directly affected by that transformation of the landscape, which is likely to increase with expansion of the mine. As extraction of minerals from remote landscapes around the world continues to fragment habitats for wildlife, increasing our understanding of impacts of those changes on behaviors of wildlife before populations decline, may assist in the mitigation and minimization of negative impacts on mineral -rich landscapes and on wildlife populations.

AB  - Heathland vegetation has undergone significant changes in the past century, e.g., due to airborne pollutants and a lack of proper management. Understanding the interactions between these factors in combination is pivotal for heathland conservation. Here, we studied the vegetation changes at a dune heath in a four-year manipulation experiment analysing the combined effects of nitrogen deposition, mowing, and deer grazing. Our results showed no significant effect of nitrogen deposition and deer grazing on plant growth and cover of dwarf shrubs within the experimental plots. However, high loads of nitrogen decreased bryophyte cover and increased the growth and cover of sand sedge Carex arenaria L. Mowing adversely affected the dwarf shrub community, e.g., the dwarf shrub species crowberry Empetrum nigrum L., and facilitated increased cover and plant growth of graminoids. Plant growth and the cover of C. arenaria increased in plots without deer grazing, whereas bryophyte cover decreased significantly without grazing. We do not recommend intensive mowing of vegetation as a conservation method for dune heaths because it promotes graminoids. From a conservation aspect, it is essential to consider the effect of deer on heathlands because they both impede some species and benefit others and mitigate the adverse effects of nitrogen deposition on dune heaths.

AB  - Woody encroachment in savannas represents an ecological process of current global interest given its negative impact on ecosystem functioning, particularly on forage production. Traditional savanna models propose competition and niche differentiation as the main mechanisms allowing tree-grass coexistence. Demographic models, instead, propose abiotic and biotic factors as bottlenecks controlling vital rates and transitions from seeds to adult trees. The role played by domestic grazing on woody encroachment is yet controversial. Here, using a multistage tree life approach, we combine both models and evaluate the role of grazing and herbaceous vegetation on woody recruitment in a Neotropical savanna dominated by Vachellia caven, a successful and widely spread encroacher tree species. We performed three experiments to evaluate seed predation, seedling emergence and survival of V. caven by manipulating cattle grazing (grazed and ungrazed areas) and herbaceous vegetation presence (vegetated and unvegetated). Finally, we combined the results of the three experiments to estimate the probability of plant recruitment across these experimental factors. Grazing decreased seed predation by half, did not modify seedling emergence and decreased seedling survival. Herbaceous vegetation did not affect seed predation nor seedling emergence rate, but increased seedling survival. Overall, the net effect of grazing on V. caven recruitment was neutral since the increase in seed availability due to the reduction in seed predation rate was compensated by the negative effect of grazing on seedling survival. Our analysis revealed that cattle grazing and herbaceous vegetation had contrasting effects on the seed and seedling life stages. We propose that in order to restrain the early stages of encroachment, cattle grazing pressure could be managed following the seasonality of demographic tree transitions. Through rotational grazing amongst paddocks, stocking rates could be relaxed during the primary dispersal stage to maximize granivory, and then increased to enhance the chance of seedling consumption and trampling.

AB  - In many disturbed terrestrial landscapes, a subset of native generalist vertebrates thrives. The population trends of these disturbance-tolerant species may be driven by multiple factors, including habitat preferences, foraging opportunities (including crop raiding or human refuse), lower mortality when their predators are persecuted (the 'human shield' effect) and reduced competition due to declines of disturbance-sensitive species. A pronounced elevation in the abundance of disturbance-tolerant wildlife can drive numerous cascading impacts on food webs, biodiversity, vegetation structure and people in coupled human-natural systems. There is also concern for increased risk of zoonotic disease transfer to humans and domestic animals from wildlife species with high pathogen loads as their abundance and proximity to humans increases. Here we use field data from 58 landscapes to document a supra-regional phenomenon of the hyperabundance and community dominance of Southeast Asian wild pigs and macaques. These two groups were chosen as prime candidates capable of reaching hyperabundance as they are edge adapted, with gregarious social structure, omnivorous diets, rapid reproduction and high tolerance to human proximity. Compared to intact interior forests, population densities in degraded forests were 148% and 87% higher for wild boar and macaques, respectively. In landscapes with >60% oil palm coverage, wild boar and pig-tailed macaque estimated abundances were 337% and 447% higher than landscapes with <1% oil palm coverage, respectively, suggesting marked demographic benefits accrued by crop raiding on calorie-rich food subsidies. There was extreme community dominance in forest landscapes with >20% oil palm cover where two pig and two macaque species accounted for >80% of independent camera trap detections, leaving 1 kg considered. Establishing the population trends of pigs and macaques is imperative since they are linked to cascading impacts on the fauna and flora of local forest ecosystems, disease and human health, and economics (i.e., crop losses). The severity of potential negative cascading effects may motivate control efforts to achieve ecosystem integrity, human health and conservation objectives. Our review concludes that the rise of native generalists can be mediated by specific types of degradation, which influences the ecology and conservation of natural areas, creating both positive and detrimental impacts on intact ecosystems and human society.

AB  - ContextMediterranean landscapes are undergoing severe transformations (land-use change and homogenization) that threatens biodiversity and the services these ecosystems provide. These effects can differ amongst biodiversity facets (plants vs. birds, taxonomic vs. functional) and ecosystem functions (e.g., seed dispersal, forest regeneration, pest control), although these are still poorly understood in Mediterranean landscapes.ObjectivesOur study aims at understanding how Mediterranean landscape characteristics and land use (tree croplands, shrublands and pine, oak and mixed forest) affect the diversity of birds and plants, and how these changes in biodiversity could affect ecosystem functioning.MethodsIn 2020-2021, we sampled 49 (5 x 5 m) plots in South-eastern Spain and from five different land uses: tree croplands, shrublands, and pine, oak and mixed forests. We measured land use, habitat diversity and size, together with birds and plant diversity. We assessed both direct and indirect (via bird and plant diversity) effects of landscape characteristics on 6 different ecosystem functions related to forest regeneration, predation, herbivory or aboveground biomass, which imply interactions between birds, plants and their environment.ResultsPlant communities responded mainly to local features (land use), whereas birds did so to habitat size and landscape diversity (within 500 m radius). Seed and caterpillar predation were more affected by bird's diversity, whereas regeneration capacity of woody species was driven by both plants and birds. Land use was amongst the most important drivers of all measured functions, with generally higher functioning levels in oak and mixed forests than in the rest of land uses.ConclusionsOur results emphasize the complementary information obtained when considering multiple biodiversity facets in studying the consequences of landscape transformation. We also show that these multiple biodiversity changes can be as important as those of land-use or landscape characteristics for ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Suitable birth-site habitat is a crucial factor affecting the survival of offspring. The alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster) is an endangered ungulate, native to the Qing-Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas. In order to determine the birth-site habitat selection of alpine musk deer, we measured and compared 16 ecological variables recorded through transect survey in Xinglongshan National Nature Reserve from July to August, 2021. The results showed that alpine musk deer preferred habitat with higher elevation (2619.67 m +/- 22.28 m), steeper slope (35.06 degrees +/- 1.72 degrees), higher arbor canopy (37.67%+/- 6.50%), shrub canopy (55.00%+/- 2.02%), ground-plant cover (83.19%+/- 3.71%), and number of fallen trees (0.18 +/- 0.08 /plot). The ecological variables affecting birth-site habitat selection were ranked according to contribution values as follows: shrub canopy, ground-plant cover, number of fallen trees and slope, which was supported by 79.9% correct discrimination rate. Furthermore, alpine musk deer preferred habitat with good concealment (60.61%), minor human activity interference (63.64%) and closer distance to the nearest water source (87.88%). The birth-site habitat selection of alpine musk deer is a comprehensive trade-off of their ecological needs, including security, food availability and water resource. Therefore, reducing the human activities interference and protecting forest edges in altitude of birth-site habitat are conductive to improve the habitat suitability of alpine musk deer.

AB  - Trees in cities perform important environmental functions: they produce oxygen, filter pollutants, provide habitat for wildlife, mitigate stormwater runoff, and reduce the effects of climate change, especially in terms of lowering temperatures and converting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into stored carbon. Generally, to increase the environmental benefits of urban forests, the number of trees is increased, directly influencing the canopy coverage. However, little is known about potential of modifying the species composition of urban tree communities in order to increase ecological benefits. Planting and managing trees to increase canopy is particularly challenging in city centres, where the dense, often historic infrastructure of buildings and roads do not allow for a significant increase in greenspace. Estimations of canopy cover obtained through i-Tree Canopy analysis unveiled significant potential to increase canopy cover in historical urban areas in Polish cities from 1534% to 31-51%. This study models the ecological benefits of urban forests in Polish cities, focusing on how different species compositions can enhance environmental functions such as carbon sequestration and pollution filtration. Two main scenarios were analyzed: one involving the addition of trees based on the most common species currently planted ("standard option" SO), and another incorporating changes to the species composition to enhance ecological benefits ("city specific option" SCO). Acer platanoides (14.5%) and Tilia cordata (11.45%) were the most frequently species of Polish cities. Betula pendula, , Quercus robur, , Robinia pseudoacacia, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer pseudoplatanus, Aesculus hippocastanum and Acer campestre were also common species in urban forest communities (up to 5%). The diverse range of tree species in Polish cities contributes significantly to the overall carbon sequestration potential. The results suggest that modifying species composition could significantly increase carbon sequestration rates by 47.8%-114% annually, with the city specific option (SCO) being the most effective in enhancing carbon sequestration potential. This highlights the importance of strategic species selection in urban forestry practices to maximize environmental benefits and mitigate climate change effects.

AB  - Biotic complexity, encompassing both competitive interactions within trophic levels and consumptive interactions among trophic levels, plays a fundamental role in maintaining ecosystem stability. While theory and experiments have established that plant diversity enhances ecosystem stability, the role of consumers in the diversity-stability relationships remains elusive. In a decade-long grassland biodiversity experiment, we investigated how heterotrophic consumers (e.g., insects and fungi) interact with plant diversity to affect the temporal stability of plant community biomass. Plant diversity loss reduces community stability due to increased synchronisation among species but enhances the population-level stability of the remaining plant species. Reducing trophic complexity via pesticide treatments does not directly affect either community- or population-level stability but further amplifies plant species synchronisation. Our findings demonstrate that the loss of arthropod or fungal consumers can destabilise plant communities by exacerbating synchronisation, underscoring the crucial role of trophic complexity in maintaining ecological stability.

AB  - Grazing is one of the most important forms of terrestrial use, and the soil microbial community plays an important role in nutrient cycling and biodiversity maintenance of grazing grassland, but the response of soil bacterial and fungal communities alpha-diversity to grazing and the potential mechanisms of grazing-induced soil microbial change have not been well synthesized. We conducted a meta-analysis of 87 pairs of globally distributed observations from 35 published papers to investigate the response of the soil microbial community to grazing and the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that light grazing increased the soil bacterial community Shannon index by 2.4%, but the soil fungal Shannon index decreased by 21.4%. Yak (Bos grunniens) grazing significantly increased the soil bacterial and fungal Shannon index by 1.5% and 11.3%, respectively. Grazing duration of 5-10 years increased the soil bacterial Chao1 index by 9.1% and fungal Chao1 and evenness indexes by 11.3% and 30.4%, respectively. In areas with <400 mm of precipitation, grazing decreased the soil bacterial Simpson index, and in areas of >= 400 mm, grazing also reduced the soil bacterial Simpson and increased the fungal richness and evenness. A linear analysis between soil microbial alpha-diversity indexes and other related variables showed that soil bacterial and fungal communities alpha-diversity and abundance under grazing conditions were significantly and positively correlated with grassland vegetation, soil pH, soil water content (SWC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), organic carbon (SOC), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), suggesting that changes in microbial communities were the combined result of grazing-induced vegetation and soil changes. Our results revealed the effects of grazing on soil bacterial and fungal alpha-diversity and their underlying mechanisms, which provide a basis for advocating moderate grazing and studying grassland management practices.

AB  - Riparian forests have declined around the world over the past century. This is mostly attributed to alteration of river flow regimes and abstraction of alluvial groundwater, although in Africa damage from elephants is often considered the primary cause. Large stands of riparian forest along the Limpopo River in Mapungubwe National Park (South Africa) were transformed to woodland between 1990 and 2005, and water stress resulting from reduced river flows and abstraction, an extreme flood and canopy infestation by climbing plants were identified as contributing causes. Recent recolonization of the area by elephant has created an additional potential driver of mortality. To determine if tree losses have continued and gain further insights into the causes - particularly the relative importance of water stress versus debarking by elephant - tagged trees were surveyed annually from 2011 to 2022. Rates of mortality were higher than in the previous decade for four of the five dominant tree species. Bank erosion from flooding remained a cause but accounted for far less mortality than in the past. For individuals not lost to floods, survival analysis indicated that low rainfall was the primary driver of mortality. Canopy infestation by climbers did not decrease survival, and while elephant damage was common for all species and most likely killed some individuals, it had far less effect than our measures of water availability. Isotopic analysis of xylem, soil, river and groundwater revealed few differences in source water use between species, and marginal contributions from the alluvial aquifer. All species relied on deep soil water, illustrating a key linkage between rainfall and survival under the current hydrological regime. Persistence of the remaining large trees at this site is highly unlikely, considering the altered flow regime of the river and likelihood that future climate change will exacerbate water stress. Given the degree of ecosystem change over the past four decades, future conservation should shift focus to the recruitment and establishment of other large tree species, particularly those tolerant of water stress and elephant browsing.

AB  - Elephants play a significant role in shaping tropical ecosystems. They influence the dispersal and regeneration of various plant species and thus shape plant and animal communities. In this study, we investigate seed predation rates by the African elephant on the torchwood forest tree (Balanites maughamii) in a part of the Arabuko Sokoke dry coastal forest in southern Kenya. We test for effects on the germination and seedling growth rates in ex situ experiments and consider the role of passing through the elephant gut and the effect of elephant dung on germination. Seed predation rates were highest close to parent trees. Seeds that passed through elephant guts had the highest germination and growth rates. Seeds enclosed by dung did not show higher rates of germination than seeds without dung. In general, our results underline the important role of elephants for seed dispersal and germination of B. maughamii in tropical forest ecosystems.

AB  - Mistletoes increase understorey resource heterogeneity by altering animal visitations, litterfall, and soil moisture, thus support diverse understorey plants. However, their impact on understorey species composition and diversity in protected areas with small to large-sized herbivores remains unclear. We compared grass and woody species under mistletoe-uninfected and infected marula (Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra) trees in the Sabie and Sabi Sand Game Reserves, with differing mean annual rainfall, 500 mm and 610 mm, respectively. Species composition varied slightly between sites and with infection level. Total species evenness was 8% higher in the wetter site, where woody species diversity indices were up to 52% higher. In contrast, grass species richness and diversity were up to 33% higher in the drier site. Functional dissimilarity (FDis), Functional divergence (FDiv), and Rao's quadratic entropy (RaoQ) were up to 23% higher in the wetter site. Infected trees had 4% greater total cover abundance, and 32% higher woody species richness than uninfected trees. Additionally, eight woody and five grass species were exclusive to infected trees, compared to two woody and three grass species under uninfected trees indicating mistletoephily. RaoQ was 8% lower beneath uninfected than infected trees. Tree height significantly influenced total cover abundance and evenness and grass species richness and evenness. Overall, rainfall had a greater effect than mistletoe infection on understorey plants, suggesting moisture limitations and that mistletoe effects are additive. Thus, by enhancing resource availability and supporting mistletoephily, the interaction of mistletoes with other factors such as rainfall influence plant heterogeneity in these low-altitude semi-arid savannas.

AB  - Introduction Most Central European grasslands crucially depend on land use, and thus there is a need to comparatively analyse the impacts of different types of land use management on grassland biota. Aims and methods We use grasshoppers (Orthoptera), which are the most important insect herbivores in grasslands, and assess the differences of grazing (sheep) and mowing on species abundance, richness, and composition. We use a river embankment in the National Park Donau Auen as study site, where we have established 28 transects. Orthoptera abundance was surveyed 13 times between May and September 2019 in each transect. Results We recorded 24 Orthoptera species, of which 12 species are listed in the national Red List. The most abundant non-threatened species is Pseudochorthippus parallelus in mown transects, while in grazed transects Euchorthippus declivus is most abundant. Eight of the ten most abundant Orthoptera species differed significantly in abundance between mown and grazed transects. Total abundance of Orthoptera was higher in mown transects, while grazed transects had higher species richness. Most xero-thermophilic species were more abundant in grazed transects, while some species of mesic grassland were more abundant in mown transects. These species-level differences resulted in clearly separated Orthoptera species assemblages between grazed and mown transects. Our findings suggest that the less dense vegetation in grazed transects better fulfilled the habitat requirements of xero-thermophilic species compared to mown transects Discussion Given that mown and grazed transects are located adjacent to each other, that the complete study site was mown for many decades and grazing was only started one year before field data collection, the scale of differences in species richness, composition and abundances between grazed and mown transects is surprising. Thus, our findings indicate that grasshoppers respond rapidly to changing land use. Implications for insect conservation We conclude that river embankments can be important secondary habitats for species-rich grasshopper communities. We recommend that grazing should be continued at the river embankment, ideally as rotational pasture as currently done. Mowing should be changed towards mowing parts of the river embankment at different times and leaving small strips of vegetation unmown.

AB  - Wildlife models focused solely on a single strong influence (e.g., habitat components, wildlife harvest) are limited in their ability to detect key mechanisms influencing population change. Instead, we propose integrated modeling in the context of cumulative effects assessment using multispecies population dynamics models linked to landscape-climate simulation at large spatial and temporal scales. We developed an integrated landscape and population simulation model using ALCES Online as the model-building platform, and the model accounted for key ecological components and relationships among moose (Alces alces), grey wolves (Canis lupus nubilus), and woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in northern Ontario, Canada. We simulated multiple scenarios over 5 decades (beginning 2020) to explore sensitivity to climate change and land use and assessed effects at multiple scales. The magnitude of effect and the relative importance of key factors (climate change, roads, and habitat) differed depending on the scale of assessment. Across the full extent of the study area (654,311km(2) [ecozonal scale]), the caribou population declined by 26% largely because of climate change and associated predator-prey response, which led to caribou range recession in the southern part of the study area. At the caribou range scale (108,378 km(2)), which focused on 2 herds in the northern part of the study area, climate change led to a 10% decline in the population and development led to an additional 7% decline. At the project scale (8,331 km(2)), which was focused more narrowly on the landscape surrounding 4 proposed mines, the caribou population declined by 29% largely in response to simulated development. Given that observed caribou population dynamics were sensitive to the cumulative effects of climate change, land use, interspecific interactions, and scale, insights from the analysis might not emerge under a less complex model. Our integrated modeling framework provides valuable support for broader regional assessments, including estimation of risk to caribou and Indigenous food security, and for developing and evaluating potential caribou recovery strategies.

AB  - Plant diversity can increase productivity. One mechanism behind this biodiversity effect is facilitation, which is when one species increases the performance of another species. Plants with extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) establish defense mutualisms with ants. However, whether EFN plants facilitate defense of neighboring non-EFN plants is unknown. Synthesizing data on ants, herbivores, leaf damage, and defense traits from a forest biodiversity experiment, we show that trees growing adjacent to EFN trees had higher ant biomass and species richness and lower caterpillar biomass than conspecific controls without EFN-bearing neighbors. Concurrently, the composition of defense traits in non-EFN trees changed. Thus, when non-EFN trees benefit from lower herbivore loads as a result of ants spilling over from EFN tree neighbors, this may allow relatively reduced resource allocation to defense in the former, potentially explaining the higher growth of those trees. Via this mutualist-mediated facilitation, promoting EFN trees in tropical reforestation could foster carbon capture and multiple other ecosystem functions.

AB  - Tree diversity is a key factor that explains the variation in the composition of insect herbivores in the canopy, but for temperate ecosystems has been little study. Mexico has some geographical zones that are rich in oak species, coexisting between two and up to six species locally. Considering the associational effects such as vegetation complexity and the characteristics of neighboring plants, we evaluated whether communities of more diverse oak species harbor greater diversity of canopy insect herbivores, increasing the herbivory rates through changes in foliar chemical defense in Quercus laurina. Five study sites were selected representing a gradient of oak diversity. Five mature Q. laurina trees were selected per site to collect canopy phytophagous insects using fogging techniques and foliar chemical defense and herbivory were measured collecting leaves from the canopy. We found 3693 insects associated to Q. laurina trees along the oak diversity gradient were collected, where Tequila Volcano had the greatest diversity of herbivorous insects and oak species. Also, the highest rates of herbivory were in the sites with more oak diversity, as well positive relationships between chemical defense and herbivore community. Our findings indicate that at a local scale, oak diversity is the main factor determining insect herbivore diversity; the levels of herbivory and foliar chemical composition of Q. laurina. We highlight the importance of conservation zones with a high diversity of oaks, being key elements of the temperate forest that harbor high diversity of herbivore insects driving the plant-insect interactions.

AB  - Climate change and habitat loss are recognized as important drivers of shifts in wildlife species' geographic distributions. While often considered independently, there is considerable overlap between these drivers, and understanding how they contribute to range shifts can predict future species assemblages and inform effective management. Our objective was to evaluate the impacts of habitat, climatic, and anthropogenic effects on the distributions of climate-sensitive vertebrates along a southern range boundary in Northern Michigan, USA. We combined multiple sources of occurrence data, including harvest and citizen-science data, then used hierarchical Bayesian spatial models to determine habitat and climatic associations for four climate-sensitive vertebrate species (American marten [Martes americana], snowshoe hare [Lepus americanus], ruffed grouse [Bonasa umbellus] and moose [Alces alces]). We used total basal area of at-risk forest types to represent habitat, and temperature and winter habitat indices to represent climate. Marten associated with upland spruce-fir and lowland riparian forest types, hares with lowland conifer and aspen-birch, grouse with lowland riparian hardwoods, and moose with upland spruce-fir. Species differed in climatic drivers with hares positively associated with cooler annual temperatures, moose with cooler summer temperatures and grouse with colder winter temperatures. Contrary to expectations, temperature variables outperformed winter habitat indices. Model performance varied greatly among species, as did predicted distributions along the southern edge of the Northwoods region. As multiple species were associated with lowland riparian and upland spruce-fir habitats, these results provide potential for efficient prioritization of habitat management. Both direct and indirect effects from climate change are likely to impact the distribution of climate-sensitive species in the future and the use of multiple data types and sources in the modelling of species distributions can result in more accurate predictions resulting in improved management at policy-relevant scales.

AB  - Biotic interactions are important to the structure and dynamics of food webs and may affect the spatial and temporal distribution of species. In the Arctic, spring snow-cover limits food avail-ability at a critical time for herbivores, potentially leading to resource competition. This study investigates the potential for competition over forage resources during spring in a high-Arctic herbivore community comprising the resident, endemic Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) and Svalbard rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea), and the migratory pink-footed goose (Anser brachyrhynchus) and barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis). First, we investi-gated herbivore behaviour that could indicate the potential for competition by conducting a field study, and second, we quantified the effects of snow-cover extent, vegetation type and presence of potential herbivore competitors on the spatiotemporal distributions of herbivores using camera-traps in one early and one late snow melt year. Only reindeer and geese appeared with sufficient sample sizes for analysis. The field study revealed that reindeer and geese foraged in the same areas, particularly moss tundra habitats. Although geese were regularly alerted by reindeer, no direct aggressive interactions were observed. The camera-trap study showed that neither of the herbivores significantly affected the spatiotemporal distribution of its potential competitor, but reindeer and goose distribution was instead driven by snow-cover extent and vegetation type. However, the shared space use by these species may lead to different types of interactions, such as facilitation or exploitative competition, which require further assessment, including dietary overlap studies, particularly in the context of climate change-induced shifts in snow melt timing and herbivore abundances.

AB  - The urgency of restoring ecosystems over vast areas has placed rewilding using wild herbivores at the forefront. However, few scientific studies address its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning compared to more traditional conservation interventions with domestic herbivores. Equus ferus przewalskii horses introduced 30 years ago in the National Park of Ce<acute accent>vennes, France - as a step of a conservation program of the species for its reintroduction in Mongolia - now occur as a semi-wild horse population, socially natural (i.e., management is based on natural selection). This introduction allowed us to compare this management system ('as wild') with other breeding systems: domestic sheep or domestic horses. Rewilding projects especially focus on the restoration of ecological functions, we therefore sought to find out if there are differences in the functional traits of the vegetation depending on the grazer and its management (domestic vs 'as wild') with the aim to generalize our results to other rewilding projects. Two levels of organization were tested (1) plant communities - using the TRY database and botanical surveys and (2) plant populations - by selecting four indicator species with traits measured in situ. Our results show that at equivalent grazing pressure, domestic horses or 'as wild' horses preserve the same plant functional types as in the traditional reference ecosystem grazed by sheep. Whatever the grazer and its management, grassland plant communities are characterized and dominated by perennial polycarpic plants, with oligotrophic to mesotrophic nutrient requirement, hemicryptophytes, graminoids, plants with entire leaf blades, not spiny, erect and mainly forming tussock. Nevertheless, some interesting significant differences were measured between the plant communities growing under the three types of grazing (e.g., lower functional richness and more plants with entire leaf blade under sheep grazing). Even between horse sub-species, differences were significant for some traits (e.g., more chamaephyte species growing under 'as wild' horses), which could be linked to physiological and morphological differences between the two horses sub-species (e.g., nutritional requirements, herbivore size) and by herd management. However, the intraspecific variability on the four quantitative traits measured on four indicator species do not show a general pattern. Although these results are valid at a given time and in a particular ecosystem, the vegetation functional traits approach can help in decision-making regarding ecosystem management choices and highlight the fact that the 'as wild' management adds an interesting alternative to conservation.

AB  - Nature-based solutions are attracting interest for their potential to enlist ecological processes as cost-effective and safe ways to capture and store carbon in forest ecosystems. Such solutions often need to be implemented in landscapes in which there are longer established values for other ecosystem services including wildlife and timber production. Here we develop an integrative model that illustrates the inherent trade-offs that will arise among the competing values for landscape space and how to resolve them. The analysis characterizes boreal forest ecosystem dynamics involving interactions among the main trophic compartments of an intact boreal ecosystem, aka "nature." The model accounts for carbon accumulation via biomass growth of forest trees (timber), carbon loss due to controls from moose herbivory that varies with moose population density (hunting), and soil carbon inputs and release, which together determine the carbon sink strength of the ecosystem. We link the ecological dynamics with an economic analysis by assigning a price to carbon stored within the intact boreal forest ecosystem. We then weigh these carbon impacts against the economic benefits of timber production and hunting across a range of moose population densities. Combined, this carbon-bioeconomic program calculates the total ecosystem benefit of a modeled boreal forest system, providing a framework for examining how different forest harvest and moose densities influence the achievement of carbon storage targets, under different levels of carbon pricing. The analysis shows that promoting nature-based solutions merely for carbon storage may result in loss of a key part of "nature" via loss of the trophic structure and key functional controls in the ecosystem.

AB  - An evolutionary significant unit of the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica), the Pyrenean ibex or "bucardo" (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica) became extinct in its natural range, the Pyrenees, at the beginning of the twentieth-first century. Several years later (2014-2021) more than 250 specimens (C. p. victoriae) coming from the same donor population from central Spain were released in four localities of the French Pyrenees. Despite an initial fast demographic increase, the genetic variability of these populations remains low. Moreover, it is expected that genetic variability continues to decline due to genetic drift and that inbreeding accumulates. Here we revise options for genetic rescue or reinforcement of these populations involving future release of animals from different extant Spanish populations, mainly those belonging to the subpecies C. p. hispanica. The future hy-bridization between both phenotypes or "subspecies" may occur anyways in the next years, since currently there is a natural expansion of C. P. hispanica populations from the southern Pyrenees (Spanish side).

AB  - Conversion from natural forest to timber plantation is an important cause of pristine forests loss. These changes alter community structure and cause a decrease in the diversity of plant communities. Leaf functional traits, which are an important defensive strategy, might also be influenced by such alterations. Altogether, shifts from natural forest to timber plantation may lead to profound changes in plant-plant and plant-animal interactions, including herbivory and the relative abundance of different feeding guilds, an important aspect of forest ecosystem function and community dynamics. In this study, we assessed insect herbivore damage in saplings of four native tree species in the understory of natural forests and two types of ca. 80-year-old timber plantations. We measured leaf damage by the most common feeding guilds in over 9000 leaves from 200 saplings. We first compared herbivory between natural forest and plantations, and we then analyzed the drivers of herbivory and of the two most common guilds - chewers and miners - using several indices of forest structure and leaf traits as predictors. Total herbivory did not change among forest types, but it showed some variation in two of the four species. Herbivory decreased with increasing species richness and increased with increasing basal area of conspecific and heterospecific trees. Leaf damage caused by chewers increased with leaf thickness, while damage caused by miners showed the opposite relationship. On an ecological level, our findings support expectations from the resource concentration hypothesis and on the role of leaf traits in mediating the impact of insect feeding guilds on leaf herbivory. On an applied level, these results suggest that timber plantations can support similar levels of ecosystem processes than natural forests decades after their establishment. Allowing the regeneration of a diverse understory in plantation forests should be implemented to favor ecosystem dynamics close to those of the original forests.

AB  - Mediterranean environments are characterized by strong intra- and inter-annual fluctuations in plant primary production, which are likely to regulate the carrying capacity and density-dependent responses of ungulate populations. These effects may, however, vary across spatial and temporal scales. Habitat heterogeneity, particularly when associated to differentiated phenological responses, may allow wild ungulates to mitigate temporal fluctuations in plant production by using different resources along the year. In this work, we use a 15-years dataset (including remote-sensing data on vegetation distribution, phenology and production, as well as ungulate population counts) to assess how temporal variability in plant primary production and livestock abundance influence the population dynamics of two wild ungulates: native red deer, Cervus elaphus, and introduced fallow deer, Dama dama. Results show that temporal alternation in the phenological cycles of the four different vegetation types increased plant production, thus food availability for ungulates, within each year. Furthermore, complementarity in the responses of different vegetation types to variations in the amount and timing of rainfall increased the predictability of food availability across different years. This complementarity effect was further increased by the contrasting responses of ungulate populations to variation in the production of different vegetation types. Furthermore, domestic ungulates had positive effects on wild ungulate density at low to intermediate abundances, but high livestock densities decreased ungulate density and constrained the stability of the plant-ungulate system in response to the impact of climatic variation, particularly under climate change. Our findings deepen the knowledge on vegetation-ungulate interactions in Mediterranean areas, potentially contributing to develop better management strategies of ungulate populations and adapt them to ongoing climate change.

AB  - Boreal peatlands of Alberta (Canada) are heavily dissected by a large network of linear disturbances, including seismic lines used for Oil and Gas exploration. Edge effects resulting from these linear disturbances can increase their footprint and affect wildlife habitat, including the quality and quantity of plant and lichen forage. In 2012, seismic line restoration became a priority in Alberta, under the realm of restoration of habitat of threatened boreal woodland caribou. More accurate understanding of biotic and abiotic interactions leading to edge effects can be important in choosing appropriate restoration practices and prompting natural regeneration. We assessed the extent of edge effects of seismic lines on the adjacent boreal peatland near Peace River, northwestern Alberta. We compared plant and lichen community composition and environmental conditions on seismic lines and along 22 transects, which extended perpendicularly 75 m into the peatland from both lines edges. Soil moisture and light were higher on the lines, but frozen ground was less frequent than in the adjacent peatland. Seismic lines were also subsided by approximately 1.2 cm. Lichens were less abundant in the 2-25 m zone from the edge-indicating edge effects. On the lines, Sphagnum constituted a nearly 100% cover while lichens, trees, herbs, and other bryophytes were less abundant than in the peatland. We demonstrate how knowledge of edge effects on plants and lichens could be applied in assessing caribou habitat quality based on forage availability and predation risk, and how such knowledge could inform restoration practices of seismic lines in peatlands.

AB  - Urban environments may offer certain species diverse and abundant food resources of natural and anthropogenic origin. However, the local-scale configuration of habitats and urban infrastructure may influence foraging decisions regardless of the availability of food. In recent years, the expansion of wild boar Sus scrofa into areas significantly transformed by humans has been observed in many parts of its range. Grubbing (rooting) is a major foraging mode of the species, during which disturbance of the upper soil layers enables these animals to find and consume food items. However, the factors that determine the selection of grubbing sites in the urban landscape, where the balance between food availability and the avoidance of humans may influence foraging decisions, are not known. Our aim was to identify local-scale factors that influence grubbing site selection and the size of grubbed patches in an urban landscape. The characteristics of 108 wild boar grubbing sites in the city of Krakow (Poland) were compared to randomly selected control sites. The probable presence of a grubbing site was positively correlated with the proportion of meadows and fallow land in the vicinity and with increases in both canopy cover and distance to pavements. The size of a grubbed patch was positively correlated with the percentage of meadows in the vicinity, increasing distance to buildings and decreasing distance to pavements. We found a non-random pattern of grubbing sites in the urban landscape and indicated that the local-scale configuration of vegetation and urban infrastructure contribute to foraging site selection by wild boar. Our study highlights that the encroachment of wildlife into the urban landscape is a complex process, driven by both resource availability and the avoidance of human-related disturbances.

AB  - Ungulate herbivory, a widespread and complex disturbance, shapes grassland biodiversity and functions primarily through three mechanisms: defoliation, trampling, and excreta return. However, the specific effects of these mechanisms on soil biodiversity and community assembly remain unclear. We conducted a 4-yr factorial experiment in the Eurasian steppe to investigate how defoliation, trampling, and excreta return influence soil bacterial, fungal, and nematode beta-diversity and community assembly under moderate- and high-density ungulate grazing scenarios. Our findings reveal that herbivores affect soil biota through multiple pathways at different grazing intensities. Specifically, selective defoliation in the moderate-density scenario promoted stochastic community assembly of nematodes and fungi by increasing the specific root length of plant communities. Excreta return encouraged stochastic bacterial communities by carbon input, while urine-induced acidification and elevated ammonium levels promoted environmental filtering of bacteria and nematodes. In the high-density scenario, non-selective defoliation and heavy trampling created harsher soil conditions, reducing bacterial and nematode beta-diversity via habitat filtering and diminishing association of soil biota with plant roots. This study explored how different components of ungulate behaviour influence soil community assembly and highlighted the crucial role of root traits in mediating soil biota responses, providing insights into the mechanisms of soil biodiversity maintenance under complex disturbances.

AB  - Herbivore-induced changes in both leaf silicon-based defence and nutrient levels are potential mechanisms through which grazers alter the quality of their own grass supply. In tundra grasslands, herbivores have been shown to increase nutrient contents of grasses; yet, it is an open question whether they also increase grass silicon-based defence levels. Here, we asked if, and to what extent, herbivores affect silicon content and silicon:nutrient ratios of grasses found in tundra grasslands. We performed an herbivore-interaction field-experiment spanning four tundra-grassland sites. At each site, we established reindeer-open and reindeer-exclusion plots in tundra-patches that had been disturbed or not by small rodents during the previous winter, for a total of 96 plots. We randomly collected over 1,150 leaf samples of inherently silicon-rich and silicon-poor grass species throughout a growing season and analysed silicon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents of each leaf. Small-rodent winter disturbance did not affect grass silicon content, but increased grass quality (i.e. lowered silicon:nutrient ratios) by enhancing nutrient levels of both silicon-rich (+20%-22%) and silicon-poor (+26%-34%) grasses. Reindeer summer herbivory increased the quality of silicon-rich grasses by decreasing their silicon content (-7%). However, the two herbivores together offset both these quality increments in silicon-rich grasses, thus reducing their quality towards the level of those found in the absence of herbivores and further enhancing their silicon:nutrient ratios (+13%-22%) relative to silicon-poor grasses. Synthesis. We provide the first community-level, field-based assessment of how herbivory-driven changes in both leaf silicon-based defence and nutrient levels alter grass-forage quality in tundra grasslands. Herbivores did not promote a net silicon accumulation in grasses, but rather enhanced their overall quality. Yet, the magnitude of these quality increments varied depending on the herbivore(s) involved and differed between silicon-rich and silicon-poor grasses. Such differential herbivory-induced changes in grass quality between and within tundra-patches may mediate plant-herbivore interactions by altering herbivore forage patterns and food choices. In tundra-patches utilised by both herbivores, the quality of silicon-rich grasses was further decreased relative to that of silicon-poor grasses. This could provide an advantage against herbivory, potentially being one of the pathways through which tundra-grassland vegetation states dominated by silicon-rich grasses are maintained by herbivores.

AB  - Positive productivity-diversity relationships, pest-effect mitigation and increased resilience and stability maintain an ongoing interest for mixed stands in forestry. However, how mixing species affects forest regeneration is yet to be further explored.
   We used data from the French National Forest Inventory (from 2006 to 2016) to model Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl regeneration cover in pure and mixed Quercus petraea stands; we included the effects of abiotic and biotic factors as well as mixture. We hypothesized that the characteristics of the companion species would prevent or facilitate the regeneration of oak.
   Quercus petraea regeneration cover in this study responded negatively to total canopy cover and herbivory pressure. Mean July potential evapotranspiration (PET), mean December maximal temperature and soil pH are variables whose spatial variations over a given territory structure regeneration cover; all three of these variables have optimum values. Quercus petraea regeneration cover is linked to the proportion of Quercus petraea in the canopy layer in all mixed stands, except when the oak is mixed with shade-intolerant conifers: in this case, Quercus petraea regeneration is enhanced. The shade tolerance of admixed broadleaved species did not affect the Quercus petraea regeneration. This suggests that oak regeneration was facilitated with a shade-intolerant coniferous companion species due to better light transmittance through the crown or the competitive advantage of Quercus petraea over coniferous shade-intolerant species. These results are of interest for oak mixtures since Quercus petraea regeneration cover benefits from mixtures with shade-intolerant conifers and is at least equal to that of pure stands.

AB  - We surveyed the urial Ovis vignei and Siberian ibex Capra sibirica in the Hindu Kush mountain range of Wakhan National Park in north-eastern Afghanistan to determine their population status and identify potential drivers of population change. We conducted two double-observer ground surveys, in April-May 2015 and 2018, in 10 areas (total = 288 km(2)). Urial herds were mostly composed of both sexes (78% of observed herds), the mean adult sex ratio (females:males) was 100:70, and the mean female:juvenile ratio was 100:53. In 2018 we calculated a urial density of 35/100 km(2), compared to 72/100 km(2) in 2015. Ibex herds were mostly (79%) composed of both sexes, the mean adult sex ratio (females:males) was 100:103, and the mean female:juvenile ratio was 100:58. Ibex density estimates were similar in 2015 and 2018 (c. 250/100 km(2)). We discuss the usefulness of the double-observer methods for ungulate surveys, highlight the value of viewshed calculations and discuss the possible causes of urial population decline. To ensure the conservation of these ungulate populations, we recommend continued regular monitoring, measures to address poaching and research to clarify the taxonomical status of urials in Wakhan.

AB  - Invasive, non-native invasive pests pose a growing threat to urban trees and the services they provide to urban residents. With the reluctance to use chemical insecticides in cities, environmentally friendly methods of pest management are needed. Tree diversity is known to affect insect herbivory in forest, with higher tree species diversity leading to lower level of damage. However, the validity of those findings for a non-native insect in an urban environment remains to be demonstrated. We monitored 54 horse chestnut trees attacked by the invasive horse chestnut leafminer Cameraria ohridella in the city of Bordeaux, France. We analyzed the effects of neighboring tree diversity and density on the abundance, injury and parasitism rate of these leafminers. We showed that the abundance and injuries of C. ohridella significantly increased with higher local tree canopy cover. We found that the parasitism rate of C. ohridella increased with the species diversity of neighboring trees. However, this increase in parasitism rate was not associated with a decrease in leaf area injured. Our results pave the way for the management of exotic insect pests in cities based on the manipulation of spatial distribution and species diversity of urban trees.

AB  - The removal and exclusion of non-native ungulates for conservation of biodiversity is common globally, including on tropical Pacific Islands. However, the poorly quantified effects of ungulate exclusion on fuels and wildfire may represent an important conservation trade-off. We measured fuels (live and dead fuel loads, type, height and continuity) and modelled potential wildfire behaviour (flame height and rate of spread) inside and outside of 13 ungulate exclosures, three of which received active ecological restoration (e.g. planting of native shrubs and trees), across a 2,740 mm mean annual rainfall (MAR) gradient on the Island of Hawaii. Differences in fuel characteristics and modelled wildfire behaviour inside versus outside of ungulate exclosures were assessed using linear mixed effects analyses. Non-native ungulate removal, in general, increased fine fuel loading (average change ranged from -0.7 to 11.3 Mg/ha), shrub fuel loading (-0.1 to 5.6 Mg/ha) and modelled flame lengths (-0.2 to 1.9 m). Post-removal fine fuel loading and modelled flame lengths increased linearly and positively with moisture availability, by as much as 56% in the wettest sites. Dead fine fuels, a key driver of fire intensity and combustion rates, also increased with ungulate removal. Sites undergoing active ecological restoration exhibited reductions in fuel loading, with greater reductions over time since ungulate removal; by the 10th year following ungulate removal, fine fuel loading was reduced at restoration sites by 41%. Synthesis and applications. Dry and mesic environments where wildfire occurrence is more frequent are of particular concern following non-native ungulate removal, but with drought even typically wet environments can be at high risk of wildfire following ungulate removal. Given limited resources, managers in mesic and wet forests might focus first non-native ungulates in non-native grass-dominated areas that contribute disproportionately to wildfire spread and are adjacent to fenced higher value areas, while managers in dry to mesic areas might focus on removing non-native ungulates. Where possible, land managers in all situations should invest in long-term fuel management strategies such as active ecological restoration to reduce fuel loads and the occurrence and intensity of wildfires.

AB  - Grassland degradation is widespread and increasing globally, which is closely related to the sustainable development of the ecosystems and the well-being of human life in pastoral areas. Quantifying the factors influencing grassland ecosystems, specifically climate change and human activities, is of great significance for grassland restoration. However, due to the unpredictability of human activities, further research is still needed to distinguish and identify the factors affecting grasslands. In this study, we examined the changes in the gross primary productivity (GPP) of grassland cover in 10 provinces (autonomous regions) of China from 2000 to 2018 and selected three representative climate factors (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation) and six factors covering socioeconomic (primary industry production and population), animal husbandry (large livestock and sheep populations), and national policies (grazing areas, rodent, and pest control) to characterize human activities; then, we quantified the effects and contribution of climate and human factors using three analysis methods (partial correlation analysis, geographical and temporal weighted regression model, and Lindeman Merenda Gold method). The results indicated that the GPP of grassland presented an obvious uptrend (4.75 g C m(-2) yr(-1), p < 0.05). Among the nine factors, sheep, precipitation, and temperature were the primary factors affecting grassland dynamics. Additionally, the GPP dynamics of grassland were mainly dominated by human activities in seven provinces (autonomous regions). These findings provide decision support for protecting grassland ecosystems and implementing ecological restoration policies in China.

AB  - Resource availability, predator-prey interaction, anthropogenic disturbances, climatic and topographic factors often determine the ecological association of a species with its environment. We measured the ecological association of Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus), and grey junglefowl (Gallus sonneratii), with predator, habitat, and human disturbance using camera traps, following an occupancy modelling framework at the Male Mahadeshwara Hills Wildlife Sanctuary, Karnataka. We collected single-season data from 172 camera trap stations during 30 days. Site occupancy for junglefowl was found to be 0.40 +/- 0.08, whereas for peafowl it was 0.31 +/- 0.06. The detection probability for junglefowl was 0.06 +/- 0.006, and for peafowl, it was 0.08 +/- 0.007. Junglefowl occupancy was negatively associated with tiger (Panthera tigris) abundance because of the difference in the habitat preferences. Contrastingly, relative abundance of leopard (Panthera pardus) and jungle cat (Felis chaus) positively influenced the occupancy of pheasants due to similar habitat preferences and predator-prey interactions. Elevation and tree density were positively associated to Junglefowl occupancy due to the availability of good foliage and climatic conditions. However, occupancy probability of peafowl and detection probability showed negative relationship with tree density and goat-sheep abundance respectively. This indicates that peafowls rely on the undergrowth in open forests, scrub jungles, and cultivation areas, and require understory vegetation for nesting, roosting, and feeding. Our study helps to fill the knowledge gap to understand the ecological interaction of less studied ground-dwelling birds.

AB  - Agricultural activities impact riverine ecosystem structure, function, and processes. In the Afrotropical regions, research on agricultural effects on macroinvertebrate trait distribution is sparse. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal changes in the community structure of macroinvertebrate traits along an agricultural disturbance gradient in an Afrotropical River system. Physicochemical variables were sampled alongside macroinvertebrates at eight sites in the dry (winter and spring) and wet (summer and autumn) periods of 2018-2019. We grouped the sites into four categories using the percentage of agricultural land-use cover within each drainage area. Our results showed that agricultural pollution exhibited varying effects on traits and ecological preferences, with traits such as a predatory lifestyle, medium body-size (>10-20 mm), active swimming, possession of spiracles and haemoglobin, and adult aquatic life stage increasing with the pollution gradient. These traits were positively associated with nutrients (PO4+-P, NO2+-N, NH4+-N and NO3+-N), salinity, turbidity and temperature and were deemed tolerant of agricultural pollution. Shredding, crawling, and a preference for macrophytes as food showed strong positive associations with the least disturbed sites and were negatively associated with increasing nutrients, salinity, turbidity and water temperature. As such, these three traits were considered sensitive to agricultural pollution. The identified indicator traits can be used to predict the survival and distribution patterns of organisms under the impact of agriculture-induced stress.

AB  - Context: Deer (Cervidae) populations are increasing in many global regions, leading to concerns about their impacts on temperate forests. Advancing evidence-based management requires a detailed understanding of the dietary habits of deer and how these are shaped by resource availability. Methodology: We studied the diet of fallow deer (Dama dama) in North Wales (United Kingdom), using faecal DNA metabarcoding. Samples were collected monthly from three woodlands during 2019-2021. Tree surveys and seasonal ground flora surveys were conducted in these woodlands and seven additional woodlands. Preference analyses were used to assess the consumption of plant taxa relative to their availability. Results: The fallow deer consumed high proportions of bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg.) across the seasons, especially in the winter months. Diet diversity was significantly lower in winter compared to the other seasons, suggesting that the deer were bulk foraging on a widely available, predictable resource to conserve energy during winter. Grasses did not form a major component of the diet in any season. The preference analysis showed that spatially clustered woody taxa (e.g. Betula sp., Corylus sp. and Fraxinus sp.) occurred less often than expected in the diet, while widespread woody species occurred in the diet more often than expected (e.g. Rosa sp., Prunus sp. and Quercus sp.). Practical implication: The expansion of deer populations in the United Kingdom has occurred alongside the recovery and maturation of degraded or planted forests since the middle of the 20th century. Despite reduced light availability in these closed-canopy forests and increased herbivory pressure, bramble has remained a dominant understory plant compared to other less herbivory-tolerant plant species. Perhaps as a consequence, bramble has become the winter survival resource for this fallow deer population, remaining a prominent dietary component throughout the year. With increasing disturbance from extreme weather and tree diseases leading to a more open canopy structure, bramble cover is set to increase in European forests, which could support further expansion of deer populations. As we work to expand tree cover and enhance forest resilience and biodiversity, we should seek to understand the dynamic interactions of increasing deer populations with rapidly changing treescapes.

AB  - Tuttuk (caribou (Rangifer tarandus)) populations are in decline across Canada, making them a major conservation concern for Inuit of Nunatsiavut (Northern Labrador) and Nunavik (Northern Quebec). This study investigates changes to caribou forage over 14 years at two tundra sites in northern Nunatsiavut, Labrador. We ask: (1) How much of the total vegetation is suitable caribou forage and how has this changed with time and experimental warming; and (2) which forage species are most affected by recent climate change? At control and warming plots, we identified selected, edible, and avoided caribou forage based on published literature, and modeled observed changes in forage availability. We found that the relative frequency of selected winter forage was lower than summer forage at both sites. Caribou appear to be more forage limited in the winter than summer, and birch (Betula spp.), and ericaceous shrub species (Vaccinium spp.), increased over time. Our research provides valuable insight into recent changes in caribou forage availability and develops a novel methodology that can be applied across other caribou ranges. This knowledge will inform conservation and management measures by helping identify possible forage limitations and can contribute to recovery targets across Nunatsiavut and ultimately the social-ecological resilience of northern communities.

AB  - Despite Africa experiencing a substantial rise in inadequately managed agricultural practices, studies examining the effects of these activities on the functional organisation of macroinvertebrates in tropical streams are underdeveloped. The responses of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPTs) functional feeding groups (FFGs) to agricultural pollution were investigated in the Kat River, Eastern Cape, South Africa, to identify potential FFG indicators. Physicochemical parameters and macroinvertebrates were sampled from eight sites delineated into four land-use impact categories (highly impacted, HIC; impacted category, IC; moderately impacted, MIC; and least impacted, LIC) based on the percentage of agricultural land cover. The Permutational multivariate analyses of variance (PERMANOVA) results revealed land use (F = 4.2, 3.62; p < 0.05) and season (F = 2.89, p < 0.03) influenced FFGs in the river, with shredder abundances decreasing with increasing agricultural stress. Conversely, collectors, predators and scrapers were tolerant of agricultural disturbance. Nutrient variables (NO3-N, NO2-N and NH4-N), canopy and depth were the critical variables that affected FFG structure in the river. Our findings provided more understanding and insights into the functional structure of EPT in relation to agricultural pollution and can contribute to developing trait-based biomonitoring tools in Africa.

AB  - Detailed knowledge of dietary preferences in wild species are important both for understanding evolutionary processes as well as for their conservation. By means of DNA metabarcoding analysis of faecal samples, we investigated the diet of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), a mountain ungulate characterised by strong sexual dimorphism and segregation, and analysed differences between male and female diet. Despite a low level of selectivity, we found differences in the diet of males and females that consumed different plant in different quantities. Differences were maintained during both spring and summer. Males tended to feed more on plants richer in fibres (i.e., grasses and sedges) and showed stronger seasonal differences while females consumed more digestible plant families (i.e., forbs). Differences in diet between male and female Alpine ibex are compatible with the strong sexual dimorphism and segregation typical of the species and with female reproductive constraints. These results also show that conservation actions have to take into account different ecological needs of males and females in species characterized by sexual dimorphism and segregation.

AB  - Aim: Climate is a major driver of large-scale variability in biodiversity, as a likely result of more intense biotic interactions under warmer conditions. This idea fuelled decades of research on plant-herbivore interactions, but much less is known about higher-level trophic interactions. We addressed this research gap by characterizing both bird diversity and avian predation along a climatic gradient at the European scale.
   Location: Europe.
   Taxon: Insectivorous birds and pedunculate oaks.
   Methods: We deployed plasticine caterpillars in 138 oak trees in 47 sites along a 19 degrees latitudinal gradient in Europe to quantify bird insectivory through predation attempts. In addition, we used passive acoustic monitoring to (i) characterize the acoustic diversity of surrounding soundscapes; (ii) approximate bird abundance and activity through passive acoustic recordings; and (iii) infer both taxonomic and functional diversity of insectivorous birds from recordings.
   Results: The functional diversity of insectivorous birds increased with warmer climates. Bird predation increased with forest cover and bird acoustic activity but decreased with mean annual temperature and functional richness of insectivorous birds. Contrary to our predictions, climatic clines in bird predation attempts were not directly mediated by changes in insectivorous bird diversity or acoustic activity, but climate and habitat still had independent effects on predation attempts.
   Main Conclusions: Our study supports the hypothesis of an increase in the diversity of insectivorous birds towards warmer climates but refutes the idea that an increase in diversity would lead to more predation and advocates for better accounting for activity and abundance of insectivorous birds when studying the large-scale variation in insect-tree interactions.

AB  - Ecosystem responses to disturbance depend on the nature of the perturbation and the ecological legacies left behind, making it critical to understand how climate-driven changes in disturbance regimes modify resilience properties of ecosystems. For coral reefs, recent increases in severe marine heat waves now co-occur with powerful storms, the historic agent of disturbance. While storms kill coral and remove their skeletons, heat waves bleach and kill corals but leave their skeletons intact. Here, we explored how the material legacy of dead coral skeletons modifies two key ecological processes that underpin coral reef resilience: the ability of herbivores to control macroalgae (spatial competitors of corals), and the replenishment of new coral colonies. Our findings, grounded by a major bleaching event at our long-term study locale, revealed that the presence of structurally complex dead skeletons reduced grazing on turf algae by similar to 80%. For macroalgae, browsing was reduced by >40% on less preferred (unpalatable) taxa, but only by similar to 10% on more preferred taxa. This enabled unpalatable macroalgae to reach similar to 45% cover in 2 years. By contrast, herbivores prevented macroalgae from becoming established on adjacent reefs that lacked skeletons. Manipulation of unpalatable macroalgae revealed that the cover reached after 1 year (similar to 20%) reduced recruitment of corals by 50%. The effect of skeletons on juvenile coral growth was contingent on the timing of settlement relative to the disturbance. If corals settled directly after bleaching (before macroalgae colonized), dead skeletons enhanced colony growth by 34%, but this benefit was lost if corals colonized dead skeletons a year after the disturbance once macroalgae had proliferated. These findings underscore how a material legacy from a changing disturbance regime can alter ecosystem resilience properties by disrupting key trophic and competitive interactions that shape post-disturbance community dynamics.

AB  - Changes of vegetation due to deer grazing may result in floristic homogenization or differentiation. The relationships between the changes caused by grazing are still being debated. Vascular plants and grazing by Cervus nippon were recorded in 2010 and 2018 in Betula forests and tall grassland communities in a subalpine zone, central Japan. Species composition differed significantly between vegetation types in both censuses. The alpha-diversity had declined significantly in both vegetation types. Metrics related to species replacement made a greater contribution to beta-diversity than those related to nestedness in both vegetation types. A decrease of beta-diversity based on incidence data from 2010 to 2018 in the Betula forests indicated that floristic homogenization had occurred; an increase of beta-diversity based on abundance data from 2010 to 2018 in the grasslands indicated that floristic differentiation had occurred. Changes of alpha-diversity in both vegetation types and of beta-diversity in the grasslands were significantly correlated with grazing intensity. These results showed that deterministic processes, which originally differed between the Betula forests and grasslands, would be the dominant causes of floristic changes under deer-grazing pressure.

(2024). Insectivorous birds and bats outperform ants in the top-down regulation of arthropods across strata of a Japanese temperate forest. Journal of Animal Ecology. . Top-down predators exert strong effects on prey populations. Theoretical and empirical studies investigating the cascading effects of predators on biodiversity dynamics and ecosystem functionality have been central to advancing ecology and conservation biology. Yet, how intraguild predation and niche overlap drive the strength and direction of trophic cascades across forest strata is still barely understood. In a study published in this issue, Sivault et al. (2024) investigated the impacts of excluding vertebrate (birds and bats) and invertebrate (ants) predators on arthropod herbivores and plant damage in understory and canopy forest strata. The study finds that birds and bats (but not ants) have negative impacts on herbivore density, which, in turn, benefits plants by reducing leaf damage. Additionally, the effects of vertebrate predators are similar across strata. The authors also show that herbivore density and herbivory are greater in the understory compared to the canopy strata. Sivault et al. (2024) demonstrate that intraguild predation and niche overlap dictate the strength and direction of trophic cascades in forest ecosystems. In addition, these findings shed new light on forest ecology and conservation, especially considering the potential negative effects of climate change on top predators.

AB  - Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) significantly threaten endangered vertebrates worldwide. In this study, we report 11 documented cases of dogs chasing, harassing, competing for food resources, biting, and killing six native vertebrate species in the Ecuadorian Andes: Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), little red brocket deer (Mazama rufina), Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus), white-tailed deer (Odo-coileus virginianus), and Andean tapeti (Sylvilagus andinus). Dog attacks on wildlife can lead to mortality through direct injury and by transmitting diseases, potentially threatening the conservation of globally endangered species such as the Andean condor, mountain tapir, and little red brocket deer. Effective management and conservation of native vertebrates in Andean ecosystems require a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted impacts of dogs on wildlife populations. These impacts include direct attacks, disease transmission, fear-induced behavioral changes, competition for food resources, and conflicts with local farmers, which may inadvertently lead to wildlife poisoning.

AB  - Human disturbance has been identified as a contributing factor to the worldwide changes in wildlife ecology. Particularly, the human disturbance forced wildlife from diurnal to nocturnal activity patterns. However, the impact of human disturbances on the spatiotemporal patterns small-and medium-sized terrestrial mammals is unknown. In this study, we then aimed to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic factors on spatial pattern and to clarify the differences in temporal patterns between human disturbed and undisturbed habitats. Our camera trap survey was conducted in northern Gifu Prefecture in central Japan from November 2019 to April 2021. We investigated the impact of human activity on relative abundance indices and the influence of the quantitative difference in human activities on diel activity patterns of 12 terrestrial mammals. In this study, the human population and bamboo forest category negatively affected the RAIs of sika deer and wild boars. Moreover, Asian black bears and wild boars showed crepuscular/nocturnal and cathemeral activity in the human undisturbed habitat, respectively, and nocturnal activity in the human disturbed habitat. Consequently, three large mammals avoided human activity temporally (Asian black bears), spatially (sika deer), and spatiotemporally (wild boars). On the other hand, there was no significant impact of human activity on the spatiotemporal patterns of other mammals. However, it is necessary for residents in the human disturbed habitat to be recognize the risk of human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - Human-induced species declines and extinctions have led to the downsizing of large-herbivore assemblages, with implications for many ecosystem processes. Active reintroduction of extirpated large herbivores or their functional equivalents may help to reverse this trend and restore diverse ecosystems and their processes. However, it is unclear whether resource competition between native and non-native herbivores could threaten restoration initiatives, or to what extent (re)introduced species may influence local vegetation dynamics. To answer these questions, we investigated the diets of a novel South American herbivore assemblage that includes resident native species, reintroduced native species and introduced non-native species. We examined plant composition, diet breadth and the overlap between species to describe the local herbivory profile and the potential for resource competition. Using DNA metabarcoding on faecal samples (n = 465), we analysed the diets of the herbivore assemblage in the Rincon del Socorro rewilding area of Ibera National Park, Argentina. We compared the species richness of faecal samples, the occurrence of plant families/growth forms and the compositional similarity of samples (inter- and intraspecifically). Our results indicate species-level taxonomic partitioning of plant resources by herbivores in this system. Differences in sample richness, composition and diet breadth reflected a diverse range of herbivory strategies, from grazers (capybara) to mixed feeders/browsers (brocket deer, lowland tapir). Differences in diet compositional similarity (Jaccard) revealed strong taxonomic resource partitioning. The two herbivores with the most similar diets (Pampas deer and brocket deer) still differed by more than 80%. Furthermore, all but one species (axis deer) had more similar diet composition intraspecifically than compared to the others. Overall, we found little evidence for resource competition between herbivore species. Instead, recently reintroduced native species and historically introduced non-natives are likely expanding the range of herbivory dynamics in the ecosystem. Further research will be needed to determine the full ecological impacts of these (re)introduced herbivores. In conclusion, we show clear differences in diet breadth and composition among native, reintroduced and non-native herbivore species that may be key to promoting resource partitioning, species coexistence and the restoration of ecological function.
   La disminucion y extincion de especies ocasionada por el hombre ha llevado a la reduccion de tamano de las comunidades de grandes herbivoros, con implicaciones para muchos procesos ecosistemicos. La reintroduccion activa de grandes herbivoros extirpados, o sus equivalentes funcionales, puede ayudar a revertir esta tendencia y restaurar diversos ecosistemas y sus procesos. Sin embargo, no esta claro si la competencia por recursos entre herbivoros nativos y no nativos podria amenazar las iniciativas de restauracion, o en que medida las especies (re)introducidas pueden influir la dinamica de la vegetacion local. Para responder a estas preguntas, investigamos las dietas de una comunidad de herbivoros sudamericanos que incluye especies nativas, especies nativas reintroducidas y especies no nativas introducidas. Examinamos la composicion de plantas, la amplitud de la dieta y la superposicion entre especies para describir el perfil herbivoro local y el potencial de competencia por los recursos. Utilizando metabarcoding de ADN en muestras fecales (n = 465), analizamos las dietas de la comunidad de herbivoros en el sitio de rewilding Rincon del Socorro dentro del Parque Nacional Ibera, Argentina. Comparamos la riqueza de especies en las muestras fecales, la ocurrencia de familias de plantas/formas de crecimiento y la similitud en la composicion de las muestras (interespecificamente e intraespecificamente). Nuestros resultados indican la particion taxonomica a nivel de especie de los recursos vegetales por parte de los herbivoros en este sistema. Las diferencias en la riqueza de las muestras, la composicion y la amplitud de las dietas reflejaron una amplia gama de estrategias de herbivoria, desde pastoreadores (capibara) hasta herbivoros mixtos/ramoneadores (corzuela, tapir amazonico). Las diferencias en la similitud de la composicion de la dieta (Jaccard) revelaron una fuerte particion taxonomica de los recursos. Los dos herbivoros con las dietas mas similares (venado de las pampas y corzuela), aun asi diferian en mas del 80%. Ademas, todas las especies menos una (ciervo axis) tenian una composicion dietetica mas similar intraespecificamente que en comparacion con las demas. En general, encontramos poca evidencia de competencia por recursos entre las especies de herbivoros. En cambio, las especies nativas reintroducidas recientemente y las no nativas introducidas historicamente probablemente esten ampliando el rango de dinamica de herbivoria en el ecosistema. Se necesitaran mas investigaciones para determinar todos los impactos ecologicos de estos herbivoros (re)introducidos. En conclusion, mostramos diferencias claras en la amplitud y composicion de la dieta entre especies de herbivoros nativas, reintroducidas y no nativas que pueden ser clave para promover la particion de recursos, la coexistencia de especies y la restauracion de las funciones ecologicas.

AB  - Sustained-yield hunting of introduced ungulates in the Hawaiian Islands often conflicts with the conservation of native species, but there is little reliable data to guide effective management. European mouflon sheep (Ovis musimon; mouflon) and axis deer (Axis axis; deer) were introduced on the island of Lana'i to provide additional hunting opportunities. Managers will require better information regarding the ecological associations of introduced ungulate species, relative to the habitats occupied, to resolve longstanding conflicts between native species conservation and sustained-yield hunting on islands. To address this information need, we modeled sheep and deer ecological associations, habitat-use, and suitability using data obtained from an intensive aerial survey completed in 2013 and temporally matching environmental data. In habitat suitability models evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) metrics, predictor importance in a generalized linear model (GLM) of deer decreased in the following order: afternoon cloud cover, topographic slope, mean annual precipitation (MAP), elevation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and bare soil index. In a random GLM model of mouflon, predictor importance decreased in the following order: afternoon cloud cover, deer habitat suitability, NDVI, bare soil index, topographic slope, elevation, and MAP. Mouflon were restricted to lower elevation arid slopes, whereas deer were more broadly distributed throughout upland environments of the island. The presence of deer was also an important predictor for mouflon distribution, although mouflon was not an important predictor of deer, suggesting asymmetrical competition. Removal of the more abundant deer population may lead to an increase in abundance and distribution of mouflon without containment. This work represents the first habitat suitability analysis for all nonnative ungulates on any entire Hawaiian island. Our results are applicable to other islands where conflicts may arise with introduced ungulates, sustained-yield hunting, and native species conservation.

AB  - Water infiltration plays an important role in water hydrological processes, especially in precipitation-limited drylands. Biocrusts are ubiquitous in drylands which had significant influence on soil water infiltration in most cases, while grazing may affect water infiltration by the disturbance of biocrusts. Toward this end, the effects of grazing on surface land cover characteristics, soil physical attributes, and water infiltration rates were measured at non-grazed area (NG) and five intensities grazing slope grasslands (G1, 2.2 goat center dot hm- 2; G2, 3.0 goat center dot hm-2; G3, 4.2 goat center dot hm-2; G4, 6.7 goat center dot hm-2; G5, 16.7 goat center dot hm-2) by conducting a fenced grazing experiment. Results showed that surface cover characteristics and soil physical properties changed significantly after grazing, especially at the G5 grazing intensity. Grazing decreased the vegetation coverage and biocrust thickness, while it increased biocrust coverage, bare soil coverage, surface roughness, and splitting index (SPLIT) of biocrust, and the influence was related to grazing intensities. Consequently, there was an increase in the water infiltration rate of 24%-47% after G1-G2 grazing, and the stable infiltration rate and average infiltration rate increased about 56% and 33% at G1, respectively when compared with non-grazed area. The infiltration rate decreased sharply when the grazing intensity was below G3, and infiltration rates remained stable when the grazing intensity was over G3. Improvement of soil infiltration under light grazing after one year was due to the changes of soil surface characteristics and biocrusts characteristics. Among them, disturbance, biocrusts thickness, soil surface roughness together explained the increase of initial infiltration rate, and 0-5 cm soil bulk density, biocrust coverage and its thickness together affected the stable infiltration rate. This link points to the possible use of grazing on the slope grassland with widespread biocrusts and their potential use for the management of soil water in drylands ecosystems.

AB  - Studying regeneration processes in oak-dominated forests requires a multi-faceted approach that considers local factors, disturbances, management actions, and tree responses. Our aims were to quantify the carbon and water-use responses of saplings and evaluate ecological consequences at the early tree regeneration phase of a pedunculate oak-hornbeam forest. We measured plant eco-physiological parameters using an open-chamber IRGA equipment in large experimental canopy gaps (instantaneous field data) and greenhouse (climate-controlled reference data) conditions. We used the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test to analyze differences and similarities in the gas-exchange response. Functional fingerprints indicated shared resource use and efficiency functions at species-specific performance levels with temporal variations. Medium-level and seasonally balanced carbon uptake and water-use functions characterized pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.). In contrast, the response patterns in wild cherry (Prunus avium (L.) L.) and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marshall) were dominated by water use. Goat willow (Salix caprea L.) had consistently elevated gas-exchange levels with the largest seasonal variation among the study species. We found that trees could be ranked on a relative isohydric-to-anisohydric scale regarding their species-environment interaction. According to the carbon-gain response pattern coupling with a non-structural carbohydrate exchange scheme, we were able to classify tree species as having medium- and long-term carbon resource management. In conclusion, spatially heterogeneous and temporally balanced canopy gaps facilitate tree species' development and mixed-stand regeneration by providing a functionally diversifying recruiting environment.

AB  - Background Grazing disturbance plays an important role in the desert steppe ecosystem in Inner Mongolia, China. Previous studies found that grazing affected the spatial distribution of species in a community, and showed patchiness characteristics of species under different grazing treatments. Artemisia frigida is the dominant species and semi-shrub in desert steppe, and whether grazing interference will affect the spatial distribution of A. frigida is studied. In this study, geo-statistical methods were mainly used to study the spatial distribution characteristics of A. frigida population in desert steppe of Inner Mongolia at two scales (quadrat size 2.5 m x 2.5 m, 5 m x 5 m) and four stocking rates (control, CK, 0 sheep center dot ha(-1)center dot month(-1); light grazing, LG, 0.15 sheep center dot ha(-1)center dot month(-1), moderate grazing, MG, 0.30 sheep center dot ha(-1)center dot month(-1), heavy grazing, HG, 0.45 sheep center dot ha(-1)center dot month(-1)). Results The results showed that the spatial distribution of A. frigida tended to be simplified with the increase of stocking rate, and tended to be banded with increased spatial scale. The density and height of A. frigida increased with increasing scale. With increased stocking rate, the density of A. frigida population decreased linearly, while its height decreased in a step-wise fashion. The spatial distribution of A. frigida was mainly affected by structural factors at different scales and stocking rate. The density of A. frigida was more sensitive to change in stocking rate, and the patchiness distribution of A. frigida was more obvious with increase in scale. Conclusions Stocking rate has a strong regulatory effect on the spatial pattern of A. frigida population in the desert steppe. Heavy grazing reduced the spatial heterogeneity of A. frigida in the desert steppe. The smaller dominant populations are unfavourable for its survival in heavy grazing condition, and affects the stability and productivity of the grassland ecosystem.

AB  - Aim: Trophic rewilding is proposed as an approach to tackle biodiversity loss by restoring ecosystem dynamics through the reintroduction of keystone species. Currently, evidence on the ecological consequences of reintroduction programmes is sparse and difficult to generalize. To better understand the ecological consequences of trophic rewilding, we simulated the extinction and reintroduction of large-bodied mammals under different environmental conditions.Location: Europe.Methods: We selected four locations varying in productivity and seasonality in Europe and used a general ecosystem model called Madingley to run simulations. We initialized the model using body mass limits of a European Holocene baseline; we then removed large mammals and let the model converge to a new equilibrium. Next, we reintroduced the previously removed groups to assess whether the equilibrium would shift back to the initial condition. We tested three different reintroduction scenarios, in order to disentangle the importance of the different large mammal groups.Results: The removal of large-bodied mammals led to cascading effects, mainly resulting in increases in smaller-bodied herbivores and the release of mesopredators. Post-reintroduction, the system's new equilibrium state was closer to the initial equilibrium for stable and productive locations compared to highly seasonal and low-productive locations. The maximum trait space volume of the initial state and the post-reintroduction state varied by 9.1% on average over all locations, with an average decrease in trait combinations of 6.6%. The body mass distribution differed by 28%, comparing the initial state to the post-reintroduction state.Main Conclusions: Our simulation results suggest that reintroducing locally extinct large-bodied mammals can broadly restore shifts in ecosystem structure, roughly resembling the baseline ecosystem conditions. However, the extent to which the ecosystem's state resembles the original ecosystem is largely dependent on the reintroduction strategy (only herbivores and omnivores vs. also carnivores) and timing, as well as local environmental conditions.

AB  - Under increasing human activity in Arctic areas and in the face of global climate change, the study of Arctic communities and ecosystems is becoming more and more relevant. However, the question of the impact of interspecific interactions in their transformation remains unresolved. The paper deals with an analysis of diet selectivity of Wrangel Island lemming, goose and ruminant species, also with an estimation of the selectivity influence on their long-term community dynamics and the entire tundra ecosystem functioning. It was shown that the herbivore selectivity distribution mainly depends on their morphophisiology and that, under equal conditions, lesser selective feeders become dominant with increasing biodiversity. We conclude that, despite the considerable human impact on the composition of herbivore species on the island, their mainly endogenous dynamics of abundance distribution correspond to ecological succession, in which the total herbivore biomass decreased by half and their total phytomass consumption-and likely the whole primary production-decreased more than fourfold.

AB  - Extensive horse grazing with hardy breeds is largely used in conservation management for restoring species-rich semi-natural grasslands in Europe. As an example, the Donze`re-Mondragon Rhone river embankments (south-eastern France) where horse grazing with Konik polski succeeded to maintain high species richness in patches of open and short grassland, but failed for patches of tall grassland dominated by the grass tussock species Brachypodium phoenicoides. In response, an increase of herd density by the creation of temporary paddocks was applied in tall grassland patches. Grazing pressure over time between patches was estimated via GPS fixed to mares, biomass, plant species richness measurements and from multispectral photographs, the normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated. Finally, telemetric data were collected. We wondered if the use of extensive horse grazing with temporary paddocks occupation, increase plant species richness. After three years, our results show that the increase in stocking rate enabled a significant increase of plant species richness in the tall grassland patches, with a significant decline of B. phoenicoides in all paddocks. The NDVI was strongly correlated with herbaceous biomass and plant species richness, while the number of GPS points indicating the position of the mares was higher in areas where the NDVI was high. These results are discussed for improving horse grazing conservation systems efficiency on grasslands established in anthropized sites such as embankments and the use of the NDVI as an appropriate tool to help decision-making for large-scale applications.

AB  - The huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) is endangered, with 1500 deer split into >100 subpopulations along 2000 km of the Andes. Currently occupied areas are claimed-erroneously-to be critical prime habitats. We analyzed historical spatiotemporal behavior since current patterns represent only a fraction of pre-Columbian ones. Given the limited knowledge, the first group (n = 6) in Argentina was radio-marked to examine spatial behavior. Historically, huemul resided year-round in winter ranges, while some migrated seasonally, some using grasslands >200 km east of their current presence, reaching the Atlantic. Moreover, huemul anatomy is adapted to open unforested habitats, also corroborated by spotless fawns. Extreme naivety towards humans resulted in early extirpation on many winter ranges-preferentially occupied by humans, resulting in refugee huemul on surrounding mountain summer ranges. Radio-marked huemul remained in small ranges with minimal altitudinal movements, as known from other subpopulations. However, these resident areas documented here are typical summer ranges as evidenced by past migrations, and current usage for livestock. The huemul is the only cervid known to use mountain summer ranges year-round in reaction to anthropogenic activities. Losing migratory traditions is a major threat, and may explain their presently prevalent skeletal diseases, reduced longevity, and lacking recolonizations for most remaining huemul subpopulations.

AB  - Garry oak (Quercus garryana) and associated ecosystems (GOAE) are culturally and ecologically significant landscapes home to over 100 Species at Risk. With less than 5% of their original extent remaining in Canada, GOAE require urgent attention to guide management of remnant habitats and protect them from ongoing cumulative threats. The loss of top predators has played a large role in a trophic cascade where hyperabundant black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus colum-bianus) are reshaping plant and animal communities, even within protected areas. The impacts of deer browsing on plant communities is well-documented; however, the impact on pollinators that are essential for the restoration and conservation of GOAEs is still unknown. We tested the hy-pothesis that deer browsing has an indirect impact on bumblebee populations through their direct negative impact on floral communities. We surveyed deer density, floral communities, and bumblebee abundances across ten islands with differing levels of deer presence in the Salish Sea. We found that deer had a negative effect on the abundance of flowering plants, with an even greater effect on native species that bumblebees rely on for foraging. Deer presence had an in-direct negative impact on female bumblebee abundances through the depletion of floral re-sources. Deer also had a negative impact on male bumblebee abundances, potentially caused by lowered colony success over the season on islands with less floral resources. These findings highlight the importance of immediate deer management to prevent the loss of native pollinators and further, potentially irreversible, ecological degradation of GOAEs.

AB  - The abundance and composition of flowers within plant communities shape the resources available to flower-visiting insects. However, it remains unclear how nutrient enrichment and changes in grazing impact plant communities and their floral resources, and whether these effects contribute to ongoing pollinator decline. We investigated how the abundance, diversity and species composition of flowers (excluding graminoids) respond to long-term nutrient additions and grazing exclusion in two high-latitude grasslands (tundra and montane). We used two factorial experimental designs: 1) a nutrient experiment with additions of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K with micronutrients), and 2) a grazing experiment that included combined NPK addition with and without grazing exclusion. Flower abundance was assessed in 5 x 5 m experimental plots after 6-10 years of treatments. N and P interactively affected flower abundance, with N counteracting the positive effects of P. N reduced flower abundance in the montane grassland, whereas P and K increased it. Grazing exclusion increased flower abundance, with its effect amplified under NPK addition, but this joint treatment reduced flower species richness. Grazing exclusion reduced flower species diversity, with contrasting site-specific effects depending on NPK. N, P and K additions as well as grazing exclusion and NPK addition changed the composition of flower assemblages. At the montane grassland joint NPK addition and grazing exclusion led to strong dominance of forbs, such as Anthriscus sylvestris and Geranium sylvaticum, and grazing exclusion led to homogenisation of the flower community at the montane grassland. Our study demonstrate the importance of grazing and nutrients as key determinants of floral resources, which are vital for flower-visiting insects. We suggest that quantifying floral resources could contribute to ecosystem status assessment. Our findings offer insights for managing and conserving pollinator habitats in the face of environmental change.

AB  - Emergent macrophytes can create important linkages between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. American water willow (Justicia americana) is an ecological engineer that provides structure and takes up nutrients in aquatic habitats but is subject to herbivory by terrestrial animals. Here, potential constraints that terrestrial herbivory, riparian shading, porewater nutrient stoichiometry, and co-occurrence with freshwater mussels may have on standing crops of aboveground and belowground water willow biomass were investigated across nine study sites in the Kiamichi River catchment, Oklahoma, USA. Stem damage - used to indirectly assess herbivore effects - and riparian shading were both associated with significant reductions in aboveground biomass. How-ever, these variables were also somewhat correlated with each other, suggesting a possible interaction between shade and herbivory. Belowground biomass was more variable between sites than aboveground biomass, but the environmental variables that were sampled failed to explain this variation consistently. Because shadier water willow patches tend to have nutrient-richer tissues, we suggest that the correlation between riparian shade and herbivore damage may result from selective feeding by terrestrial herbivores at shadier sites. However, further experimental work (e.g., using grazing exclosures) is needed to assess this possibility due to the limitations of using stem damage counts as an indirect representation of herbivory. Despite these limitations, the present study complements a growing body of evidence that shows emergent macrophytes are seemingly more important as a resource for herbivores than historically recognized. Emergent macrophytes may be especially important when consumed by terrestrial herbivores that then transfer aquatic-derived resources into the terrestrial habitat.Data availability: The data used to generate this manuscript are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

AB  - The takin (Budorcas taxicolor) is one of the largest bovid herbivores in the subfamily Caprinae. The takin is at high risk of extinction, but its taxonomic status and genetic diversity remain unclear. In this study, we constructed the first reference genome of Bu. taxicolor using PacBio long High-Fidelity reads and Hi-C technology. The assembled genome is similar to 2.95 Gb with a contig N50 of 68.05 Mb, which were anchored onto 25+XY chromosomes. We found that the takin was more closely related to muskox than to other Caprinae species. Compared to the common ancestral karyotype of bovidae (2n = 60), we found the takin (2n = 52) experienced four chromosome fusions and one large translocation. Furthermore, we resequenced nine golden takins from the main distribution area, the Qinling Mountains, and identified 3.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. The genetic diversity of takin was very low (theta pi = 0.00028 and heterozygosity =0.00038), among the lowest detected in domestic and wild mammals. Takin genomes showed a high inbreeding coefficient (FROH =0.217), suggesting severe inbreeding depression. The demographic history showed that the effective population size of takins declined significantly from similar to 100,000 years ago. Our results provide valuable information for protection of takins and insights into their evolution.

AB  - Aim Tropical old-growth grasslands are increasingly acknowledged as biodiverse ecosystems, but they are understudied in many aspects. Geoxyle species are a key component in many of these ecosystems, their belowground storage organs and bud banks are functionally diverse and contribute to the grasslands' resilience. However, the drivers of the geoxyles' evolution and (belowground) diversity are little understood. Thus, we combined analyses on the key aspects of diversity, belowground functionality, ancestry, and ecology of geoxyles to provide the first comprehensive understanding of this often overlooked growth form. Location Southern hemisphere Africa, particularly Angola as a part of the Zambezian phytochorion. Taxon Geoxyle species. Methods We assessed belowground bud bank types and biogeographic origins of geoxyles in grass-dominated vegetation types on the Angolan plateau, covering a broad altitudinal, climatic and geological range. Geoxyles were sampled extensively at three different sites, yielding 118 taxa covering about 59% of the Angolan geoxyle flora. Based on the current distribution of these species in Africa below the equator, we analysed their origins and environmental correlates in a taxonomic, functional and biogeographic context. Results Geoxyle species numbers and species communities differed strongly among sites, but functional types showed very similar spectra. Geoxyles evolved in multiple lineages and originated in different biomes, and functional types were unevenly associated with lineages and biomes. Furthermore, functional types correlate to specific environmental driver combinations. Main conclusions Functional diversity is not directly linked to species diversity, but is a result of multiple biogeographic origins that contributed functionally differently preadapted lineages to the Zambezian flora. Thus, geoxyles can occur under different environmental conditions, but require seasonal climates, and open grassy ecosystems subjected to fire, frost and likely herbivory. We highlight the importance of frost as a correlate of geoxyle diversity and emphasize the need for further studies to understand this important and complex growth form.

AB  - The spatial expansion of human populations has increased the overlap between humans and wildlife, leading to the greater tolerance of many wildlife species to humans. However, our current understanding of the consequences of such tolerance is limited. In particular, we lack information on whether reduced behavioural responses to humans are indicative of reduced responses to other potential threats. We made use of a unique natural system comprising geographically adjacent, but nevertheless separate, populations of the threatened Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) that are exposed to different levels of human disturbance to test the effects of exposure to humans on ibex behavioural responses to other stimuli. We measured flight initiation distance (FID) and alert distance (AD) in males approached by four different stimuli: a human, a human with a dog, a novel object, and a leopard model. Both FID and AD decreased for all stimuli as the human exposure level increased. Ibex in areas that are highly exposed to humans reduced their behavioural responses to humans more strongly compared to other stimuli. These findings suggest that tolerance for humans may be the product of several complementary behavioural mechanisms (such as habituation and non-random dispersal). Policy implications. Our findings align with the concern that animals highly exposed to human beings may be less capable of surviving in the wild. Our results also emphasize that the interactions between people and wild animals (such as feeding them) determine the behavioural responses of wild animals, shaping patterns of human-wildlife conflict and co-existence.

Poaching and habitat degradation are threats to the guanaco, a native herbivore of arid environments of South America. Seasonal surveys of guanacos were carried out during two independent years in mountain environments of Andean Precordillera, inside a protected area and surroundings. Field surveys and GIS analyses estimated environmental variables. Density surface models estimated spatial distribution of guanacos, based on predictions about food availability, weather, risk perception, and human activities. The current distribution of densities is mainly influenced by the availability of preferred food and water, and protection effectiveness. Twelve years ago, disturbing human activities were also relevant. High densities in great altitudes yearlong, and a winter expansion through lower altitudes, are evidence of partial migrations, related to climatic events and food declines. Selective use of Puna grasslands and association with wetlands agree with food and risk predictions. Greater densities inside than outside the protected area, and decreasing guanaco-observer distances, are evidence of continued effective protection. Density surface modeling, applied to multi-year distance sampling, highlights as a useful tool for understanding the spatial dynamics of guanaco populations, and aiding management decisions.

AB  - If not properly managed, free-range livestock grazing could be a great threat to forest ecosystems by causing heterogeneous and unpredictable changes in forest structure, functions, and biodiversity. Understanding these changes is important for informing land management decisions compatible with long-term biodiversity conservation. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of biodiversity may provide integrative indices for assessing grazing effects. However, little is known about the responses of soundscape characteristics to forest grazing, especially in temperate forests. Here, we use bioacoustics to assess the impact of continuous livestock grazing on acoustic indices at the landscape scale in Northeast China. We compared the acoustic complex index (ACI), acoustic diversity index (ADI), acoustic evenness index (AEI), bioacoustic index (BIO), total acoustic entropy (H), and normalized difference soundscape index (NDSI) between 16 cattle-grazed forest plots and 36 ungrazed forest plots for different time scales (24 h diel cycles, dawn, day, dusk and night). We collected and analysed over 7000 h of recordings from 52 sites. Our results showed that the six acoustic indices exhibited distinct diel patterns in both forest habitats. Moreover, several indices, except for the ADI and AEI, significantly responded to grazing over 24 h diel cycles, but with contrasting patterns; compared to grazed forests, ungrazed forests had much more bioacoustics activity measured by significantly higher ACI and NDSI values and significantly lower BIO and H values. Livestock grazing was a key driver of diel acoustic patterns, resulting in the loss of nocturnal and dawn soundscapes. Our results indicate that intensive/excessive livestock grazing has a significant negative impact on soundscape quality in human-dominated temperate forest areas, which is likely triggered by shifts in faunal assemblages. Livestock, for example, may reduce the occupancy of sika deer (Cervus nippon), resulting in fewer sika deer vocalizations in grazed forests. Cattle lowing and the intensive sounds of cattle bells may also mask biological vocalizations. We argue that multiple acoustic indices are required to adequately account for the complex responses of soundscapes to large-scale livestock grazing. For forest management, we propose employing PAM to quantify the acoustic communities of the landscape from a new perspective, thereby fostering evidence-based forest management at the local scale to reconcile the livestock sector with ecosystem conservation.

AB  - Anoa (Bubalus spp.) are an endemic species that inhabits the forests of Sulawesi, but are threatened with extinction due to hunting and habitat destruction. Despite these pressures, they temporally adapt to fragmented lowland forests near rivers with food availability. In the Tanjung Peropa Wildlife Reserve, an isolated habitat patch, we used MaxEnt modelling to assess environmental factors influencing their distribution in support of a comprehensive species conservation programme. We used 233 anoa presence data points from footprints, faeces, food remnants, horn rubbing marks, wallowing areas and shelter locations during field surveys and 13 environmental variables. The MaxEnt model showed excellent performance (AUC 0.923), fruit-feeding trees presence contributing most (41.1%), followed by distance to the road, perimeter metrics, distance to the river, elevation and large patch index metrics. The results show that 1,239.8 ha (3.2%) of the study area is suitable for anoa as primary habitat, 3,045.1 ha (7.8%) is moderately suitable as secondary habitat and 6,609.8 ha (17.0%) is unsuitable out of the total 38,937 ha study area, while the remaining 28,042.3 (72.0%) is undefined due to lack of occurrence data. The anoa distribution map shows that the edge of the area can still provide for the ecological needs of the anoa, highlighting the need for patrols, community education and further surveys of identified and undefined areas.

AB  - Comprehending the mechanisms and circumstances responsible for the dynamics of biological communities is a fundamental step for predicting responses to environmental changes as well as efficient conservation and management efforts. Macrofaunal assemblages support a wide range of ecosystem services, serving as integral components of the biogeochemical cycle. Here, we examine the structure of the subtidal macrofaunal community in a semi-enclosed bay system located in the Northeast Atlantic. Employing a functional approach, our aim is to understand the interplay between water depth, geographical position, colonisation development and the communities. Our findings did not reveal the influence of water depth (range of 4 m-12 m) on the functional structures of the communities. Instead, only significant differences were demonstrated for 'time of colonisation' and 'site'. The community with 1 month of colonisation presented limited functional diversity lacking overall ecological resilience. It was mainly characterised by 'small-sized', 'short-lived', 'mobile', and 'deposit-feed' organisms indicating an incipient state of development. Communities Site 2 and Site 3 revealed significant differences in the functional structure of the communities. They exhibited similar levels of functional diversity, yet significant differences emerged in the Biological Trait Analysis. Community Site 2 was characterised by 'sessile', 'long-lived', 'large-sized' 'suspension feed' while community Site 3 was characterised by 'herbivore/grazer', 'tubicolous', and 'medium-lived' organisms. Site 2 focuses on the transport of elements from pelagos to the benthos and from benthos to pelagos while Site 3 focus on the transport of elements within the benthos and from benthos to pelagos, and effectively contributes to decomposition and resuspension processes. Moreover, they differ in their sensitivity to disturbance, which suggests that their location in the Ria influences the functional composition of the communities. Understanding these patterns within this environment of significant ecological and economic importance holds profound implications for the effective preservation of ecosystem services.

AB  - Long recognized as a threat to wildlife, particularly for large carnivores, livestock grazing in protected areas can potentially undermine conservation objectives. The interspecific interactions among livestock, snow leopards (Panthera uncia), and their wild prey in fragile Asian highland ecosystems have been a subject of debate. We strategically deployed 164 camera traps in the Wolong National Nature Reserve to systematically investigate the activities of snow leopards, their primary wild ungulate prey species, and free-ranging livestock. We found that snow leopard habitat use was influenced by both wild prey and livestock. Blue sheep served as the main wild prey that spatially attracted snow leopards and coexisted with yaks while free-ranging yaks significantly restricted snow leopard habitat use both temporally and spatially. This study challenges the conventional understanding that livestock indirectly impacts large carnivores by competing with and displacing wild prey. Our findings highlight that free-ranging yaks within the alpine canyon terrain could directly limit snow leopard habitat use, suggesting a potential risk of grazing in reducing apex predator distribution and jeopardizing their populations. Consequently, managing their coexistence in shared habitats requires a more nuanced approach. Furthermore, our research underscores the importance of further research efforts aimed at enhancing our comprehension of the complex interplay within animal communities and ecosystems. This knowledge will contribute to the development of informed, evidence-based conservation strategies and policies.

AB  - Under the Ecosystem Exploitation Hypothesis ecosystem productivity predicts trophic complexity, but it is unclear if spatial and temporal drivers of productivity have similar impacts. Long-term studies are necessary to capture temporal impacts on trophic structure in variable ecosystems such as deserts. We sampled ants and measured plant resources in the Simpson Desert, central Australia over a 22-year period, during which rainfall varied 10-fold. We sampled dune swales (higher nutrient) and crests (lower nutrient) to account for spatial variation in productivity. We asked how temporal and spatial variation in productivity affects the abundance of ant trophic guilds. Precipitation increased vegetation cover, with the difference more pronounced on dune crests; seeding and flowering also increased with precipitation. Generalist activity increased over time, irrespective of productivity. Predators were more active in more productive (swale) habitat, i.e. spatial impacts of productivity were greatest at the highest trophic level. By contrast, herbivores (seed harvesters and sugar feeders) increased with long-term rainfall; seed harvesters also increased as seeding increased. Temporal impacts of productivity were therefore greatest for low trophic levels. Whether productivity variation leads to top-down or bottom-up structured ecosystems thus depends on the scale and dimension (spatial or temporal) of productivity.

AB  - Biological invasions are a significant driver of global biodiversity decline in the Anthropocene. The success of plant invasions often depends on mutualistic relationships, such as animal-mediated seed dispersal. While the role of birds in dispersing invasive plants is well documented, the involvement of mammals in new ecosystems remains largely unclear. In the mountains of Central Argentina, Pyracantha species are among the most prominent invasive plants, and their seed dispersal by birds has been extensively studied. In this study, we assessed the role of mammals within a novel assemblage (comprising native, invasive, and domestic species) in the seed dispersal process of invasive Pyracantha angustifolia and P. crenulata shrubs. Specifically, we identified which mammal species are legitimate seed dispersers, evaluated their impact on seed germination, and determined where they deposit the seeds using a combination of observational and experimental approaches. Through camera traps and faecal analyses, we identified the following mammals consuming Pyracantha fruits: (1) domestic species: cattle and horses; (2) native species: grey fox, common hog-nosed skunk, and collared peccary; and (3) invasive species: European hare, wild boar, and invasive deer (red or spotted deer). We included two additional native mammals (i.e., collared peccaries and brown brocket deers) to perform germination trials due to their presumably frugivorous behaviour. The germination experiment revealed that seed ingestion by captive horses, grey foxes, collared peccaries, brown brocket deer, red deer and exotic deer enhanced seed germination. Principal Component Analysis indicated no specific association between mammal species and seed deposition sites, suggesting non-directed dispersal. This research highlights the emergence of new mutualisms in anthropogenic systems that may influence plant community structure through the promotion of plant invasions. Understanding these novel mutualisms is crucial for predicting community rearrangements and improving management actions against plant invasions.

AB  - Remote sensing has detected recent trends of increased vegetation productivity on the Bathurst caribou herd's range. The cause of this spectral greening is unknown but is hypothesized to be the result of a change in the composition, establishment, structure, and/or growth of erect deciduous shrubs. We combined field investigation and dendroecology to compare shrubs between areas where productivity has increased (Greening sites) and areas where productivity has remained stable (No Change sites) based on a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer time series for the period from 2000 to 2017. Contrary to expectations, species composition, timing of stem establishment, stem density, stem length, and vertical and diameter growth rates did not differ between the two site types. However, shrub cover was 13% greater at Greening sites and shrubs at No Change sites had 9% more dead stems regardless of the size of the shrub. This suggests that the differences observed remotely are due to a combination of increased foliage production or survival at Greening sites and a dimming of the vegetation index at No Change sites. Our findings offer a population-level validation of specific shrub characteristics contributing to trends in spectral greening in an understudied region of the southern Arctic tundra.

AB  - Forests in the eastern United States are undergoing wide-scale transformations driven by the combined effects of biological and anthropogenic factors. Understanding how these drivers interact to affect forest dynamics is important for predicting the resilience of forest ecosystem services, but few long-term records exist for oldgrowth forests that have not been directly altered by humans. In this study, we utilized historical datasets covering a 96-year period to investigate temporal changes in forest structure and composition at Trelease Woods, an old-growth temperate forest remnant in central Illinois. Our objectives were to (1) characterize shifts in forest composition and structure, and (2) determine how tree mortality due to biotic invasions may have affected the dynamics. Our findings documented substantial compositional changes across the different census periods. Species richness and diversity both declined over time, with saplings exhibiting markedly lower diversity values. The relative densities and basal areas of sugar maple (Acer saccharum L.) and Ohio buckeye (Aesculus glabra) increased across the sapling (< 10 cm) and mid-sized (10-50.7 cm) strata, while the overstory (> 50.7 cm) has become heavily dominated by sugar maple since 1936. These observed temporal trends suggest that Trelease Woods is experiencing species homogenization likely driven by tree mortality associated with pest and pathogen outbreaks, rising deer populations, and mesophication due to fire suppression. These findings provide insights into the historical compositional and structural shifts that temperate forests in the eastern U.S. have undergone over the past century and the potential implications for future changes in dynamics of old-growth forests in eastern North America.

AB  - Landscape composition and its related functional agrobiodiversity (FAB) was severely simplified during the last decades. As landscape composition is expected to influence the interrelated microclimate and arthropod community at different scales, this simplification might have led to a decline in multiple agro-ecosystem services, with potential impacts for the growth of crops with different demands from the environment. To study landscape-scale effects on multicrop yield and herbivory in combination with its potential drivers, including functional arthropod community and microclimate, we used standardised 1 m(2) mini-gardens planted with ten different vegetable crops as phytometers. The gardens were installed at locations varying in surrounding landscape composition and the vegetables were selected to have contrasting requirements in terms of growing conditions, pollination services and susceptibility to pests. Monitoring of the mini-gardens was performed in 2018 and 2019 in Flanders (Belgium). We found no relationship between landscape composition in a 500 m radius and crop yield. Considering possible mechanisms, we found that an increasing share of woody vegetation (>3 m high) in the surrounding landscape is important to buffer the temperature and soil moisture variation in the mini-gardens. The share of agricultural land use and urban green (<3 m high) is, respectively, positively and negatively related with the activity-density of natural enemies and pollinators. The growth of different crops responded differently to higher temperature ranges and we found no relation between natural enemies and herbivory. In conclusion, these abiotic and biotic pathways did not cause an overall relationship between landscape composition and yield. Synthesis and applications. These outcomes indicate that woody vegetation in the rural landscape buffers soil moisture and temperature variation, which will become even more important due to climate change. Furthermore, pollinators and natural enemies were most active in rural environments and less active in areas with residential green and built-up surfaces. Local, flower rich habitat, such as road sides, can further support natural enemies and buffer soil moisture variation. Yet, high arthropod activity is no assurance for arthropod mediated ecosystem service delivery nor is microclimate buffering an assurance for higher crop yields.

AB  - Climate change poses a significant global threat, requiring rapid and effective mitigation strategies to limit future warming. Tree planting is a commonly proposed and readily implementable natural climate solution. It is also a vital component of habitat restoration for the threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus). There is potential for the goals of caribou conservation and carbon sequestration to be combined for co-benefits. We examine this opportunity by estimating the carbon sequestration impacts of tree planting in woodland caribou range in British Columbia (BC), Canada. To do so, we couple Landsat-derived datasets with Physiological Processes Predicting Growth, a process-based model of forest growth. We compare the sequestration impacts of planting informed by woodland caribou habitat needs to planting for maximum carbon sequestration under multiple future climate scenarios including shared socio-economic pathways (SSP) 2, representing similar to 2.7 degrees C warming, and SSP5, representing similar to 4.4 degrees C warming. Trees were modelled as planted in 2025. Province-wide by 2100, planting for maximum-carbon sequestration averaged 1062 Mg CO2 <middle dot> ha-1 planted, while planting for caribou habitat resulted in an average of 930 Mg CO2 <middle dot> ha-1 planted, a reduction of 12%. We found that relative sequestration between herds remained similar across warming scenarios and that, for most ecotypes, sequestration increased from 5% to 7% between the coldest (similar to 2.7 degrees C warming) and warmest (similar to 4.4 degrees C warming) scenario. Variability in the relative sequestration impacts of planting strategies was observed between herds, highlighting the importance of spatially-explicit, herd-level analysis of future forest growth when planning restoration activities. Our findings indicate a large potential for co-benefits between carbon sequestration and woodland caribou habitat restoration across BC in all warming scenarios modelled. They also underscore the value of process-based forest growth models in evaluating the carbon implications of tree planting and habitat restoration across large areas under a changing climate.

AB  - Tropical and subtropical regions shelter high levels of biodiversity. A combination of biological, environmental and anthropogenic factors influences tree community diversity and composition. Here, we use data from the IFFSC project to test the effect of conspecific and heterospecific density dependence, canopy cover and distance to edge on saplings populations of 229 woody species in 159 plots distributed across three forest types in Southern Brazil. All plots were measured twice with a standardized time interval of 5 years. We fitted one ordinary least square regression model to each species to test the strength of each predictor on the species' population growth rate, and one global mixed effect model including forest type, ecological group and the interaction between distance to edge and conspecific density to test their impact in the overall trend of the species. Our analysis provided circumstantial evidence that conspecific density dependence is shaping diversity of forest fragments. This mechanism was present for 75.5% of the species, while heterospecific density affected 10% of the species. Canopy cover affected the population dynamics of 9.2% of the species and distance to edge affected 7.4% of the species. Forest type had a significant effect in the global model, suggesting that population dynamics differ between different forest formations. Ecological group was not significant in the global model suggesting that the mechanism affects species similarly despite their ecological group. The interaction between distance to edge and conspecific density was significant in the global model, suggesting that this mechanism differs between interior and edge of fragments. This work represents one of the few large-scale analyses of conspecific density dependence in fragmented secondary forests. Our results show that, once the forest is stablished, conspecific density dependence is crucial in sapling population dynamics, despite high levels of fragmentation.

AB  - Vegetation restoration may promote the development of biological soil crusts (biocrusts) that are colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and play an important role in microbially-mediated mineral nutrient cycling. However, little is known about biocrust AMF communities or microbial biomass carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling during vegetation restoration in coal mining subsidence areas. Here, we examine cyanobacterial biocrust microbial biomass C:N:P stoichiometry and AMF communities under five revegetation types, i.e., field plots planted with Hippophae rhamnoides, Xanthoceras sorbifolium, Cerasus humilis, Cerasus szechuanica, or Amorpha fruticosa. Cyanobacterial biocrusts under H. rhamnoides and A. futicosa had the highest estimated microbial biomass C:N:P and AMF alpha-diversity values but the lowest pH and electrical conductivity. Moreover, four AMF genera (Ambispora, Glomus, Diversispora, and Paraglomus), one order (Glomerales) and one class (Glomeromycetes) were the most abundant AMF in cyanobacterial biocrusts under the five revegetation types. Vegetation cover induced by revegetation type had direct positive effects on biocrust biomass and was the strongest driver of AMF diversity and microbial biomass C:P ratio. The N-2-fixing plant species (A. fruticosa and H. rhamnoides) are preferable in restoration strategies in enhancing the development of cyanobacterial biocrusts and thus promoting the soil AMF community and microbial mineral nutrient cycling during vegetation reconstruction. The results provide a clearer understanding of the ecological functions of cyanobacterial biocrusts and further facilitate the assessment of ecosystem services and sustainable development in vegetation reconstruction in coal mining subsidence areas.

AB  - The native bees associated with deciduous forest are likely the pre-colonial dominant bee fauna of the eastern United States, yet we lack the data on their resource use needed to guide management. We characterized bees' floral resource use in mature deciduous forests managed by the National Park Service at sites spanning similar to 550 km of latitude in Indiana and Michigan. We collected floral visitation records for 4194 bee specimens representing 103 species, and data on bees' pollen collection for 665 specimens. Our findings highlight differences among dominant bee genera in their floral resource use, especially pollen, and confirm the importance of canopy tree species and shrubs for bees in deciduous forests, even in those with diverse understory floral assemblages. As the largest, most spatially extensive source of data on bees' use of floral resources within mature deciduous forests in North America, these records provide a useful reference point for forest bee conservation.

AB  - Carrion of wild ungulates is an important resource for microbes, invertebrates and vertebrates, and affects local plant communities and soils. Most wild ungulates in central Europe, however, are intensely hunted and removed from the ecosystem, thus not available as carrion. This study explores the use of evisceration residues as a resource by necrophagous insects in a temperate mountainous forest in Germany. We experimentally compared the relative abundance of necrophagous insects between sites of caged roe deer carcasses and evisceration residues of roe deer using pitfall-traps. While evisceration residues were used by necrophagous insects, significantly more individuals were sampled at entire deer carcasses; when corrected for biomass, however, no significant difference in abundance for Coleoptera groups was found. Overall, evisceration residues were used earlier and for a shorter period than entire deer carcasses. Leaving evisceration residues on site where game animals are obtained might help maintain specialized necrophagous insect communities, although their ecological role cannot completely replace that of whole carcasses of wild ruminants.

AB  - Bats are facing several threats like land-use change, habitat loss, overexploitation for food, mortality at wind energy turbine installations, disease, and climate change worldwide. Defining biodiversity of bat species can help conservation biologists to prioritize areas for bat conservation. In this study, we assembled distribution records of all bats of Iran to generate the first richness map of bats, as no richness map is available for bat species in the country. By constructing generalized linear models, we determined which historical and environmental factors drive the richness of bat species across the country. Results of richness mapping showed that Zagros Mountains host the highest number of species in Iran. We found that precipitation is the most influential variable in shaping bat richness in Iran by explaining 26% of variation in species richness. Topographic heterogeneity, with 19% of explained variance, was the second most important determinant of bat richness. We also estimated bat assemblage similarity among the biomes in the country. Temperate Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands biome was the most distinct biome based on bat assemblage. On the other hand, Montane Grasslands and Shrublands and Deserts and Xeric Shrublands were the most similar biomes based upon distributions of the bat species. Areas that were identified to have higher species diversity were regions with high priority for the conservation of bat biodiversity in the country. Temperate Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands, which host the most unique assemblage of bat species, have high importance for conservation. Therefore, to enhance the conservation of bats and maintain the important ecosystem services which they provide, we must have a clear knowledge of their richness and essential needs.

AB  - Livestock grazing is an important management tool for biodiversity conservation in many native grasslands across the globe. Understanding how different grazing species interact with their environment is integral to achieving conservation goals. In the semiarid grasslands of Australia, grazing by sheep or cattle is used to manipulate vegetation structure to suit the habitat needs of a globally unique, critically endangered grassland bird, the plains-wanderer Pedionomus torquatus. However, there has been no investigation of whether sheep and cattle differ in their effects on plains-wanderer habitat and, therefore, it is unknown if these grazers are substitutable as a management tool. Using a grazing experiment in native grasslands over 3 years, we determined the effects of grazer type (sheep, cattle) on occurrence and vocal activity of plains-wanderer, vegetation structure and composition, and food availability. We also examined grazer effects on encounter rates of other grassland birds. Plains-wanderer breeding activity was inferred from vocalization rates captured by bioacoustic recorders. Spotlighting was used to measure encounter rates of other grassland birds. We found that different grazers altered the structure of the habitat. Grasslands grazed by cattle were typically more open, less variable, and lacked patches of dense vegetation relative to those grazed by sheep. Grazer type did not influence the likelihood of plains-wanderer occurrence, but it did interact with year of survey to affect breeding activity. The number of days with one or more calls significantly increased at sheep grazed sites in year-3, which coincided with enduring drought conditions. Similarly, grazer effects on encounter rate of all birds, bird species richness, and Australasian pipit Anthus novaeseelandiae were different between years. Dense vegetation specialists (such as stubble quail Coturnix pectoralis) were positively associated with grasslands grazed by sheep. As a habitat management tool, sheep or cattle grazing are useful when the goal is to support an open grassland structure for the plains-wanderer. However, their substitutability is likely to be dependent upon climate. We caution that a loss of dense vegetation in grasslands grazed by cattle during drought could limit the availability of optimal habitat for the plains-wanderer and habitat for other grassland birds.

AB  - Climate change is expected to affect arid-system ungulate populations by altering the distribution and availability of critical resources such as water and forage, particularly through more frequent and extreme droughts. Tule elk (Cervus canadensis nannodes), a subspecies of North American elk endemic to the Mediterranean climate regions of California, USA, can provide insight into the habitat selection behaviors arid-system ungulate populations use in response to changing resource availability. We used location data collected between 2005-2017 from GPS-collared tule elk to model elk response to surface water sources, forage dynamics (i.e., spatio-temporal changes in forage quality and abundance), and drought in the wet and dry seasons. These data spanned the extreme drought that occurred from 2012-2017, a time when survival was apparently stable in the population. We found that, in the dry season, tule elk localized around water sources but selected areas farther from water with greater forage abundance. In the wet season, high quality forage and road avoidance were the primary factors influencing selection. These patterns were intensified by the extreme drought, with elk selecting areas closer to water in the dry season and farther from water sources in the wet season. Tule elk appeared to modify their behavior to minimize the impacts of drought on their survival. These findings suggest that water source availability and the relationship between water sources and other landscape features, including forage and roads, are a critical component of ungulate management in drought-prone regions.

AB  - Functional traits are useful for characterizing variation in community and ecosystem dynamics. Most advances in trait-based ecology to date centre on plant functional traits, although there is an increasing recognition that animal traits are also key contributors to processes operating at the community or ecosystem scale.
   Terrestrial invertebrates are incredibly diverse and ubiquitous animals with important roles in nutrient cycling. Despite their widespread influence on ecosystem processes, we currently lack a synthetic understanding of how invertebrate functional traits affect terrestrial nutrient cycling.
   We present a meta-analysis of 511 paired observations from 122 papers that examined how invertebrate functional traits affected litter decomposition rates, nitrogen pools and litter C:N ratios. Based on the available data, we specifically assessed the effects of feeding mode (bioturbation, detritus shredding, detritus grazing, leaf chewing, leaf piercing, ambush predators, active hunting predators) and body size (macro- and micro-invertebrates) on nutrient cycling.
   The effects of invertebrates on terrestrial nutrient cycling varied according to functional trait. The inclusion of both macro- (>= 2 mm) and micro-invertebrates (<2 mm) increased litter decomposition by 20% and 19%, respectively. All detritivorous feeding modes enhanced litter decomposition rates, with bioturbators, detritus shredders and detritus grazers increasing decomposition by 28%, 22% and 15%, respectively. Neither herbivore feeding mode (e.g. leaf chewers and leaf piercers) nor predator hunting mode (ambush and active hunting) affected decomposition. We also revealed that bioturbators and detritus grazers increased soil nitrogen availability by 99% and 70%, respectively, and that leaf-chewing herbivores had a weak effect on litterfall stoichiometry via reducing C:N ratios by 11%.
   Although functional traits might be useful predictors of ecosystem processes, our findings suggest context-dependent effects of invertebrate traits on terrestrial nutrient cycling. Detritivore functional traits (i.e. bioturbators, detritus shredders and detritus grazers) are more consistent with increased rates of nutrient cycling, whereas our currently characterized predator and herbivore traits are less predictive. Future research is needed to identify, standardize and deliberately study the impacts of invertebrate functional traits on nutrient cycling in hopes of revealing the key functional traits governing ecosystem functioning worldwide.

AB  - Development of the modern, highly specialised and economically efficient, forestry in the 1700s has substantially changed the structural characteristics and dynamics of European wood- lands. In particular, the ban on forest grazing that had been almost universally adopted through- out all Central Europe, unleashed the processes of development of shade-tolerant undergrowth, leading to the loss of semi-open woods and to functional, ecological, isolation of forests from the wider landscape context. In a separate development, due the recent socio-economic changes, scores of farmland have been abandoned, turning variegated countryside to feral landscapes, increasingly covered by woody vegetation. Although such changes are in line with recommen- dations focused on the climate issues, we believe that the 'ecological intensification' of the abandoned landscapes may provide more benefits than their permanent abandonment. In order to verify that intuition, we studied ecological features and silvopastoral benefits of a landscape unit in the Carpathian foothills of SE Poland, which, during the last twelve years has been grazed by cattle, let in after the former ten years since the agricultural abandonment. We pro- vide the information on the landscape's mosaic structure with regard to the habitats use by cat- tle. In addition, we investigated the animals' reaction to the exposure of the local arboreal for- age, of which the chemistry and nutritional values have been compared to those of the herba- ceous one. As shown by the study, cattle can be used as a factor successfully preventing suc- cession and sustaining the balance between wooded and non-wooded habitats. We revealed that the wood-pasture's tree hay was very attractive to cattle, compensating deficits of the herbaceous fodder. Our study proved that the grazing herd of robust cattle breeds can turn feral, post-agricultural land into a working wood-pasture, consisting of interconnected open grasslands and various facets of woodland, some of them missing in contemporary high forests. Such landscapes can provide multiple ecosystem services, scarce or absent in abandoned, over- grown farmlands. We advocate, therefore, for the transition management of abandoned farm- lands towards the integrated silvopastoral land use, contributing to the land's economic value and landscape's ecosystem services, and the restoration of woodland's characteristics, disap- peared in contemporary forests.

AB  - Grassland ecosystems globally are being negatively impacted by changes in climate, disturbance regimes, nutrient flux, and consumer guilds. Changes in the trophic ecology of consumers can substantially influence local resources, contributing to shifting diversity, community turnover, and other processes of ecosystem change. Small mammals are diverse and abundant within grasslands and yet the impact of changing ecosystems on small mammals and the role of these mammals as consumers are still both under-studied. We assessed small mammal resource use within grassland and woodland vegetation types that have resulted from landscape-scale experimental disturbance through fire treatments within the tallgrass prairie ecoregion of the North American Great Plains. We predicted that resource use would vary significantly among grassland vs. woodland communities, in turn reducing the role of small mammals in contributing to future maintenance of native prairies. We sampled five dominant species of rodents across three years and multiple habitats. Using stable isotope analysis, we investigated isotopic niche area and overlap to infer variation in diet, both within and among species. Resource use shifted in bivariate isotopic space seasonally but not across years when combining all species and habitats. Inferred spring diet (based on fur samples) was highly diverse and overlapping. Summer isotopic values (based on liver tissue) in woody habitat treatments were narrower and overlapped less than within grassland habitats. Consumers generally shifted from C-4 herbivory to C-3 herbivory, or greater omnivory, when analyzing grassland, shrubland, and woodland habitats respectively. Within the tallgrass prairie ecosystem, small mammal populations in herbaceous-dominated habitats use a broader variety of resources than small mammals in proximate woody-dominated habitats. As native grasslands experience woody encroachment, small mammal assemblages experience turnover of dominant species and associated changes in diet. Ecosystem changes such as cessation of frequent fire resulting in more woody habitats may include reduced roles by native small mammals as consumers/dispersers/propagators of native grassland plants.

AB  - Madagascar's biota underwent substantial change following human colonization of the island in the Late Holocene. The timing of human arrival and its role in the extinction of megafauna have received considerable attention. However, the impacts of human activities on regional ecosystems remain poorly studied. Here, we focus on reconstructing changes in the composition of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to evaluate the impact of human land use and climate variability. We conducted a paleoenvironmental study, using a sediment record that spans the last similar to 1,145 years, collected from a lakebed in the Namonte Basin of southwest Madagascar. We examined physical (X-ray fluorescence and stratigraphy) and biotic indicators (pollen, diatoms and micro- and macro-charcoal particles) to infer terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem change. The fossil pollen data indicate that composition of grasslands and dry deciduous forest in the region remained relatively stable during an arid event associated with northward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) between similar to 1,145 and 555 calibrated calendar years before present (cal yr BP). Charcoal particles indicate that widespread fires occurred in the region, resulting from a combination of climate drivers and human agency during the entire span covered by the paleorecord. Following settlement by pastoral communities and the disappearance of endemic megafauna similar to 1,000 cal yr BP, grasslands expanded and the abundance of trees that rely on large animals for seed dispersal gradually declined. A reduction in the abundance of pollen taxa characteristic of dry forest coincided with an abrupt increase in charcoal particles between similar to 230 and 35 cal yr BP, when agro-pastoral communities immigrated into the region. Deforestation and soil erosion, indicated by a relatively rapid sedimentation rate and high K/Zr and Fe/Zr, intensified between 180 and 70 cal yr BP and caused a consequent increase in lake turbidity, resulting in more rapid turnover of the aquatic diatom community. Land use and ongoing climate change have continued to transform local terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems during the last similar to 70 years. The current composition of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems reflects the legacy of extinction of native biota, invasion of exotic species, and diminished use of traditional land management practices.

AB  - Biodiversity and food web ecology are interconnected in the study of community dynamics, being related to underlying factors, such as complexity, productivity, and community assembly. Biodiversity can contribute to increasing the ecosystem function, but its effect on consumer trophic levels remains inconclusive. We generated a multitrophic seed-herbivore-parasitoid food web based on seed traits, insect species abundance and richness, structural and functional food web attributes and the relationship between the seed biomass and the number of eggs laid by the herbivorous beetle Stator maculatophygus. We hypothesized that the food web structure (i.e., connectivity, linkage density and connectance) was determined by the parasitoid trophic levels. Our second hypothesis was that food web functionality (e.g., the parasitism rate) was not affected by the dominance of a single parasitoid species. From the seeds of a plant species (Senegalia tenufolia) (primary trophic level), we recorded nine species and four trophic levels, with one herbivore and seven parasitoids. A significant positive relationship was found between the number of eggs laid and the seed biomass. Connectivity and linkage density were affected by the parasitoid trophic level, and the dominance of a single parasitoid species led to decreases in the structural complexity and the parasitism rate. We described the relationship between structure and function in the field in a multitrophic host-parasitoid food web. The biodiversity of parasitoids plays an important role in the food web, maintaining its complexity and functionality. Synergies between processes acting at lower and higher levels may be driving the food web patterns presented here. Implications for insect conservation Our results highlight the positive role of parasitoid insect biodiversity in the biological population control of herbivorous insects in this microhabitat (fruit/seed). This demonstrates the importance of public policies aimed at the conservation of natural areas to maintain the diversity and ecosystem functions performed by parasitoid insects.

AB  - Moose present a complex management problem because they generate a mixture of benefits and costs to humans, some of which are caused by browsing of regenerating trees. We developed a Lotka-Volterra model, parameterized by moose management areas, to link moose browsing to spruce and balsam fir dynamics on the island of Newfoundland. The model predicts the distribution of moose, adult fir, and spruce well. Empirical estimates of juvenile fir biomass were variable, and our model predicted its biomass poorly. Our model predicts a small negative effect of moose on adult fir biomass (-0.06%) and juvenile fir biomass (-1.65%) and a small positive effect on spruce biomass (+0.02%) under baseline assumptions, but larger effects (+/- 10%-60%) if moose browse commercial softwoods preferentially. Small effects of moose on trees at steady state do not fully reflect the importance of moose because moose parameters (e.g., growth rate and harvesting rate) impacted the return time of our model from disturbance. Our model analysis demonstrates one way to add animal effects into vegetation growth models and suggests that parameterizing ecological models by management unit is useful when the data to support more detailed models are not available.

AB  - Livestock grazing abandonment entails important shifts on the overall ecosystem function, but the effects of this land -use change on specific bacterial taxa remain poorly understood in mountain grasslands. Moreover, we currently lack knowledge about the feedbacks between changes in ecosystem functions affected by livestock abandonment in moun-tain grasslands and the soil bacterial communities. Here, we evaluated the behavior of bacterial communities' structure and composition at taxa level as a function of short (1-year) and long-term (15-years) grazing abandonment in a moun-tain grassland. We also linked the observed responses in the bacterial communities to changes in several ecosystem functions (i.e. primary production, plant species biodiversity, carbon stocks and soil fertility). The alpha diversity of the bacterial communities did not show a significant response as a consequence of grazing abandonment. However, we identified significant changes on the overall composition of soil bacterial communities between the long-term abandoned grassland areas and grazed or abandoned areas in the short term. We also evidenced a balance between the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) whose relative abundance is favored by livestock grazing (19.51 %) and those with higher relative abundances in long-term grazing exclusion areas (20.23 %) that could behave as indicators of grazing abandonment. Structural Equation Modeling analyses proved that several bacterial taxa asso-ciated with relevant ecosystem functions, such as Rhodospirillales order within Alphaproteobacteria phylum, featured significant changes in their relative abundance between grazing treatments. The direct and indirect effects of grazing exclusion on woody species encroachment and soil organic carbon were strongly linked to the changes in the abun-dance of bacterial taxa indicators. The assessment of the bacterial community response to livestock abandonment in mountain grasslands may thus provide early warning signs before subtle changes in ecosystem functions occur.

AB  - Invasive herbivores that kill foundation tree species pose a major threat to forest ecosystem sustainability. One important foundation tree species in the interior western United States is quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), which is threatened by recent outbreaks of an invasive insect, oystershell scale (Lepidosaphes ulmi Linn.; OSS). OSS outbreaks were first reported in 2016, when OSS began causing dieback and mortality of aspen in wildland forest settings in northern Arizona. Since then, OSS has been observed in other locations across Arizona and in other western states, and recent studies in Arizona have highlighted the threat that OSS poses to aspen sustainability, warranting a comprehensive survey of OSS invasions and their impacts on aspen ecosystems. We sampled aspen populations across Arizona and addressed three questions: (1) What is the geographic extent of OSS in Arizona? (2) What impacts does OSS have on aspen? (3) Which biotic and abiotic factors influence the proportion of aspen stems infested by OSS? OSS was present in 29% of our 220 study plots and had a negative impact on aspen forest health. OSS was associated with crown damage and tree mortality, especially of intermediate-sized, recruiting stems. Climate was the most important driver of OSS infestation, with warmer, drier conditions resulting in significantly more OSS. OSS was also associated with less recent fire, presence of ungulate management strategies (e.g. fenced exclosures) and stands with a greater density of aspen saplings. We conclude by providing OSS monitoring and management recommendations, based on our findings, and emphasise that active management - such as prescribed fire, reduced reliance on ungulate exclosures or thinning - is required to suppress OSS populations and mitigate damage to aspen ecosystems.

AB  - Deep-sea ecosystems provide services such as food, minerals, and nutrient recycling, yet baseline data on their structure is often lacking. Our limited knowledge of vulnerable deep-sea ecosystems presents a challenge for effective monitoring and mitigation of increasing anthropogenic threats, including destructive fishing and climate change. Using data from two stations differing in total epifaunal abundance and taxonomic composition, we compared the use of imagery collected by two non-invasive tools [remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and drop camera] and data collected with a trawl system, commonly used to quantify epibenthic megafauna in the deep sea. Imagery and trawl data captured different epifaunal patterns, the former being more efficient for capturing epifauna, particularly Pennatulacean recruits. The image-based methods also caused less disturbance, had higher position accuracy, and allow for analyses of spatial structure and species associations; fine-scale distributions could not be elucidated with a trawl. Abundance was greater for some taxa, and diversity accumulated faster with increasing sample size for the drop camera than the ROV at one station. However, there are trade-offs between these tools, including continuous and discrete sampling for the ROV and drop camera, respectively, which can affect follow-up analyses. Our results can be used to inform monitoring frameworks on the use of appropriate sampling tools. We recommend further research into tool sampling biases and biometric relationships to help integrate datasets collected with different tools.

AB  - Environmental stressors such as land development and climate change impact biodiversity from local to landscape scales. Meta-ecosystem models can be used to represent these important cross-ecosystem interactions, but these models are rarely applied to real ecosystems. Here, we derive a meta-ecosystem model based on empirical data from the island of Newfoundland, Canada to predict how terrestrial disturbances will impact the functioning of small boreal streams. We study the effects of disturbances common in boreal systems: logging, insect outbreaks, unpaved roads, and general human impacts captured by the human impact index. We collect in situ data from 28 streams and analyze geospatial data at three spatial extents to inform the structure and analysis of our meta-ecosystem model. We use disturbance simulations in our meta-ecosystem model to identify mechanisms for how individual terrestrial disturbances affect streams. Top statistical models for our empirical data show that (1) benthic invertebrate biomass and specific conductivity increase with road density, (2) dissolved nitrogen and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) index increase with logging and insect outbreaks, and (3) benthic invertebrate biomass and percent shredders decrease with human impact index. Based on our boreal meta-ecosystem model simulations, logging may change the form of energy entering the aquatic ecosystem and weaken apparent competition between benthic invertebrates, periphyton, and leaf litter. Our unpaved road simulations suggest low sediment loading at our study streams increases habitat heterogeneity. Along with improving our mechanistic understanding of forest-stream ecosystems, our integration of empirical data and mathematical modeling creates a framework for using meta-ecosystem models to inform natural resource management.

AB  - Kelp forests provide habitat and resources to diverse organisms and provide valuable ecosystem services. However, marine deforestation due to wild kelp harvesting, among other drivers, is being observed worldwide. Studies assessing kelp removal effects often focus on the effects on kelp populations, although deforestation also impacts the organisms that interact directly or indirectly with kelp, including herbivores and algal assemblages. Using a meta-analytical approach, we estimated the magnitude and direction of kelp removal effects on kelp, invertebrate herbivores, and understory algae. We also tested if responses varied among functional groups of understory algae and whether results were influenced by the subtidal or intertidal distribution of the removed kelp species and the time elapsed since kelp removal. We observed a substantial decrease in kelp abundance, remaining for up to 4 years following kelp removal, with a larger decrease in subtidal kelp but no recovery observed in intertidal kelp over time. Invertebrate herbivore abundance showed no significant change over time. Understory algae abundance responded positively, although this effect tended to slightly decline over time following subtidal kelp removal. Canopy-, turf-forming and foliose algae were the most benefited, which raises concern about their potential to outcompete kelp. The early succession patterns and cascading effects within kelp forests illustrated here highlight the need for long-term studies to elucidate the long-lasting effects of kelp fisheries, which are scarce at present. There is also a need to consider kelp forests' role in providing habitat and resources to improve predictive frameworks allowing kelp forest conservation and sustainable fisheries.

AB  - 1. Whether wild herbivores confer biotic resistance to invasion by exotic plants remains a key question in ecology. There is evidence that wild herbivores can impede invasion by exotic plants, but it is unclear whether and how this generalises across ecosystems with varying wild herbivore diversity and functional groups of plants, particularly over long-term (decadal) time frames.
   2. Using data from three long-term (13- to 26-year) exclosure experiments in central Kenya, we tested the effects of wild herbivores on the density of exotic invasive cacti, Opuntia stricta and O. ficus-indica (collectively, Opuntia), which are among the worst invasive species globally. We also examined relationships between wild herbivore richness and elephant occurrence probability with the probability of O. stricta presence at the landscape level (6150 km(2)).
   3. Opuntia densities were 74% to 99% lower in almost all plots accessible to wild herbivores compared to exclosure plots. Opuntia densities also increased more rapidly across time in plots excluding wild herbivores. These effects were largely driven by megaherbivores (>= 1000 kg), particularly elephants.
   4. At the landscape level, modelled Opuntia stricta occurrence probability was negatively correlated with estimated species richness of wild herbivores and elephant occurrence probability. On average, O. stricta occurrence probability fell from similar to 0.56 to similar to 0.45 as wild herbivore richness increased from 6 to 10 species and fell from similar to 0.57 to similar to 0.40 as elephant occurrence probability increased from similar to 0.41 to similar to 0.84. These multi-scale results suggest that any facilitative effects of Opuntia by wild herbivores (e.g. seed/vegetative dispersal) are overridden by suppression (e.g. consumption, uprooting, trampling).
   5. Synthesis. Our experimental and observational findings that wild herbivores confer resistance to invasion by exotic cacti add to evidence that conserving and restoring native herbivore assemblages (particularly megaherbivores) can increase community resistance to plant invasions.

AB  - Land -use change analysis is widely accepted as a biodiversity conservation tool. However, it has seldom been used in the context of endangered plants. Our aim is to accurately quantify changes in land cover over the last 60 years in a selection of 58 populations of 43 Spanish threatened plants. Consequently, we explain how these changes correlate with major trends in biodiversity conservation such as human demography, ecological gradients or the spatial distribution of plant threats. A semi -automatic classification methodology is used to identify land -cover changes by comparing aerial photographs from 1956 to 2019 in an established radius around field plots. Secondly, information from field plots and external databases was analyzed using GIS layers and PCA statistics. Land use changes have been extensive and diverse. Tree and shrubland area have increased by 717.8 ha (an increase of 1.19 times compared to the initial situation) affecting most of the samples, whereas the urban area has increased by 168.8 ha (at a rate of 49 times from the initial values), although concentrated in certain populations. Land -use changes define two groups in the endangered flora: a first group is related to high human densities, low elevation settings and low in situ protection, while a second group is related to the cessation in human pressure, protected area establishment and increase in forest cover. The increase in forested area could be counterproductive. Urban land -use changes present a more urgent issue, especially for those endangered plants in coastal areas. Finally, high herbivore density and richness compromise endangered plant populations growing at high elevation in protected areas.

AB  - The distribution and abundance of marine fishes have been changing over the last decades due to climate change and overfishing. We evaluated the status of an important exploited marine ecosystem for one of the largest fisheries in Greenland, Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, in the offshore slopes of West Greenland. We examined how five ecological indicators changed from 1997 to 2019 under the effect of climate and commercial fishery. The oscillatory tendency of the bottom temperature modified the structure and composition of the demersal fish community. In the shallower zone, the warming bottom temperature favoured high trophic level and warmer water species, and subsequently, an increase in halibut biomass, which reduced the biodiversity. In the middle depth zone, the high biomass of halibut masked increases of less common higher trophic level species. In the deep zone, the drastic reduction of halibut biomass coincided with an increase of high trophic level and colder-water species. Despite the increasing exploitation, especially the mid depth zone, the current fishery did not induce changes to community structure. With the present study, we demonstrate the value of using ecological indicators and estimating spatio-temporal trends to provide a further understanding of the ecosystem status.

AB  - Ungulate overbrowsing is a growing problem in forests worldwide due to its prolonged and pervasive impact on plant biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It has been shown that overbrowsing not only reduces plant species diversity and biomass (i.e., direct effects) but also causes a loss of associated trophic levels that could potentially feedback to influence plant community structure (i.e., indirect effects). One of the primary pathways of such indirect effects that have not been fully examined is the impact of overbrowsing on soil microorganisms. Recent studies have shown that soil microorganisms maintain vegetation diversity and drive succession, so it is of critical importance to understand how soil microbial communities might be affected by or protected from the deer impact. To assess the consequence of creating artificial grazing refugia on the structure and composition of soil microbial communities, we compared the distribution and abundance of soil microbial taxa (bacteria, archaea, fungi) at the fenced versus unfenced control sites in the context of a catchment-scale field experiment in Japan. The eDNA metabarcoding analysis of soil microbial communities showed that the numbers of archaea and basidiomycetes fungal species were greater in the fenced site than in the control, while no such pattern was found for bacteria and ascomycetes fungi. Despite the lack of significant influence of the fence treatment on taxonomic composition in the soil fungal communities, their functional guild composition was influenced by the fenced treatment, with significant changes in the abundance of animal pathogens. Thus, although the effect of fencing on soil microbial communities is characterized by complex responses that vary from taxon to taxon, our work suggests that creating ecosystem-scale refugia from deer overgrazing might help sustain certain, if not all, taxa of soil microbial communities.

AB  - Mammals are globally in decline, with habitat loss a primary driver. There are also human-wildlife conflicts, such as elephants destroying crops, which results in the ranges of many large mammal species being fenced off. Yet, how this activity affects functional associations of insects with large mammals has received little attention. Previous work suggests a generalised association with large mammals, as well as a strong response to landscape transformation. Here we assess how well dung beetle diversity tracks large African mammal herbivore diversity across a forestry plantation land use gradient by assessing how dung beetle taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional richness compares to large mammal diversity. We also determine how land use intensity affects dung beetle-to-mammal interaction networks. Dung beetles responded more intensively to an array of large mammals than to differences in land use intensity. Beetles also showed a strong preference for specific mammalian dung, with elephant dung being the most important factor for maintaining local dung beetle diversity. Large mammal abundance, functional diversity, dung beetle phylogenetic richness and number of realised mammal-to-dung beetle interactions were highest in the protected area. Land use intensity categories had distinct mammal and dung beetle assemblages. Transformed areas also have conservation value but provided that there is functional connectivity between remnant vegetation within the modified landscapes. Synthesis and applications. The loss of any native large mammal, especially African elephants, from transformed landscapes is likely to lead to a decline in biodiversity. This suggests that protected areas are essential for the conservation of native biodiversity and its interactions, while well-designed and managed transformed areas can have additional conservation value. African conservation managers and landowners should be encouraged to maintain a diversity of large mammals on their properties to maintain functional diversity and ultimately ecological resilience.

AB  - Goats at high densities are known to degrade vegetation in arid environments around the world. Their role as potential dispersers of seeds of native and exotic plant species, however, still remains uncertain. This study assesses whether goats, through endozoochorous seed dispersal, may potentially change the plant assemblage of seasonally dry tropical forests. We used seedling emergence as a method to analyze which plant species germinated from goat feces and thus may be dispersed by goats after passing through their intestinal tract. Seedling emergence data were analyzed with respect to the plot vegetation, water availability (permanent, temporary and no water courses), and altitude (as an indicator of anthropogenic pressure). We identified 18 species belonging to 14 families. Feces from the plots near permanent water with the largest anthropogenic pressure were characterized by the highest number of germinated plants. The most common plant species by far found in the experiment was the exotic Prosopis juliflora. This high abundance of P. juliflora seedlings shows that non-native grazers facilitate the spread of exotic plant species in threatened dry forest habitats. We therefore conclude that free-roaming goats may play an important ecological role in changing plant species assemblages of even remote areas.

AB  - Mediterranean landscapes are characterized by fine-grained land-cover mosaics of interspersed vegetation types and high wildfire vulnerability, where grazing plays a key role in regulating vegetation structure and composition. This study explores the early effects, over a three-year period, of a transition from extensive commercial cattle grazing to semi-wild horse grazing in two rewilding areas in the C & ocirc;a Valley region, Portugal. Using grazing exclusion areas as control, we test whether the less intensive regime of semi-wild horse grazing can be used to manage vegetation structure and composition, to mitigate local fire hazard and promote biodiversity. The monitoring scheme followed a paired design, where each survey site of 40 m x 40 m comprises four sampling plots of 10 m x 10 m, including two fenced plots (grazing exclusion) and two plots open to grazing. Effects on vegetation structure were assessed considering grass height, shrub height, shrub cover and aboveground biomass, as well as effects on plant species richness, turnover, and forbs-to-grasses ratio (F:G ratio) and the community-level importance of grasses and forbs. Results showed that grass height had a greater increase in ungrazed plots, suggesting that semi-wild horse grazing helps limit grass height. There were no significant differences in shrub metrics between treatments (i.e. horse grazing vs. no grazing), indicating that horse grazing did not effectively control woody vegetation. While species richness remained stable, species temporal turnover was higher in ungrazed plots. Additionally, the F:G ratio and the importance value of forbs were higher under horse grazing, suggesting potential benefits for anthophilous insects. These findings indicate that semi-wild horse grazing contributes to maintaining open habitats by controlling grass dominance, thereby reducing local fire hazard and potentially fostering habitat and food resources for insects. While this demonstrates the potential of using semi-wild horse grazing in rewilding, the results also suggest that horses alone, particularly at low densities, have limited impact on woody vegetation structure.

AB  - Regional long-term monitoring can enhance the detection of biodiversity declines associated with climate change, improving future projections by reducing reliance on space-for-time substitution and increasing scalability. Rodents are diverse and important consumers in drylands, regions defined by the scarcity of water that cover 45% of Earth's land surface and face increasingly drier and more variable climates. We analyzed abundance data for 22 rodent species across grassland, shrubland, ecotone, and woodland ecosystems in the southwestern USA. Two time series (1995-2006 and 2004-2013) coincided with phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which influences drought in southwestern North America. Regionally, rodent species diversity declined 20%-35%, with greater losses during the later time period. Abundance also declined regionally, but only during 2004-2013, with losses of 5% of animals captured. During the first time series (wetter climate), plant productivity outranked climate variables as the best regional predictor of rodent abundance for 70% of taxa, whereas during the second period (drier climate), climate best explained variation in abundance for 60% of taxa. Temporal dynamics in diversity and abundance differed spatially among ecosystems, with the largest declines in woodlands and shrublands of central New Mexico and Colorado. Which species were winners or losers under increasing drought and amplified interannual variability in drought depended on ecosystem type and the phase of the PDO. Fewer taxa were significant winners (18%) than losers (30%) under drought, but the identities of winners and losers differed among ecosystems for 70% of taxa. Our results suggest that the sensitivities of rodent species to climate contributed to regional declines in diversity and abundance during 1995-2013. Whether these changes portend future declines in drought-sensitive consumers in the southwestern USA will depend on the climate during the next major PDO cycle.

AB  - For decades, wildlife has been observed getting entangled in and affected by plastic litter. Despite the increasing annual accumulation of plastic waste in the Indian environment and its potential threat to marine biodiversity, the specific impacts of this litter often go unmeasured in India. Based on a search of social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google), we evaluated the negative impacts of abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) on Indian biodiversity. Among the cases posted detailing interaction with anthropogenic litter, 35 species were affected with 144 individuals reported. Of the species entangled in this study, 13 are listed as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered according to the IUCN. Sea turtles, fish and marine mammals were the most reported groups entangled in ALDFG. We also identified birds, land mammals (the Asian elephant), reptiles and invertebrates (crustaceans and sponges). These findings reveal that the majority of entangling litter impacting animals in India is from fishing activity. Five types of materials (fishing nets, rope, monofilament lines, trap and fish hook) accounted for the most (98 %) of entanglements. This study shows that ALDFG are not only a problem for marine species, but also for freshwater species. The presence of ALDFG in aquatic and marine environments contributes to the extinction risk of wildlife in India, which are already threatened by other human activities. There is therefore an urgent necessity to continue building management programs and develop government policies which attempt to protect the aquatic environment from ALDFG.

AB  - Plants can facilitate their local environment and create a two-phase spatial structure of vegetation and bare soil in drylands, which largely influences ecosystem functioning. Although an increasing number of studies have examined how global change drivers like aridity influence vegetation spatial structure in drylands (e.g., the patch size distribution), it remains unclear how grazing impacts differ from those of climatic gradients, how these effects vary with herbivore feeding habits, and which plant-level traits-such as size and life form-mediate these spatial responses. Here, we coupled spatial vegetation pattern analyses of ecosystem images with field data analyses of the size distribution and dominant life forms of plants from 326 plots sampled across 25 countries and six continents to explore the effects of herbivores on the spatial structure of dryland vegetation. The effects of herbivores on vegetation spatial structure were opposite to the effects of aridity. Specifically, vegetation in grazed areas was clustered into larger patches, with fewer small patches, which skewed the patch-size distribution towards larger patches. These effects differed between browsing and grazing herbivores. Grazing effects were partially explained by the fact that grazing reduced average plant size, increased shrub density, and promoted facilitation among species of contrasting sizes. Similar effects were also confirmed by using model simulations that accounted for positive plant interactions. By linking remotely sensed images, a global field survey, and a mathematical model, our study uncovers the species-level mechanisms by which herbivores shape ecosystem-level spatial patterns and provides insights into the consequence of herbivory pressure on the resilience of drylands.

AB  - Climate change is known to affect key life-history traits, such as body mass, reproduction, and survival in many species. Animal populations inhabiting mountain habitats are adapted to extreme seasonal environmental conditions but are also expected to be especially vulnerable to climate change. Studies on mountain ungulates typically focus on populations or sections of populations living above the tree line, whereas populations inhabiting forested habitats are largely understudied. Here, we investigate whether forested areas can mitigate the impact of climatic change on life-history traits by evaluating the interactive effects of temperature and habitat characteristics on body mass variation in the Alpine chamois Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra. We examined data of 20,573 yearling chamois collected from 1993 to 2019 in 28 mountain ranges in the Austrian Eastern Alps, characterized by different proportion of forest cover. Our results show that the temporal decline of chamois body mass is less pronounced in areas with greater proportion of forest cover. For chamois living in forest habitats only, no significant temporal change in body mass was detected. Variation in body mass was affected by the interaction between density and snow cover, as well as by the interaction between spring temperatures and forest cover, supporting the role of forests as thermal buffer against the effects of increasing temperatures on life-history traits in a mountain ungulate. In turn, this study suggests a buffering effect of forests against climate change impacts. Assessments of the consequences of climate change on the life-history traits and population dynamics of mountain-dwelling species should thus consider the plasticity of the species with respect to the use and availability of different habitat types.

AB  - Many protected areas (PAs) have been created globally in response to the dramatic human induced decline in biodiversity. However, not all PAs successfully preserve their biodiversity and continued monitoring is vital to assess the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Here, we repeated a study done in 2003 to assess whether investments in anti-poaching in two partially PAs (PPAs), Grumeti Game Reserve (GGR) and Ikona Wildlife Management Area (IWMA), have had quantifiable impacts on impala (Aepyceros melampus) populations, compared to the adjacent strictly protected Serengeti National Park. Since 2003, management of the PPAs has changed dramatically under the non-profit organisation Grumeti Fund. We predicted that if conservation management had improved, impala populations in 2018 would have higher local density, less female-skewed sex ratio, larger group sizes, and shorter flight initiation distances (FID). To assess these parameters of the impala populations, we conducted the same road-based surveys in 2003 and 2018. We found that compared to 2003, impala population density doubled in GGR, group sizes were larger in IWMA and nearly doubled in GGR, and that impala had shorter FID in IWMA in 2018. Our results suggest that the changes in conservation management could have led to the observed positive impacts for impala populations. Our study is encouraging for managers and reveals a conservation success story: if proper action is taken to increase the protection of wildlife within PPAs, wildlife populations may respond quickly and positively.

AB  - In seagrass systems, there is a realization that biotic interactions affecting sediment stability might be as important as abiotic stressors in shaping the growth and distribution patterns of seagrass vegetation. However, few studies have looked at the interaction between seagrass and large (mega) bioturbating species, although through sediment reworking activity they may have the capacity to cause large scale impact on seagrass establishment. We assessed the effect of bioturbation by mobile megabioturbators (species lager than 5 cm) on subtidal seagrass (Cymodocea nodosa) using a manipulative field experiment where access by megabioturbators was restricted for 4 months during the growth season. There was a negative effect of megabioturbators on both the biomass and density of young seagrass ramets extending outwards from a mature seagrass meadow, but megabioturbators did not have a notable effect on seagrass growth in the meadows. Interestingly, the exclusion of megabioturbators in all tested habitats significantly modified the infaunal community composition, indicating the presence of complexity in biotic interactions and the possibility of indirect effects caused by the megabioturbators. Overall, megabioturbators have direct and indirect impact in seagrass habitats, playing a significant role in seagrass distribution patterns.

AB  - The effect of anthropogenic disturbance on plant community traits and tradeoffs remains poorly explored in tropical forests. In this study, we aimed to identify tradeoffs between defense and other plant functions related to growth processes in order to detect potential aboveground and edaphic environmental conditions modulating traits variation on plant communities, and to find potential assembly rules underlying species coexistence in secondary (SEF) and old-growth forests (OGF). We measured the foliar content of defense phytochemicals and leaf traits related to fundamental functions on 77 species found in SEF and OGF sites in the Jalisco dry forest ecoregion, Mexico, and we explored (1) the trait-trait and trait-habitat associations, (2) the intra and interspecies trait variation, and (3) the traits-environment associations. We found that phytochemical content was associated with high leaf density and leaf fresh mass, resulting in leaves resistant to drought and high radiation, with chemical and physical defenses against herbivore/pathogen attack. The phytochemicals and chlorophyll concentrations were negatively related, matching the predictions of the Protein Competition Model. The phylogenetic signal in functional traits, suggests that abundant clades share the ability to resist the harsh biotic and abiotic conditions and face similar tradeoffs between productive and defensive functions. Environmental filters could modulate the enhanced expression of defensive phytochemicals in SEF, while, in OGFs, we found a stronger filtering effect driving community assembly. This could allow for the coexistence of different defensive strategies in OGFs, where a greater species richness could dilute the prevalence of pathogens/herbivores. Consequently, anthropogenic disturbance could alter TDF ecosystem properties/services and functioning.

AB  - Due to rapid urbanization, logging, and agricultural expansion, forest fragmentation is negatively affecting native wildlife populations throughout the tropics. This study examined the effects of landscape and habitat characteristics on the lesser mouse-deer, Tragulus kanchil, populations in Peninsular Malaysia. We conducted camera-trap survey at 315 sampling points located within 8 forest reserves. An assessment of site-level and landscape variables was conducted at each sampling point. Our study provides critical ecological information for managing and conserving understudied populations of T. kanchil. We found that the detection of T. kanchil was attributed to forest fragmentation in which forest patches had four times greater detection of T. kanchil than continuous forest. The detection of T. kanchil was nearly three times higher in peat swamp forest compared to lowland dipterocarp forests. Surprisingly, the detection of T. kanchil was higher in logged forests (logging ceased at least 30 years ago) than unlogged forests. The detection of T. kanchil increased with the presence of trees, particularly those with DBH of 5 cm to 45 cm, canopy cover, number of saplings and palms, number of dead fallen trees, and distance from nearest roads. However, detection decreased with a greater number of trees with DBH greater than 45 cm and higher elevations, and greater detections where creeping bamboo was abundant. We recommend that conservation stakeholders take the necessary steps (e.g., eradicating poaching, habitat degradation, and further deforestation) to support the conservation of mouse-deer species and its natural habitats.

AB  - The forage maturation hypothesis (FMH) assumes that herbivores cope with the trade-off between digestibility and biomass in forage by selecting vegetation at intermediate growth. The green wave hypothesis (GWH) extends the FMH to suggest how spatiotemporal heterogeneity in plant quality shapes migratory movements of herbivores. Growing empirical support for these hypotheses mainly comes from studies in vast landscapes with large-scale habitat heterogeneity. It is unclear, however, to what extent ungulates surf green waves in human-altered landscapes with small-scale heterogeneity in terms of land use and topography. We used plant phenological proxies derived from Sentinel 2 satellite data to analyze the habitat selection of 93 collared red deer (Cervus elaphus) in montane and alpine habitats. Using a step selection analysis, we investigated how plant phenology, that is, the instantaneous rate of green-up (IRG) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and a set of variables describing topography and human presence influenced red deer resource selection in open habitats. We learned that red deer selected areas with high biomass at green-up and avoided habitats with possible exposure to human activity. Additionally, landscape structure and topography strongly influenced spatial behavior of red deer. We further compared cumulative access to high-quality forage across migrant strategies and found migrants gained better access than residents. Many migratory individuals surfed the green wave, and their surfing behavior, however, became less pronounced with decreasing distance to settlements. Within the constraints of topography and human land use, red deer track spring green-up on a fine spatiotemporal scale and follow the green wave across landscapes in migration movements. Thus, they benefit from high-quality forage even in human-dominated landscapes with small-scale heterogeneity and vegetation emerging in a heterogenic, dynamic mosaic.

AB  - Human-induced nutrient eutrophication is a major threat to grassland biodiversity, because it promotes the dominance of fast-growing plants. Negative impacts of fertilization on plant biodiversity may be offset by grazing by large vertebrate herbivores. However, whether grazers also mitigate impacts of nutrient addition on insects is less well understood. We use a field experiment to test how plant communities and abundances of pollinators and grasshoppers respond to nutrient addition and grazing by different assemblages of large herbivores, i.e. access by all herbivores (including cattle and horses), access by wild herbivores only (wild boar and deer), no access by large herbivores. Plant biomass increased, plant diversity decreased and community composition shifted towards lower forb cover in response to fertilization, but only in the absence of all herbivores. Flower visitation by Hymenoptera (bees and wasps), i.e. the most abundant pollinator group, was reduced by nutrient addition only in the absence of all herbivores and was positively related to flowering plant richness. In contrast, flower visitation by Diptera (e.g. hoverflies) was enhanced by fertilization, but not affected by grazing. Orthoptera (grasshopper) abundance was reduced by grazing and enhanced by nutrient addition, with positive impacts of fertilization tending to be stronger in plots with only wild or no herbivores. The abundance of grasshoppers was positively related to grass biomass. We conclude that vertebrate herbivores can offset impacts of fertilization on both plant and insect communities, making grazing by large mammals an essential tool to protect insects, particularly pollinators. Most responses to nutrient addition were only apparent in plots without any large herbivores, suggesting that wild herbivores alone could already mitigate nutrient impacts. We also show that insects with contrasting feeding guilds may be favoured by fertilized, ungrazed conditions. Therefore, creating a mosaic of patches grazed at different intensities will enhance overall insect biodiversity.

AB  - Aim The effects of fires on vertebrate scavengers have not been characterized despite the importance of scavenging in shaping food web dynamics. We assessed whether the 2019/2020 megafires in Australia shifted the species richness, carcass detection and feeding times of vertebrate scavengers, and whether the fire affected carcasses persistence times. Location Blue Mountains, south-eastern Australia. Method We monitored vertebrate scavengers via remote cameras on a total of 60 experimentally placed kangaroo carcasses for 30 days in two periods before the megafire (January 2018 and 2019) and one period after the megafire (March 2020) in both open and closed canopy habitats. We compared vertebrate species richness, carcass discovery and scavenging activity before and after the fire and between the two habitats. We also assessed carcass persistence (time to carcass removal) before and after the fire and between the two habitats. Results We collected more than 689,000 images of nine vertebrate scavengers including six avian, two mammal and one reptile species. We detected no decline in scavenger species richness following the fire, and rates of carcass detection for mammals and reptiles did not differ across pre- and post-fire periods. On the other hand, avian scavengers detected carcasses faster in the post-fire period and in open compared to closed canopy habitats. Overall, scavengers increased their feeding times in the post-fire period, especially avian scavengers, but carcasses persisted longer in the post-fire period when compared to the second pre-fire period. Main conclusion Our study identified that a widespread fire could influence avian scavenging dynamics, but that other factors such as habitat and possibly apex scavenger presence affected carcass persistence times over the study period in addition to fire. Future monitoring of carcasses following fires should focus on the responses by both vertebrate and insect scavengers to fully elucidate the effects of these major disturbance events on critical ecosystem processes linked to decomposition.

AB  - Examining the trophic niche overlap of sympatric species is crucial for understanding fundamental concepts of community ecology and for the effective management of multi-species habitats within shared landscapes. Using plant (n = 85) and faecal (n = 300) samples collected in 2020-2021, the diet composition of the scimitar-horned oryx and the dorcas gazelle in the Sidi Toui National Park in Tunisia, was studied. Microhistological procedures combined with the use of n-alkanes and long-chain alcohols as faecal markers, were used to assess diet composition and the overlap of their trophic niches. During the dry season, the diet of the scimitar-horned oryx consisted primarily of Hyparrhenia hirta (L.) Stapf (35.6 %), while the gazelle's diet was dominated by Ziziphus lotus (L.) Lam. (66.4 %). In the wet season, Gymnocarpos decander Forssk. became the main dietary component for both antelope species. Pastoral species consumed by scimitar-horned oryx were richer in fiber fractions (neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber) compared to those consumed by dorcas gazelles, which preferred species with high crude protein content. Our results show low trophic overlap between the two antelope species during both seasons, supporting their long-term coexistence in the park at current population densities.

AB  - Plant functional traits can elucidate the response of plant communities and ecosystems to biotic and abiotic disturbances. However, whether livestock consume more aboveground biomass (AGB) in communities dominated by species with 'acquisitive' traits or in communities where biodiversity is high is not well known. Here, we measured 22 functional traits of the grazing communities and control communities in a Mongolian Plateau desert steppe. The effects of grazing on AGB, CWM traits, species diversity, and functional diversity (FD) were analysed, furthermore, we estimated the grazing impact by using the log response ratio (LRR, an increasing value shows a higher grazing impact) and investigated the correlations between the LRR, plant growth, and community-weighted mean (CWM) traits and diversity indices. We found that grazing significantly increased the CWM dry matter content and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and decreased the CWM height, specific leaf area (SLA), and nitrogen and phosphorus contents. The AGB decreased, while species diversity and FD increased under grazing treatments. Additionally, we found that plant traits and biodiversity could predict the response of AGB to grazing, the LRR was higher in patches dominated by species with 'acquisitive' foliage and in patches with higher biodiversity; in these patches, plant growth was lower. In the study area, the response of CWM traits to grazing suggests an avoidance strategy, which may be more conducive for adapting to low resource utilization environments. Also, the relationship between the CWM traits and the LRR indicated that the effect of grazing on AGB was mainly related to the selective foraging of herbivores. In addition, patches preferred by livestock may not recover quickly, leading to slow growth and thus reduced biomass under grazing treatments after prolonged grazing.

AB  - Background: Herbivores modify the structure and function of tundra ecosystems. Understanding their impacts is necessary to assess the responses of these ecosystems to ongoing environmental changes. However, the effects of herbivores on plants and ecosystem structure and function vary across the Arctic. Strong spatial variation in herbivore effects implies that the results of individual studies on herbivory depend on local conditions, i.e., their ecological context. An important first step in assessing whether generalizable conclusions can be produced is to identify the existing studies and assess how well they cover the underlying environmental conditions across the Arctic. This systematic map aims to identify the ecological contexts in which herbivore impacts on vegetation have been studied in the Arctic. Specifically, the primary question of the systematic map was: "What evidence exists on the effects of herbivores on Arctic vegetation?".
   Methods: We used a published systematic map protocol to identify studies addressing the effects of herbivores on Arctic vegetation. We conducted searches for relevant literature in online databases, search engines and specialist websites. Literature was screened to identify eligible studies, defined as reporting primary data on herbivore impacts on Arctic plants and plant communities. We extracted information on variables that describe the ecological context of the studies, from the studies themselves and from geospatial data. We synthesized the findings narratively and created a Shiny App where the coded data are searchable and variables can be visually explored. Review findings We identified 309 relevant articles with 662 studies (representing different ecological contexts or datasets within the same article). These studies addressed vertebrate herbivory seven times more often than invertebrate herbivory. Geographically, the largest cluster of studies was in Northern Fennoscandia. Warmer and wetter parts of the Arctic had the largest representation, as did coastal areas and areas where the increase in temperature has been moderate. In contrast, studies spanned the full range of ecological context variables describing Arctic vertebrate herbivore diversity and human population density and impact.
   Conclusions: The current evidence base might not be sufficient to understand the effects of herbivores on Arctic vegetation throughout the region, as we identified clear biases in the distribution of herbivore studies in the Arctic and a limited evidence base on invertebrate herbivory. In particular, the overrepresentation of studies in areas with moderate increases in temperature prevents robust generalizations about the effects of herbivores under different climatic scenarios.

AB  - Aims In the sagebrush ecosystems of the western United States, identifying and enhancing habitat for large ungulates has become an increased priority for many management agencies, as indicated by Department of Interior Secretarial Order 3362. Estimating and understanding current and future habitat suitability and connectivity is important for successful long-term management of these species. Location Great Basin ecoregion, western USA. Methods We focussed on pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) in the Great Basin ecoregion and used a variety of data sources (GPS telemetry, aerial surveys, observation locations) to develop multi-scale ensemble habitat suitability models for the current and two future time steps (years 2050 and 2070). We also developed dynamic resistant kernels to model pronghorn connectivity. We combined the habitat suitability and connectivity outputs to derive and quantify changes in pronghorn habitat networks through time as well as identify areas that are resilient to climate and land use change. Results We observed a 33.4% decline in highly suitable pronghorn habitat by 2070, assuming a high carbon emission scenario. Patches of suitable habitat reduced in number and size, whilst the distance amongst patches increased, indicating elevated importance of connectivity for pronghorn in the future. Future connectivity decreased to a greater degree than habitat suitability (47.2%-80.0%, depending on the pronghorn movement threshold used). We also found highly suitable habitat (70%) to be more resilient to climate change than areas of connectivity (10%-15%). Main conclusions Our results show a loss of high-quality pronghorn habitat and areas of connectivity with projected climate change. Connectivity was more sensitive than habitat, indicating connectivity may become a limiting factor for pronghorn populations in the Great Basin. These results can help managers prioritize resource investments and conservation efforts in areas most likely to be successful towards long-term pronghorn conservation.

AB  - Herbivorous reef fishes control algal growth and are critical for maintaining reef health. Grazing effects vary due to community composition, so a diverse herbivore community is important for preventing phase shifts from coral to algal-dominated reefs. However, herbivore communities and grazing effects vary spatially, resulting in non-uniform distribution of algal mitigation across the seascape. Therefore, understanding how habitat influences herbivore communities is essential for predicting the spatial distribution of these species' ecological services. This study used underwater visual surveys (n = 5455) to examine how habitat influences spatial patterns of herbivorous fish densities and species richness in the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas, Florida. Herbivorous fishes were ubiquitous, and communities were dominated by small herbivores such as damselfishes (Pomacentridae), gobies (Gobiidae), surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae), and small- to medium-bodied parrotfishes (subfamily Scarinae). A suite of factors influenced herbivorous fish communities but boosted regression tree results showed that habitat relief, depth, and spatial location within the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas were the most important factors. In general, herbivore occurrence, density, and species richness increased as percent of low relief hardbottom habitat (<0.2 m high) decreased. In addition, density and occurrence of herbivores generally increased at shallower depths. Spatial location influenced the density of herbivores with potential hotspots predominantly located in the Upper Keys and the Dry Tortugas Bank. These data provide a valuable understanding of the spatial distribution of herbivorous reef fishes, and aid management decisions regarding the protection and sustainability of herbivore resources and the ecosystems that rely on them.

AB  - Climate change is modifying plant communities and ecosystems around the world. Alpine ecosystems are of special concern on oceanic islands, due to their characteristic higher endemicity percentage, small area and undergoing severe climate change impact in the last few decades. During recent decades there has been increasing interest in the effects of climate change on biodiversity and a range of methods have been developed to assess species vulnerability. However, some new insights are necessary to obtain useful information for species management on oceanic islands. Here in the alpine area of two oceanic islands (Tenerife and La Palma) we evaluate the drivers that best explain the vulnerability of 63 endemic species along three scenarios, covering recent past to present and two future projections (2041-2060 and 2061-2080). The selected drivers were: loss of potential area, mismatch index between potential and occupied areas in different scenarios, and adaptive capacity constraints. We assess the influence of potential area size and whether the drivers of risk and the vulnerability for common, restricted and rare species are significantly different. Our results indicate that management must be widely distributed over the species, and not only focus on restricted species. Evidence for this was that drivers directly deriving from climate change showed no significant differences in their impact on the rarity groups identified. Vulnerability depends partially on the potential area size, showing a more complex picture where constraints on the adaptive capacity of the species have a strong enough influence to modify the effects of the characteristic drivers of climate change.

AB  - Wild boar and feral swine (Sus scrofa) numbers are growing worldwide. In parallel, their severe ecological and economic impacts are also increasing and include vehicle collisions, damage to crops and amenities, reduction in plant and animal abundance and richness, and transmission of diseases, the latter causing billions of U.S. dollars in losses to the livestock industry each year. Recreational hunters are the main cause of mortality for this species, and hunting has traditionally been the main method to contain populations of wild pigs. Hunting might affect the behavior of the species, which potentially can lead to these animals moving to new areas or to an increase in disease transmission. This review summarized the evidence that recreational hunting influences the behavior of wild pigs. Twenty-nine studies reported the effect of recreational hunting on social, spatial, and temporal behavior. Although most found that recreational hunting caused changes in home range size, home range shifting, habitat use, and activity patterns, there was little agreement between studies on the size, direction, and duration of these effects. Several studies suggested that other factors, such as season and food availability, equally affect the behavior of this species. Very few studies provided details about the type and frequency of hunting, the number of hunters and dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), the number of animals harvested, or the presence of reserve areas where hunting was forbidden on neighboring sites. As wild pigs adapt to human disturbance, these factors should be investigated to minimize the effects of recreational hunting on the behavior of the species, particularly in the context of disease transmission.

AB  - The present study was conducted to understand the avian species distribution pattern along the elevational zone in forest habitat of Nainital district of Uttarakhand. The study was conducted during January 2017 to January 2020. Total 132 species belonging to 43 families, Diversity indices and non-parametric estimators (Chaol, Chao2, and Jackknief) values were high at 1500 m asl (mid elevation) along the study range. Avian composition indicates a significantly positive correlation with vegetation structure (tree diversity and shrub density). The current study provides supportive data to understand the species distribution pattern at the local level.
   The occurrence of vulnerable Cheer Pheasant (Catreus wapiti) and endangered species Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), indicates the rich avian diversity in the forest and it is suggested that more focus on the conservation efforts in the forest habitat.

AB  - Studies have shown that food chain length is governed by interactions between species richness, ecosystem size and resource availability. While redundant trophic links may buffer impacts of species loss on food chain length, higher extinction risks associated with predators may result in bottom-heavy food webs with shorter food chains.
   The lack of consensus in earlier empirical studies relating species richness and food chain length reflects the need to account robustly for the factors described above. In response to this, we conducted an empirical study to elucidate impacts of land-use change on food chain length in tropical forest streams of Southeast Asia.
   Despite species losses associated with forest loss at our study areas, results from amino acid isotope analyses showed that food chain length was not linked to land use, ecosystem size or resource availability. Correspondingly, species losses did not have a significant effect on occurrence likelihoods of all trophic guilds except herbivores.
   Impacts of species losses were likely buffered by initial high levels of trophic redundancy, which declined with canopy cover. Declines in trophic redundancy were most drastic amongst invertivorous fishes. Declines in redundancy across trophic guilds were also more pronounced in wider and more resource-rich streams.
   While our study found limited evidence for immediate land-use impacts on stream food chains, the potential loss of trophic redundancy in the longer term implies increasing vulnerability of streams to future perturbations, as long as land conversion continues unabated.

AB  - The North American beaver (Castor canadensis Kuhl) and cottonwoods (Populus spp.) are foundation species, the interactions of which define a much larger community and affect a threatened riparian habitat type. Few studies have tested the effect of these interactions on plant chemistry and a diverse arthropod community. We experimentally examined the impact of beaver foraging on riparian communities by first investigating beaver food preferences for one cottonwood species, Fremont cottonwood (P. fremontii S. Watson), compared to other locally available woody species. We next examined the impact of beaver foraging on twig chemistry and arthropod communities in paired samples of felled and unfelled cottonwood species in northern Arizona (P. fremontii) and southwestern Colorado (narrowleaf cottonwood, P. angustifolia James, and Eastern cottonwood, P. deltoides W. Bartram ex Marshall). Four major patterns emerged: (1) In a cafeteria experiment, beavers chose P. fremontii six times more often than other woody native and exotic species. (2) With two cottonwood species, we found that the nitrogen and salicortin concentrations were up to 45% greater and lignin concentration 14% lower in the juvenile resprout growth of felled trees than the juvenile growth on unfelled trees (six of seven analyses were significant for P. fremontii and four of six were significant for P. angustifolia). (3) With two cottonwood species, arthropod community composition on juvenile branches differed significantly between felled and unfelled trees, with up to 38% greater species richness, 114% greater relative abundance and 1282% greater species diversity on felled trees (six of seven analyses with P. fremontii and four of six analyses with P. angustifolia were significant). The above findings indicate that the highest arthropod diversity is achieved in the heterogenous stands of mixed felled and unfelled trees than in stands of cottonwoods, where beavers are not present. These results also indicate that beaver herbivory changes the chemical composition in 10 out of 13 chemical traits in the juvenile growth of two of the three cottonwood species to potentially allow better defense against future beaver herbivory. (4) With P. deltoides, only one of five analyses in chemistry was significant, and none of the four arthropod community analyses were significant, suggesting that this species and its arthropod community responds differently to beaver. Potential reasons for these differences are unknown. Overall, our findings suggest that in addition to their impact on riparian vegetation, other mammals, birds, and aquatic organisms, beavers also may define the arthropod communities of two of three foundation tree species in these riparian ecosystems.

AB  - Arctic-nesting geese are specialist herbivores of grasses and sedges (collectively, graminoids). Under moderate grazing pressure, these migratory herbivores can create and maintain arctic grazing lawns with high nutritional content and low aboveground biomass. Nutrient and energy subsidies from southern agricultural landscapes during winter have improved survival among populations of Ross's (Anser rossii) and lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens), leading to marked population growth. Resulting goose hyperabundance has raised conservation concern for resilience of arctic ecosystems to withstand cumulative and intense pressures of herbivory and nest construction. We used both design-based (experimental herbivore exclosures) and model-based methods to investigate changes to plant community structure in direct response to foraging and nesting by these species within the Queen Maud Gulf (Ahiak) Migratory Bird Sanctuary, Nunavut, Canada. Annual nest construction and foraging by up to similar to 1.3 million geese at a large colony at Karrak Lake markedly reduced aboveground biomass of forage (graminoids) and non-forage (foliose and fruticose lichens) vegetation, with spatial variation in reduction associated with intensity of use by geese. Within vast brood-rearing regions, foraging reduced above- and belowground plant biomass of lowland plant communities by 61% and 29%, respectively, between 1994 (when herbivore exclosures were established) and 2017. In addition to landscape diversity associated with abiotic properties created by geomorphic processes, long-term herbivory by geese further increased spatial heterogeneity in vegetation at the landscape scale. Although foraging geese nearly completely depleted aboveground plant biomass in some parts of their brood-rearing areas, belowground biomass was largely conserved, and thus, plant communities had strong potential for aboveground regeneration. We propose that the effects of high-density nesting and foraging by Ross's and lesser snow geese in the central Canadian Arctic, while extensive, are ephemeral and prone to reversion following cessation of grazing and nesting pressure, such as that afforded by shifts in herbivore distribution or local population decline.

AB  - We investigated stratigraphic changes in mollusk death assemblages and geochemistry in sediment cores from four seagrass beds and one unvegetated site in the Gulf of Guanahacabibes (GG), NW Cuba. There was a transition from mangrove to seagrass beds, associated with sea level rise-6000 years ago. Sediment accumulation rates during the last century showed a general rise, but increased sharply after-1980, likely because of human activities. The GG displayed overall high mollusk gamma-diversity, and our estimate of 189 species is biased toward the low end. High beta-diversity was driven by inter-site differences in grain size, vegetation cover, and nutrient input. Spatial heterogeneity within the basin influenced downcore abundance and diversity metrics, highlighting the influence of local drivers. Herbivorous gastropods dominated in seagrass beds and suspension feeder bivalves were dominant on sandy bottom. In the top parts of cores, species richness declined at two sites that were subject to high, human-mediated bulk sedimentation rates and eutrophication. Conservation measures are needed to preserve this hotspot of marine diversity.

AB  - Knowledge about habitat selection is crucial for ungulate management and conservation to handle competing land use. Thermal tolerance and access to food are two important drivers of habitat selection. Thus, moving into thermal shelter when temperatures increase may result in reduced energy intake e.g. mature forests providing thermal shelters through high canopy cover, but lower amounts of forage than more open habitats. Body size affects heat sensitivity, with larger animals being more sensitive. In this study, we investigated ambient temperature mediated habitat selection in three differently-sized, sympatric, deer species (moose, red deer and roe deer) during spring and summer in Sweden. We also assessed the trade-off between thermal shelter and forage availability. We used data from GPS-collared animals with a combination of land cover and airborne LIDAR data to quantify canopy cover as a proxy for thermal refuge and shrub cover as a proxy for forage availability. We found that temperature influenced habitat selection in all three deer species however with divergent patterns. During warmer daily temperatures, moose and red deer selected areas with more canopy cover for thermal shelter, however showing opposite patterns during warmer nights, suggesting patterns of thermoregulatory behaviour. Roe deer showed no influence of high temperatures on canopy cover selection however,, selected more strongly for areas with high canopy cover during colder temperatures i.e. showing contrasting patterns compared to moose and red deer, suggesting that canopy cover may be relatively less important for roe deer as temperature increase. All three species selected for shrub cover during warmer temperatures, which can provide both high forage availability and shade over bed sites for smaller deer species. Our findings indicate that canopy cover and shrub cover habitats appear to be important as temperatures increase, but their significance varies among species. Furthermore, our study highlights the complexity behind habitat selection in sympatric ungulate species, food intake and predation risk.

AB  - Extinctions stemming from environmental change often trigger trophic cascades and coextinctions. Bottom-up cascades occur when changes in the primary producers in a network elicit flow-on effects to higher trophic levels. However, it remains unclear what determines a species' vulnerability to bottom-up cascades and whether such cascades were a large contributor to the megafauna extinctions that swept across several continents in the Late Pleistocene. The pathways to megafauna extinctions are particularly unclear for Sahul (landmass comprising Australia and New Guinea), where extinctions happened earlier than on other continents. We investigated the potential role of bottom-up trophic cascades in the megafauna extinctions in Late Pleistocene Sahul by first developing synthetic networks that varied in topology to identify how network position (trophic level, diet breadth, basal connections) influences vulnerability to bottom-up cascades. We then constructed pre-extinction (-80 ka) network models of the ecological community of Naracoorte, south-eastern Sahul, to assess whether the observed megafauna extinctions could be explained by bottom-up cascades. Synthetic networks showed that node vulnerability to bottom-up cascades decreased with increasing trophic level, diet breadth and basal connections. Extinct species in the Naracoorte community were more vulnerable overall to these cascades than were species that survived. The position of extinct species in the network - tending to be of low trophic level and therefore having relatively narrow diet breadths and fewer connections to plants - made them vulnerable. However, these species also tended to have few or no predators, a network-position attribute that suggests they might have been particularly vulnerable to new predators. Together, these results suggest that trophic cascades and naivety to predators could have contributed to the megafauna extinction event in Sahul.

AB  - Shelter building caterpillars act as ecosystem engineers by creating and maintaining leaf shelters, which are then colonized by other arthropods. Foliage quality has been shown to influence initial colonization by shelter-building caterpillars. However, the effects of plant quality on the interactions between ecosystem engineers and their communities have yet to be studied at the whole plant level. We examined how leaf tying caterpillars, as ecosystem engineers, impact arthropod communities on Quercus alba (white oak), and the modifying effect of foliage quality on these interactions. We removed all leaf tying caterpillars and leaf ties on 35 Q. alba saplings during the season when leaf tying caterpillars were active (June-September), and compared these leaf tie removal trees to 35 control trees whose leaf ties were left intact. Removal of these ecosystem engineers had no impact on overall arthropod species richness, but reduced species diversity, and overall arthropod abundance and that of most guilds, and changed the structure of the arthropod community as the season progressed. There was an increase in plant-level species richness with increasing number of leaf ties, consistent with Habitat Diversity Hypothesis. In turn, total arthropod density, and that of both leaf tying caterpillars and free-feeding caterpillars were affected by foliar tannin and nitrogen concentrations, and leaf water content. The engineering effect was greatest on low quality plants, consistent with the Stress-Gradient Hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that interactions between ecosystem engineering and plant quality together determine community structure of arthropods on Q. alba in Missouri.

AB  - Climate-driven shifts in herbivores, temperature, and nutrient runoff threaten coastal ecosystem resilience. However, ecological resilience, particularly for foundation species, remains poorly understood due to the scarcity of field experiments conducted across appropriate spatial and temporal scales that investigate multiple stressors. This study evaluates the resilience of a widespread tropical marine plant (turtlegrass) to disturbances across its geographic range and examines how environmental gradients in (a)biotic factors influence recovery. We assessed turtlegrass resilience by following recovery rates for a year after a simulated pulse disturbance (complete above- and belowground biomass removal). Contrary to studies in temperate areas, higher temperature generally enhanced seagrass recovery. While nutrients had minimal individual effects, they reduced aboveground recovery when combined with high levels of herbivore grazing (meso and megaherbivore). Belowground recovery was also affected by combined high levels of nutrients and grazing (megaherbivores only). Light availability had minimal effects. Our results suggest that the resilience of some tropical species, particularly in cooler subtropical waters, may initially benefit from warming. However, continuing shifts in nutrient supply and changes in grazing pressure may ultimately serve to compromise seagrass recovery.

AB  - Apex predators are essential for maintaining ecosystem balance by controlling biotic communities. The spatiotemporal grazing of livestock in pastoral areas can pose threats to endangered carnivores and their prey resulting in resource competition, conflicts and increased disease transmission. Our research aimed to assess the spatio-temporal distribution of snow leopards and livestock determine factors causing snow leopard-livestock conflicts identify seasonal conflict zones through public claims and interviews and evaluate conservation benefits and challenges. In this study, camera traps were used in 20 villages of Baltistan from November to April resulting in 720 snow leopard sightings and 8277 livestock events. Snow leopards preyed on 195 livestock in the 2022-2023 period resulting in an estimated loss of $225,004.51 USD including sheeps, goats, cows and yaks.We utilized the Generalized Linear Regression Model to examine snow leopard attacks finding that the timing of attacks was not significant. Proximity to predator-proofed corrals, traditional corrals, bite marks and distance to the nearest village or shepherd huts were positively correlated with attacks, while small stock body size was not significant. Through 110 public interviews we discovered that awareness campaigns and avoidance strategies successfully mitigated human-snow leopard conflicts. In conclusion, our results found that livestock attacks occur in pastures during both day and night with the size and sex of the livestock affecting the likelihood of attacks. Snow leopard attacks were linked to increased grazing and poorly constructed corrals. Snow leopards targeted vulnerable areas of their prey including the neck, mouth, ears and anal region. Compensation claims and field visits were used to identify conflict areas and public perception. In the future research should prioritize the use of camera traps to study prey and snow leopard density, grazing effects, food habits using genetic tools and sex determination.

AB  - The frequency and intensity of natural disturbances such as infestations by forest insect pests are expected to increase under a scenario of climate change. Thus, tools for monitoring the impact of these disturbance events at large spatial scales are required, together with appropriate management practices for enhancing the ability of forest ecosystems to overcome affectations by insect pests. Here, we used the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) combined with 'ground truth' measurements to assess the effects of tree species diversity and forest management on the resistance, recovery and short-term (two years) resilience in mixed oak forests after a severe Lymantria dispar L. defoliation episode. Our results showed that, although neither diversity nor management influenced forest resistance to defoliation, both factors interacted and influenced EVI recovery after the disturbance event. This interaction revealed the complex role tree diversity plays in increasing (in managed forests) or decreasing (in unmanaged forests) resilience to defoliation, thereby suggesting that tree species composition may be more relevant than tree species diversity per se. Indeed, in the field we observed a variety of species-specific degrees of defoliation (e.g. higher in Quercus ilex L.), as well as the preference of L. dispar adults for ovipositing in unmanaged areas and on particular trees (Arbutus unedo L.) that were barely defoliated. In addition, we also found significant and positive effects of tree size (dbh) on avoiding defoliation damage. We thus make three management recommendations for increasing the resilience of oak forests to L. dispar defoliation: i) the application of continuous-cover silviculture (30% thinning intensity in basal areas), ii) the retention of larger trees, and iii) the maintenance of a preferential combination of tree species in mixed stands (e.g. Q. suber and Q. pubescens).

AB  - Context. Sus scrofa is a species that easily adapts to diverse environments and climatic zones. In urban and suburban spaces, its presence negatively impacts soil, crops, and animal production, posing health risks for other animals and even humans. Declared a national pest in Uruguay, it is one of the main predators of sheep. A deeper knowledge of its habitat, current distribution, and the environmental factors that influence its locations is required to develop an adequate programme to control its population. Aims. To determine the spatial distribution of wild boars in Uruguay and its association with environmental factors concerning livestock production, on the basis of a survey administered to farmers. Methods. The survey was completed by 2360 farmers, gathering information on the presence of wild boars and other wildlife animals on their farms, methods used for wild boar control, economic damages caused by the species, number of sheep, and types of land-cover besides pastures (native woodlands, shelter forests, pine plantations, and eucalyptus plantations). Key results. Farms located in the Northeast region, with native woodlands and/or pine plantations, and larger than 500 ha were more likely to report the presence of wild boars. The presence of eucalyptus plantations did not affect the presence of wild boars in any region of the country. While the presence of sheep, free- ranging dogs, or wild boars on neighbouring farms affected the presence of wild boars, the existence of eucalyptus plantations showed no effect across any region of the country. On the other hand, the presence of wild boars increased in association with the presence of pampas foxes (Lycalopex gymnocercus). Conclusions. These results provide valuable information regarding the current distribution of an invasive exotic ungulate, and factors influencing the probability of reporting its presence.

AB  - Fish community manipulation and regulation has been largely overlooked as a mitigation strategy for restoring submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in shallow lakes of the middle and lower Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB). An in-situ fish exclusion experiment and a large-scale lake manipulation were conducted to test the hypothesis that the reasonable removal of benthivorous and herbivorous fish would facilitate the restoration and reconstruction of SAV in shallow lakes within the MLYRB. The in-situ exclusion experiment was conducted from April to October in 2017. Electrofishing was used to remove benthivorous and herbivorous fish from the exclosures. SAV were then artificially planted in the same pattern and density in both exclosures and adjacent open sites, and responses were measured for seven consecutive months. The mean percent coverage and biomass of SAV in the exclosures increased quickly and remained significantly higher than those in open sites over the duration of the experiment. Water quality also improved as turbidity, chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus and total nitrogen in the exclosures remained significantly lower than those in the open sites. After the in-situ experiment, a larger scale manipulation of fish in the entire submerged macrophyte zone (SMZ) was implemented from 2017 to 2020. After removing more than 2/3 of the benthivorous and herbivorous fish biomass by October 2020 in the SMZ, both the species richness and spatial coverage of SAV increased from 2 to 9 and from 1.7% to 32.2%, respectively. Our results provided clear evidence that fish are strong regulators of SAV productivity and that their reasonable removal facilitates ecological recovery. Therefore, we propose that fish community manipulation as implemented in this study be given more attention in addition to the reduction of external nutrient loading when designing projects to restore SAV in shallow lakes of the MLYRB.

AB  - AimL: Grazing intensity and fire patterns across the Eurasian steppes have changed dramatically over the past decades due to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and Kazakhstan is now a global fire hotspot. The implications of these changes for ecosystem functioning are largely unclear. We aimed to understand the effects of changed grazing intensity and fire frequency on a key ecosystem engineer, the yellow ground squirrel Spermophilus fulvus, on a very large scale.Location: Kazakhstan.Methods: Ground squirrels were surveyed in an area of ca. 100,000 ha in the dry steppe of central Kazakhstan, using hierarchical distance sampling at more than 200 random points, stratified by fire frequency and livestock grazing intensity. We modelled abundance as a function of different variables, grouped at the landscape scale (fire and grazing), meso-scale (soil and vegetation structure) and at burrow scale (plant traits such as palatability, digestibility and nutrient content).Results: Ground squirrels prefer areas of a high wormwood cover (Artemisia spp.) and high plant species richness, which are moderately grazed, preferably by cattle, with only rare fire occurrence. High squirrel densities were also related to the availability of nitrogen-rich plants of high nutritional value for herbivores.Main Conclusions: Yellow ground squirrels seem to reach their density optima by balancing trade-offs between optimal foraging in areas of short, nutrient-rich vegetation and a good visibility of approaching predators. Post-Soviet changes in grazing pressure, resulting in higher fire recurrence rates due to grass encroachment and litter accumulation (i.e. fuel for wildfire), have likely affected the abundance of burrowing mammals and associated biodiversity across huge parts of the Eurasian steppes and semideserts.

AB  - Forest stand densities are increasing in the boreal and temperate biomes, suggesting that tree-tree competition is intensifying. Anticipating the consequences of this intensified competition is difficult because competition-induced mortality may depend not only on the occurrence of extreme climatic events such as drought, but also on stand composition, since tree species differ in their ability to compete and tolerate competition. A better understanding of the effects of stand composition and drought on competition-induced mortality would help to anticipate future changes in forest ecosystems.We studied the tree-level probability of competition-induced mortality using National Forest Inventory data from three European countries (Finland, France and Germany), covering a latitudinal gradient from the Mediterranean to the Arctic. We investigated how (i) the proportion of conspecifics, (ii) the shade tolerance (ST) of the focal tree and its competitors and (iii) drought events modify the effect of competition on tree mortality. We used a generalized linear mixed model on a dataset of 461,109 trees representing 39 species on 48,088 individual plots.Competition, measured as the basal area of larger trees, was a stronger driver of background mortality (BM) than tree size and climate. A higher proportion of conspecifics increased the competition effect on mortality, showing that conspecific individuals had a higher competitive effect compared to heterospecific individuals. The competition effect on mortality also increased as a function of the ST of neighbouring trees, suggesting an increased shading effect. A higher ST of a focal tree decreased the competition effect on mortality. Drought anomalies increased the competition effect, resulting in a higher mortality probability for the most suppressed trees.Synthesis. Competition was the main driver of background mortality. Increasing stand density increased competition-induced tree mortality in both monospecific and mixed stands, but to different extents depending on the proportion of conspecifics and tree species shade tolerance (ST). Drought periods increase mortality, especially among the most suppressed trees, suggesting an interaction between competitive status and drought. Incorporating more detailed information on stand composition and tree species ST into tree mortality models will improve our understanding of forest dynamics in a changing climate.

AB  - Intact forest landscapes (IFLs) are globally important for maintaining functional ecosystems. Ebo forest (similar to 1400 km(2)) in Cameroon is one of the largest remaining IFLs in the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forest ecoregion and harbours several IUCN Red-Listed threatened mammal species. We evaluated the status, trends, and distribution of mammals >= 0.5 kg in the Ebo forest over 12 years using guided recce and camera trap monitoring surveys, as well as local knowledge to inform future land use and conservation planning. Recce monitoring of six taxa (blue duiker Philantomba monticola, chimpanzee Pan troglodytes, forest elephant Loxodonta cyclotis, putty-nosed monkey Cercopithecus nictitans, medium sized duikers Cephalophus spp., and red river hog Potamochoerus porcus) showed that some are stable or increasing. Indeed, our recent camera trap data confirmed breeding Gorilla gorilla (western gorilla) and elephant. Distribution models for chimpanzees and elephants showed that their populations are concentrated in the centre of the forest, away from human pressure. Some other species, however, including red colobus Piliocolobus preussi, leopard Panthera pardus, African golden cat Caracal aurata, and forest buffalo Syncerus caffer nanus are either close to extirpation or have been extirpated within living memory. We conclude that the Ebo intact forest landscape retains an important mammal community, despite no formal legal protection. Ebo's future is uncertain, with two commercial logging concessions announced by Cameroon in 2020 and later suspended in response to national and international pressure. It is crucial to maintain Ebo's integrity to protect the biodiversity and function of this important part of the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forest ecoregion.

AB  - Release from herbivory is a factor underpinning coral replacement by macroalgae. Once macroalgae have achieved dominance, shifts back to the coral-dominated state can be hindered by stabilizing feedbacks. Thus, restoring herbivore assemblages alone can be insufficient to trigger coral recovery. However, herbivores could control macroalgal recovery in the aftermath of physical disturbances removing macroalgae. Diadematid urchins at Moorea (French Polynesia) have collapsed in the last decade. By means of a manipulative field experiment, we tested the interactive effects of physical disturbance and increased diadematid densities on macroalgae inside the lagoon. Massive Porites colonies, referred to as 'bommies', were assigned to 3 different macroalgal removal treatments (removal of stipes and fronds of the canopy-forming macroalgae Turbinaria ornata and Sargassum pacificum, total removal of erect macroalgae or untouched) and exposed to 3 different urchin densities (absent, low [similar to 0.5 ind. m(-2)], and intermediate [similar to 1 ind. m(-2)]). After 1 yr, sea urchins had no effect on the covers of S. pacificum and T. ornata when macroalgal canopies were left untouched. Urchins could control the recovery of S. pacificum on total macroalgal removal bommies, but not that of T. ornata. However, urchins, even when at intermediate densities, did not generate major changes in the structure of benthic assemblages on experimental bommies. Our study indicates that a moderate increase in diadematid densities is unlikely to reduce the extent of macroalgal stands in Moorea back reefs unless associated with the recovery of other herbivore guilds able to remove adult macroalgae (i.e. browsers).

AB  - Background Fire and herbivores are essential to savanna ecosystems, consuming vegetation and recycling nutrients. Fire volatilises some elements and makes others readily available through ash, while herbivores redistribute nutrients via dung (excrement, faeces).Aims We investigate, for the first time, fire's role in consuming dung and affecting nutrient cycling.Methods We examined the chemical characteristics of wild large herbivore dung (buffalo, elephant, giraffe, wildebeest, zebra) burned during African savanna fires (Kruger National Park, South Africa) and estimated carbon and nutrients losses from dung burning.Key results Smouldering combustion of dung led to high carbon loss to the atmosphere (C: 41% and 4.1% in unburned and burned dung) and high enrichment of nutrients (e.g. Ca, P) and metals (e.g. Cu, Fe, Zn) in the burned residue. Flaming combustion of grass resulted in lower carbon loss (C: 43% and 23% in vegetation and ash), leaving more carbon in the ash and lower relative enrichment of other nutrients and metals.Conclusions Burned dung forms nutrient hotspots with physicochemical characteristics distinct from vegetation ash.Implications Taking dung from wild or domestic herbivores into account in fuel inventories can improve estimations of fire-related carbon emissions and provide better understanding of fire impacts on nutrients cycling.

AB  - Current climate change is disrupting biotic interactions and eroding biodiversity worldwide. However, species sensitive to aridity, high temperatures, and climate variability might find shelter in microclimatic refuges, such as leaf rolls built by arthropods. To explore how the importance of leaf shelters for terrestrial arthropods changes with latitude, elevation, and climate, we conducted a distributed experiment comparing arthropods in leaf rolls versus control leaves across 52 sites along an 11,790 km latitudinal gradient. We then probed the impact of short- versus long-term climatic impacts on roll use, by comparing the relative impact of conditions during the experiment versus average, baseline conditions at the site. Leaf shelters supported larger organisms and higher arthropod biomass and species diversity than non-rolled control leaves. However, the magnitude of the leaf rolls' effect differed between long- and short-term climate conditions, metrics (species richness, biomass, and body size), and trophic groups (predators vs. herbivores). The effect of leaf rolls on predator richness was influenced only by baseline climate, increasing in magnitude in regions experiencing increased long-term aridity, regardless of latitude, elevation, and weather during the experiment. This suggests that shelter use by predators may be innate, and thus, driven by natural selection. In contrast, the effect of leaf rolls on predator biomass and predator body size decreased with increasing temperature, and increased with increasing precipitation, respectively, during the experiment. The magnitude of shelter usage by herbivores increased with the abundance of predators and decreased with increasing temperature during the experiment. Taken together, these results highlight that leaf roll use may have both proximal and ultimate causes. Projected increases in climate variability and aridity are, therefore, likely to increase the importance of biotic refugia in mitigating the effects of climate change on species persistence.

AB  - Interest in use of naturally ignited wildland fires managed to meet multiple resource objectives (resource objective wildfire) is increasing among U.S. public forest managers; however, only a limited number of studies have examined this approach for conserving or restoring understory plant diversity, productivity, and community structure. We analyzed understory community changes two and twelve years after resource objective fire, using permanent sample plots in three montane contrasting forest types in Grand Canyon National Park, AZ. Our findings indicated that species composition in the pine-oak forest rebounded to be similar to that observed before the fire, but plant cover did not recover to pre-fire levels by the twelfth year post-fire. Plant cover showed mixed results post-fire in mixed-conifer and spruce-fir forests, and species composition was still characterized by ruderal species twelve years later. Patterns observed in this study likely reflect interacting factors of burn severity, periodic drought, large ungulate herbivory, and inherent site variability. Other than cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), we found no non-native species occurring with high frequency. Continued monitoring with increased frequency and intensity could lead to better understanding of long-term changes in these forests after resource objective fire, and enhance our understanding of important drivers of variation including interactions of climate, burn severity and herbivory by large ungulates.

AB  - Sustainable forest management strategies include emulating historical disturbance regimes to achieve multiple objectives. Partial-harvesting strategies are used to overcome conflicts between timber production and wildlife habitat conservation; however, the potential impacts on complex disturbance interactions and ecological functions remain largely unknown. In 1984, a controlled experiment was initiated in the dry forests of central British Columbia, Canada, to test partial harvesting intended to enhance mule deer habitat while allowing timber extraction. To determine the short- and long-term impacts on complex disturbance regimes, we quantified changes in forest structure and susceptibility to western spruce budworm, Douglas-fir beetle, and wildfire. We compared structural attributes in 2014 (30 years after the first harvest) and 2015 (1 year after the second harvest) in treated forests, and contrasted them with control forests that were measured in 2015. In the short term (1 year post-harvest), partial harvesting altered forest structure by reducing total canopy cover, subcanopy tree density and basal area, and increasing the abundance of large woody surface fuels. In the long term (30 years post-harvest), the forest canopy attributes did not differ between the treatment and control areas, partly due to increased growth of subcanopy trees. Harvesting had little impact on forest susceptibility to western spruce budworm. Susceptibility to Douglas-fir beetle was lower in the short term due to fewer available mature host trees, but increased to levels similar to the control forest over the long term. Reduced canopy fuels and increased canopy base height decreased the likelihood of crown fire in favor of surface fire. In the long term, canopy fuels and likelihood of crown fire recovered, but woody fuel loads remained low after 30 years. Harvesting to enhance mule deer habitat interacts with biotic and abiotic disturbances in the short and long term. Potential cascading affects depended more on the decision to remove harvesting residuals to mitigate potential Douglas-fir beetle infestations and wildfire than on time since treatment. Provided partial harvesting occurs at intervals <= 30 years and residuals are immediately removed, timber extraction and mule deer habitat can be compatible with complex disturbance regimes and sustainable forest management.

AB  - While the proximate and ultimate causes of sexual segregation have been well studied over the past 30 years, most of the research has focused on species with a pronounced sexual size dimorphism. Species with a smaller size dimorphism are probably understudied, because the assumption is that aggregation rather than sex segregation should be the norm. We used 6 years of direct observations of goitered gazelles, Gazella subgutturosa, an ungulate with a small degree of sexual size dimorphism, to explore sexual segregation and aggregation patterns and habitat choice at two timescales. We predicted minimal differences in activity budgets between the sexes, based on their small size dimorphism, and did not expect any evolutionary niche divergence based on size. However, we found that goitered gazelles showed considerable sexual and habitat segregation for most of the year, and only showed a tendency to randomly aggregate during the peak of the rutting season. We also found that they segregated socially and by habitat and had different activity budgets in some months. Behavioural asynchrony and sexual differences in habitat use were much greater than predicted for a species with such a small sexual dimorphism in body size. Our study confirms strong multifactorial sexual segregation patterns, and points to the potential importance that social factors (aggression and territoriality) may have on sexual segregation in goitered gazelles.

AB  - Tropical dry forests maintain a high diversity and endemic flora and fauna but are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world. In the present study we analyzed the composition, structure, diversity, and traditional uses of the plants in the locality of San Gabriel Casa Blanca, within the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve, Oaxaca, Mexico. The vegetation in the study landscape is representative of the semi-arid areas composed by tropical dry forest, scrub, and agricultural areas. During the rainy season of 2018, 30 sampling sites were sampled in five landscape units. The tree and shrub stratum were sampled and vegetation diversity, composition and structure were evaluated. Additionally, surveys and workshops were conducted to understand the plant species utilized by the population. A total of 71 species belonging to 24 botanical families were identified. The best represented families were Cactaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Leguminosae; while the species were Neobuxbaumia tetetzo, Bursera fagaroides, Opuntia pilifera, Myrtillocactus geometrizans and Amphipterygium adstringens. The composition of species varied among the different landscape units, being the unit with agricultural presence the one that had the least diversity of species. Based on interviews, a total of 54 species of plants with traditional uses in the locality were determined. The results of the present study suggest that under an adequate management scheme and conservation plans such as those practiced in this site, the representative composition and plant diversity of this reserve can be maintained.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands in Japan have decreased due to management abandonment and urbanization over the last 100 years, but they remain in suburban areas in addition to rural areas. Because suburban grasslands have various land-use histories and disturbance regimes, plant and herbivorous insect communities are likely to differ among grassland types. To identify grasslands with high conservation value, we conducted a comprehensive survey of grasshoppers and plants in 150 grasslands with 5 grassland types differing in land-use history and current management in northern Chiba prefecture, Japan. We then analyzed the association of the distributions of grasshopper and plant species compositions. Our results showed that grasshoppers were classified into habitat specialists and generalists. Three out of four habitat specialists were almost exclusively found in semi-natural grasslands and vacant lots, while habitat generalists were commonly observed at the cropland margins. This habitat specialist-generalist distribution gradient corresponded well to that found in plant communities, which was probably due to current disturbance regimes. We suggest that vacant lots as well as semi-natural grasslands have high conservation value for grassland organisms of various taxa in suburban areas, and grasshoppers are candidate indicator species for monitoring grassland environments.

AB  - Landscape complexity can determine the population dynamics of interacting predators and prey. Yet, management plans are commonly developed from aspatial predictive models. This oversight may result in unexpected outcomes or the loss of opportunities to make spatial interventions that would increase a plan's effectiveness. The management of the threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), boreal population, provides an example of such shortcomings when using an aspatial approach. Currently, the most influential management recommendation is to maintain at least 65% of undisturbed forests in areas occupied by caribou populations, regardless of the spatial configuration of the forest cover. Using a spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM), we evaluated the effects of the spatial configuration of cuts and roads on the mortality of boreal caribou living in sympatry with wolves (Canis lupus) and moose (Alces alces), an apparent competitor. Starting with a real forest landscape, we created forest management scenarios of the specific spatial distribution of cuts (mosaic, small, or large agglomeration) with increasing disturbance levels. We then ran the IBM with simulated agents, representing individuals of the three species, moving according to movement rules determined from radio-collared individuals. We found that movement responses to land cover types and roads differed among species. For example, caribou and moose generally avoided areas close to roads, contrary to wolves. Those differences influenced the mortality of caribou agents, which not only depended on the levels of disturbance but also depended on the spatial distribution of cuts and roads. After controlling for disturbance level, wolves were more successful when forest management required an extensive road network resulting in relatively high habitat fragmentation. Caribou agents experienced lower mortality in landscapes with low densities of road and disturbance-related edges. The effect remained much stronger, however, for the level than the spatial configuration of human disturbances. Still, our IBM demonstrated how landscape management could be used to manipulate species interactions, with the intent of either increasing or decreasing predation rates on specific populations, depending on management goals.

AB  - Bison have long been considered a keystone species of North American prairies, increasing plant and animal diversity through a number of unique behaviors. One such behavior is wallowing, in which the repeated rolling of bison in the same spot leads to the formation of small, shallow, oval depressions called wallows. The objective of this study was to characterize spatial and physical attributes of bison wallows at the Konza Prairie Biological Station, a tallgrass prairie preserve in northeastern Kansas. We used aerial imagery from two different years (2011 and 2019) to assess the abundance and spatial distribution of these wallows in relation to fire frequency, elevation, and slope. We also recorded physical characteristics (2020) for a randomly selected subset of wallows and analyzed these data in relation to the same landscape features. Results from the analysis of the aerial images indicated that wallows were more abundant in areas characterized by combinations of more frequent burning, higher elevations, and little or no slope. In the 2020 physical measurements, we found that wallows were smaller in areas burned more often and shallower at higher elevations, particularly when located on grazing lawns. Terrestrial plants were found in approximately 72.1% of the wallows that were physically sampled, and their prevalence increased with increasing slope. We found some quantity of aquatic plants in approximately 7.1% of the sampled wallows. The probability of finding aquatic vegetation in wallows was higher on grazing lawns and in areas burned less frequently, particularly every 20 years. This study enhances the understanding of the distribution of wallows and their physical characteristics as a type of disturbance that could alter relationships within grassland communities.

AB  - Megafauna play a disproportionate role in developing and maintaining their biomes, by regulating plant dispersal, community structure and nutrient cycling. Understanding the ecological roles of extinct megafaunal communities, for example through dietary reconstruction using isotope analysis, is necessary to determine pre-human states and set evidence-based restoration goals. We use delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic analyses to reconstruct Holocene feeding guilds in Madagascar's extinct megaherbivores, which included elephant birds, hippopotami and giant tortoises that occurred across multiple habitats and elevations. We compare isotopic data from seven taxa and two elephant bird eggshell morphotypes against contemporary regional floral baselines to infer dietary subsistence strategies. Most taxa show high consumption of C-3 and/or CAM plants, providing evidence of widespread browsing ecology. However, Aepyornis hildebrandti, an elephant bird restricted to the central highlands region, has isotope values with much higher delta C-13 values than other taxa. This species is interpreted as having obtained up to 48% of its diet from C-4 grasses. These findings provide new evidence for distinct browsing and grazing guilds in Madagascar's Holocene megaherbivore fauna, with implications for past regional distribution of ecosystems dominated by endemic C-4 grasses.

AB  - Moose Alces alces are among the many species that are vulnerable to both direct and indirect effects of climate change. Habitat selection is one framework to assist investigators in disentangling the various factors (including weather) that ultimately dictate how animals respond to their environment. We investigated patterns of winter habitat selection by adult female moose in southwestern Montana, USA during 2007-2010, and how that selection was affected by snow (quantified by snow water equivalent) and winter temperatures. We used data from GPS collars and a suite of environmental covariates to quantify winter habitat selection at both study area (2nd order) and home range (3rd order) spatial scales using resource selection functions. Moose strongly selected for the willow (Salix spp.) cover type, and against grassland cover. Moose use of conifer cover at the home range scale increased when either amount of snow or ambient temperature was higher, although the latter only during periods of the day when conifer patches were likely to have been cooler than cover types lacking a canopy. Wildlife conservation and management naturally focuses on preferred habitats, particularly those that fulfill essentially all foraging requirements. However, habitats used preferentially under stressful weather conditions, even if used rarely overall, can also form a critical part of a species' overall needs.

AB  - Simple Summary Conservation strategies often involve reintroducing species back into parts of their historic range where they no longer occur. Reintroduction efforts can be complicated when there are native species present that might compete with the reintroduced species. Exploring the relationship between the existing and reintroduced species can improve the success of reintroduction efforts. Using information from camera-traps, we examined the extent to which reintroduced oryx and native gazelle display similar activity and space use patterns in Sidi Toui National Park, Tunisia. The two species exhibited minimal spatial overlap within the park and favoured habitats with different vegetation features. Activity patterns relative to time of day and season were similar for oryx and gazelle. Both antelope species were most active at dawn and dusk. Seasonally, activity was lowest for both when conditions were hot and dry and was highest following the rainy season in spring, when new vegetation emerged. The differences in space use patterns can facilitate coexistence between the two species of grazers in Sidi Toui National Park. Habitat diversity can be a key determinant for allowing reintroduced and native species to coexist.Abstract Examining the distribution patterns and spatiotemporal niche overlap of sympatric species is crucial for understanding core concepts in community ecology and for the effective management of multi-species habitats within shared landscapes. Using data from 26 camera-traps, recorded over two years (December 2020-November 2022), in Sidi Toui National Park (STNP), Tunisia, we investigate habitat use and activity patterns of the scimitar-horned oryx (n = 1865 captures) and dorcas gazelle (n = 1208 captures). Using information theory and multi-model inference methods, along with the Pianka index, we evaluated the habitat characteristics influencing species distribution and their spatial niche overlap. To delineate daily activity patterns, we applied kernel density estimation. Our findings indicate minimal spatial overlap and distinct environmental factors determining suitable habitats for each species. Furthermore, we found significant temporal niche overlaps, indicative of synchrony in daily activity patterns, with both species showing peak activity at dawn and dusk. Our results indicated that oryx and gazelle differ in at least one dimension of their ecological niche at the current density levels, which contributes to their long-term and stable coexistence in STNP.

AB  - Purpose Soil diaspore banks of bryophytes are poorly known in tundra grasslands, yet can be important for the maintenance of local bryophyte assemblages. We examined the effects of fertilization and grazing exclusion on above-ground bryophyte assemblages and soil diaspore banks in a tundra grassland. Methods We collected soil diaspore samples and recorded the cover of above-ground bryophytes from a full-factorial experiment with NPK fertilization and grazing exclusion treatments (a Nutrient Network site in NW Finland). Soil diaspore samples were germinated on trays in a greenhouse. We analyzed the compositions of diaspore bank assemblages and of above-ground assemblages and assessed their responses to the experimental treatments. Results The diaspore bank contained c. 50% of taxa found in above-ground assemblages; 26 bryophyte taxa germinated from the diaspore bank, while 40 taxa were found in the above-ground assemblages. These communities had distinct species compositions: the diaspore bank was dominated by Pohlia nutans, while above-ground assemblages were dominated by several species. NPK fertilization and grazing exclusion had negative effects on bryophyte richness and cover in above-ground assemblages, and weaker effects on these responses in the diaspore bank. Conclusion Soil diaspore banks comprise about half of the bryophyte taxa encountered in above-ground assemblages. Bryophyte diaspore banks are more buffered against nutrient enrichment and grazing exclusion than above-ground assemblages, suggesting that diaspore banks may enhance persistence and recovery of local bryophyte assemblages from environmental changes.

AB  - Wildlife conservation relies heavily on the identification and mapping of species' geographic distributions. Many species face habitat loss and even extinction due to an increasingly fragile climate and the threat of human-induced changes. This study aims to model suitable habitats for African buffaloes using an ensemble approach. The datasets used include bioclimatic variables (temperature and precipitation), land use and land cover, normalised difference vegetation index, normalised difference built-up index, slope, proximity to settlements, and proximity to water sources. Multicollinearity analysis was used to test the correlation among the variables. An ensemble model predicting suitable habitats for the African buffaloes for the wet season (MAM) and dry season (JAS) in 2009, 2016, and 2023 was created by taking the geometric mean of three independent models: maximum entropy, random forest, and support vector machine. Results indicated that temperature and precipitation contributed the most during the modelling process. The results further indicated that from 2009 to 2023, the areal percentage of high and moderate potential areas reduced by 4.3% (158.13 km2) and 30.5% (1071.43 km2), respectively, while low potential areas increased by 2.2% (1229.56 km2) in MAM. Additionally, high and moderate potential areas decreased by 4.9% (177.88 km2) and 25.8% (966.16 km2), respectively, while the low potential areas increased by 2.0% (1144.04 km2) in JAS. The models' accuracy was evaluated using the area under curve (AUC), yielding AUC scores >= 0.96 for both seasons in each epoch, which was good. These results are valuable in supporting the conservation of buffaloes under changing climatic and environmental conditions.

AB  - Current genetic methods of population assessment in conservation biology have been challenged by genome-scale analyses due to their quantitatively novel insights. These analyses include assessments of runs-of-homozygosity (ROH), genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP), and mutational load. Here, we aim to elucidate the relationships between these measures using three divergent ungulates: white-tailed deer, caribou, and mountain goat. The white-tailed deer is currently expanding, while caribou are in the midst of a significant decline. Mountain goats remain stable, having suffered a large historical bottleneck. We assessed genome-wide signatures of inbreeding using the inbreeding coefficient F and %ROH (F-ROH) and identified evolutionarily constrained regions with GERP. Mutational load was estimated by identifying mutations in highly constrained elements (CEs) and sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) mutations. Our results showed that F and F-ROH are higher in mountain goats than in caribou and white-tailed deer. Given the extended bottleneck and low N-e of the mountain goat, this supports the idea that the genome-wide effects of demographic change take time to accrue. Similarly, we found that mountain goats possess more highly constrained CEs and the lowest dN/dS values, both of which are indicative of greater purifying selection; this is also reflected by fewer mutations in CEs and deleterious mutations identified by SIFT. In contrast, white-tailed deer presented the highest mutational load with both metrics, in addition to dN/dS, while caribou were intermediate. Our results demonstrate that extended bottlenecks may lead to reduced diversity and increased F-ROH in ungulates, but not necessarily an increase in mutational load, probably due to the purging of deleterious alleles in small populations.

AB  - It is well established that climate warming has become a growing issue globally, posing a threat to native ecosystems. Alpine ecosystems, such as meadows of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, are expected to be particularly sensitive to warming given current temperature constraints. While many studies have explored the effects of warming on aboveground ecosystems and edaphic properties, few studies have assessed the effects on soil biota. We assessed edaphic, plant, microbial and nematode responses to warming ina long-term (8 year) multilevel warming experiment and applied piecewise structural equation modelling to reveal how warming affected nematode communities directly and indirectly via biotic and abiotic factors. We found that (1) warming had a significant effect on nematode community composition, which was mainly due to direct warming effects on herbivores and omnivore-predatory nematode composition; (2) warming affected nematode richness mainly through effects on bacterial richness, with a strong negative relationship between bacterial richness and bacterivore richness as well as bacterivore richness and omnivore-predatory richness; and, (3) the predominantly direct effect of warming on nematode biomass was mainly due to significant responses of omnivore-predatory biomass. Our study provides insight into the effects of long-term warming on nematode communities and highlights the contrasting responses of composition, diversity and biomass to warming. It contributes to forecasting warming effects on the structure of soil food webs and ecosystem functioning on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau in the future.

AB  - 1. The diversity in meadows is affected by numerous aspects, such as the amount and type of fertilisation and the timing and frequency of cutting. The effects of mowing on the diversity of plants and insects have been studied in detail. However, the effect of mulching (vegetation is cut, shredded, and left in place, instead of being removed) on insects in small forest meadows has received limited scrutiny to date.2. In this study, we examined how different mulching times influenced insect diversity of forest meadows. We sampled insect larvae and observed flower-visiting insects at 24 sites in the Northern Black Forest in south-west Germany. We applied four treatments with six replicates each: (i) mulching in June, (ii) mulching in September, (iii) mulching in June and September, and (iv) no mulching as a control.3. The overall larval community was dominated by Symphyta (45%, Hymenoptera) and Lepidoptera (44%). The flower-visiting insect community was dominated by Syrphidae (80%, Diptera).4. The insect larvae were negatively influenced by all mulching treatments. The abundance and species richness of flower visitors was reduced by mulching in June only and by mulching in both June and September.5. Summary: Given that meadow management is required for conserving grassland diversity our results indicate that for insect larvae other mulching methods, than those we tested, such as mulching with an arthropod-friendly mulching machine, strip-mulching, or delayed mulching may help this crucial stage of insect development. For insect flower visitors mulching in September is beneficial.

AB  - Grassland systems constitute a significant portion of the land area in the United States and as a result harbors significant arthropod biodiversity. During this time of biodiversity loss around the world, bioinventories of ecologically important habitats serve as important indicators for the effectiveness of conservation efforts. We conducted a bioinventory of the foliar, soil, and dung arthropod communities in 10 cattle pastures located in the southeastern United States during the 2018 grazing season. In sum, 126,251 arthropod specimens were collected. From the foliar community, 13 arthropod orders were observed, with the greatest species richness found in Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Hemiptera. The soil-dwelling arthropod community contained 18 orders. The three orders comprising the highest species richness were Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera. Lastly, 12 arthropod orders were collected from cattle dung, with the greatest species richness found in Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera. Herbivores were the most abundant functional guild found in the foliar community, and predators were most abundant in the soil and dung communities. Arthropod pests constituted a small portion of the pasture arthropod communities, with 1.01%, 0.34%, and 0.46% pests found in the foliar, soil, and dung communities, respectively. While bioinventories demand considerable time, energy, and resources to accomplish, the information from these inventories has many uses for conservation efforts, land management recommendations, and the direction of climate change science.

AB  - Dryland agriculture has extensive impacts on surrounding ecosystems through its unintentional provision of food and water resources to local wildlife. We analyzed the response of a predator community of jackals, wolves and foxes to land-management choices, and how that response in turn affects native gazelles and Acacia vegetation in the Arava Valley of Israel. This hyperarid region is characterized by contrasting regimes comprising privatized (Moshavim) and communal (Kibbutzim) agricultural settlements, which provides ideal conditions for evaluating how land-management differences translate into crop choices, affecting resource availability and ecosystem changes. Integrating multi-year field observations of predators and gazelles with agricultural datasets, we show that shifts in land-use strategies have cascading ecological impacts. This is evident in the association of date orchards, an expanding land use especially in Kibbutzim, with shifts in the geographical and seasonal distributions of predators. Increased predator presence due to resource availability has displaced gazelles farther from settlements, subsequently impacting Acacia seed dispersal and recruitment. Considering the global expansion of dryland agriculture, the evidence of such socio-ecological cascading effects suggests the necessity to approach agricultural management at the landscape scale in desert regions.

AB  - It is well understood, that grazing and browsing in the African savanna ecosystem modulates tree-grass ratios. However, many of the large mammals are under pressure due to land use and climate change. It is challenging to predict how their altered abundance or range shifts will interact with savanna structure. Herbivore exclusion experiments can help to better understand the impacts of herbivores of different sizes on vegetation structure and composition, including interactions with rainfall. Here, we combine field data of the Ungulate Herbivory Under Rainfall Uncertainty (UHURU) exclusion experiment and high spatial resolution satellite images of the Planet- Scope and Sentinel-2 series to investigate the impacts of herbivores on vegetation structure in a Kenyan savanna. Field data as well as NDVI values derived from Sentinel-2 and NDVI contrast values of PlanetScope show that presence of herbivores lowers vegetation cover and modify the woody vegetation structure depending on which herbivores are present. The vegetation grew tallest when mega-sized herbivores were absent but meso-sized and small herbivores were present, which resulted in high NDVI contrast values. The absence of herbivores resulted in fewer bare ground patches and increased green biomass, such as a higher mean canopy width, which led to higher NDVI values. Few studies have explored the potential of passive remote sensing data to assess herbivory impacts beyond the plot scale and over longer time-periods; however, these previous studies solely focused on the NDVI. Here we demonstrate the added value of also using GLCM texture measures to investigate effects on a savanna ecosystem in response to presence or absence of herbivores. Combining these data with plot measurements our study demonstrates the benefits of combining field and space perspectives in ecosystem studies.

AB  - Understanding fire and large herbivore interactions in interior western forests is critical, owing to the extensive and widespread co-occurrence of these two disturbance types and multiple present and future implications for forest resilience, conservation and restoration. However, manipulative studies focused on interactions and outcomes associated with these two disturbances are rare in forested rangelands. We investigated understory vegetation response to 5-year spring and fall prescribed fire and domestic cattle grazing exclusion in ponderosa pine stands and reported long-term responses, almost two decades after the first entry fires. In fall burn areas open to cattle grazing, total understory cover prior to utilization was about 12% lower compared with fall burn areas where cattle were experimentally excluded. This response was not strongly driven by a particular palatable or unpalatable plant functional group. Fire and grazing are likely interacting in a numerically mediated process, as we found little evidence to support a functionally moderated pathway. Post-fire green-up may equalize forage to a certain extent and concentrate herbivores in the smaller burned areas within pastures, constraining a positive understory response to burning. Fall fire and grazing also increased annual forbs and resprouting shrubs. The effects of spring burning were relatively minor, and we found no interaction with grazing. The nonnative annual grass Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) remains a problematic invader linked to fall burning but not grazing in stands that had higher propagule pressure when the experiment was initiated. At these sites, exotic grass was a major component of the vegetation by 2015, and invasion was also increasing in spring burn and unburned areas. Information from our study suggests that frequent fall fires and cattle grazing combined may reduce understory resilience in similar dry ponderosa pine forests. Consideration of longer fire return intervals, resting areas after fire, virtual fencing, or burning entire pastures may help to mitigate the effects noted in this study.

AB  - Context. High density deer populations can cause ecological damage, yet their distribution and impacts are poorly known across much of Australia. As a result, land managers rely on anecdotal reports to make decisions about management and control measures. Aims. We aimed to model habitat suitability for deer in the South Coast of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, to be used as a baseline for future management and identify which threatened ecological communities (TECs) in the region are at greatest current risk of being occupied by deer. Methods. We compiled 678 presence-only records of wild deer from online databases, observations made by National Parks and Wildlife Service field staff and field-based surveys. We combined these observations with eight environmental variables to model and map habitat suitability for deer across our study area using maximum entropy. Three spatial models of habitat suitability across our study area were produced: one for all deer species; and two species-specific models for fallow and sambar deer. Key results. Our models indicate that suitable habitat for deer exists throughout much of the South Coast of NSW. Of the TECs examined, Coastal Saltmarsh, Themeda Grassland, and Swamp Sclerophyll Forest had the highest proportion of area likely to be extremely suitable for deer and thus should be prioritised for protection within our study area. Conclusions. Further systematic field-based surveys are needed to improve the quality of models in this region.

AB  - Habitat selection is a dynamic biological process where species respond to spatiotemporal variation in resource availability. The resulting distribution patterns can be detected as presence-absence or heterogeneity in abundance and indicate habitat preferences based on environmental correlations at multiple scales. Variation in habitat selection by ungulates is constrained by trade-offs in top-down and bottom-up trophic processes arising from differences in forage requirements, water dependency, anthropogenic effects, and predation avoidance, and mediated by physiological (feeding guild) and morphological (body size) factors. We conducted distance sampling over 7 years in the Tarangire Ecosystem (TE) of northern Tanzania for six resident ungulate species: Kirk's dik-dik (Madoqua kirkii), Grant's gazelle (Nanger granti), Thomson's gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii), Masai giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi), impala (Aepyceros melampus), and common waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), and tested hypotheses related to effects of top-down and bottom-up processes on ungulate presence and abundance. We modeled ecological correlates against two distributional responses to understand which environmental factors constrained these ungulate species at different scales; (i) presence-absence observations modeled in a logistic regression to assess habitat selection at an ecosystem scale; (ii) local abundances from presence-only observations modeled using a negative binomial distribution for finer-scale selection. Browser and grazer species in the TE selected suitable habitat proximal to rivers and avoided the Combretum-Azanza woody plant assemblage. Browsers and grazers also showed strong preference for habitat with more dense cover of preferred forage species, and abundance was influenced by the presence of specific forage species with significant seasonal variation. Mixed feeders were more heterogeneous in habitat suitability implying that broader diets allow avoidance of areas with high human activity. Small-bodied and dehydration-sensitive species selected areas near rivers and seasonal tributaries. Seasonal habitat selection was more pronounced among mixed feeders. Conservation strategies based on spatially and seasonally explicit resource selection studies such as ours can minimize impacts to biodiversity by protecting vital resources to ungulates through all seasons of the year.

AB  - Urbanization is among the main drivers of global biodiversity changes. Urban areas are increasing faster, particularly in global biodiversity hotspots. Therefore, more evidence is needed on how urban gradients drive plant traits and interactions with herbivores in neotropical regions. Here, we investigated how urbanization intensity and habitat permeability affect metrics (species richness, composition and vegetation cover), functional traits, and herbivory of plant communities, focusing on spontaneous native and non-native species in a neotropical city in Brazil. Non-native species represented 64.6 % of the occurrences, and habitat permeability had a stronger influence on plant communities than urbanization intensity. The intensity of urbanization decreased the species richness and increased the specific leaf area in native and non-natives plants. Habitat permeability also affected species composition. Permeable habitats had higher vegetation cover, herbivory, and height of the non-native communities. Life forms as geophyte for non-natives, chamaephyte, and hemicryptophyte for natives, and zoochoric dispersal syndrome were more frequent in permeable habitats. Impermeable habitats had higher frequencies of therophyte life form, and autochoric dispersal syndrome for native species. The higher vegetation cover, the lower direct interference from humans, and the permeability of habitats allowed more different functional traits within plant community and more interactions between plants and herbivores along the urbanization intensity gradient. The permeability of urban habitats, in a medium-sized neotropical city, has greater influence on the variation of the plant community than the intensity of urbanization. This highlights the importance of the presence of permeable areas in supporting plant biodiversity within highly paved urban gradients.

AB  - 1. Insect herbivory is a key process in ecosystem functioning. While theory predicts that plant diversity modulates herbivory, the mechanistic links remain unclear. We postulated that the plant metabolome mechanistically links plant diversity and herbivory. 2. In late summer and in spring, we assessed individual plant above-ground herbivory rates and metabolomes of seven plant species in experimental plant communities varying in plant species diversity and resource acquisition strategies. In the same communities, we also measured plant individual biomass as well as soil microbial and nematode community composition. 3. Herbivory rates decreased with increasing plant species richness. Path modelling revealed that plant species richness and community resource acquisition strategy correlated with soil community composition. In particular, changes in nematode community composition were related to plant metabolome composition and thereby herbivory rates. 4. Synthesis. These results suggest that soil community composition plays an important role in reducing herbivory rates with increasing plant diversity by changing plant metabolomes.

AB  - Translocation of wildlife species from one area to another is a conservation tool that contributes to the restoration of depleted populations, augments declining populations, or establishes of new populations. This paper documents one of the first studies examining in detail stakeholders' perceptions of the factors influencing the outcomes of translocations of wildlife into a community conservation area, using the case of eland (Taurotragus oryx) translocations into the Nyae Nyae Conservancy in Namibia. The translocations took place between 2000 and 2005 as part of the national community-based natural resource management programme and were monitored through annual waterpoint counts. These data on perceptions were collected through a household survey and focused group discussions involving community members and leaders and key informant interviews with external stakeholders. Community members' perceptions could not confirm that the translocated eland decreased or increased, however, reflected that eland individuals moved away from the release site soon after translocation to more distant locations further away from human settlements. The outcomes of the translocations were perceived to be most strongly associated with anthropogenic factors compared to habitat or environmental factors. However, stakeholders exhibited divergent perceptions regarding which of the anthropogenic factors was of most importance, particularly with respect to the roles of the different types of hunting, and to a lesser degree, the role of traditional burning of landscapes on translocation outcomes. The paper illustrates the complexities associated with translocations of wildlife into community conservation areas compared to state protected areas, given the strong influence of human disturbances on translocation success. It highlights the importance of understanding the social factors influencing how and why translocated individuals may adapt well or poorly to their new environment. Building this understanding is essential to improving the outcomes of similar translocations in the future.

AB  - Herbivores and fire are important consumers of plant biomass that influence vegetation structure, nutrient cycling, and biodiversity globally. Departures from historic biomass consumption patterns due to wild herbivore losses, livestock proliferation, and altered fire regimes can have critical ecological consequences. We set out to (i) understand how consumer dominance and prevalence responded to spatial and temporal moisture gradients in Holocene North America and (ii) examine how past and present consumer dominance patterns in North America compare to less altered consumer regimes of modern Sub-Saharan Africa. We developed long-term records of bison abundance and biomass burning in Holocene midcontinent North America and compared these records to reconstructions of moisture availability and vegetation structure. We used these reconstructions to characterize bison and fire prevalence across associated moisture and vegetation gradients. We found that bison herbivory dominated biomass consumption in dry settings whereas fire dominated in wetter environments. Historical distributions of herbivory and burning in midcontinent North America resemble those of contemporary Sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting disturbance feedbacks and interactions regulate long-term consumer dynamics. Comparisons of consumer dynamics in contemporary North America with Holocene North America and Sub-Saharan Africa also reveal that fire is functionally absent from regions where it was once common, with profound ecological implications.

AB  - The historic western edge of the bison (Bison bison) range and the ecological processes that caused its formation are frequently debated with important implications for bison restoration across North America. We test the hypothesis that a combination of bottom-up habitat suitability and top-down harvest pressure from Indigenous peoples were important processes in forming the western edge of bison distribution. Using 9384 historical journal observations from 1691-1928, we employ MaxEnt ecological niche modelling to identify suitable bison habitat across the Western Cordillera from bottom-up climatic, land cover, and topographic factors. We then use mixed-effect logistic regression to test if bison occurrence in journal records can be in part explained by the abundance of humans, wolves, or grizzly bears, in addition to MaxEnt-derived habitat suitability. We find support for our hypothesis because of the limited suitable habitat in the Rocky Mountains that likely prevented westward bison dispersal from their core habitat, and there was a negative relationship between bison occurrence and human harvest pressure. On this basis, we propose that intensive human harvest from large populations in the Western Cordillera, subsidized by other wildlife, salmon, and vegetation resources, is an underappreciated socioecological process that needs to be restored alongside bison populations. Co-managing bison with Indigenous peoples will also mitigate the adverse effects of overabundant bison populations and maximize the ecological and cultural benefits of bison restoration.

AB  - The Great Amazon Reef System (GARS) is an ecosystem amid major economic and environmental disagreements. Besides the eminent threats from oil and gas exploration in its surroundings, the reefs are also exposed to intense fishing pressure, including destructive practices such as bottom gillnetting and trawling. We assessed the richness of benthic sessile invertebrates (Cnidaria and Porifera) and associated taxa (Echinodermata) to report the impacts from fisheries bycatch on the GARS. A taxonomic survey was carried out based on photographic records and notes (dates and geographic coordinates) made by onboard observers at more than 200 stations sampled over approximately 42.000 km2. The photographic records were made from invertebrates incidentally collected through four fishing gears: bottom trawling, shrimp trawling, bottom gillnet ("rede de ca & ccedil;oeira"), and pit trap ("manzua<acute accent>"). These gears were used to sample 209 fishing stations, including benthic invertebrates as bycatch. We also assessed literature records on the distribution of benthic invertebrates to check for overlaps between reef benthic communities and fishing effort. A total of 54 species were recorded as bycatch. Richness was highest for the Phylum Echinodermata. Among the structuring taxa, Cnidaria was the richest, with the Class Anthozoa represented mainly by scleractinian corals (seven species, 24 stations) and gorgonians (seven species, 26 stations), whereas hydrozoans were more frequent (five species, 50 stations). The distribution of the hydrocoral Stylaster roseus was extended to the north. Porifera had 16 species and were dominated by the class Demospongiae in 8 Orders. We show here that gillnet and trawling fisheries pose significant threats to reef integrity by removing sessile key species as bycatch. Fishery pressures on GARS are mainly concentrated in the areas where habitat-forming species occur, thus threatening a broad diversity of benthic reef organisms. Corals and sponges are selectively impacted by traps and gillnets. In the long term, fisheries bycatch may impose profound disturbances to benthic reef communities and decline fishery yields. Our results reinforce the urgent need for a systematic conservation approach to reconcile extractive activities with conservation goals.

AB  - The grazing activity of animals has a significant role on the environmental modification of land. In the coastal wetlands of eastern China, long-term David deer (Elaphurus davidianus) grazing has caused the degradation of various ecological elements in the area. Still, few studies have been reported concerning the effects of David deer grazing on the soil microorganisms of their habitats. We analyzed the community structure of soil bacteria and fungi in an area of continuous annual grazing and another area without traces of David deer grazing so as to learn about the effects of deer grazing on the soil microbial community structure in a spatial instead of temporal way, in preparation for improving the environment for deer survival. David deer grazing drastically changed the physicochemical characteristics of the soil, accelerating the alkalinization process and inhibiting the buildup of nutrients. There were differences in the microbial community structure between the grazed and the control areas, with bacteria predominating. The control had a higher level of bacterial and fungal alpha-diversity than the grazed area. The makeup of the soil's microbial community was also influenced, except for the dominant microbial at the phylum level. In addition to the establishment of numerous complex fungal functional types, David deer grazing increased the number of bacterial functional types linked to the carbon cycle. The impacts of soil pH and urease activity on bacterial and fungi populations were highlighted using the redundancy analysis. This study demonstrates that David deer grazing changes and complicates microbial functional kinds of composition, as well as modifies the composition of the soil's microbial community, improving the soil nutrient cycling process, mainly the carbon element.

AB  - Choosing appropriate forest restoration interventions is challenging. Natural regeneration can rapidly facilitate forest recovery in many situations. However, barriers such as dispersal limitation and competition with non-native species can require assisted restoration approaches to facilitate plant community recovery. We used a study that has directly compared the outcomes of tropical wet forest restoration interventions across 11 replicate sites in southern Costa Rica. Within this framework, we examined the functional recovery trajectories of recruiting tree sapling communities across a gradient of restoration interventions including low (natural regeneration), intermediate (applied nucleation), and high (plantation) initial resource-investment, which we compared to remnant reference forest. We collated leaf and stem functional traits for tree species that comprised the bulk of recruiting saplings, then determined how community-weighted trait means and functional diversity metrics changed over a decade across treatments. Results show that assisted restoration approaches (applied nucleation, plantation) sped the development of more functionally diverse tree communities, more than tripling the functional richness (FRic) of recruiting communities when compared to natural regeneration. However, functional dispersion (i.e., the trait range of dominant species) was equivalent across interventions, and between 28 and 44% lower than remnant forest, indicating that increases in FRic under assisted restoration were driven by species recruiting in low abundances (<10 individuals across treatments). Recruits in assisted restoration treatments also had 10-15% tougher, less-palatable leaves, and leaves were even tougher in reference forest, which could be driven by increasing herbivory pressure along the gradient of interventions. Results show that tracking simple metrics such as species richness can mask a more mechanistic understanding of ecosystem recovery that is elucidated by taking a functional trait-driven approach toward evaluating outcomes. For example, our work identified a paucity of dense-wooded species recruiting across restoration interventions, wood density was 11-13% lower in restoration treatments than reference forests, underscoring such species as prime targets for enrichment planting. Overall, findings suggest that assisted restoration can catalyze the functional recovery of naturally recruiting tree communities in landscapes that are slow to recover naturally and highlight the importance of evaluating how different components of functional diversity shift over time to fully understand restoration outcomes.

AB  - Polymorphism for immune functions can explain significant variation in health and reproductive success within species. Drastic loss in genetic diversity at such loci constitutes an extinction risk and should be monitored in species of conservation concern. However, effective implementations of genome-wide immune polymorphism sets into high-throughput genotyping assays are scarce. Here, we report the design and validation of a microfluidics-based amplicon sequencing assay to comprehensively capture genetic variation in Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). This species represents one of the most successful large mammal restorations recovering from a severely depressed census size and a massive loss in diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We analysed 65 whole-genome sequencing sets of the Alpine ibex and related species to select the most representative markers and to prevent primer binding failures. In total, we designed similar to 1,000 amplicons densely covering the MHC, further immunity-related genes as well as randomly selected genome-wide markers for the assessment of neutral population structure. Our analysis of 158 individuals shows that the genome-wide markers perform equally well at resolving population structure as RAD-sequencing or low-coverage genome sequencing data sets. Immunity-related loci show unexpectedly high degrees of genetic differentiation within the species. Such information can now be used to define highly targeted individual translocations. Our design strategy can be realistically implemented into genetic surveys of a large range of species. In conclusion, leveraging whole-genome sequencing data sets to design targeted amplicon assays allows the simultaneous monitoring of multiple genetic risk factors and can be translated into species conservation recommendations.

AB  - The mechanisms of interactions between apex and smaller carnivores may range from competition to facilitation. Conversely, interactions between predators and prey are mainly driven by the prey reducing the likelihood of encounters with predators. In this study, we investigated (1) the spatiotemporal interactions between an apex (the snow leopard) and a meso-predator (the red fox), and (2) the temporal interactions between the snow leopard and its potential prey (Siberian ibex, argali, Asian wild ass, Tolai hare) through camera trapping in the Mongolian Great Gobi-A. The probability of occurrence for the red fox was higher in the presence of the snow leopard than in its absence. Moreover, the red fox activity pattern matched that of the snow leopard, with both species mostly active at sunset. This positive spatiotemporal interaction suggests that the presence of the snow leopard may be beneficial for the red fox in terms of scavenging opportunities. However, other explanations may also be possible. Amongst prey, the Siberian ibex and the argali were mainly active during the day, whereas the Asian wild ass and the Tolai hare were more nocturnal. These findings suggest that potential prey (especially the Siberian ibex and the argali) may shape their behavior to decrease the opportunity for encounters with the snow leopard. Our results have revealed complex interactions between apex and smaller predators and between apex predator and its potential prey.

AB  - Restoring populations of large mammals in human-dominated landscapes requires careful planning of conservation strategies. To support such planning for the European bison (Bison bonasus), Europe's largest land mammal currently constrained to small and isolated populations, we parameterized an individual-based, spatially-explicit metapopulation model. We then systematically assessed the impacts of three conservation interventions: 1) connectivity restoration with wildlife overpasses, 2) additional reintroductions, and 3) reduced supplementary feeding to encourage dispersal. Our baseline model projected a doubling of bison abundance in Central Europe within 30 years to >2250 females (in 20 occupied habitat patches), reaching >4300 females (38 patches) within 100 years. Yet subpopulations often remained isolated, highlighting the need for interventions to increase connectivity to prevent a further erosion of already low genetic diversity. Of the interventions we tested, reintroductions were most effective (5 % abundance increase, 10 % patch occupancy increase, on average, after 50 years) and helped establish larger metapopulations that are important for maintaining genetic diversity. Individual wildlife overpasses had a small effect (1 % range increase). Reducing supplementary feeding did not promote range expansion and slightly slowed population growth. We found that the five extant subpopulations in north-eastern Poland could form a viable metapopulation and identified two additional promising regions for such metapopulations: (1) Western Poland/Eastern Germany, and (2) the Eastern Carpathians in Poland/ Slovakia. Overall, our findings underscore the potential for European megafauna recovery, highlight the key role of reintroductions to help megafauna reclaim their historical ranges, and can guide more fine-scale assessments of the social-ecological feasibility of such recoveries.

AB  - As the climate warms, endotherms are challenged with maintaining body temperature within a neutral range. Modifying behaviour to mitigate heat loads is a potentially low-cost response to avoid heat stress and may be critical to persistence in a changing environment, especially for large endotherms. We tested the hypothesis that bed sites are a thermal refuge and means of behavioural mitigation of heat loads for a large temperate ungulate especially prone to heat stress, the Shiras moose, Alces alces shirasi. We predicted that if bed sites are a thermal refuge, selection of bed sites should be consistent with sites that reduce heat gain or increase heat loss via convection or conduction. Moose selected cool bed sites with a substrate that was moist, wet or had standing water, and avoided bedding in open or sparse vegetation. On warm days and during the warmest periods of the day, moose increased selection for wet substrate and for bed sites in standing water with sparse vegetation, which they avoided on cool days and during cool periods of the day. Strong and context-dependent selection for bed sites that would reduce heat gain and ameliorate heat load supports the notion that bed sites are a thermal refuge and a way to behaviourally mitigate warming temperatures. Flexibility in habitat selection may be a primary way for large endotherms to combat a warming climate, although doing so is contingent on habitat assemblages that offer thermal refuge to limit heat gain and importantly, facilitate heat loss.

AB  - Rangelands may offer valuable habitat for invertebrate wildlife, helping conserve ecologically and economically significant organisms, like native bees. In some systems, livestock may affect bees by consuming or trampling blooming plants that bees rely on for food. One potential way to reduce potential negative effects of livestock on bees is to delay grazing on floristically rich parts of the landscape until after peak bloom (i.e., phenologically targeted grazing). To test the outcome of this method, we collected bees using pan traps and counted blooming stems from May to September in grazed and ungrazed sites. Our sites were located in two experimental cattle grazing systems in the Pacific Northwest, United States, in which cattle turnout did not occur until after peak forb bloom. One system was located in bunchgrass prairie, and the other was located in riparian meadows. Our objectives were to 1) quantify seasonal variation in bee and blooming plant communities and 2) measure how or if these communities responded to grazing. In both systems, bee and bloom species richness peaked in June and bloom abundance and diversity were highest in May and June. Bee abundance and diversity were more variable throughout the season. We observed significantly lower abundance, richness, and diversity of blooming species in the riparian system in response to grazing, potentially decreasing floral resource availability for bees, but did not detect a concomitant negative effect on bees. In the bunchgrass system, we observed no significant negative effects of grazing on bees or blooming plants. This suggests that for areas with high-quality bee habitat, site-specific, phenologically targeted grazing may moderate negative effects of livestock on bee and plant communities. Range managers could use alternative grazing locations (e.g., old fields, early senescing sites, more intensively managed pastures), if available, during peak bloom to mitigate potential herbivory effects on bees and blooms. & COPY; 2023 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - Recolonization of predators to their former ranges is becoming increasingly prevalent. Such recolonization places predators among their prey once again; the latter having lived without predation (from such predators) for a considerable time. This renewed coexistence creates opportunities to explore predation ecology at both fundamental and applied levels. We used a paired experimental design to investigate white-tailed deer risk allocation in the Upper and Lower Peninsulas (UP and LP) in Michigan, USA. Wolves are functionally absent in the LP, while deer in the UP coexist with a re-established wolf population. We treated 15 sites each in UP and LP with wolf olfactory cues and observed deer vigilance, activity, and visitation rates at the interface of habitat covariates using remote cameras. Such a paired design across wolf versus no-wolf areas allowed us to examine indirect predation effects while accounting for confounding parameters such as the presence of other predators and human activity. While wolf urine had no effect across most metrics in both UP and LP, we observed differences in deer activity in areas with versus without wolves. Sites treated with wolf urine in the UP showed a reduction in crepuscular deer activity, compared to control/novel-scent treated sites. Furthermore, we observed a strong positive effect of vegetation cover on deer vigilance in these sites. This indicates that simulated predator cues likely affect deer vigilance more acutely in denser habitats, which presumably facilitates predation success. Such responses were however absent among deer in the LP that are presumably naive toward wolf predation. Where human and non-human predators hunt shared prey, such as in Michigan, predators may constrain human hunting success by increasing deer vigilance. Hunters may avoid such exploitative competition by choosing hunting/bait sites located in open areas. Our results pertaining to fundamental predation ecology have strong applied implications that can promote human-predator coexistence.
   Recolonizing and reintroduced predators are increasingly common. We investigated the reaction of two different white-tailed deer populations (a wolf-savvy and a wolf-naive population) to wolf olfactory cues at hunter-bait sites. We found that habitat affected deer vigilance rather than the presence of wolf olfactory cues.image

AB  - The term pyric herbivory was first introduced in 2009, describing how fire shapes herbivory as burned areas attract herbivores and, simultaneously, herbivory shapes fuel load and fire behaviour. Pyric herbivory results in a mosaic of patches with varying levels of herbivory and grazing intensity fire intensity and frequency. The importance of pyric herbivory for ecosystem heterogeneity and biodiversity has been described for North American, Australian and African systems, but the concept remains largely untested in a European context. We introduced fire and herbivory in a full-factorial experiment in a temperate European wood-pasture system to test whether pyric herbivory operates in ways comparable to grassy systems elsewhere in the world. Using camera traps, we observed the behaviour of cattle in burned subplots (49 m2) compared with unburned subplots. We measured grass height and the proportion of the subplot that burned as variables affecting cattle preference and to assess how grazing affects fire behaviour. We also examined the effect on plant species and life-form composition after six seasons of treatment. Cattle spent more time grazing in burned than in unburned subplots in the most productive paddock, where a larger proportion of the subplot burned. The proportion of a subplot that burned was positively related to pre-fire grass height. Moreover, both grass height and the proportion of subplot burned declined in the burned subplots during the 6-year study period and fire and cattle grazing altered the relative cover of graminoids and shrubs (Rubus spp.), with more graminoids in grazed and/or burned subplots and more shrubs in ungrazed subplots at the end of the study. Synthesis and applications. In our temperate European wood pasture, fire and (cattle) grazing interacted in ways comparable to pyric herbivory in grassy ecosystems elsewhere in the world, especially in the most productive paddock. Fire attracted grazing, with cattle grazing longer on subplots that burned more fully. Grazing also affected fire, where over the course of our experiment cattle grazing reduced grass height and the proportion of a subplot that burned. We suggest that pyric herbivory is an interesting management method to further explore in the European context to address the loss of biodiversity in open ecosystems, particularly in more productive sites.

AB  - Populations of large herbivores, including members of the deer family Cervidae, are expanding across and within many regions of the northern hemisphere. Because their browsing on trees can result in economic losses to forestry and strongly affect ecosystems, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how best to mitigate resultant damage. Previous research has highlighted the importance of regulating deer density and the availability of alternative forage to reduce browsing damage levels in conifer production stands. However, often only one or two proxies of forage availability have been used instead of applying a broad foodscape approach and more knowledge is needed to understand which types of alternative forage best mitigate damage. We conducted field inventories of damage that occurred during the previous fall/winter in 112 production stands in southern Sweden, while also measuring forage availability and cervid faecal pellets in the surrounding landscape (16 ha). Local landowners provided data on supplementary feeding. We found that variation in cervid (Alces alces, Capreolus capreolus, Cervus elaphus and Dama dama) browsing damage to top shoots or stems of young Scots pine trees (Pinus sylvestris, hereon pine), was better explained by the availability of alternative natural forage (using several indices and species of trees and shrubs) than by supplementary feeding. The proportion of damaged pine trees was higher in stands with a lower density of pine stems; in landscapes with a lower density of key broadleaf tree species (genera Sorbus, Salix, Populus and Quercus); and in landscapes with more open land (agricultural fields and paddocks). Damage was also higher in stands where relatively large amounts of moose faeces was found, while not related to the amount of faeces from other cervid species. The amount of supplementary feed (silage or other types such as root vegetables) did not explain variation in pine damage, but the result was possibly affected by relatively few study areas supplying sufficient data on supplementary feeding. The results from our inventory illustrate the efficacy of using naturally growing forage to mitigate browsing damage to young pine trees in managed landscapes. Creation of such forage is also recommended over supplementary feeding because of co-benefits to forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB  - Simple Summary The wild boar population decreased drastically in Eastern Europe after the emergence of a viral disease called African Swine Fever. We studied how the gray wolves' diet changed in two regions in Belarus during this situation. Wolves mainly hunted wild boar, elk, red deer, roe deer and beaver. The decrease in the wild boar population caused changes in the diet of wolves, but only in Vitebsk region. After the decrease in the wild boar population, wolves in this region hunted wild boar less, but they hunted roe deer and red deer more. The more the wolves consumed wild boar, the less they consumed both deer species (roe deer and red deer). Moreover, the more the wolves consumed elk, the less they consumed beaver. In another region, Grodno, no changes in the wolves' diet were found. After the emergence of African swine fever (ASF), the wild boar population numbers fell drastically in Eastern Europe. This situation made it possible to verify the changes in the wolves' diet that occurred. The material collection was carried out in two regions, Grodno and Vitebsk, in Belarus. In total, 19 species/groups of prey were observed in the gray wolf diet, but the most important were wild boar, elk, red deer, roe deer and beaver. The decrease in the number of wild boar caused changes in the diet of wolves but only in Vitebsk region, where wolves' diet before the ASF epidemic outbreak consisted mainly of elk and wild boar. After the decrease of wild boar numbers, wolves still mainly hunted elk, but other types of prey included roe deer, red deer and beaver. We found a negative correlation between wild boar and both deer species (roe deer and red deer) in the wolves' diet. Moreover, the more the wolves consumed elk, the less they consumed beaver. In our opinion, only intensive hunting of wolves by humans can explain the resulting dietary fluctuations between elk and beaver, as well as the fact that wolves did not turn to other food sources.

AB  - Large carnivores play a key ecological role in nature, yet quantifying the effects of predation at large spatiotemporal scales remains challenging. Wolves and brown bears have recovered in Sweden, where they share the same staple prey, moose. This ecosystem is representative of the Eurasian boreal realm, and makes an interesting case study for exploring the use of hunter-collected observation data to understand the ecological effects of large carnivore recovery in human-dominated ecosystems. We used over 50 million hours of moose observation data collected by "citizen scientists" (i.e., moose hunters) between 2000 and 2017 to evaluate the role of recovering bear and wolf populations on an important ungulate vital rate, calf/cow ratio (the number of observed calves per female in fall). Calf/cow ratios were negatively correlated with both wolf and bear densities, suggesting that summer calf survival decreased via predation. Calf/cow ratios decreased by 7% and 17% in the northern and southern areas where bears and wolves were allopatric, respectively. Where wolves and bears were sympatric, the effect of predator densities was additive; calf/cow ratios decreased by 18%. However, both calf/cow ratios and moose densities declined over the last similar to 20 years across Sweden, including areas where wolves and bears were absent. While recolonizing large carnivores affected ungulate vital rates in Sweden's human-dominated landscape, they were likely not the primary driver of long-term moose population trends. Our results reinforce that citizen-collected data are a useful wildlife monitoring tool that help understand ecological processes, including the effects of recovering carnivores on prey populations.

AB  - Biological invasions are one of the main drivers of biodiversity decline worldwide. However, many associated extinctions are yet to occur, meaning that the ecological debt caused by invasive species could be considerable for biodiversity. We explore extinction scenarios due to invasive species and investigate whether paying off the current extinction debt will shift the global composition of mammals and birds in terms of ecological strategy and evolutionary history. Current studies mostly focus on the number of species potentially at risk due to invasions without taking into account species characteristics in terms of ecological or phylogenetic properties. We found that 11% of phylogenetic diversity worldwide is represented by invasive-threatened species. Furthermore, 14% of worldwide trait diversity is hosted by invasive-threatened mammals and 40% by invasive-threatened birds, with Neotropical and Oceanian realms being primary risk hotspots. Projected extinctions of invasive-threatened species result in a smaller reduction in ecological strategy space and evolutionary history than expected under randomized extinction scenarios. This can be explained by the strong pattern in the clustering of ecological profiles and families impacted by invasive alien species (IAS). However, our results confirm that IAS are likely to cause the selective loss of species with unique evolutionary and ecological profiles. Our results also suggest a global shift in species composition away from those with large body mass, which mostly feed in the lower foraging strata and have an herbivorous diet (mammals). Our findings demonstrate the potential impact of biological invasions on phylogenetic and trait dimensions of diversity, especially in the Oceanian realm. We therefore call for a more systematic integration of all facets of diversity when investigating the consequences of biological invasions in future studies. This would help to establish spatial prioritizations regarding IAS threats worldwide and anticipate the consequences of losing specific ecological profiles in the invaded community.

AB  - Watershed degradation due to invasion threatens downstream water flows and associated ecosystem services. While this topic has been studied across landscapes that have undergone invasive-driven state changes (e.g., native forest to invaded grassland), it is less well understood in ecosystems experiencing within-system invasion (e.g. native forest to invaded forest). To address this subject, we conducted an integrated ecological and ecohydrological study in tropical forests impacted by invasive plants and animals. We measured soil infiltration capacity in multiple fenced (i.e., ungulate-free)/unfenced and native/invaded forest site pairs along moisture and substrate age gradients across Hawaii to explore the effects of invasion on hydrological processes within tropical forests. We also characterized forest composition, structure and soil characteristics at these sites to assess the direct and vegetation-mediated impacts of invasive species on infiltration capacity. Our models show that invasive ungulates negatively affect soil infiltration capacity consistently across the wide moisture and substrate age gradients considered. Additionally, several soil characteristics known to be affected by invasive ungulates were associated with local infiltration rates, indicating that the long-term secondary effects of high ungulate densities in tropical forests may be stronger than effects observed in this study. The effect of invasive plants on infiltration was complex and likely to depend on their physiognomy within existing forest community structure. These results provide clear evidence for managers that invasive ungulate control efforts can improve ecohydrological function of mesic and wet forest systems critical to protecting downstream and nearshore resources and maintaining groundwater recharge.

AB  - Determining the environmental factors that contribute to food resource partitioning or overlap is key to understanding the mechanisms of multispecies coexistence. Two ruminants, the Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus) and the sika deer (Cervus nippon), occur sympatrically in Japan, and interspecific interactions between them regarding food resource utilization remain unclear. In this study, we compared the diets of these two sympatric ungulates in two contrasting habitats: a montane forest and an alpine grassland in Mt. Asama. The montane forest provides both broad-leaved trees and graminoids of relatively small quantity, while the alpine grassland provides abundant graminoids. In the montane forest, the serow fed mainly on dicot leaves while the deer fed mainly on graminoids, suggesting partitioning of food resources. By contrast, in the alpine grassland, both species fed mainly on graminoids, resulting in dietary overlap. These results suggest that these two species can partition food resources in habitats with diverse food resources, while their diets tend to overlap in habitats with simple food resource composition. Their coexistence was seemingly facilitated by food resource partitioning in the montane forest and by sharing abundant food in the alpine grassland, suggesting that competition between them is unlikely at this location.

AB  - Exotic plant species often negatively affect native herbivores due to the lack of palatability of the invading plant. Although often unsuitable as food, certain invasive species may provide non-nutritional ecological benefits through increased habitat structural complexity. To understand the potential for common invasive forest plant species of the eastern United States to benefit invertebrate communities, we examined the functional and taxonomic community composition of forest insects and spiders in long-term monitoring plots that contained invasive plant species. The extent of invasive plant species ground cover significantly altered spider community composition as categorized by hunting guild. Areas with higher invasive herbaceous and grass cover contained a higher abundance of space web-weaving and hunting spiders, respectively. Spider species richness and total invertebrate abundance also increased with greater invasive grass cover. Still, these trends were driven by just two invasive plant species, garlic mustard and Japanese stiltgrass, both of which have previously been shown to provide structural benefits to native invertebrate taxa. While these two species may improve the structural component of understory forest habitat, many invertebrate groups were not significantly correlated with other prevalent invasive plants and one species, mock strawberry, negatively affected the abundance of certain insect taxa. Particularly in forests with reduced native plant structure, invasive plant management must be conducted with consideration for holistic habitat quality, including both plant palatability and structure.

AB  - The hypothesized main drivers of megafauna extinctions in the late Quaternary have wavered between over-exploitation by humans and environmental change, with recent investigations demonstrating more nuanced synergies between these drivers depending on taxon, spatial scale, and region. However, most studies still rely on comparing archaeologically based chronologies of timing of initial human arrival into naive ecosystems and palaeontologically inferred dates of megafauna extinctions. Conclusions arising from comparing chronologies also depend on the reliability of dated evidence, dating uncertainties, and correcting for the low probability of preservation (Signor-Lipps effect). While some models have been developed to test the susceptibility of megafauna to theoretical offtake rates, none has explicitly linked human energetic needs, prey choice, and hunting efficiency to examine the plausibility of human-driven extinctions. Using the island of Cyprus in the terminal Pleistocene as an ideal test case because of its late human settlement (similar to 14.2-13.2 ka), small area (similar to 11 000 km(2)), and low megafauna diversity (2 species), we developed stochastic models of megafauna population dynamics, with offtake dictated by human energetic requirements, prey choice, and hunting-efficiency functions to test whether the human population at the end of the Pleistocene could have caused the extinction of dwarf hippopotamus (Phanourios minor) and dwarf elephants (Palaeoloxodon cypriotes). Our models reveal not only that the estimated human population sizes (n = 3000-7000) in Late Pleistocene Cyprus could have easily driven both species to extinction within < 1000 years, the model predictions match the observed, Signor-Lipps-corrected chronological sequence of megafauna extinctions inferred from the palaeontological record (P. minor at similar to 12-11.1 ka, followed by P. cypriotes at similar to 10.3-9.1 ka).

AB  - Historically, oaks dominated the canopies of large regions of eastern North American forests, but at many sites current recruitment is insufficient to sustain oak dominance. Intense browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and light limitation due to expansion by fire-intolerant tree species may cause poor oak recruitment. In a xeric woodland in Kansas USA, we used a deer exclusion experiment in natural canopy gaps to quantify effects of browsing and light availability on post oak (Quercus stellata) sapling performance, meaning growth and survival. Two weeks after beginning the experiment, a prescribed fire occurred that, due to natural burn heterogeneity, affected 29 of 31 experimental canopy gaps and top-killed 78.6% of experimental saplings. This allowed us to examine post-fire recovery in a sub-set of saplings. Our hypotheses were 1) ambient deer browsing intensity reduces post oak sapling performance, 2) sapling performance increases with gap size and light availability, 3) deer browsing effects on sapling performance vary with light availability, and 4) re-growth rate of saplings that were top-killed by fire is affected by light, deer browsing and the interaction of light and browsing. After five years, deer exclusion increased sapling growth in height and aboveground biomass. Sapling height growth was positively correlated with light. Deer effects on sapling performance generally were consistent across light environments. However, there was a weak pattern toward more negative effects of browsing in high light than in low light environments for saplings that re-sprouted post-fire. Protection from deer shortened the time required for saplings to re-attain their pre-fire height from five to three years. We conclude that deer browsing reduces post oak recruitment in canopy gaps in these xeric woodlands. Further, under current browsing intensity, fire return intervals less than five years will strongly limit oak recruitment.

AB  - Background and aimsLitter decomposition shapes nutrients dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Effects of component leaf litter abundance and species richness in a mixture on its own decomposition remain unclear.MethodsUsing leaf litter of 1 to 5 coexisting species, we manipulated the proportions of mixed litters (resulting in 106 different mixtures), and monitored the biomass decomposition of individual species component in mixtures over a year. For each species, we separately recognized two gradients: focal species abundance (i.e., leaf litter abundance) and species richness (i.e., the number of other plant species surrounding the focal species in mixtures) in mixtures. We then simultaneously considered both effects of litter abundance and richness on litter mass loss at species level.ResultsSpecies abundance could increase its own litter decomposition (i.e., abundance effects) at least for Thermopsis lanceolata and Anemone rivularis, and species richness promoted litter decomposition of the reference species (i.e., richness effects) for each species. High quality of leaf litter (low cellulose:nitrogen, etc.) at species level promoted abundance effects, while low quality (high hemicellulose:phosphorus, etc.) enhanced richness effects.ConclusionThere were positive effects of component litter abundance and species richness in the mixture on its own decomposition, and the effects of both depended on its own initial litter quality. These results set a new path to improving our understanding of litter decomposition in natural ecosystems. This study suggests that in the future, theoretical models and experimental studies of litter decomposition need to consider the influence of abundance of litter components in the mixture.

AB  - Current ecological communities are in a constant state of flux from climate change and from species introductions. Recent discussion has focused on the positive roles introduced species can play in ecological communities and on the importance of conserving resilient ecosystems, but not how these two ideas intersect. There has been insufficient work to define the attributes needed to support ecosystem resilience to climate change in modern communities. Here, I argue that non-invasive, introduced plant species could play an important role in supporting the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. Using examples from multiple taxonomic groups and ecosystems, I discuss how introduced plants can contribute to ecosystem resilience via their roles in plant and insect communities, as well as their associated ecosystem functions. I highlight the current and potential contributions of introduced plants and where there are critical knowledge gaps. Determining when and how introduced plants are contributing to the resilience of ecosystems to climate change will contribute to effective conservation strategies.
   In this perspective, I argue that we need to rethink the way we consider introduced plants in the resiliency of ecosystems to climate change. Given the ability of introduced species to tolerate and adapt to a broad range of environmental conditions, I suggest that introduced plants may fulfill a similar functional role as native plants that have been lost and/or provide a critical role that cannot (yet) be performed by 'local' native plant species. I propose that we need a clearer picture of the complex roles that introduced species play in our ecosystems and how they respond to climate change.image

AB  - Parasitic nematodes are ubiquitous and can negatively impact their host by reducing fecundity or increasing mortality, yet the driver of variation in the parasite community across a wildlife host's geographic distribution remains elusive for most species. Based on an extensive collection of fecal samples (n = 264) from GPS marked moose (Alces alces), we used DNA metabarcoding to characterize the individual (sex, age class) and seasonal parasitic nematode community in relation to habitat use and migration behavior in five populations distributed across a wide latitudinal gradient (59.6 degrees N to 70.5 degrees N) in Norway. We detected 21 distinct nematode taxa with the six most common being Ostertagia spp., Nematodirella spp., Trichostongylus spp., T. axei, Elaphostrongylus alces, and an unclassified Strongylida. There was higher prevalence of livestock parasites in areas with larger sheep populations indicating a higher risk of spillover events. The individual level nematode richness was mostly consistent across study areas, while the number and type of nematode taxa detected at each study area varied considerably but did not follow a latitudinal gradient. While migration distance affected nematode beta-diversity across all sites, it had a positive effect on richness at only two of the five study areas suggesting population specific effects. Unexpectedly, nematode richness was higher in winter than summer when very few nematodes were detected. Here we provide the first extensive description of the parasitic nematode community of moose across a wide latitudinal range. Overall, the population-specific impact of migration on parasitism across the distribution range and variation in sympatry with other ruminants suggest local characteristics affect hostparasite relationships.

AB  - Climate change increases the insect abundance, especially in Arctic ecosystems. Insect herbivory also significantly increases plant emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are highly reactive in the atmosphere and play a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry and physics. However, it is unclear how the effects of insect herbivory on VOC emissions interact with climatic changes, such as warming and increased cloudiness. We assessed how experimental manipulations of temperature and light availability in subarctic tundra, that had been maintained for 30 years at the time of the measurements, affect the VOC emissions from a widespread dwarf birch (Betula nana) when subjected to herbivory by local geometrid moth larvae, the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) and the winter moth (Operophtera brumata). Warming and insect herbivory on B. nana stimulated VOC emission rates and altered the VOC blend. The herbivory-induced increase in sesquiterpene and homoterpene emissions were climate-treatment-dependent. Many herbivory-associated VOCs were more strongly induced in the shading treatment than in other treatments. We showed generally enhanced tundra VOC emissions upon insect herbivory and synergistic effects on the emissions of some VOC groups in a changing climate, which can have positive feedbacks on cloud formation. Furthermore, the acclimation of plants to long-term climate treatments affects VOC emissions and strongly interacts with plant responses to herbivory. Such acclimation complicates predictions of how climate change, together with interacting biotic stresses, affects VOC emissions in the high latitudes.

AB  - Late Quaternary climatic fluctuations in the Northern Hemisphere had drastic effects on large mammal species, leading to the extinction of a substantial number of them. The giant deer (Megaloceros giganteus) was one of the species that became extinct in the Holocene, around 7660 calendar years before present. In the Late Pleistocene, the species ranged from western Europe to central Asia. However, during the Holocene, its range contracted to eastern Europe and western Siberia, where the last populations of the species occurred. Here, we generated 35 Late Pleistocene and Holocene giant deer mitogenomes to explore the genetics of the demise of this iconic species. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of the mitogenomes suggested five main clades for the species: three pre-Last Glacial Maximum clades that did not appear in the post-Last Glacial Maximum genetic pool, and two clades that showed continuity into the Holocene. Our study also identified a decrease in genetic diversity starting in Marine Isotope Stage 3 and accelerating during the Last Glacial Maximum. This reduction in genetic diversity during the Last Glacial Maximum, coupled with a major contraction of fossil occurrences, suggests that climate was a major driver in the dynamics of the giant deer.

AB  - ContextUnderstanding how forest disturbances, such as fire and herbivory, affect carbon storage across the landscape can help inform forest management and disturbance mitigation. However, this is made difficult by uncertainties in carbon predictions and limited records of disturbance histories.ObjectivesOur objectives were to predict carbon stocks and predict where disturbances have created open forest patches across the study areas, and to assess the relative effects of disturbances and subsequent moose herbivory on carbon stocks.MethodsWe used field measurements of carbon stocks and disturbances from a two-year field study on the island of Newfoundland, Canada, along with remotely sensed environmental variables (e.g., stand height, elevation), to predict spatial patterns in carbon stocks as well as predict where disturbances have created open forest across Gros Morne and Terra Nova National Parks.ResultsWe found that the remotely sensed variables of forest height and productivity were the most informative predictor variables for both carbon stocks and whether an area was an open forest. Our models predict less carbon in areas classified as open forest relative to areas classified as mature forest. Further, we observed that moose herbivory may impede the recovery of carbon stocks in open forests after disturbances, leading to a reduction in carbon storage of up to 13 megatonnes, or 40% of carbon predicted to be stored across the two national parks.ConclusionsOverall, we find there is potential to increase or maintain carbon storage in maritime boreal forests by limiting moose herbivory in areas regenerating following disturbance. This work adds to our understanding of drivers of forest carbon storage and can help inform boreal forest management to optimize carbon storage.

AB  - Simple Summary Mountain hares in Scandinavia are classified as Near Threatened in the Norwegian and Swedish Redlists assessing the risk of species extinction. This is due to a possible population decline witnessed during the last decades in Scandinavia. Competition between large herbivores such as moose, red deer, roe deer on one hand and hares on the other, is one of several hypotheses that has been put forward to explain this decline. In a cafeteria trial (providing several types of forage to determine food preference) we investigate the effects of previous moose winter foraging on the food selection (i.e., amount consumed, bites per minute and bitediameter) of downy birch and goat willow by captive hares. We find that hares do not differentiate among levels of previous moose foraging on downy birch but have larger bite diameters of goat willow earlier eaten on by moose, compared to plants not fed on by moose. Thus, effects of moose on hare winter food quality seem to be limited. We highlight the need for studies focusing on (1) effects of previous moose foraging using wild hares in a natural experimental design, and (2) effects of moose foraging on available hare food at a landscape scale during winter. Mountain hares (Lepus timidus) in Scandinavia are classified as Near Threatened in the Norwegian and Swedish Redlists. This is due to a possible population decline witnessed during the last decades in Scandinavia. Competition between large herbivores and mountain hares is one of several hypotheses that has been put forward to explain this decline. In a cafeteria trial we investigate the effects of previous moose (Alces alces) winter browsing on the food selection (i.e., biomass consumed, bites per minute and bitediameter) of downy birch (Betula pubescens) and goat willow (Salix caprea) by captive mountain hares. We find that mountain hares do not differentiate among previous browsing levels of downy birch, but have larger bite diameters of goat willow earlier browsed by moose, compared to non-browsed plants. Thus, effects of moose on mountain hare winter food quality seem to be limited. We highlight the need for studies focusing on (1) qualitative effects of moose browsing using wild mountain hares in a natural experimental design, and (2) quantitative effects of moose browsing on available mountain hare forage at a landscape scale during winter.

AB  - Herbivory plays a crucial role in shaping vegetation dynamics. In the Brazilian Cerrado, the abundant and widespread presence of leaf-cutter ants contributes to the prevalence of high levels of chewing insect damage. However, the influence of increased herbivory on seedling survival remains largely untested in experimental settings. Furthermore, it is unclear how plant species traits affect seedling responses in savanna areas with contrasting canopy cover. To address these gaps, we transplanted seedlings from 10 native woody species into open and closed savanna areas in the Panga Ecological Reserve, Brazil, and evaluated long-term survival under four levels of simulated herbivory. We also tested the role of seed mass and resprouting capacity in seedling survival across species. We found that moderate herbivory (50% defoliation) did not reduce seedling survival compared with undamaged plants, regardless of the savanna area. However, severe damage (100% defoliation and shoot system removal) increased mortality two- to three-fold. Overall, seedling survival was lower in the open savanna area than in the closed savanna area across all herbivory levels. However, while tree canopies reduced environmental stress, they also limited seedling recovery from severe herbivory, resulting in a greater relative increase in mortality for damaged seedlings in closed savannas. Seedling responses to herbivory also varied by species traits, with large-seeded species and those with greater resprouting often showing higher survival, particularly in the open savanna. These findings enhance our understanding of how herbivory may influence savanna vegetation dynamics, demonstrating that chewing insects compound the environmental stressors affecting seedling recruitment, with canopy cover modulating seedling-herbivore interactions across the heterogeneous landscapes of Neotropical savannas.

AB  - Although herbivory and allelopathy play important roles in plant invasions, their roles in mediating the effect of plant diversity on invasion resistance remain unknown. In a 2-year field experiment, we constructed native plant communities with four levels of species richness (one, two, four, and eight species) and used a factorial combination of insecticide and activated carbon applications to reduce herbivory and allelopathy, respectively. We then invaded the communities with the introduced plant Solidago canadensis L. One year after the start of the experiment, there was no statistically significant net effect of species richness on biomass of the invader. However, a structural equation model showed that species richness had a positive direct effect on invader biomass that was partially balanced out by a negative indirect effect of species richness via increased light interception. In the second year, the relationship between invader biomass and species richness was negative when we analyzed the treatment combination with herbivory and allelopathy separately. Therefore, we conclude that joint effects of herbivory and allelopathy may play major roles in driving the diversity-invasibility relationship and should be considered in future studies.

AB  - Ongoing Arctic greening can increase productivity and reindeer pasture quality in the tundra. However, greening may also entail proliferation of unpalatable species, with consequences for pastoral social-ecological systems. Here we show extensive greening across 20 reindeer districts in Norway between 2003 and 2020, which has reduced pasture diversity. The allelopathic, evergreen dwarf-shrub crowberry increased its biomass by 60%, with smaller increases of deciduous shrubs and no increase in forbs and graminoids, the most species rich growth forms. There was no evidence for higher reindeer densities promoting crowberry. The current management decision-making process aims at sustainable pasture management but does not explicitly account for pasture changes and reduced diversity. Large-scale shifts towards evergreening and increased allelopathy may thus undermine the resource base for this key Arctic herbivore and the pastoral social-ecological system. Management that is sensitive to changes in pasture diversity could avoid mismanagement of a social-ecological system in transition.
   Evergreen crowberry biomass increased in contrast to deciduous shrubs and herbaceous plants, affecting reindeer pasture quality and diversity according to an analysis combining reindeer data and a vegetation resurvey in twenty districts in Norway.

AB  - Knowledge regarding the response of soil invertebrate communities to typhoon disturbance is limited, although it is known that soil invertebrates are sensitive to forest disturbances and that tropical cyclones (typhoons/hurricanes) are the most destructive natural disasters affecting the structure and function of forest ecosystems. To fill this knowledge gap, soil invertebrates in both litter and topsoil layers were investigated in four representative subtropical coastal forests of eastern China one week before the first typhoon (Hinnamnor) (T1), one day after the first typhoon (Hinnamnor) (T2), one day after the second typhoon (Muifa) (T3), and one week after the second typhoon (Muifa) (T4) in September 2022. Typhoon disturbances decreased the density and taxa abundance of soil invertebrate communities in litter layer, but the first typhoon disturbance increased these values in the topsoil layer. One week after the second typhoon disturbance, soil invertebrate communities in the litter layer showed a gradual recovery trend. Meanwhile, the soil invertebrate communities in the litter layer were more sensitive to typhoon disturbances than those in the topsoil layer. Furthermore, the responses of the soil invertebrate communities to the typhoon disturbances varied greatly with the forest types. The invertebrate densities in the litter layer decreased by 62.1%, 63.53%, 47.01%, and 46.92% in Chinese fir, second broad-leaved, mixed, and bamboo forests, respectively. Particularly, these two non-catastrophic typhoons significantly altered the functional group composition of detrital food webs in the short term, and the proportion of phytophages in detrital food webs in the litter layer increased after the typhoon disturbances. In conclusion, the effects of typhoon disturbances on soil invertebrate communities vary greatly with forest type and soil layer, and soil invertebrate communities can gradually recover after typhoon disturbances. The legacy effects of typhoon disturbances on the functional group composition of detrital food webs may influence carbon and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.

AB  - The genus Caulerpa has attracted much attention because many of its species were introduced into non-native regions and became notoriously invasive. This is the case of Caulerpa prolifera that has been rapidly expanding in Ria Formosa lagoon, taking over the deeper unvegetated soft bottoms and competing with seagrass meadows in the shallower areas. Here we address how C. prolifera invasion may affect the support of biodiversity, and specifically, the provision of habitat and nursery for commercial species by the native habitats of this coastal lagoon. Even though no significant differences in total species richness, diversity and evenness were found between C. prolifera and the native unvegetated habitat, the dissimilarity between these two habitats was highest, mostly driven by the extreme reduction of the gastropod Bittium reticulatum and of the tanaid Apseudopsis formosus. This may implicate changes in the trophic interactions of the ecosystem, for example decreasing the tanaid food source for seahorses, which are presently endangered in the lagoon. On the other hand, the fauna species richness, diversity and evenness were significantly higher in the native seagrass habitat than in C. prolifera. Juveniles of valuable flat and sparid fish were only observed in unvegetated sediments and seagrass meadows, respectively. The aggressive spread of C. prolifera in Ria Formosa may alter the structure of native faunal communities, with likely negative implications on fisheries. Nevertheless, the global biodiversity of the lagoon will not be likely drastically affected unless the seaweed takes over the seagrass meadows.

AB  - 1. One of the key ecosystem services offered by avian biodiversity within agricultural landscapes is natural predation. Nonetheless, the current use of biological control agents such as farmland birds in oil palm plantations is relatively limited. 2. This study aimed to assess the potential roles of avian biodiversity, particularly insectivores that provide natural predation against oil palm herbivorous insects. We also investigated the influence of local- and landscape-scale variables on foliage damage (crown or frond). 3. Our data showed that crown damage decreased with increasing farmland bird richness (overall and insectivore), shrub cover, dried biomass and elevation, but increased with epiphyte cover, oil palm height and distance to continuous forest. Frond damage was negatively related to bird richness (overall, insectivore and non-insectivore) and non-insectivore abundance, elevation and shrub cover, while increased with insectivorous abundance, epiphyte cover, oil palm height and distance to continuous forest. We also found that plantations (>= 50 ha) were more susceptible to foliage damage from pest insects than smallholdings (<50 ha). 4. There was no evidence that indicate the influence of forest patches on foliage damage. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study highlights the economic value of conserving biodiversity, most notably, farmland birds and continuous forests with respect to biological control of defoliating pests and maintaining yield productivity in oil palm cultivation. Growers, particularly major plantation companies should make oil palm farming more biodiversity-friendly in order to increase the number of biological control agents such as birds.

AB  - Arctic ecosystems are warming nearly 4 times faster than the global average, which is resulting in plant community shifts and subsequent changes in biogeochemical processes such as gaseous fluxes. Additionally, herbivores shape plant communities and thereby may alter the magnitude and composition of ecosystem respiration and biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions. Here we determine the effect of large mammalian herbivores on ecosystem respiration and BVOC emissions in two southern and two northern sites in Swedish Scandes, encompassing mountain birch (LOMB) and shrub heath (LORI) communities in the south and low-herb meadow (RIGA) and shrub heath (RIRI) communities in the north. Herbivory significantly altered BVOC composition between sites and decreased ecosystem respiration at RIGA. The difference in graminoid cover was found to have a large effect on ecosystem respiration between sites as RIGA, with the highest cover, had 35% higher emissions than the next highestemitting site (LOMB). Additionally, LOMB had the highest emissions of terpenes, with the northern sites having significantly lower emissions. Differences between sites were primarily due to differences in exclosure effects and soil temperature and the prevalence of different shrub growth forms. Our results suggest that herbivory has a significant effect on trace gas fluxes in a productive meadow community and that differences between communities may be driven by differences in shrub composition.

AB  - Vegetation can be used as a nature-based solution (NBS) to restore rivers and mitigate water-triggered processes along streambanks. Roots are well known to improve the overall stability of slopes through hydro-mechanical reinforcement within the rooted zone. Vegetation-based solutions require the selection of species that are most suitable for specific locations, and they are aimed at restoring the natural state and function of river systems in support of biodiversity, flood management, and landscape development. Selecting a combination of different species along different zones of the riverbank can improve the conditions for the river system with regard to biodiversity and stability. Therefore, more studies are needed to investigate how the combination of a variety of different plant species can improve the stability of the riverbank. This paper presents a methodological approach for slope stability modeling including vegetation as well as the results obtained from a series of slope stability calculations adopting the proposed methodology. The analyses were carried out for critical shallow (<= 3 m deep) shear planes of ideal benchmark slopes covered with four different plant combinations-(i) only grass, (ii) grass and shrubs, (iii) only trees, and (iv) trees, shrubs, and grass-for species typically found along streams in southeastern Norway. In this desk study, two types of tree species were selected, namely Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Downy birch (Betula pubescens). The Goat willow (Salix caprea) was selected as a shrub, while a common mixed-grass was chosen as grass. Vegetation features were obtained from the literature. The methodology was used for two main cases: (1) considering only the mechanical contribution of vegetation and (2) considering both the hydrological and mechanical reinforcement of vegetation. The main outcome of the numerical modeling showed that the purely mechanical contribution of vegetation to slope stability could not be decoupled from the hydrological reinforcement in order to have a realistic assessment of the roots improvement to the stability. The most critical shear surfaces occurred below the rooted zone in all cases, and the best performance was obtained using the combinations including trees. Considering the typical climate conditions in Norway, the hydro-mechanical reinforcement was most effective in the spring and for combinations including low height vegetation (i.e., grass and shrubs). The study concludes that a mixed combination of vegetation (trees, shrubs, and grass) is the most suitable for reaching the highest hydro-mechanical reinforcement of streambanks, together with erosion protection and boosting the ecosystem biodiversity. The current study can help practitioners determine which vegetation cover combination is appropriate for improving the current stability of a streambank with restoration practices.

AB  - We estimated the population density and investigated the social organization of sambar (Rusa unicolor unicolor) in Horton Plains National Park (HPNP), Sri Lanka. Distance sampling was conducted along six strip transects every month for a period over 3 years (2018-2020) to estimate the density of the sambar population in grasslands of HPNP (9.4 km(2)), while the antler stage of males and the behavior of individuals were recorded to describe the population's reproductive stage and hence the social organization. Population density estimates showed relative stability over the 3 years and varied over the seasons but with consistent peaks from year to year with the highest population densities recorded in November-December (212.93 & PLUSMN; 25.38 animals/km(2) in 2018, 187.91 & PLUSMN; 28.51 in 2019, and 179.76 & PLUSMN; 31.85 in 2020). The highest percentage of males in hard antlers was observed from November through January, while the percentage of antlers cast sambar peaked from March to April each year. Hinds were observed with newborn calves throughout the year, but the highest number of newborn calves were recorded from July to August each year, while the number of calves counted each year varied from 210 to 267 individuals. The mean group size was variable throughout each year with the largest groups recorded from September to December (up to 52), the period accompanied by the most observations of mating and sparring behavior. Although on a tropical island, HPNP is situated on a rolling plateau landscape in the highlands, where sambar showed a degree of reproductive seasonality somewhat similar to temperate cervid species.

AB  - Conservation strategies for huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus), listed as an endangered cervid by IUCN, have not helped to reverse its declining population trends. Recent evaluations of historical data revealed that they also inhabited lower valleys and grasslands as residents or only during winter. However, the dogma persists that huemuls do not need such habitats. To determine if more solid evidence exists to back up or refute our hypothesis that huemuls once inhabited lower valleys and grasslands, we researched the literature and discovered additional relevant historical sources on this species. These new findings substantiate that huemuls also occupied unforested areas, reaching the Atlantic coast, and resided on various islands including Tierra del Fuego, and that their co-occurrence with guanaco was frequent. Their extreme naivety towards humans resulted in their extirpation on winter ranges settled by humans, resulting in refugee huemuls year-round on remote mountain summer ranges. The ease by which indigenous people could kill them for subsistence and commercial export of hides to Europe, followed by the lowlands becoming modified by settlers and their exotic species facilitated the huemuls' extirpation. The hypothesis of a dramatic modification of the original biogeographical distribution of huemuls is supported by anatomical and ecological features along with historical accounts. Sedentariness on only rugged summer ranges makes long-term survival of this species crucially challenging and requires sound conservation strategies that incorporate geographical areas of their former distribution.

AB  - Environmental changes, such as climate warming and higher herbivory pressure, are altering the carbon balance of Arctic ecosystems; yet, how these drivers modify the carbon balance among different habitats remains uncertain. This hampers our ability to predict changes in the carbon sink strength of tundra ecosystems. We investigated how spring goose grubbing and summer warming-two key environmental-change drivers in the Arctic-alter CO2 fluxes in three tundra habitats varying in soil moisture and plant-community composition. In a full-factorial experiment in high-Arctic Svalbard, we simulated grubbing and warming over two years and determined summer net ecosystem exchange (NEE) alongside its components: gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). After two years, we found net CO2 uptake to be suppressed by both drivers depending on habitat. CO2 uptake was reduced by warming in mesic habitats, by warming and grubbing in moist habitats, and by grubbing in wet habitats. In mesic habitats, warming stimulated ER (+75%) more than GEP (+30%), leading to a 7.5-fold increase in their CO2 source strength. In moist habitats, grubbing decreased GEP and ER by similar to 55%, while warming increased them by similar to 35%, with no changes in summer-long NEE. Nevertheless, grubbing offset peak summer CO2 uptake and warming led to a twofold increase in late summer CO2 source strength. In wet habitats, grubbing reduced GEP (-40%) more than ER (-30%), weakening their CO2 sink strength by 70%. One-year CO2-flux responses were similar to two-year responses, and the effect of simulated grubbing was consistent with that of natural grubbing. CO2-flux rates were positively related to aboveground net primary productivity and temperature. Net ecosystem CO2 uptake started occurring above similar to 70% soil moisture content, primarily due to a decline in ER. Herein, we reveal that key environmental-change drivers-goose grubbing by decreasing GEP more than ER and warming by enhancing ER more than GEP-consistently suppress net tundra CO2 uptake, although their relative strength differs among habitats. By identifying how and where grubbing and higher temperatures alter CO2 fluxes across the heterogeneous Arctic landscape, our results have implications for predicting the tundra carbon balance under increasing numbers of geese in a warmer Arctic.

AB  - In this paper we study the relationships between plants and extinct megafauna by examining the characteristics of the vegetation in the central region of Argentina (i.e. Espinal, Monte, and Chaco phytogeographic regions). First, we study the size, shape, quantity, and characteristics of fruits and seeds. We also evaluate the presence of mechanical (spinescence and wood density) and chemical (secondary metabolic compounds) defenses against high rates of herbivory. Complementarily, we assess the importance these plants had for human populations, using archeological, ethnographic, and current data. A high percentage of the analyzed plants met the criteria proposed for fruits and seeds dispersed by megafauna, together with a high frequency of spinescence, high density woods, and secondary metabolites. We propose that these traits cannot be explained by the herbivory pressure of extant fauna in the area, but rather developed in interaction with currently extinct fauna. We suggest that Pleistocene megafaunal extinction had important consequences in the region due to their role as ecosystem engineers and to vegetation's characteristics, which were probably strongly shaped by megafauna activities. Among these consequences, we discuss the loss of certain interactions between these animals and vegetation, such as loss of seed dispersal mechanisms, shrub invasion, and increased susceptibility of vegetation to fire. Other effects for hunter-gatherer groups were the generation of highly regulated mobility patterns and the formation of barriers for the dispersal of prey. Finally, we also discuss the importance of these plants for human populations as food, construction material, medicines and firewood. Likewise, the role of humans as "heirs" of the megafauna in the propagation of tree and shrub species is highlighted.

AB  - Trees that elephants select are generally at risk to local extirpation. Elephants are the primary drivers of change to large savannah trees, pushing trees over, ring barking or damaging them. These impacts have an adverse effect on the diversity and structure of woody vegetation. Many tree species have slow growth and recruitment rates. This makes it difficult for ecosystems to recover after damage, especially in areas with high densities of elephants. In this study, we mapped the spatial distribution of six endemic and priority tree species that are selected by elephants using Sentinel-2 imagery. Data on the GPS locations of the selected trees were collected and a machine learning algorithm, Random Forest, was used to discriminate between species and to map their spatial distribution in the Venetia-Limpopo Nature Reserve. The algorithm successfully discriminated the different tree species with an overall accuracy of 79.6%, ranking the vegetation red edge (Band-7) and water vapour (Band-9) as the most important bands in the classification. Colophospermum mopane is a dominant tree species in terms of its distribution on the reserve, and according to the classification results, canopies of this species cover approximately 17% of the study area, while Commiphora spp. cover 19%. These findings indicate the effectiveness of Sentinel-2 imagery for mapping savannah tree species that are valuable for conservation and selected by elephants.

AB  - To test the effect of reindeer husbandry on soil carbon storage of seasonally frozen ground, we analysed soil and vegetation properties in peatlands and mixed pine and mountain birch forests. We analysed sites with no grazing and contrasting intensities of grazing, and associated trampling, in Northern Finland. With a pilot study approach, we optimised the study design to include several grazing class sites including grazing seasonality but omitting sample replication at one site. Soils were analysed for water content, bulk density, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen, stable carbon isotopes and radiocarbon ages. We found that there was no significant difference between grazing intensities in terms of TOC, but that TOC mainly depended on the soils' TOC content present prior to intensive herbivory introduction. In contrast, understory vegetation was visibly transformed from dwarf shrub to graminoid-dominated vegetation with increasing grazing and trampling intensity. Also, we found a decrease in bulk density with increasing animal activity on soil sites, which most likely results from named vegetation changes and therefore different peat structures.

AB  - Climate change is threatening fragile alpine ecosystems and their resident ungulates, particularly the wild yak ( Bos mutus ) that inhabits alpine areas between the tree line and glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau. Although wild yaks tend to shift habitats in response to changes in climatic factors, the precise impacts of climate change on their habitat distribution and climate refugia remain unclear. Based on over 1000 occurrence records, the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm was applied to simulate habitat ranges in the last glacial maximum (LGM), Mid-Holocene, current stage, and three greenhouse gas emission scenarios in 2070. Three habitat patches were identified as climate refugia for wild yaks that have persisted from the LGM to the present and are projected to persist until 2070. These stable areas account for approximately 64% of the current wild yak habitat extent and are sufficiently large to support viable populations. The long-term persistence of these climate refugia areas is primarily attributed to the unique alpine environmental features of the Tibetan Plateau, where relatively stable arid or semi-arid climates are maintained, and a wide range of forage resource supplies are available. However, habitat loss by 2070 caused by insufficient protection is predicted to lead to severe fragmentation in the southeastern and northwestern Kunlun, Hengduan, central-western Qilian, and southern Tanggula-northern Himalaya Mountains. Habitat disturbance has also been caused by increasing anthropogenic effects in the southern Tanggula and northern Himalaya Mountains. We suggest that sufficient protection, transboundary cooperation, and community involvement are required to improve wild yak conservation efforts. Our combined modeling method (MaxEnt-Zonation-Linkage Mapper-FRAGSTAT) can be utilized to identify priority areas and linkages between habitat patches while assessing the conservation efficiency of protected areas and analyzing the coupled relationship between climate change and anthropogenic impacts on the habitat distribution of endangered species.

AB  - The main threats to forest ungulates are land cover change, poaching, invasive species and other anthropogenic factors. Tropical rainforest deer, especially those in the South American Atlantic Forest, are extremely elusive, resulting in limited data on their density and the factors influencing it. In this study, our objective was to estimate the density of Atlantic Forest deer and to identify its most significant drivers. We conducted density estimates using faecal standing crop methods with scat detection dogs across the whole Atlantic Forest. In addition, we investigated the influences on density of a locally collected environmental index (AII) incorporating anthropogenic impact variables, landscape metrics (habitat cover, matrix heterogeneity and number of habitat patches), altitude, slope, canopy height and socioeconomic indexes (human development index, purchasing power parity, income inequality and gender development index) as well as protected area ranger density. After a variable selection process to avoid autocorrelation, we tested the relationship between the selected variables and forest deer population density using multiple linear regression models. Density varied from 0.14 to 18.17 individuals/km2, with P. nemorivagus showing the highest values. The average and median values were 3.42 and 1.47 individuals/km2, respectively. Only the model where density was a function of AII was significant, with satisfactory residuals and the lowest AIC value. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight how threats such as poaching, predation by domestic dogs, disease transmission from domestic ungulates and competition, predation or disturbance by wild boar may affect forest deer density and potentially lead to species extinction.

AB  - Rivers of tropical islands formed by volcanic eruptions experience unpredictable and heavy rainfall and are characterised by irregular topography. During the 2019 and 2020 low-water season, we investigated the responses of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages to variations in local environmental conditions in four rivers located in areas of different rainfall intensity. We found that changes in local environmental conditions associated with lower rainfall intensity reduced abundance and taxonomic richness and modified taxonomic composition but did not impact the balance of functional feeding groups of macroinvertebrate communities amongst streams, except for piercer herbivores. Heterotrophy associated with substrate instability and autotrophy with a more stable substrate co-occurred in semi-arid climate rivers. In contrast, a change from heterotrophy upstream to autotrophy and substrate stability downstream was apparent in the two humid rivers studied. Surrogates of stream ecosystem function revealed a very low ratio of coarse to fine particulate organic matter related to the quasi-absence of shredders in these streams and suggested a low allochthonous input contribution, which could be the result of the 5% decline in forest cover over the two past decades.

AB  - Increases or decreases in grazing cause significant disturbances in natural and managed forests. Indeed, grazing impacts can be on par with habitat destruction, exotic species invasion and fire. Grazing can produce changes in the diversity of native and exotic species as well as in functional plant groups at community and ecosystem levels. Unfortunately, overgrazing is a common occurrence in many plant communities, increasing erosion risks, land degradation and plant invasion. We analyze and quantify the effects of grazing by goats as well as cattle and horses on forest structure and spatial distribution of a dominant tree species (Pinus cembroides) in Coahuila, Mexico, an area affected by overgrazing and with problems of desertification. We also assess the influence of other forest variables that may be affected by cattle grazing, such as infestation by Tillandsia recurvata (an atmospheric epiphytic bromeliad) on P. cembroides. The study site is a protected area of 45,000 ha in the Sierra of Zapaliname (Coahuila, Mexico). In this area, grazing is considered a traditional and essential activity as the local economy depends on it. Eight plots (900 m(2)) 100 m apart were set up over a control site that had been grazed by cattle and equines for at least the last 100 years, while another eight plots (also 100 m apart) were established in an area that had excluded grazing for 25 years. Tree species composition and forest structure were analyzed in the plots, as well as other relevant variables, like T. recurvata infestation. The number of tree species (DBH>2.5 cm) differed significantly in control (6) vs. exclusion areas (11), with higher values in the latter. In addition, infestation of T. recurvata was found to be significatively higher in plots where grazing occurred. Spatial analysis of the tree distribution did not reveal any specific patterns related to either grazed or exclusion areas, and neither were there significant differences in species composition. For saplings (>50 cm high and <2.5 cm DBH), five species were present in exclusion plots, while there were only three in control ones. Regarding seedlings (<50 cm high), three species were present in both exclusion and control plots. Our findings suggest that grazing may have modified species richness and made the tree population more vulnerable to parasitic plants, as shown by the higher infestation levels. Also, tree regeneration has been negatively affected, reducing the number of species. We suggest a reduction in grazing pressure and more restrictive grazing management for the forest site as a way of maintaining landscape use, cultural values, and biodiversity.

AB  - Simple Summary Understanding the macro pattern and mechanisms of variation in species diversity along environmental gradients is one of the most important objectives in ecology. However, there have been few large-scale studies on the specific mechanisms by which climate and human activities affect insect diversity along the ecological transect. This study revealed the diversity patterns of insect communities along the ecological transect in the Eastern Eurasian Temperate Steppe, investigated the effects of environmental factors on its diversity in two types of steppes, and assessed the influence of plant diversity alterations on these effects. Our results revealed a breakpoint of insect diversity that divided typical and desert steppe communities. Climate factors and grazing intensities combine to influence insect diversity along the transect, and these effects are mediated through plant diversity. These findings provide a reference for the diversity patterns of insects along ecological gradients in the Eastern Eurasian Temperate Steppe and different conservation strategies of biodiversity in typical and desert steppes. Insects are important components of biodiversity and play significant roles in the steppe ecosystem. They are abundant, easy to sample, and sensitive to changing conditions, making them useful indicators of environmental changes. This study aims to describe patterns (alpha and beta) of insect diversity across two steppe types (a typical steppe and a desert steppe) along the Eastern Eurasian Steppe Transect (EEST), as well as evaluate the effects of environmental variables in determining these patterns and the influence of plant diversity alterations on these effects. To this end, we collected 5244 individual insects and found an n-shaped diversity distribution along the latitudinal gradient and a significant difference in insect communities across the two steppe types. Further, the Mantel test and path analysis indicate that climate and grazing activities combine to influence insect diversity, and these effects are mediated through plant diversity, strongly supporting the role of bottom-up effects in situations of climatic and grazing pattern changes. Moreover, the contribution of plant diversity varied with steppe types and insect functional groups, with greater effects seen in the typical steppe and herbivorous insects. This indicated the importance of protecting species diversity in steppes through managing plant diversity and assessments of local environmental factors such as grazing intensity and temperature.

AB  - Population bottlenecks can have dramatic consequences for the health and long-term survival of a species. Understanding of historic population size and standing genetic variation prior to a contraction allows estimating the impact of a bottleneck on the species' genetic diversity. Although historic population sizes can be modelled based on extant genomics, uncertainty is high for the last 10-20 millenia. Hence, integrating ancient genomes provides a powerful complement to retrace the evolution of genetic diversity through population fluctuations. Here, we recover 15 high-quality mitogenomes of the once nearly extinct Alpine ibex spanning 8601 BP to 1919 CE and combine these with 60 published modern whole genomes. Coalescent demography simulations based on modern whole genomes indicate population fluctuations coinciding with the last major glaciation period. Using our ancient and historic mitogenomes, we investigate the more recent demographic history of the species and show that mitochondrial haplotype diversity was reduced to a fifth of the prebottleneck diversity with several highly differentiated mitochondrial lineages having coexisted historically. The main collapse of mitochondrial diversity coincides with elevated human population growth during the last 1-2 kya. After recovery, one lineage was spread and nearly fixed across the Alps due to recolonization efforts. Our study highlights that a combined approach integrating genomic data of ancient, historic and extant populations unravels major long-term population fluctuations from the emergence of a species through its near extinction up to the recent past.

AB  - The warming of the Arctic is affecting the carbon cycle of tundra ecosystems. Most research on carbon fluxes from Arctic tundra ecosystems has focused on abiotic environmental controls (e.g., temperature, rainfall, or radiation). However, Arctic tundra vegetation, and therefore the carbon balance of these ecosystems, can be substantially impacted by herbivory. In this study we tested how vegetation consumption by brown lemmings (Lemmus trimucronatus) can impact carbon exchange of a wet-sedge tundra ecosystem near Utqiagvik, Alaska during the summer and the recovery of vegetation during the following summer. We placed brown lemmings in individual enclosure plots and tested the impact of lemmings' herbivory on carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes, methane (CH4) fluxes, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) immediately after lemming removal and during the following growing season. During the first summer of the experiment, lemmings' herbivory reduced plant biomass (as shown by the decrease in the NDVI) and decreased net CO2 uptake while not significantly impacting CH4 emissions. CH4 emissions were likely not significantly affected due to CH4 being produced deeper in the soil and escaping from the stem bases of the vascular plants. The summer following the lemming treatments, NDVI and net CO2 fluxes returned to magnitudes similar to those observed before the start of the experiment, suggesting a complete recovery of the vegetation and a transitory nature of the impact of lemming herbivory. Overall, lemming herbivory has short-term but substantial effects on carbon sequestration by vegetation and might contribute to the considerable interannual variability in CO2 fluxes from tundra ecosystems.

AB  - Many theories have been proposed to explain the high diversity of plants in the tropics. However, we lack an understanding of the processes that drive plant diversity and community assembly at different spatial scales. Here, we applied beta-diversity partitioning to test how biotic and abiotic factors are associated with seedling beta-diversity in a tropical montane forest in southern Ecuador. We recorded seedling communities on 81 subplots in nine plots located at three elevations along a 2000 m elevational gradient. We measured biotic pressures (i.e. herbivory and fungal pathogen attacks) and environmental conditions (i.e. soil moisture and canopy closure) in all subplots and related them to species turnover and richness differences in seedling communities within and between elevations. We found that species turnover increased with differences in biotic dissimilarity within elevations, while differences in species richness within elevations increased with increasing environmental dissimilarity. Between elevations, species turnover increased with increasing environmental dissimilarity. Our findings show that species turnover and changes in species richness are related differently to abiotic and biotic factors, and that the importance of these factors for shaping seedling diversity is scale-dependent. Our study contributes to better understand the processes driving seedling beta-diversity and the assembly of plant communities in highly diverse tropical montane forests.

AB  - The objective of the present study is to estimate the species composition and relative abundance of wild ungulates in the Eurasian forested steppe on the basis of fossil zoological evidence. We used an extensive data set of ungulate remains from more than 570 archaeological sites dated to the Middle and Late Holocene. While the ungulate composition was similar in most forested steppe provinces, our analysis revealed spatial differences in the relative abundance of most typical species such as the Wild boar (Sus scrofa), the Red deer (Cervus elaphus), the Elk (Alces alces), the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), and the Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygatgus). According to the results obtained, in the western part of the forested steppe zone, from the Pannonian province to the Central Russian one, the relative abundance of the Red deer and the Wild boar was higher than in the eastern part of the forested steppe from the Zavolzhskaya province to the Ob province. Temporal changes in ungulate compositions occurred in the Neolithic and Bronze ages and resulted in the extinction of the European wild ass, the Giant deer, and the Auroch.

AB  - Prey depletion poses a threat to large carnivores worldwide. The Javan leopard ( Panthera pardus melas ), the last remaining apex predator on the Indonesian island of Java, is facing numerous threats from human activities including poaching, habitat loss and prey depletion. Despite the fact that the Javan leopard is an adaptable and opportunistic predator capable of surviving in various environments, our understanding of its prey and predator -prey interactions is still limited, which is crucial for their conservation. Using camera trap data collected from four national parks (i.e., Ujung Kulon, Gunung Gede Pangrango, Meru Betiri, Alas Purwo) that represent four distinct terrestrial ecoregions across the island of Java, we investigated the species richness, relative abundance, and spatial -temporal overlap in activity patterns between the Javan leopard and other animals that coexist in the same location. Our analysis of 7461 independent photos, covering 12,983 camera trap days, revealed that areas with the presence of Javan leopards exhibited higher species richness and abundance compared to those without the presence of Javan leopards. In addition, we found that the activities of banteng ( Bos javanicus ), barking deer ( Muntiacus muntjak ), Javan deer ( Rusa timorensis ), Javan mousedeer ( Tragulus javanicus ), wild boar ( Sus scrofa ), junglefowl ( Gallus spp. ), spangled ebony langur ( Trachypithecus auratus ), Javan rhino ( Rhinoceros sondaicus ), long-tailed macaque ( Macaca fascicularis ) and dhole ( Cuon alpinus ) were highly overlapping with those of Javan leopards in space and time, suggesting that these species are potential candidate prey for Javan leopards. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive investigation of potential prey for the Javan leopard that utilizes camera traps from all four types of terrestrial ecoregions on Java Island. The findings of this study may serve as essential information for the conservation of this critically endangered species.

AB  - Abyssal plains cover more than half of Earth's surface, and the main food source in these ecosystems is phytodetritus, mainly originating from primary producers in the euphotic zone of the ocean. Global climate change is influencing phytoplankton abundance, productivity, and distribution. Increasing importance of picoplankton over diatom as primary producers in surface oceans (especially projected for higher latitudes) is projected and hence altering the quantity of organic carbon supplied to the abyssal seafloor as phytodetritus, consequences of which remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the in situ responses of abyssal biota from viruses to megafauna to different types of phytoplankton input (diatoms or cyanobacteria which were labeled with stable isotopes) at equatorial (oligotrophic) and temperate (eutrophic) benthic sites in the Pacific Ocean (1 degrees N at 4277 m water depth and 39 degrees N at 5260 m water depth, respectively). Our results show that meiofauna and macrofauna generally preferred diatoms as a food source and played a relatively larger role in the consumption of phytodetritus at higher latitudes (39 degrees N). Contrarily, prokaryotes and viruses showed similar or even stronger responses to cyanobacterial than to diatom supply. Moreover, the response of prokaryotes and viruses was very rapid (within 1-2 days) at both 1 degrees N and 39 degrees N, with quickest responses reported in the case of cyanobacterial supply at higher latitudes. Overall, our results suggest that benthic deep-sea eukaryotes will be negatively affected by the predicted decrease in diatoms in surface oceans, especially at higher latitudes, where benthic prokaryotes and viruses will otherwise likely increase their quantitative role and organic carbon cycling rates. In turn, such changes can contribute to decrease carbon transfer from phytodetritus to higher trophic levels, with strong potential to affect oceanic food webs, their biodiversity and consequently carbon sequestration capacity at the global scale.

AB  - The Tragelaphini, also known as spiral-horned antelope, is a phenotypically diverse mammalian tribe comprising a single genus, Tragelaphus. The evolutionary history of this tribe has attracted the attention of taxonomists and molecular geneticists for decades because its diversity is characterised by conflicts between morphological and molecular data as well as between mitochondrial, nuclear and chromosomal DNA. These inconsistencies point to a complex history of ecological diversification, coupled by either phenotypic convergence or introgression. Therefore, to unravel the phylogenetic relationships among spiral-horned antelopes, and to further investigate the role of divergence and gene flow in trait evolution, we sequenced genomes for all nine accepted species of the genus Tragelaphus, including a genome each for the highly divergent bushbuck lineages (T. s. scriptus and T. s. sylvaticus). We successfully reconstructed the Tragelaphus species tree, providing genome-level support for the early Pliocene divergence and monophyly of the nyala (T. angasii) and lesser kudu (T. imberbis), the monophyly of the two eland species (T. oryx and T. derbianus) and, importantly, the monophyly of ke<acute accent>wel (T. s. scriptus) and imbabala (T. s. sylvaticus) bushbuck. We found strong evidence for gene flow in at least four of eight nodes on the species tree. Among the six phenotypic traits assessed here, only habitat type mapped onto the species tree without homoplasy, showing that trait evolution was the result of complex patterns of divergence, introgression and convergent evolution.

AB  - Human activity and associated landscape modifications alter the movements of animals with consequences for populations and ecosystems worldwide. Species performing long-distance movements are thought to be particularly sensitive to human impact. Despite the increasing anthropogenic pressure, it remains challenging to understand and predict animals' responses to human activity. Here we address this knowledge gap using 1206 Global Positioning System movement trajectories of 815 individuals from 14 red deer (Cervus elaphus) and 14 elk (Cervus canadensis) populations spanning wide environmental gradients, namely the latitudinal range from the Alps to Scandinavia in Europe, and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in North America. We measured individual-level movements relative to the environmental context, or movement expression, using the standardized metric Intensity of Use, reflecting both the directionality and extent of movements. We expected movement expression to be affected by resource (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) predictability and topography, but those factors to be superseded by human impact. Red deer and elk movement expression varied along a continuum, from highly segmented trajectories over relatively small areas (high intensity of use), to directed transitions through restricted corridors (low intensity of use). Human activity (Human Footprint Index, HFI) was the strongest driver of movement expression, with a steep increase in Intensity of Use as HFI increased, but only until a threshold was reached. After exceeding this level of impact, the Intensity of Use remained unchanged. These results indicate the overall sensitivity of Cervus movement expression to human activity and suggest a limitation of plastic responses under high human pressure, despite the species also occurring in human-dominated landscapes. Our work represents the first comparison of metric-based movement expression across widely distributed populations of a deer genus, contributing to the understanding and prediction of animals' responses to human activity.

AB  - Accurately estimating forage biomass is essential for understanding the nutritional value of vegetation communities for wild herbivores. However, clipping, drying, and weighing vegetation by species requires substantial labor, which restricts the size and number of plots that can be sampled over a large geographical area. Labor-intensive sampling effort can be reduced by using a double sampling strategy that pairs visual estimates of horizontal cover of vegetation with a subset of clipped plots to create equations that convert horizontal cover to biomass. However, sampling strategy and environmental covariates have rarely been considered when developing cover-biomass equations. We evaluated environmental and sampling factors that could affect the cover-biomass relationship using 3,404 cover-biomass pairs measured in the Clearwater River Basin in North-central Idaho, USA, collected from May 31-October 4 in 2016 and 2017. Our study demonstrated that when carefully applied, double sampling techniques can streamline field sampling while providing cover-biomass conversion equations with moderate to high predictive ability (pseudo R-2 = 0.25-0.99, x over bar $\bar{x}$ = 0.70) for both biomass of current annual growth and high-quality (e.g., leaves of shrubs) portion of plants (pseudo R-2 = 0.65-1). Based on our results, we recommend comparing fit and predictive ability of regression types (linear, log-linear, Gamma) and collecting >20 cover-biomass pairs spanning a wide range of horizontal cover (1 to >50%) for each plant species. We found that accounting for overstory canopy cover and season through interaction terms improved the fit of equations by as much as 20% for over half of the 81 species-specific and 12 structure groups. We found a modest degree of observer bias; thus, training should reduce observer bias and improve consistency but may not alleviate inconsistencies among studies. Careful classification of plant species into plant structure groups can reduce the number of equations, but species-specific equations for the most abundant and objectively relevant plant species should be developed.

AB  - The intensity of browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter deer) can be influenced directly by deer densities and food availability, and indirectly by landscape characteristics that influence these factors. However, the variables and spatial scales that influence browsing intensity likely differ in landscapes with varying composition and land use. Furthermore, because high browsing intensity can influence the structure and function of forests, determining the most effective and efficient indices of browsing intensity can aid forest management decisions. To evaluate differences in browsing intensity, we used Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate the probability of browsing for twigs from non-avoided species based upon woodlot and landscape-scale variables, which were calculated within 200, 500, 1000, and 1500 m buffers. We then evaluated the efficacy of the twig age, oak sentinel, and herbaceous indicator methods of indexing browsing intensity by correlating these to browsing intensity and deer density. We also evaluated the expense and required work time associated with each index method. Food availability seemed to drive browsing intensities in our study, however, deer density was also important in the region with the lowest cover of forest. When meaningful, landscape characteristics fit data best at the 500 m buffer size. The twig age method showed the strongest correlations to both browsing intensity and deer density and was among the most efficient methods, suggesting it is a reliable index of browsing intensity within Indiana and similar regions. Together, our results highlight that landscape characteristics can mediate the relationship between deer and forest plant communities, which emphasizes the need to tailor management actions to variable landscapes that may occur within a single state or region. Additionally, our results suggest that the twig age method is the most efficient and effective index to monitor browse intensity in agriculturally dominated landscapes, such as those of the Central Hardwood Forest Region.

AB  - Concerning declines in insect populations have been reported from Europe and the United States, yet there are gaps in our knowledge of the drivers of insect trends and their distribution across the world. We report on our analysis of a spatially extensive, 14-year study of ground-dwelling beetles in four natural forest biomes spanning Japan's entire latitudinal range (3000 km). Beetle species richness, abundance and biomass declined in evergreen coniferous forests but increased in broadleaf-coniferous mixed forests. Further, beetles in evergreen coniferous forests responded negatively to increased temperature and precipitation anomalies, which have both risen over the study's timespan. These significant changes parallel reports of climate-driven changes in forest tree species, providing further evidence that climate change is altering forest ecosystems fundamentally. Given the enormous biodiversity and ecosystem services that forests support globally, the implications for biodiversity change resulting from climate change could be profound.

AB  - Traditional pastoralism based on free-ranging goats is indispensable for the rural economy of millions of people in the Brazilian Caatinga drylands. The use of landscape as rangelands for domestic herbivores benefits humans, but understanding its impacts on vegetation is crucial to sustainable strategies. Here we assessed how freeranging domestic goats use mixed working landscapes in the largest dry forest of the Americas. We evaluated habitat use via GPS tracking and analysis of feeding preferences. Goats preferentially used open areas near human settlements and their impact on plant community may be negligible because they feed mostly on plants widely available in modified environments. Although free-ranging, the area of use was nearly constant (95.44 ha), but the size of herds varied (2-100 animals). Our study suggests that domestic goats can be considered dwellers of human-modified landscapes, foraging close to villages, on open (i.e., degraded) areas where abundant plant species thrive. Therefore, the extensive goat pastoralism in the Caatinga may have little impact on natural vegetation and could be sustainably managed under traditional management practices.

AB  - Silviculture can be a powerful tool for restoring and enhancing habitat for forest-dependent wildlife. In eastern North America, regenerating timber harvests support abundant wildflowers that provide essential forage for native pollinators. Factors driving floral resource availability within regenerating forests remain almost entirely unstudied. Recent efforts to increase the area of regenerating forests (<10 years old) through overstory removal harvest in the central Appalachian Mountains provide an opportunity to investigate the development of forest wildflower communities following canopy removal. We conducted 1208 surveys of blooming plants across 143 harvests, recording 1 525245 flowers representing 220 taxa spanning 47 families. The number of flowers within recently harvested stands was negatively associated with fern and sapling cover but positively associated with grass and bramble (Rubus spp.) cover. Early in the growing season, more flowers bloomed in older regenerating stands (e.g., >5 years old), but this pattern reversed by the end of the growing season. Ultimately, our study demonstrates that the abundance of flowers available to pollinators within regenerating hardwood stands varies with factors associated with advancing succession. Recognizing the potential trade-off between woody regeneration (i.e., saplings) and pollinator forage availability may benefit forest managers who intend to provide floral resources to flower-dependent wildlife like pollinators via silviculture.

AB  - Boreal coastal habitats, with their complex hydrological, ecological, and geological functions, play a pivotal role in regulating regional climate, supporting biodiversity, and sustaining local communities. This study presents a comprehensive, multidecadal assessment of land cover dynamics, a large and environmentally sensitive coastal-fluvial watershed. Using a 30-year Landsat satellite data archive (1990-2020) from Landsat 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 sensors, we analyzed long-term changes in land cover patterns, focusing on vegetation health, surface water extent, and urban expansion. A suite of spectral indices, including the normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference built-up index, normalized difference water index, and modified normalized difference water index, was calculated for each time slice to capture key environmental variables related to vegetation productivity, urbanization, and hydrological dynamics. To ensure methodological consistency and computational efficiency, a cloud-based processing workflow was implemented using the Google Earth Engine platform. This approach enabled automated preprocessing, atmospheric correction, cloud masking, and multidecadal time-series analysis across the study area. Landsat surface reflectance and spectral index data were fused and subsequently classified using a random forest machine learning algorithm, allowing for enhanced land cover classification accuracy across seven time intervals spanning three decades. Our findings reveal distinct spatiotemporal trends in the Moose River Basin's landscape. A marked decline in vegetation cover was observed during the early 2000s, likely driven by a combination of climate variability, hydrological fluctuations, and local disturbances. Urban and built-up areas, primarily concentrated near river corridors and accessible regions, exhibited gradual but steady expansion over the study period, signaling increasing human settlement pressures.

AB  - Two of the major factors that control the composition of herbaceous plant communities are competition for limiting soil resources and herbivory. We present results from a 14-year full factorial experiment in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem that crossed nitrogen (N) addition with fencing to exclude white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, from half the plots. Deer presence was associated with only modest decreases in aboveground plant biomass (14% decrease; -45 +/- 19 g m(-2)) with no interaction with N addition. N addition at 5.44 and 9.52 g N m(-2) year(-1) led to increases in biomass. There were weak increases in species richness associated with deer presence, but only for no or low added N (1 and 2 g N m(-2) year(-1)). However, the presence of deer greatly impacted the abundances of some of the dominant perennial forb species, but not the dominant grasses. Deer presence increased the abundance of the forb Artemisia ludoviciana by 34 +/- 12 SE g m(-2) (94%) and decreased the forb Solidago rigida by 32 +/- 13 SE g m(-2) (79%). We suggest that these changes may have resulted from trade-off in plant competitive ability for soil N versus resistance to deer herbivory. Field observations suggest deer acted as florivores, mainly consuming the flowers of susceptible forb species. The preferential consumption of flowers of forbs that seem to be superior N competitors appears to create an axis of interspecific niche differentiation. The overpopulation of white-tailed deer in many tallgrass reserves likely structures the abundance of forb species.

AB  - Optimal foraging theory (OFT) and the energy maximization hypothesis (EMH) have long been essential when examining wildlife habitat selection. At high latitudes and altitudes, animals in winter face greater limitations in availability and accessibility of forage. Here we explore the foraging behavior of wood bison (Bison bison athabascae) during winter within the Ronald Lake bison herd in northeastern Alberta, Canada, and examine the trade-offs they face due to limitations in forage abundance and availability (snow conditions), as well as the need to minimize predation risk. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) location data collected from 70 female wood bison to identify winter foraging sites and craters selected by bison to access forage beneath the snow. Within wetlands used by bison we selected 190 pairs of used (foraged) and random (available) sites to test eight a priori hypotheses explaining how bison traded-off between forage availability, accessibility, and minimizing predation risk. We found with matched-paired logistic regression that Carex atherodes was 1.21-times more likely to be selected per unit increase in ground cover, compared to 1.17-times per unit ground cover for C. aquatilis and C. utriculata. However, all Carex species showed an increase in selection when cover was > 50% cover within individual craters. While the importance of Carex was clear, forage site selection was still inversely related to snow depth. There is also a neutralizing combined effect of snow depth and Carex species ground cover which suggests that bison maximized their energy return by avoiding areas with deep snow (> 30 cm) that demanded intensive cratering, even when highly selected forage was accessible beneath. Avoidance of forage areas with deep snow demonstrates that wood bison employed a foraging strategy that considers both forage availability and environmental conditions, with snow depth being a limiting factor. We highlight the relationship between optimal foraging based on food availability and the trade-offs within an energy restrictive winter season, furthering the understanding of how large herbivores forage strategically to maximize energy intake in northern environments.

AB  - Microbiome diversity and diet composition concomitantly influence species health, fitness, immunity, and digestion. In environments where diet varies spatially and temporally, microbiome plasticity may promote rapid host adaptation to available resources. For northern ungulates in particular, metabarcoding of noninvasively collected fecal pellets presents unprecedented insights into their diverse ecological requirements and niches by clarifying the interrelationships of microbiomes, key to deriving nutrients, in context of altered forage availability in changing climates. Muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) are Arctic-adapted species that experience fluctuating qualities and quantities of vegetation. Geography and seasonality have been noted to influence microbiome composition and diversity in muskoxen, yet it is unclear how their microbiomes intersect with diet. Following observations from other species, we hypothesized increasing diet diversity would result in higher microbiome diversity in muskoxen. We assessed diet composition in muskoxen using three common plant metabarcoding markers and explored correlations with microbiome data. Patterns of dietary diversity and composition were not fully concordant among the markers used, yet all reflected the primary consumption of willows and sedges. Individuals with similar diets had more similar microbiomes, yet in contrast to most literature, yielded negative relationships between microbiome and diet alpha diversity. This negative correlation may reflect the unique capacities of muskoxen to survive solely on high-fiber Arctic forage and provide insight into their resiliency to exploit changing dietary resources in a rapidly warming Arctic altering vegetation diversity.

AB  - Freshwater megafauna, such as sturgeons, giant catfishes, river dolphins, hippopotami, crocodylians, large turtles, and giant salamanders, have experienced severe population declines and range contractions worldwide. Although there is an increasing number of studies investigating the causes of megafauna losses in fresh waters, little attention has been paid to synthesising the impacts of megafauna on the abiotic environment and other organisms in freshwater ecosystems, and hence the consequences of losing these species. This limited understanding may impede the development of policies and actions for their conservation and restoration. In this review, we synthesise how megafauna shape ecological processes in freshwater ecosystems and discuss their potential for enhancing ecosystem restoration. Through activities such as movement, burrowing, and dam and nest building, megafauna have a profound influence on the extent of water bodies, flow dynamics, and the physical structure of shorelines and substrata, increasing habitat heterogeneity. They enhance nutrient cycling within fresh waters, and cross-ecosystem flows of material, through foraging and reproduction activities. Freshwater megafauna are highly connected to other freshwater organisms via direct consumption of species at different trophic levels, indirect trophic cascades, and through their influence on habitat structure. The literature documenting the ecological impacts of freshwater megafauna is not evenly distributed among species, regions, and types of ecological impacts, with a lack of quantitative evidence for large fish, crocodylians, and turtles in the Global South and their impacts on nutrient flows and food-web structure. In addition, population decline, range contraction, and the loss of large individuals have reduced the extent and magnitude of megafaunal impacts in freshwater ecosystems, rendering a posteriori evaluation more difficult. We propose that reinstating freshwater megafauna populations holds the potential for restoring key ecological processes such as disturbances, trophic cascades, and species dispersal, which will, in turn, promote overall biodiversity and enhance nature's contributions to people. Challenges for restoration actions include the shifting baseline syndrome, potential human-megafauna competition for habitats and resources, damage to property, and risk to human life. The current lack of historical baselines for natural distributions and population sizes of freshwater megafauna, their life history, trophic interactions with other freshwater species, and interactions with humans necessitates further investigation. Addressing these knowledge gaps will improve our understanding of the ecological roles of freshwater megafauna and support their full potential for facilitating the development of effective conservation and restoration strategies to achieve the coexistence of humans and megafauna.

AB  - Overgrazing by introduced herbivores is widely recognized as a threatening process in Australia's semi-arid rangelands. Comparatively, grazing by native herbivores is generally considered to have benign effects. Populations of introduced herbivores are controlled in conservation reserves, but populations of native kangaroos and wallabies are seldom subject to control. We investigated the impacts of rabbit and kangaroo grazing on vegetation and soils at Yathong Nature Reserve in semi-arid Australia during the dry conditions that prevailed in 2019. We conducted spotlight and dung surveys to measure the relative abundance of kangaroos and rabbits, and assessed understorey biomass, woody plant density, soil bulk density and water infiltration rates in selective herbivore exclosures that had been established in 1979, and nearby controls that all herbivores could access. Kangaroos were the dominant herbivores at the time of our study. Grazing by kangaroos decreased grass biomass, increased soil density and reduced the rate of water infiltration. Rabbits reduced woody plant density but had no detectable effect on understorey vegetation cover or soil attributes. Our findings question the existing paradigms about how grazing by kangaroos should be viewed and prompt the question: should kangaroo populations be managed within conservation reserves to reduce their impacts on ecosystems?

AB  - Herbivores affect plants via direct consumption, but also indirectly via changes in the vegetation. These indirect effects may only manifest after decades of exposure and, as a result, their impact is rarely accounted for. To better understand the direct and indirect impacts of a large herbivore, moose (Alces alces), on forests, we measured tree growth in areas that were both subjected to and excluded from herbivory for over 80 years. Growth data were gathered from five tree species, ranging from low to high palatability. We found that at small sizes, Betula papyrifera, a preferred species, benefited from herbivore exclusion. However, larger individuals grew more when exposed to herbivory, a response we attribute to lower competition in heavily browsed conditions. Populus tremuloides, a highly preferred tree, did not show any differences between levels of herbivory. Abies balsamea, a preferred winter browsed, was only marginally affected by browsing at smaller sizes. The two non-preferred species, Picea glauca and Picea mariana, did not show differential growth between herbivory levels. We conclude that herbivores can impact forests through both direct and indirect effects, that these effects are size specific, and that effects vary among species in ways not always predicted by consumption patterns.

AB  - The use of taste agents to regulate the grazing behavior of livestock is a new attempt in pasture management, but the effects on grassland plant communities are not clear at present. Therefore, the following scientific questions need to be addressed: (1) how do different taste agents affected plant community structure by changing feed intake? (2) What was the mechanism of this effect? We proposed the following hypotheses: (1) Salt and sweetener increased feed intake of livestock and decreased the biomass of plant community, while bitters did the opposite. (2) Taste agents can regulate the relationship between plant species, and different taste agents can enhance or weaken the competitiveness of the different plants. In order to test the hypothesis, a grazing experiment with yaks was conducted in the alpine meadows of the Tibetan Plateau. Denatonium benzoate (Bitterant), NaCl (Salt), and sodium cyclamate (Sweetener) were sprayed onto the meadows twice a year, along with a control treatment of tap water. The results showed that (1) Salt increased the feed intake of yak significantly; bitterant decreased the feed intake of livestock and increased the biomass of plant community. (2) Salt increased the Pielou index of the plant community significantly. (3) The stability of plant community ranking from high to low is as follows: Control > Bitterant > Sweetener > Salt. (4) Bitterant and salt improved grazing tolerance of grassland and salt reduced the edibility of grassland. (5) The use of taste agents reduced the correlation between dominant species and led to the fragmentation of the relationship chain. The results of this study will provide a theoretical basis for using taste agents to regulate the community, species biodiversity management, restoration of degraded grassland, promoting utilization of grassland though controlling livestock selectivity.

AB  - Context Studies of tree cover and spatial pattern in tropical savannas often focus on coarse-scale effects of climate, disturbance, and herbivory. Local hydrological, topographic, or edaphic factors, however, play an important role in determining resource availability for trees, but we often lack data for these variables at fine spatial resolution. River networks can serve as a proxy for some of these effects. Objectives Our objective was to characterize the relationship between distance to rivers and tree cover and spatial pattern, and to provide a first-order assessment of the total fraction of tree cover associated with river networks in a savanna ecosystem. Methods We explored the relationship between tree cover amount and patchiness as a function of distance to rivers in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We used segmented regression to identify the proportion of trees most likely to be influenced by river-associated resources. Results Both tree cover and tree patchiness declined systematically with distance to rivers, with tree cover declining up to about 100 m from river beds. Assuming that trees closer than this threshold are influenced by rivers (e.g., through greater access to groundwater), between a third and half of all Serengeti trees may be classifiable as 'river-associated trees.' Conclusions Our results suggest that river networks may play a greater role in determining the amount and spatial pattern of tree cover in savanna ecosystems than previously considered, with potentially important consequences for savanna dynamics, and perhaps drought resilience.

AB  - In many regions of the world, browsing pressure by ungulates has increased over the last century, often reaching unsustainable levels. Overbrowsing by ungulates is threatening biodiversity and causing delays in the establishment of forest regeneration. Moose (Alces alces) is considered as an ecological engineer, as it can cause severe impacts on stand structure, composition, quality, and succession through overbrowsing. In conifer-dominated stands, moose browsing pressure has been shown to vary with the distribution of forage and cover patches across the landscape, but such spatial relationships have not been explored in hardwood-dominated landscapes, where intensive forest management can create clustered patches of good-quality forage and cover, ideal conditions for wintering moose. We investigated the influence of local and landscape variables on browsing by North American moose (Alces alces americana) on commercial and non-commercial woody regeneration in an intensively managed forest landscape of northwestern New Brunswick, Canada. We predicted that browsing pressure at the local scale (vegetation sampling plot) would increase with moose winter counts in the surrounding landscape (1 to 3 km radius). We modeled moose counts as a function of environmental features and road density, using a quasi-Poisson regression. According to an aerial survey (25 km(2) sampling plots), moose counts increased with the proportion of forage patches (disturbed stands < 20 years old), whereas they decreased with the proportion of mixed mature stands > 80 years old, which offer both forage and cover. We extrapolated this model to a 2770 km(2) study area and used predicted counts as an independent variable to assess its influence on browsing pressure. In 720 plots of 4.15 m(2), browsing pressure was quantified using occurrence (i.e. proportion of seedlings/saplings with at least one twig browsed during the previous winter) and intensity (i.e. mean proportion of twigs browsed per stem) on commercial and non-commercial tree seedlings and saplings. We explained variation in occurrence and intensity using zero-inflated models with snow precipitation and local vegetation variables as covariates. Browsing pressure increased with predicted moose counts within a 3 km radius, with snow precipitation and with the proportion of coniferous trees in the canopy, whereas it decreased with sapling density. These results highlight the importance of seedlings and saplings in moose winter diet and confirm the attraction of moose toward recent (<20-year-old) harvest blocks during winter. Therefore, we should avoid aggregating harvest blocks to decrease their attractiveness to moose and browsing pressure on natural hardwood regeneration.

AB  - Reef-building species are recognized as having an important ecological role and as generally enhancing the diversity of benthic organisms in marine habitats. However, although these ecosystem engineers have a facilitating role for some species, they may exclude or compete with others. The honeycomb worm Sabelaria alveolata (Linnaeus, 1767) is an important foundation species, commonly found from northwest Ireland to northern Mauritania, whose reef structures increase the physical complexity of the marine benthos, supporting high levels of biodiversity. Local patterns and regional differences in taxonomic and functional diversity were examined in honeycomb worm reefs from 10 sites along the northeastern Atlantic to explore variation in diversity across biogeographic regions and the potential effects of environmental drivers. While taxonomic composition varied across the study sites, levels of diversity remained relatively constant along the European coast. Assemblages showed high levels of species turnover compared to differences in richness, which varied primarily in response to sea surface temperatures and sediment content, the latter suggesting that local characteristics of the reef had a greater effect on community composition than the density of the engineering species. In contrast, the functional composition of assemblages was similar regardless of taxonomic composition or biogeography, with five functional groups being observed in all sites and only small differences in abundance in these groups being detected. Functional groups represented primarily filter-feeders and deposit-feeders, with the notable absence of herbivores, indicating that the reefs may act as biological filters for some species from the local pool of organisms. Redundancy was observed within functional groups that may indicate that honeycomb worm reefs can offer similar niche properties to its associated assemblages across varying environmental conditions. These results highlight the advantages of comparing taxonomic and functional metrics, which allow identification of a number of ecological processes that structure marine communities.

AB  - Numerous evaluations of the economic value of fisheries, tourism, coastal protection, and carbon sequestration have been conducted for shallow reefs. However, no quantitative evaluations of the ecosystem services provided by mesophotic reefs as a whole or that only consider provisioning, regulating, supporting, or cultural services have been conducted. We used a remotely operated vehicle to describe the composition, community structure, and ecosystem services provided by reef fishes of Isla Espiritu Santo in three depth strata ("shallow" [13-22 m], "intermediate" [23-40 m], and "deep" [41-70 m]) defined by temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, percentage of incident light, and primary productivity. From 5-min videos (n = 189), we computed Hill numbers to describe fish community structure. We classified 12 ecosystem services (provisioning, regulating, supporting, or cultural services) offered by fish. Species richness and abundance were higher in shallow reefs than deep reefs. Diversity, evenness, and average trophic level did not change, even when qualitative differences in species composition were present between zones (a higher number of herbivores [Pomacentridae and Acanthuridae] and planktivores in shallow and mesophotic reefs, respectively). Regulating and provisioning services were significantly lower in deep reefs, while cultural services were significantly higher in shallow reefs. Finally, similarities in species composition and the lack of differences in most ecological indices support the hypothesis that the deep reefs of Isla Espiritu Santo may function as refugia. However, species richness and the scores of ecosystem services were significantly different among depth strata. We propose that the mesophotic reefs in the study area serve, at least partially, as refugia for fish species.

AB  - Stream fish movement in response to changing resource availability and habitat needs is important for fish growth, survival and reproduction. The authors used radio telemetry to evaluate individual movements, daily movement rates, home ranges and habitat-use characteristics of adult (278-464 mm L-T) Neosho smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu velox in three Ozark Highlands streams from June 2016 to February 2018. The authors quantified variation in movement and habitat use among seasons and streams and examined relations with select environmental cues (i.e., temperature and discharge), fish size and sex. Maximum movement distances were an order of magnitude greater in the larger Elk River (17.0 km) and Buffalo Creek (12.9 km) than in the smaller Sycamore Creek (1.71 km), were similar in both upstream and downstream directions and typically occurred during the spring. Most movement rates were <= 10 m day(-1) in all streams and seasons, except for Elk River during spring. Ranking of linear mixed-effects models using AIC(c) supported that movement rates were much greater in spring and increased with stream size. Spring movement rate increased with discharge and water temperature; only weak relationships were apparent during other seasons. Increased variation in water temperature had a small negative effect on movement rate. Home range size was highly variable among individuals, ranging 45-15,061 m (median: 773 m), and was not related to fish size, sex, season or stream. Although some fish moved between rivers, this study's tagged fish did not use reservoir or associated interface habitat. Water temperatures used by this study's tagged fish followed seasonal patterns but indicated the use of thermal refugia during summer and winter. Deeper-water habitats were used in Buffalo Creek and in winter across all study streams, whereas greater velocities used in the Elk River likely reflect the increased use of run habitats. Use of pool habitats predominated among tagged fish, particularly in smaller streams. The results of this study indicate considerable heterogeneity in movement and habitat use within and among lotic populations of Neosho smallmouth bass. These findings suggest that population-specific management may be appropriate and highlight the importance of natural flow conditions (i.e., spring high flows) and connected habitats for this endemic sport fish, particularly in smaller streams.

AB  - Land degradation due to unsustainable land use is of major concern worldwide and recovery is often slow. A potential mechanism behind slow recovery of degraded ecosystems is the retarding impacts of allelopathic plant species on the establishment of species that might facilitate the recovery process. However, the strength of the retarding impact may depend on soil type. In this study, we investigated the potential role of an abundant, evergreen and allelopathic dwarf shrub, Empetrum nigrum, in trapping tundra ecosystems in a degraded state in Iceland after centuries of unsustainable land use. We first ran a series of bioassays to assess the potential allelopathic legacy effects of the Empetrum-associated volcanic soils (Andosol and Vitrisol) on seed germination and root elongation of the common grass species Festuca richardsonii in comparison with Empetrum-associated non-volcanic Histosol and Podzol soil types. Then we assessed the Empetrum leaf-soil interactions for all soil types using leaves from a degraded site in Iceland. We found no potential allelopathic legacy effects of Empetrum-associated volcanic soils, whereas the non-volcanic soils negatively impacted Festuca root elongation. Empetrum leaves alone affected both seed germination and root elongation. These effects were strongly alleviated by the volcanic soils, but not by the non-volcanic soils. We conclude that abundant allelopathic plant species may significantly contribute to trapping tundra ecosystems in a degraded state, but the strength of this trapping mechanism depends on the soil environment.

AB  - Alpine meadows constitute one of the major ecosystems on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, with livestock grazing exerting a considerable impact on their biodiversity. However, the degree to which plant diversity influences community stability under different grazing intensities remains unclear in this region. This study conducted controlled grazing experiments across four levels of grazing intensity (no-, low-, medium-, and high-grazing) based on herbage utilization rate to assess the influence of grazing intensities on plant community structure and diversity-stability relationships. We discovered that high-grazing reduced plant diversity and attenuated the temporal stability and resistance of above-ground biomass. No- and low-grazing could alleviate plant biomass loss, with community resistance being optimal under low-grazing. The direct effects of livestock grazing on temporal stability were found to be negligible. Plant characteristics and diversity accounted for a substantial proportion of livestock grazing effects on community resistance (R2 = 0.46), as revealed by piecewise structural equation model analysis. The presence of plant diversity enhances the resistance of alpine meadows against disturbance and accelerates the recovery after grazing. Our results suggest that low-grazing intensity may represent a judicious option for preserving species diversity and community stability on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - The importance of climate, habitat structure, and higher trophic levels on microbial diversity is only beginning to be understood. Here, we examined the influence of climate variables, plant morphology, and the abundance of aquatic invertebrates on the microbial biodiversity of the northern pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. The plant's cup-shaped leaves fill with rainwater and support a miniature, yet full-fledged, ecosystem with a diverse microbiome that decomposes captured prey and a small network of shredding and filter-feeding aquatic invertebrates that feed on microbes. We characterized pitcher microbiomes of 108 plants sampled at 36 sites from Florida to Quebec. Structural equation models revealed that annual precipitation and temperature, plant size, and midge abundance had direct effects on microbiome taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity. Climate variables also exerted indirect effects through plant size and midge abundance. Further, spatial structure and climate influenced taxonomic composition, but not phylogenetic composition. Our results suggest that direct effects of midge abundance and climate and indirect effects of climate through its effect on plant-associated factors lead to greater richness of microbial phylotypes in warmer, wetter sites.

AB  - Plant community construction is influenced by bottom-up processes, such as environmental factors, and top-down processes, such as herbivore disturbances. With climate change and overgrazing, the stability of plant community structure and function decreases, and more land at risk of degradation. However, the response of the plant community to interference from native herbivores under similar environmental conditions remains unclear. Plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) is an important small rodent inhabiting the alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and its disturbance may accelerate the degradation of grassland ecosystems when its population experiences a burst. In this study, we investigated the plant communities, collected and analyzed the soil samples, to explore the effects of plateau pikas' disturbance intensity on species composition and phylogenetic structure of plant communities on the alpine meadow. We utilized the generalized additive model and structural equation model to explain and predict the response of plant phylogenetic structure and species competition to the disturbance of plateau pikas. Our results indicated that plateau pika disturbance altered the dominance of plant groups, increased species substitution, and facilitated coexistence among different species, and it affected deterministic processes, reduced interspecific competition intensity, and promoted the dispersion of phylogenetic structures. These findings suggested that plateau pika, as a small native herbivore, plays a significant role in fostering multi-species plant communities. Therefore, it is essential to manage plateau pika disturbance intensity to maintain the stability of alpine meadow plant communities, as well as to influence the long-term succession of grassland ecosystems. This study provides some new evidence for exploring the effects of native small herbivores on the changes in grassland plant communities.

AB  - Large carnivores play key roles in their ecosystems, but their protection is a major challenge in biodiversity conservation due to conflicts with human interests. The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is the top predator of Asian high-altitude landscapes and faces various threats including wild prey depletion and illegal killings as a consequence of livestock depredation. As the interactions between snow leopards, wild prey, and livestock are still insufficiently understood, we studied the effects of 1) wild prey (blue sheep Pseudois nayaur and Himalayan marmots Marmota himalayana) and domestic prey on snow leopard relative abundance, and of 2) these ecological parameters and intervention applications on livestock depredation by snow leopards. In the Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal, we monitored wildlife populations and livestock along transects (490.8 km) in 82 grid cells (4 x4 km) in 2019 and 2021 and conducted questionnaire surveys to determine livestock depredation between 2018 and 2021 (n = 479 households). We applied generalized linear models (GLMs) and sample comparison testing to examine the effects of prey densities and other environmental and anthropogenic predictors on snow leopard relative abundance and livestock depredation. Blue sheep density strongly positively affected snow leopard relative abundance, which also increased with terrain ruggedness and decreased with increasing densities of livestock and the human population. The size of livestock holdings shaped depredation events of large livestock (yak, cattle and horse), whereas depredation events of sheep and goats, which accounted for most (68.6%) depredated animals, decreased with increasing human population density and marmot presence. The strong impact of blue sheep on snow leopard relative abundance supports demands for integrating this ungulate into conservation and management plans, including wild prey recovery and translocation. The rather weak evidence for effects of blue sheep on depredation events suggests that conflicts over livestock depredation by snow leopards would neither be inflicted nor solved by increasing wild prey abundance. This demonstrates the need to improve intervention strategies in the Annapurna region, such as predator-proofing corrals and optimizing daytime herding practices. We suggest further exploring the effects of marmots and other secondary prey on livestock depredation rates, and testing the suitability of additional interventions, e.g., dogs and deterrents, as conflict mitigation tools. Our results will support wildlife managers in setting conservation priorities to promote the long-term co-existence of local people and snow leopards.

AB  - Climate change is increasing the frequency and extent of fires in the boreal biome of North America. These changes can alter the recovery of both canopy and understory vegetation. There is uncertainty about plant and lichen recovery patterns following fire, and how they are mediated by environmental conditions. Here, we aim to address these knowledge gaps by studying patterns of postfire vegetation recovery at the community and individual species level over the first 100+ years following fire. Data from vegetation surveys collected from 581 plots in the Northwest Territories, Canada, ranging from 1 to 275 years postfire, were used to assess the influence of time after fire and local environmental conditions on plant community composition and to model trends in the relative abundance of several common plant and lichen species. Time after fire significantly influenced vegetation community composition and interacted with local environmental conditions, particularly soil moisture. Soil moisture individually (in the absence of interactions) was the most commonly significant variable in plant and lichen recovery models. Patterns of postfire recovery varied greatly among species. Our results provide novel information on plant community recovery after fire and highlight the importance of soil moisture to local vegetation patterns. They will aid northern communities and land managers to anticipate the impacts of increased fire activity on both local vegetation and the wildlife that relies on it.

AB  - Moose (Alces alces) in the boreal forest habitats of Alaska are unlike other northern ungulates because they tolerate high densities of flies (Diptera) even though flies cause wounds and infections during the warm summer months. Moose move to find food and to find relief from overheating (hyperthermia) but do they avoid flies? We used GPS collars to measure the rate of movement (m & sdot;h(-1)) and the time spent (min & sdot;day(-1)) by enclosed moose in four habitats: wetlands, black spruce, early seral boreal forest, and late seral boreal forest. Fly traps were used in each habitat to quantify spatio-temporal abundance. Average daily air temperatures increased into July when peak biomass of forage for moose was greatest in early seral boreal forest habitats (424.46 vs. 25.15 kg & sdot;ha(-1) on average in the other habitats). Average daily air temperatures were 1.7degree celsius cooler in black spruce than other habitats, but fly abundance was greatest in black spruce (approximately 4-fold greater on average than the other habitats). Moose increased their movement rate with counts of biting flies (mosquitoes, black flies, horse and deer flies), but not non-biting flies (coprophagous flies). However, as air temperature increased (above 14.7 degrees C) moose spent more time in fly-abundant black spruce, than early seral boreal forest, showing great tolerance for mosquitoes. Warm summer temperatures appear to cause moose to trade-off foraging in fly-sparse habitats for resting and dissipating heat in shady, wet habitats with abundant flies that adversely affect the fitness of moose.

AB  - Increasing numbers of wild ungulates in human-dominated landscapes in Europe could lead to negative effects, such as damages to forests through browsing. To prevent those effects and, thus, mitigate wildlife-based conflicts while ensuring viable ungulate populations, sustainable management is required. Roe deer, as the most abundant cervid species in Europe, is primarily managed via hunting to decrease population densities through harvesting. Besides direct mortality, non-lethal effects of hunting activities further affect the spatial habitat selection for this species. Accordingly, the spatial distribution of hunting locations might influence game impact on forest vegetation. To examine these relationships in more detail, we linked the spatial distribution of hunting locations for roe deer with forest damage through browsing in 20 regions in Upper Austria. Consistent with our hypothesis, an avoidance of forests by hunters was found in regions with <20% forest cover and intolerable browsing impact. When hunters in certain regions, however, used forests according to their availability, game impact on forest vegetation was tolerable. Although forest damage by ungulates depends on numerous factors, we conclude that careful consideration of hunting locations might be an additional approach to reduce browsing intensity by roe deer, at least in regions with low forest cover.

AB  - Forage plants, as primary producers, play an essential role in maintaining populations of large herbivores. The availability and quality of these forage plants can affect the health and viability of these animals. Seasonally dry forests of Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Huai Thab Salao-Huai Rabum Non-Hunting Area are recognized as one of the largest contiguous pieces of forests in mainland Southeast Asia and serve as a home to many large herbivore species, particularly banteng (Bos javanicus birmanicus). However, our understanding of forage plants and their dynamics is still limited. Therefore, the current study was undertaken to understand the dynamics of forage plants, prescribed burning effects, and the associated environmental factors. During 2018-2019, the results showed that the highest forage availability was in June after the prescribed burns at 156.2-252.6 kg ha(-1) and the lowest in February before the burning at 16.8-39.8 kg ha(-1). Environmental factors that impacted the forage availability include canopy cover, tree density, tree basal area, soil bulk density, soil pH, and topography. However, the impacts of these factors varied among the studied plant life forms, suggesting the importance of active habitat management through prescribed burns and stand improvement to maintain sufficient forage for large herbivores in the future.

AB  - Climate warming is expected to contribute to the decline of arthropod species diversity and biomass around the world. However, direct experimental evidence is lacking. Here, we report on a field experiment documenting arthropod species diversity and biomass responses to passive simulated warming for six consecutive years in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. The field warming experiment consisted of six large open-top chambers (15 x 15 x 2.5 m), with three chambers warmed and three non-warmed, resulting in mean temperature differences of 0.18 degrees C and 0.57 degrees C in the growing season and the non-growing season, respectively. Warming decreased arthropod species diversity by 39% and arthropod biomass by 18% during the experiment. Specifically, the richness of large-bodied species decreased, while small-bodied species were not significantly affected. Moreover, the abundance of small-bodied species increased, but that of large-bodied ones decreased, resulting in decreases in community size spectrum and community-weighted mean body size under warming. Results of structural equation model suggest that the decreases in arthropod species diversity (represented by species richness and community size spectrum) and biomass were primarily caused by a warming-induced shift from forb- to graminoid-dominated plant communities, which could be attributed to a warming-induced decrease in soil moisture. Moreover, the warming effect on arthropod species diversity and biomass was more pronounced in later years of the experiment, which could be partly related to the increase in mean annual temperature over the course of the experiment and progressing shift in plant community species composition over time. Our study provides unique experimental evidence that even very modest warming may result in declines in both species diversity and biomass of arthropods through cascades of indirect effects, and identifies important mechanisms underlying biodiversity loss.

AB  - The structural complexity of Halodule wrightii enhances the abundance and diversity of mollusks in the marine protected area of Bahia Balandra, in the southern Gulf of California. Marine mollusks are considered ecosystem engineers because they create, modify, and maintain habitats. Taxonomical and functional analyses of the mollusk community were carried out from May 2016 to 2017. The total abundance in all sampled periods was 7284 individuals and comprised 52 families, 69 genera, and 89 species. The Gastropoda class showed the highest number of species (61 species, 68.53%), followed by Bivalvia (24 species, 26.96%) and Scaphopoda (4 species, 4.49%). The highest density of mollusks was in the summer of 2016 (ca. 6500 ind. m(-2)), while the highest richness was found in spring 2017 (60 species). Five trophic levels were identified. All trophic groups were present in all the seasons with carnivores showing the highest species richness and herbivores the highest abundance, followed by filter-feeders. A positive and moderate relationship between the total biomass of seagrass and gastropod richness was found, while the relationship between gastropod abundance and seagrass biomass was negative. Halodule wrightii in the Gulf of California represents a unique niche that supports a high mollusk biodiversity and offers great variability of resources for this group. Halodule wrightii represents a suitable habitat for reproduction, metamorphosis, nursery, refuge, and feeding for mollusks. Finally, the functional group concept was applied to evaluate the ecosystem seagrass health of Bahia Balandra resulting in a moderate score.

AB  - Genomic studies of species threatened by extinction are providing crucial information about evolutionary mechanisms and genetic consequences of population declines and bottlenecks. However, to understand how species avoid the extinction vortex, insights can be drawn by studying species that thrive despite past declines. Here, we studied the population genomics of the muskox (Ovibos moschatus), an Ice Age relict that was at the brink of extinction for thousands of years at the end of the Pleistocene yet appears to be thriving today. We analysed 108 whole genomes, including present-day individuals representing the current native range of both muskox subspecies, the white-faced and the barren-ground muskox (O. moschatus wardi and O. moschatus moschatus) and a similar to 21,000-year-old ancient individual from Siberia. We found that the muskox' demographic history was profoundly shaped by past climate changes and post-glacial re-colonizations. In particular, the white-faced muskox has the lowest genome-wide heterozygosity recorded in an ungulate. Yet, there is no evidence of inbreeding depression in native muskox populations. We hypothesize that this can be explained by the effect of long-term gradual population declines that allowed for purging of strongly deleterious mutations. This study provides insights into how species with a history of population bottlenecks, small population sizes and low genetic diversity survive against all odds.

AB  - Small-sized invertebrates inhabiting hard substrates in coral reefs (a.k.a. cryptofauna) contribute substantially to reef biodiversity, but their patterns of distribution and ecological controls are poorly understood. Here, we characterized the cryptofauna community and explored "bottom-up" and "top-down" controls by benthic cover and fish abundance, respectively. We sampled the cryptofauna inhabiting the reef terrace from 13 sites along 200 km in Jardines de la Reina (Cuba), a well-preserved and protected area in the Caribbean. We counted 23,959 invertebrates of 14 higher taxa, being the most abundant Copepoda (54%), Nematoda (21%), Mollusca (7%), Ostracoda (5%), Polychaeta (5%), and Amphipoda (3%). Richness, abundance, and community structure varied across the reefs without any geographical gradient of distribution. One-third of the variance occurred at site scale (similar to 10 km), and half occurred at quadrat scale (similar to 1 m). Algal cover promoted cryptofauna richness and abundance likely providing substrate and food, while live coral cover negatively influenced nematode abundances, potentially due to coral defenses. Relationships between cryptofauna and reef fishes were also present, with invertivores and herbivores negatively affecting cryptofauna abundance likely due to direct or indirect predation pressures. This research highlights the important roles of bottom-up and top-down controls, by algal/coral cover and fishes, respectively, on cryptofauna and in extension to coral reef biodiversity. Current threats by climate change are expected to alter these controls on cryptofauna resulting in changes to diversity, trophodynamics and energy flows of coral reefs.

AB  - Shrub encroachment can alter the structure and function of grassland ecosystems, leading to their degradation. Therefore, population regeneration dynamics after shrub encroachment on the influence of grassland should not be ignored. H. rhamnoides, as a pioneer species, has significantly encroached with large areas on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) due to climate change and over-grazing. However, few studies have focused on the dynamics of population regeneration following successful encroachment. Therefore, we studied H. rhamnoides natural population in the alpine grasslands, investigating population regeneration pattern, seed, bud production and storage, and limitation imposed by microhabitats (soil, light and feeding). Our aim was to explore population regeneration strategies and identify key limiting factors for population regeneration after successful encroachment. Our findings revealed several key points: (i) H. rhamnoides entered the alpine grassland by relying on seeds, it would seize resources by low-cost clonal reproduction, then increase sexual reproduction to improve genetic diversity. (ii) The production and storage of seeds and buds was sufficient, seed vigor was high, seed emergence rate was higher due to mechanical restriction of hard seed coat was weakened by the water transport channels in the palisade layer, and formation of seedlings was less restricted. (iii) H. rhamnoides population regeneration was mainly limited by microhabitats light and feeding. However, light and feeding significantly affected seedlings photosynthesis and carbon storage, their interaction significantly reduced the seedlings survival, and further restricted population regeneration. The results can provide theoretical basis for the restoration and management of alpine grassland degradation caused by shrub encroachment.

AB  - 1. Anthropogenic land use has transformed habitats globally, leading to human-wildlife cohabitation that presents challenges and opportunities for coexistence. This coexistence is contingent on the nature and frequency of human-animal interactions (HAI) that are primarily shaped by public attitudes and values.
   2. We designed a questionnaire using the Wildlife Attitudes and Values (WAVS) and Wildlife Value Orientations (WVO) frameworks to investigate public attitudes and values regarding a feral ungulate, the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), living in and around the South Lantau region of Hong Kong. We analysed 657 questionnaire responses (online = 550, in-person = 107) and additional comments from 56 respondents who completed their questionnaire in person.
   3. We conducted exploratory factor analyses using the questionnaire responses related to WAVS and WVO. Two latent factors from each framework were found: (i) WAVS-Tolerance and Appreciation and Social Benefits and Advocacy, explaining similar to 64% of data variance, and (ii) WVO-Preservation and Education, and Daily Interactions, explaining similar to 60% of data variance. We conducted a thematic analysis of the additional comments to explore how these factors contextualise public attitudes and values regarding buffalo.
   4. Using demographic data (self-reported gender, age, ethnicity, education level and place of birth), we conducted linear regression analyses to investigate the associations between demographic characteristics and the four latent factors. Gender, age, ethnicity and place of birth were strongly associated with the latent factors. We also found significant variation among participants living in the three districts of Hong Kong and whether they were South Lantau residents, with regard to the latent factors. These findings imply a complex interplay between public attitudes and values toward a feral animal and their relationships with the natural environment. Fifty-six respondents provided a total of 207 additional comments, highlighting Safety concerns and issues, Emotion and sentiment, and Livelihood impacts as key themes.
   5. Studying public attitudes and values, such as appreciation and preservation for semi-urban feral buffalo, points to methods for successful strategies using buffalo as 'agents' of conservation. This includes considering social, cultural and demographic factors for tailored approaches and integrating them into solutions for human-animal interactions, facilitating long-term conservation success.

AB  - center dot The study investigated the impact of intraspecific plant chemodiversity on plant growth and reproductive traits at both the plant and plot levels. It also aimed to understand how chemodiversity at stand level affects ecosystem functioning and plant-plant interactions. center dot We describe a biodiversity experiment in which we manipulated intraspecific plant chemodiversity at the plot level using six different chemotypes of common tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L., Asteraceae). We tested the effects of chemotype identity and plot-level chemotype richness on plant growth and reproductive traits and plot-level headspace emissions. center dot The study found that plant chemotypes differed in growth and reproductive traits and that traits were affected by the chemotype richness of the plots. Although morphological differences among chemotypes became less pronounced over time, reproductive phenology patterns persisted. Plot-level trait means were also affected by the presence or absence of certain chemotypes in a plot, and the direction of the effect depended on the specific chemotype. However, chemotype richness did not lead to overyielding effects. Lastly, chemotype blends released from plant communities were neither richer nor more diverse with increasing plot-level chemotype richness, but became more dissimilar as they became more dissimilar in their leaf terpenoid profiles. center dot We found that intraspecific plant chemodiversity is crucial in plant-plant interactions. We also found that the effects of chemodiversity on plant growth and reproductive traits were complex and varied depending on the chemotype richness of the plots. This long-term field experiment will allow further investigation into plant-insect interactions and insect community assembly in response to intraspecific chemodiversity.

AB  - Human-mediated dispersal of non-native earthworms can cause substantial changes to the functioning and composition of ecosystems previously earthworm-free. Some of these earthworm species have the potential to "geoengineer" soils and increase plant nitrogen (N) uptake. Yet the possible consequences of increased plant N concentrations on rodent grazing remains poorly understood. In this study, we present findings from a common garden experiment with two tundra communities, meadow (forb dominated) and heath (shrub dominated), half of them subjected to 4 years of earthworm presence (Lumbricus spp. and Aporrectodea spp.). Within four summers, our earthworm treatment changed plant community composition by increasing graminoid density by, on average, 94% in the heath vegetation and by 49% in the meadow. Rodent winter grazing was more intense on plants growing in soils with earthworms, an effect that coincided with higher N concentrations in plants, indicating a higher palatability. Even though earthworms reduced soil moisture, plant community productivity, as indicated by vegetation greenness (normalized difference vegetation index), was not negatively impacted. We conclude that earthworm-induced changes in plant composition and trophic interactions may fundamentally alter the functioning of tundra ecosystems.

AB  - Establishing protected areas is a key element of most conservation strategies, but continuous effective management is needed to ensure that biodiversity is protected. Here we provide an evaluation of park effectiveness by quantifying changes in the abundance of the commonly occurring ungulates (bushbuck - Tragelaphus scriptus; red duiker - Cephalophus harveyi; blue duiker - Cephalophus moniticola, bushpigs - Potomochoerus larvatus, and giant forest hogs - Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), and African elephants (forest elephants - Loxodonta cyclotis, savanna elephants Loxodonta africana, and their hybrids) in Kibale National Park, Uganda and consider the financial commitment needed to ensure protection. Following the upgrading of the protection of Kibale from a forest reserve to a national park, wildlife populations generally increased. Bushpigs are an exception and their populations appear stable. The increases of ungulate and elephant populations typically happened soon after park establishment, with the exception of the giant forest hog that only recently showed an increase. We conducted an assessment of Uganda Wildlife Authorities budget and those of the small NGOs working in the area and considered the contribution that Makerere University Biological Field Stations makes to the community. This analysis indicates that with a small budget UWA and its collaborators have been successful in protecting the park's ungulate and elephant populations. While the past decades have demonstrated the park's ability to conserve biodiversity with limited resources, the changing climate and mounting pressures faced by the park will necessitate significantly increased investments.

AB  - Risk associated with predation influences habitat selection in Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer). In the absence of predation risk, selection pressure for predator avoidance behaviors are relaxed, but behavioral traits associated with predator avoidance often persist. Our study area lacks populations of typical predators of White-tailed Deer, and our objective was to investigate birth-site selection by parturient White-tailed Deer in the absence of predation risk. We paired observed birth-sites (n = 31) with random sites and compared the vegetation characteristics using univariate paired analyses. Females selected birth-sites with 10% more vegetation density up to 1 m in comparison to random sites (P = 0.02). Parturient females have retained some degree of selection towards predator avoidance behavior despite the absence of non- human predator communities in the study area.

AB  - Ecosystem engineers affect other organisms by creating, maintaining or modifying habitats, potentially supporting species of conservation concern. However, it is important to consider these interactions alongside non-engineering trophic pathways. We investigated the relative importance of trophic and non-trophic effects of an ecosystem engineer, red deer, on a locally rare moth, the transparent burnet (Zygaena purpuralis). This species requires specific microhabitat conditions, including the foodplant, thyme, and bare soil for egg-laying. The relative importance of grazing (i.e., trophic effect of modifying microhabitat) and trampling (i.e., non-trophic effect of exposing bare soil) by red deer on transparent burnet abundance is unknown. We tested for these effects using a novel method of placing pheromone-baited funnel traps in the field. Imago abundance throughout the flight season was related to plant composition, diversity and structure at various scales around each trap. Indirect effects of red deer activity were accounted for by testing red deer pellet and trail presence against imago abundance. Imago abundance was positively associated with thyme and plant diversity, whilst negatively associated with velvet grass and heather species cover. The presence of red deer pellets and trails were positively associated with imago abundance. The use of these sites by red deer aids the transparent burnet population via appropriate levels of grazing and the provision of a key habitat condition, bare soil, in the form of deer trails. This study shows that understanding how both trophic and non-trophic interactions affect the abundance of a species provides valuable insights regarding conservation objectives.

AB  - Physical trampling is a ubiquitous activity of walking vertebrates, but is poorly understood as a mechanism impacting biogeochemical cycling in soil. Lack of detailed knowledge of soil abiotic-biotic interactions underlying trampling effects, and the primary sources of heterogeneity in these effects, limit our ability to predict ecosystem-level consequences of ongoing population changes in large animals. We conducted a summer field study of moose trampling effects on soil properties and nitrogen cycling using natural moose trails in boreal forest and heath barren ecosystems on the island of Newfoundland, Canada. We tested the extent to which trampling effects on soil abiotic properties, microbes, and nitrogen cycling depend on local trampling severity, and/or ecosystem type. Using structural equation models, we further tested whether trampling effects on soil nitrogen mineralization occurred via indirect interaction chains mediated by soil abiotic and microbial properties. Finally, we tested whether trampling modifies plot-scale controls on net nitrogen mineralization. Trampling effects on the soil environment, substrate, and microbial properties depended on ecosystem type, but rarely on trampling severity. Trampling effects were of consistently greater magnitude in heath than in forest. Further, trampling effects on organic matter content, pH, moisture, microbial abundance, and microbial community composition were qualitatively different between forest and heath ecosystems. Trampling severity increased the magnitude of some trampling effects in heath, but did not impact the direction of the effects and did not significantly impact any trampling effects in forest. Trampling indirect effects on soil microbes were ecosystem-dependent but did not alter net N mineralization rates. In forest, trampling did not shift N mineralization rates via any indirect interaction chains, but modified relationships between N mineralization and other soil physical and microbial properties. In heath, multiple opposing interaction chains resulted in no net shift in N mineralization rates, and most relationships between diverse soil properties and N mineralization were not modified by trampling. Overall, our results disentangle complex abiotic-biotic interactions underlying megafauna effects on ecosystem functioning. These insights pave the way for better integration of animal consumptive and non-consumptive mechanisms into biogeochemical models, as well as prediction of trampling effects over landscapes.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands are recognized as important habitat for bumblebees in Fennoscandia. These grasslands are maintained by free-ranging sheep, but it is unclear which sheep intensities are most beneficial to bumblebees. We will compare bumblebee species richness and abundance with Bayesian mixed models at varying levels of disturbance by sheep to test the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, while considering other important habitat variables: distance to forest, meadow size, sward height, and availability of flowers, litter and bare soil. Practical Implication: Results of this investigation will provide valuable information to land managers setting limits for the number of free-ranging sheep released on semi-natural grasslands within the coniferous boreal landscape to benefit bumblebee conservation.

AB  - Verbal accounts, supported by limited ground-based and satellite images, reveal decreasing riparian woodland and a loss of large trees along the rivers of the Kruger National Park (KNP, South Africa) over the last century. A multi-decadal analysis was conducted to identify trends in extent and possible drivers of riparian woodland change. Aerial and satellite imagery (1936-2018) were used to quantify changes in the extent of riparian woodland at 18 sites on 14 rivers in KNP. These changes were compared in a multivariate time-series with river flow and local rainfall. Particular attention was paid to cumulative flow effects, as well as the frequency and magnitude of large infrequent disturbances such as droughts and floods. Riparian tree cover fluctuated over the time period, and the trajectory of change varied between sites. Most (11) sites experienced a decrease in overall riparian tree cover over similar to 80 years, with these declines being significant at six sites. Peak flow and maximum rainfall events were strongly associated with these decreases, indicating that flood events are potentially the biggest driver of tree loss from the system. Indeed, the mega-flood event of 2000 and subsequent large floods have resulted in substantial declines in riparian woodland extent in recent decades. Alternatively, flow variability and cumulative rainfall significantly influenced woodland expansion in isolated cases. With global change models predicting more erratic rainfall and an increased likelihood of large infrequent disturbances, together with increasing demands to abstract more water, the long-term future of these dynamic habitats and their associated biota here is uncertain.

AB  - Plant diversity aboveground can exert top-down pressure on herbivores by attracting predatory insects, while organic soil amendments rich in beneficial microbes can limit herbivores from the bottom-up by enhancing plant defensive chemistry. Aboveground and belowground forces always operate simultaneously to shape herbivore pressure, but understanding how they interact is a longstanding and persistent challenge. Here, we examine how organic composts mediate the effects of plant diversity across trophic levels, using zucchini plants (Cucurbita pepo) as a study system. Over two field seasons, we manipulated vermicompost treatments in 18 experiments in school gardens that varied in surrounding plant and floral resource diversity and measured responses of insect herbivores and their natural enemies. Vermicompost strengthened a positive relationship between flower richness and foliar-feeding omnivores, suggesting that robust reservoirs of omnivores at flower-rich sites mounted stronger responses to compost-treated host plants. Predators increased with flower richness, but were not affected by vermicompost. Net outcomes of vermicompost and plant diversity were neutral for herbivores. Synthesis and applications. Altogether, our results reveal that bottom-up factors protecting plants are modified by their environmental context, and may more effectively attract natural enemies in landscapes with diverse floral resources. Therefore, we recommend augmentation of biodiversity aboveground (i.e. floral resources) together with biodiversity belowground (organic soil amendments) to strengthen crop protection.

AB  - Large terrestrial herbivorous mammals (LTH-mammals) influence plant community structure by affecting seedling establishment in mature tropical forests. Many of these LTH-mammals frequent secondary forests, but their effects on seedling establishment in them are understudied, hindering our understanding of how LTH-mammals influence forest regeneration in human-modified landscapes.We tested the hypothesis that the strength of LTH-mammals' effects on seedling establishment depends on landscape protection, forest successional stage and plant species' traits using a manipulative field experiment in six 1-ha sites with varying successional age and landscape protection. In each site, we established 40 seedling plot-pairs, with one plot excluding LTH-mammals and one not, and monitored seedlings of 116 woody species for 26 months.We found significant effects of LTH-mammal exclusion on seedling survival contingent upon the protection of forests at the landscape level and forest stage. After 26 months, survival differences between LTH-mammal exclusion and non-exclusion treatments were greater in protected than unprotected landscapes. Additionally, plant species' traits were related to the LTH-mammals' differential effects, as LTH-mammals reduced the survival of seedlings of larger-seeded species the most. Overall, LTH-mammals' effects translated into significant shifts in community composition as seedling communities inside and outside the exclosures diverged. Moreover, lower density and higher species diversity were found as early as 12 and 18 months outside than inside exclosures.Synthesis and applications. Insight into the interactions between LTH-mammals and seedling communities in forest regeneration can be instrumental in planning effective restoration efforts. We highlight the importance of landscape protection in seedling survival and the role of LTH-mammals in promoting seedling diversity in mature forests but also in secondary successional forests. The findings suggest that conservation efforts and possibly trophic rewilding can be important approaches for preserving diversity and influencing the trajectory of secondary tropical forest succession. However, we also caution that an overabundance of LTH-mammals may adversely impact the pace of forest succession due to their preference for large-seeded species. Therefore, a comprehensive wildlife management plan is indispensable. Additionally, longer term studies on LTH-mammals are necessary to understand the effects of temporal fluctuations that are undetected in short-term studies.

AB  - Research on the coexistence of congeneric species is essential for understanding community assemblages. Smaller competitors are expected to avoid larger ones, either spatially or temporally, to reduce interspecific competition. According to the spatial scaling law, the greater the difference in body size, the weaker the competitive interactions of the competitors. However, this is not confirmed in the guild of tropical forest ungulates. In this study, we assessed the competitive interactions of Williamson's mouse deer (Tragulus williamsoni), an endangered species and one of the smallest ungulates in the world, with sympatric larger ungulates. We hypothesized that: 1) because of its extremely small body size, competition with the larger ungulates would be relatively weak, allowing spatial co-existence but still requiring temporal avoidance, and 2) the strength of avoidance would increases with decreasing differences in body size. We set up 238 camera traps from January 2017 to January 2021 to survey Williamson's mouse deer and the sympatric larger ungulate species, that is, northern red muntjac (Muntiacus vaginalis), wild boar (Sus scrofa), Chinese serow (Capricornis milneedwardsii), and sambar (Rusa unicolor), in the protected areas of Mengla County, southwestern China. We then performed spatio-temporal analyses, including occupancy models, daily activity patterns, and a time interval analysis. Spatially, there was no significant avoidance. Temporally, Williamson's mouse deer had different daily activity patterns and direct temporal avoidance of all larger ungulate species. The lack of spatial avoidance and strong temporal avoidance supported our first hypothesis, but the stronger avoidance of much larger species ran counter to our second hypothesis. Our results revealed the coexistence mechanism between Williamson's mouse deer and sympatric larger ungulates and suggested that the difference in body size is limited in explaining the competitive interactions of tropical forest ungulates due to the effects of multiple ecological processes. This deepens our understanding of the relationship between species trait differences and community assembly in tropical forest ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding how biodiversity responds to fine-scale heterogeneity improves our ability to predict larger-scale diversity patterns and informs local-scale conservation practices. This information is important in the design of conservation set-asides in commercial forestry landscapes in the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany biodiversity hotspot, in South Africa. We assessed how soil arthropod assemblages vary among biotopes with varying degrees of contrast in forestry landscape mosaics in this hotspot. The biotopes included dry and hydromorphic grasslands, indigenous forests and pine plantations. Assemblages were highly segregated among all biotopes for overall arthropods, and for all the feeding guilds, namely predators, herbivores, detritivores, and omnivores. There was a high degree of assemblage dissimilarity between structurally contrasting biotopes (grasslands vs. wooded biotopes) and biotopes that differ in their degree of transformation (natural biotopes vs. plantations). Yet, there was an equally high level of assemblage dissimilarity between dry and hydromorphic grasslands, which are similar in structure and undergo the same disturbance regimes, which emphasises the responsiveness of soil fauna to fine-scale habitat heterogeneity. Different biotopes favoured different feeding guilds and each biotope had species strongly associated with it, highlighting the complementarity of the biotopes. All natural biotopes had relatively high species richness, diversity, and species turnover. The diversity and turnover in pine plantations was as high as in the natural areas, suggesting that plantation conditions may favour certain soil arthropods.

AB  - The long-term conservation of species at risk relies on numerous, and often concurrent, management actions to support their recovery. Generally, these actions are habitat-based while others are focused on a species' position within its ecological community. Less studied are the impacts from human presence, despite evidence that human activity may reduce the area functionally available for occupancy or resource acquisition. In the winter of 2020/2021, COVID-19-related travel restrictions led to a reduction in helicopter-assisted back-country skiing (heli-skiing). We examined how these reductions in heli-skiing (termed the anthropause) affected the movement ecology and resource selection of southern mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) as compared to two prior years (2018/2019 and 2019/2020) and the following year when heli-skiing resumed (2021/2022). We found that home-range size was on average 80-120% larger during the anthropause than in years of normal heli-ski operations. Movement rates also varied among periods, with movement during the anthropause (11.9 km(2)/day) being higher than in 2019/2020 (7.8 km(2)/day) and 2021/2022 (8.7 km(2)/day), though similar to 2018/2019 (12.2 km(2)/day). Resource selection among periods did not differ, with caribou consistently selecting old forests, high elevations and gentle terrain. These results suggest that back-country recreation, specifically heli-skiing, may be limiting access to resources for southern mountain caribou. This limitation arises through reduced home-range size within suitable late-winter habitat, relative to when heli-skiing is reduced or not occurring - consistent with Encounter Theory. While the demographic effects of reduced home-range size and movement were not examined here, reduced access to resources likely compounds other stressors known to affect population viability of caribou. The results of this study demonstrate the impact that recreation can have on wildlife and highlight the need to consider heli-skiing and other forms of recreation when developing recovery plans.

AB  - Background and aims - Plant phenology, defined as the timing of recurring life events like leaf flushing, flowering, or fruiting, is highly sensitive to environmental factors such as photoperiod, temperature, and moisture. Phenological synchrony between interacting species - such as plants and their pollinators - is of major importance to the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Plant phenology might also be affected by changes in edaphic conditions. However, whether former agricultural activities may shift phenological patterns of plant communities remains poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the impact of past agricultural practices on herbaceous plant community phenology in the protected Mediterranean xeric grassland of La Crau (France).
   Material and methods - We compared (1) species composition, and (2) phenological patterns of annuals, perennials, Bromus rubens (annual), and Lobularia maritima (perennial), in formerly-cultivated plots - abandoned for 30 years and intact native grassland plots (steppe), both subjected to itinerant sheep grazing.
   Key results and conclusion - Our results suggest that former agricultural activities can affect species composition of Mediterranean xeric grassland communities with differences visible after 30 years of abandonment, but only altered phenological patterns slightly. We suggest that climatic factors and sheep grazing acted as strong habitat filters constraining community assembly at the phenological level.

AB  - Monitoring population dynamics is of fundamental importance in conservation but assessing trends in abundance can be costly, especially in large and rough areas. Obtaining trend estimations from counts performed in only a portion of the total area (sample counts) can be a cost-effective method to improve the monitoring and conservation of species difficult to count.We tested the effectiveness of sample counts in monitoring population trends of wild animals, using as a model population the Alpine ibex Capra ibex in the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy), both with computer simulations and using historical count data collected over the last 65 years. Despite sample counts failed to correctly estimate the true population abundance, sampling half of the target area could reliably monitor the trend of the target population. In case of strong changes in abundance, an even lower proportion of the total area could be sufficient to identify the direction of the population trend. However, when there is a high yearly trend variability, the required number of samples increases and even counting in the entire area can be ineffective to detect population trends. The effect of other parameters, such as which portion of the area is sampled and detectability, was lower, but these should be tested case by case.Sample counts could therefore constitute a viable alternative to assess population trends, allowing for important, cost-effective improvements in the monitoring of wild animals of conservation interest.

AB  - The high toxicity of mercury (Hg) poses a danger to the environment and humans, but studies of the concentration of this metal in organisms of terrestrial ecosystems are few. Ecotoxicologists also pay little attention to studying the role of antioxidant vitamins in protecting cells from toxic metals. The Republic of Karelia is one of the northwestern regions of Russia, the biogeochemical features of which can contribute to an increase in the mobility and bioavailability of Hg in food chains. The purpose of the work was to determine the concentration of Hg in the liver, kidneys, muscle and hair of ungulate mammals of the Republic of Karelia (wild boar Sus scrofa L. and moose Alces alces L.) and to analyze the relationship between the level of this toxic metal and the content of low molecular-weight antioxidants-reduced glutathione, retinol and alpha-tocopherol. Species and tissue-specific of the studied parameters in wild boars and moose are noted. The observations discovered by other researchers that omnivorous species accumulate more Hg in their tissues compared to herbivores, and also that this toxic metal is predominantly accumulated in the kidneys, while muscles contain a minimal amount, have been confirmed. Hg concentrations in most samples of liver and kidney of wild boars and in all samples of the same organs of moose were within the limits recorded for domestic pigs and deer, respectively. The levels of Hg we recorded in the tissues and hair of wild boars and moose were generally comparable to or lower than the levels of this metal noted in animals from other regions of Russia and other countries of the world. In wild boars and moose of Karelia, no statistically significant relationships were found between the Hg level and the content of the studied antioxidants in the internal organs. Moose were characterized by a higher content of alpha-tocopherol in the body than wild boars, which is a feature of this type of herbivorous ungulate mammal. The results of the study indicate a relatively low level of mercury pollution in terrestrial ecosystems in Karelia.

AB  - Declines in biodiversity generated by anthropogenic stressors at both species and population levels can alter emergent processes instrumental to ecosystem function and resilience. As such, understanding the role of biodiversity in ecosystem function and its response to climate perturbation is increasingly important, especially in tropical systems where responses to changes in biodiversity are less predictable and more challenging to assess experimentally. Using large-scale transplant experiments conducted at five neotropical sites, we documented the impacts of changes in intraspecific and interspecific plant richness in the genus Piper on insect herbivory, insect richness, and ecosystem resilience to perturbations in water availability. We found that reductions of both intraspecific and interspecific Piper diversity had measurable and site-specific effects on herbivory, herbivorous insect richness, and plant mortality. The responses of these ecosystem-relevant processes to reduced intraspecific Piper richness were often similar in magnitude to the effects of reduced interspecific richness. Increased water availability reduced herbivory by 4.2% overall, and the response of herbivorous insect richness and herbivory to water availability were altered by both intra- and interspecific richness in a site-dependent manner. Our results underscore the role of intraspecific and interspecific richness as foundations of ecosystem function and the importance of community and location-specific contingencies in controlling function in complex tropical systems.

AB  - Invasive grasses cause devastating losses to biodiversity and ecosystem function directly and indirectly by altering ecosystem processes. Escape from natural enemies, plant-plant competition, and variable resource availability provide frameworks for understanding invasion. However, we lack a clear understanding of how natural stressors interact in their native range to regulate invasiveness. In this study, we reduced diverse guilds of natural enemies and plant competitors of the highly invasive buffelgrass across a precipitation gradient throughout major climatic shifts in Laikipia, Kenya. To do this, we used a long-term ungulate exclosure experiment design across a precipitation gradient with nested treatments that (1) reduced plant competition through clipping, (2) reduced insects through systemic insecticide, and (3) reduced fungal associates through fungicide application. Additionally, we measured the interaction of ungulates on two stem-boring insect species feeding on buffelgrass. Finally, we measured a multiyear smut fungus outbreak. Our findings suggest that buffelgrass exhibits invasive qualities when released from a diverse group of natural stressors in its native range. We show natural enemies interact with precipitation to alter buffelgrass productivity patterns. In addition, interspecific plant competition decreased the basal area of buffelgrass, suggesting that biotic resistance mediates buffelgrass dominance in the home range. Surprisingly, systemic insecticides and fungicides did not impact buffelgrass production or reproduction, perhaps because other guilds filled the niche space in these highly diverse systems. For example, in the absence of ungulates, we showed an increase in host-specific stem-galling insects, where these insects compensated for reduced ungulate use. Finally, we documented a smut outbreak in 2020 and 2021, corresponding to highly variable precipitation patterns caused by a shifting Indian Ocean Dipole. In conclusion, we observed how reducing natural enemies and competitors and certain interactions increased properties related to buffelgrass invasiveness.

AB  - Wildlife vehicle-collision is one of the most visible negative effects that roads exerts on animals and has increased dramatically across the world. Despite its conspicuousness, studies about roadkills in cities have been neglected lacking in road ecology. We developed new approach for estimating capybara roadkill hotspots in Campo Grande, a big city in Brazil. We also investigated potential driving factors correlated with roadkill occurrence, to build a predictive roadkill map for the entire city and propose mitigation measures. We monitored capybara roadkills for thirteen years and found hotspots using a graph-based kernel density estimation. We tested four predictors to identify which characteristics influence roadkill occurrence: distance from water bodies, distance from parks, vegetation cover, and traffic flow. We used a generalized linear mixed model to test for significant effects and to predict roadkill occurrences. Hotspots analysis showed four hotspots surrounding large green areas and water bodies, probably due to capybara habitat and physiological requirements. The predictive map shows latent hotspots, locations that have the characteristics necessary for a capybara to live but where we do not have observed deaths. To mitigate risk, we recommend using speed reduction tools around parks. A decrease in capybaras roadkills could positively impact human population welfare and material damage caused by these collisions.

AB  - Maintaining ecosystem processes within patches of remnant vegetation is critical to minimising biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes. Foundation species-habitat-forming organisms that interact with many other species-are therefore a priority for conservation and restoration in farming areas. Triodia spp. grasses are foundation species of arid and semi-arid Australia that largely depend on fire for recruitment, but fire is suppressed or excluded in many agricultural areas. We tested the effectiveness of controlled burns and competitor removal (exotic and native grasses), both in isolation and combined, on recruitment rates of Triodia scariosa in remnant vegetation using a before-after, control-impact study across 126 plots. A subset of plots were located in an herbivore exclusion area inside a reserve. There was no recruitment of T. scariosa 1 year after burning, regardless of treatment or control, and the burns killed all existing plants. However, T. scariosa germinated by 2 years post-burn, with the greatest recruitment in sites where both burning and grass removal were applied. Two years after burning, T. scariosa abundance (adults and recruits) remained low outside reserves, but returned to original levels in reserves and in areas where large herbivores were excluded. Synthesis and applications. Despite failing to increase overall abundance, we show that restoration of a foundation plant species in degraded, agricultural landscapes can be achieved through a combination of fire reintroduction and competitor suppression. Germination trials from soil samples suggest a depleted seed bank limited recruitment rates, and therefore emphasise the importance of carefully timing restoration actions to overcome recruitment bottlenecks.

AB  - Global climate change and overgrazing pressure both affects the community succession, and multifunctionality of grassland ecosystems. Alpine meadows cover 1/3 of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China's climate sensitive area and major pastures, which is the main grassland ecosystem. However, the responses of ecosystem multifunctionality during climate change and overgrazing induced divergent community succession to shrubs- and forbs-dominated community remains poorly understood in alpine meadow ecosystem. Here, we examined five ecological functions, including above- and below-ground productivity, soil water holding capacity, soil organic carbon stocks and soil erosion resistance capacity of the native Kobresia-dominated alpine meadow ecosystem during the divergent succession to shrubs- and forbs-dominated meadow located on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and identified the key factors contributing to the changes of ecosystem multifunctionality during the divergent succession. Results showed that the divergent succession to shrubs- and forbs-dominated meadow both significantly reduced community species diversity and richness, changed community structure, especially the decreasing of the Sedges and Leguminous functional groups. Meanwhile, the ecological functions including below-ground productivity, soil water holding capacity, and soil organic carbon stocks are greatly decreased along shrubs and forbs encroachment in hillside alpine meadows. Taken together, our results demonstrate that climate warming and overgrazing induced divergent successions to the shrubs-encroached and the forbsencroached communities both decreased the ecosystem multifunctionality of hillside alpine meadows. The ecosystem multifunctionality of hillside alpine meadow ecosystem might therefore be decreased continuously under ongoing and future climate warming and overgrazing by herbivores.

AB  - Plant and soil biodiversity can have significant effects on herbivore resistance mediated by plant metabolites. Here, we disentangled the independent effects of plant diversity and soil legacy on constitutive and herbivore-induced plant metabolomes of three plant species in two complementary microcosm experiments. First, we grew plants in sterile soil with three different plant diversity levels. Second, single plant species were grown on soil with different plant diversity-induced soil legacies. We infested a subset of all plants with Spodoptera exigua larvae, a generalist leaf-chewing herbivore, and assessed foliar and root metabolomes. Neither plant diversity nor soil legacy had significant effects on overall foliar, root, or herbivore-induced metabolome composition. Herbivore-induced metabolomes, however, differed from those of control plants. We detected 139 significantly regulated metabolites by comparing plants grown in monocultures with conspecifics growing in plant or soil legacy mixtures. Moreover, plant-plant and plant-soil interactions regulated 141 metabolites in herbivore-induced plants. Taken together, plant diversity and soil legacy independently alter the concentration and induction of plant metabolites, thus affecting the plant's defensive capability. This is a first step toward disentangling plant and soil biodiversity effects on herbivore resistance, thereby improving our understanding of the mechanisms that govern ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Historical and current climate impacts reshape the evolutionary trajectory and ecological dynamics of entire vegetative communities, which can drive insect species distribution. Understanding the spatial distribution of insects can enhance forest management effectiveness. The effects of historical and current climates in the spatial distribution of herbivorous tree insects in China were explored. A species distribution model simulated insect spatial distribution based on 596 species and the distribution probability and richness of these species were assessed in forest ecoregions. The explanatory power of the historical climate was stronger than that of the current climate, particularly historical annual precipitation and annual mean temperatures, for the distribution of herbivorous insects. Under both historical and current climatic conditions, herbivorous tree insects were and are mainly distributed in the North China Plain and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Plain, namely in the Huang He Plain mixed forests, Changjiang Plain evergreen forests, and Sichuan Basin evergreen broadleaf forests. The Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and northeast China are regions with large impact differences between historical and current climates. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into herbivorous insect responses to sustained climate change and may contribute to long-term biodiversity conservation activities.

AB  - Overabundant deer populations can cause severe ecological impacts. To inform management decisions and assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, land managers require a rapid and cost-effective method for collecting data on both deer density and impacts. Here, we describe a field method for rapidly and concurrently assessing indices of deer density and impacts in forested habitats, and using field data collected in 2019-2020, we demonstrate its performance. The method combines commonly used protocols for surveying deer faecal pellets, vegetation impact and floristic attributes, without relying on indicator species. The survey involves assessment of 150-m transects in forested habitats along which 30 plots are surveyed for faecal pellets of deer and sympatric herbivores (here, Swamp Wallaby, Wallabia bicolor), and impacts on woody trees and shrubs at different heights. In total, we surveyed 154 transects comprising 15,941 plant impact assessments and assessed the methods performance using basic and comparative statistics, and power analyses. Almost all plant species were similarly impacted at the local (transect) level. Indices of deer and Swamp Wallaby density explained similar amounts of variance in impacts <1 m, while the deer index explained much more of the variance in impacts >1 m. We detected differences in vegetation impact and other floristic attributes between four locations surveyed in 2020 from a modest sample size (23-24 transects). The method is simple to implement and can be applied in a wide range of forest types. In comparison to alternatives (e.g. fenced exclosures), this method presents a rapid and cost-effective means of collecting information on deer density and impacts, and detecting large differences in impact. We suggest that the proposed method enables rapid landscape-scale assessments of deer impacts suitable for evaluating management interventions.

AB  - Factors influencing grazing behavior in species-rich grasslands have been little studied. Methodologies have mostly had a primary focus on grasslands with lower floristic diversity. We test the hypothesis that grazing behavior is influenced by both animal and plant factors and investigate the relative importance of these factors, using a novel combination of video technology and vegetation classification to analyze bite and step rates. In a semi-natural, partially wooded grassland in northern Estonia, images of the vegetation being grazed and records of steps and bites were obtained from four video cameras, each mounted on the sternum of a sheep, during 41 animal-hours of observation over five days. Plant species lists for the immediate field of view were compiled. Images were partnered by direct observation of the nearest-neighbor relationships of the sheep. TWINSPAN, a standard vegetation classification technique allocating species lists to objectively defined classes by a principal components procedure, was applied to the species lists and 25 vegetation classes (15 open pasture and 10 woodland) were identified from the images. Taking bite and step rates as dependent variables, relative importance of animal factors (sheep identity), relative importance of day, and relative importance of plant factors (vegetation class) were investigated. The strongest effect on bite rates was of vegetation class. Sheep identity was less influential. When the data from woodland were excluded, sheep identity was more important than vegetation class as a source of variability in bite rate on open pasture. The original hypothesis is therefore supported, and we further propose that, at least with sheep in species-rich open pastures, animal factors will be more important in determining grazing behavior than plant factors. We predict quantifiable within-breed and between-breed differences, which could be exploited to optimize conservation grazing practices and contribute to the sustainability of extensive grazing systems.

AB  - Carcass decomposition largely depends on vertebrate scavengers. However, how behavioral differences between vertebrate scavenger species, the dominance of certain species, and the diversity of the vertebrate scavenger community affect the speed of carcass decomposition is poorly understood. As scavenging is an overlooked trophic interaction, studying the different functional roles of vertebrate species in the scavenging process increases our understanding about the effect of the vertebrate scavenger community on carcass decomposition. We used motion-triggered infrared camera trap footages to profile the behavior and activity of vertebrate scavengers visiting carcasses in Dutch nature areas. We grouped vertebrate scavengers with similar functional roles. We found a clear distinction between occasional scavengers and more specialized scavengers, and we found wild boar (Sus scrofa) to be the dominant scavenger species in our study system. We showed that these groups are functionally different within the scavenger community. We found that overall vertebrate scavenger diversity was positively correlated with carcass decomposition speed. With these findings, our study contributes to the understanding about the different functional roles scavengers can have in ecological communities.

AB  - ContextRestricted to the densely populated regions of Eastern China, musk deer populations have dramatically declined over the past several centuries, primarily due to extensive poaching and significant habitat loss. In recent years, the Anhui musk deer has further faced an extremely high risk of extinction as a result of climate change and escalating human disturbances. However, research on the Anhui musk deer based on extensive field survey data remains limited, thereby constraining the development of effective conservation strategies.ObjectivesThis study aims to evaluate the current and future habitat suitability of the Anhui musk deer, assess the vulnerability of these habitats to climate change, and delineate potential refuges that could support the population amidst climatic shifts. Additionally, we seek to identify ecological corridors that would facilitate dispersal among habitat patches under changing climate conditions.MethodsOccurrence locations (N = 101) of the Anhui musk deer were collected using large-scale infrared camera monitoring data from 2013 to 2023. The MaxEnt model was employed to predict suitable habitat and assess the potential impacts of climate change. A gap analysis was then conducted to identify deficiencies in current nature reserves, and potential climate refuges were determined based on areas of stable habitat. Subsequently, connectivity analysis was performed to identify potential ecological corridors between habitat patches.ResultsThe Anhui musk deer is highly sensitive to temperature and human disturbance. The total area of suitable habitat for Anhui musk deer is 1188.90 km2 currently, with only 11 habitat patches larger than 5 km2 (median patch size = 79.05 km2; and mean = 19.84 km2). Future projections suggest a continuous decline in suitable habitat, with areas decreasing to 1,052.45 km2 by 2050, 841.82 km2 by 2070, and 798.35 km2 by 2090. Currently, nature reserves encompass only 38.52% of the suitable habitat. Climate refuges for the Anhui musk deer cover 586.24 km2, but 44.38% of these areas remain unprotected. The construction of 14 potential ecological corridors connecting isolated populations to core populations could mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and protect the Anhui musk deer population.ConclusionsOur findings indicated that the habitat area of Anhui musk deer will continue to decline under future climate conditions, and current conservation efforts are insufficient. The remaining Anhui musk deer populations in the Dabie Mountains should be considered as regional populations and managed meticulously to ensure their long-term survival under human disturbances and climate warming.

AB  - Ozegahara Mire is the largest alpine mire in Japan, and it has been preserved as the precious peatland ecosystem under oligotrophic condition. However, after the late 20 century, the mire has been exposed to ecosystem disturbance by invaded Sika deer. Browsing and digging of the mire vegetation by Sika deer have given considerable impacts on not only vegetation but also biochemical property of the peat soil, resulting in the changes in microbiological activities and nutrient dynamics. However, little information has been provided about the effect of deer disturbance on nitrogen (N) dynamics in the mire. This study aims to provide information about the effects of deer disturbance on nitrogen dynamic including N-2 fixation and denitrification in Ozegahara Mire. Soil samples were collected at 6 plots on 2 sites with and without mire disturbance by Sika deer at eastern Naka-Tashiro of Ozegahara mire in July 2018. Mineral N contents and other physicochemical properties of the soil samples were measured. N-2 fixation and denitrification activities of the soil samples were also measured at different incubation temperatures (15, 20 or 25 degrees C) under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions by acetylene reduction activity (ARA) and inhibition methods, respectively. As results, the ARA in the disturbed sites were lower than those in the undisturbed sites and also lower under aerobic condition than anaerobic condition. Negative correlation was found between ARA and ammonium N in the soil (R-2 = 0.353, p< 0.05), suggesting that mechanical disturbance of the peat soils by deer enhanced mineralization of organic N to suppress N-2 fixation. ARA was increased by elevated incubation temperature in the undisturbed sites, while no change in the disturbed sites. Denitrification activities was not affected by the disturbance by Sika deer, while higher under aerobic condition than in anaerobic condition, and in higher temperature than lower temperature. Multi-regression analysis of ARA affecting factors revealed that ARA was significantly influenced by temperature, ammonium N and disturbance. These results indicate the marked influences of the mire disturbance by Sika deer on N-2 fixation and denitrification activities of the peat soils and N dynamics in Ozegahara Mire.

AB  - Increased demands for water affect its quality availability and threaten biodiversity. In freshwaters, the Chironomidae (Diptera) represents * 50% of macroinvertebrate individuals and have great potential to improve ecological assessment tools. Incorporating trait-based approaches in those tools can further improve how we assess the effects of human disturbances on aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Given that chironomid genera have different degrees of sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbances, we expected that composition, structure and functional characteristics of chironomid genera would be negatively affected by anthropogenic disturbances in a neotropical savanna river basin. We used nine traits in 32 categories related to Chironomidae functional roles. Out of 6147 individuals distributed in three subfamilies, we identified 52 chironomid genera collected from 30 randomly selected stream sites. The index of functional divergence was lower in places with greater anthropogenic disturbance of riparian vegetation. A RLQ matrix analysis revealed a significant relationship between genera abundance and environmental variables as well as with biological traits. We observed a positive relationship between Tanypodinae, which are mainly engulfer predators, with average embeddedness, % sand and catchment pasture. Three Chironomidae genera (Stenochironomus, Endotribelos and Beardius) were positively related to miner habit, herbivore feeding strategy and larger body size. We found that physical habitat structure and food resources were the most important factors structuring Chironomidae assemblages in the study sites and that chironomid genera were effective for assessing basin ecological status.

AB  - Question: Natural reforestation is an important component of climate mitigation and adaptation, but the ecological processes promoting or constraining it are poorly understood. In this study we employ a stand reconstruction approach (which uses ages of extant trees to estimate year of establishment for each individual tree) to test for general trait-based effects on tree species arrival order in post-agricultural forest successions.Location: Naturally reforesting post-agricultural landscapes throughout New Zealand.Methods: Ages were obtained for 2434 individuals spanning 30 tree species across a nationwide network of 128 plots in 14 naturally reforesting post-agricultural sites. These ages were used to calculate individual-level arrival times (relative to the oldest individual in each plot). We estimated species-level arrival times by fitting linear mixed-effects (LME) regressions (with species identity as the fixed effect, and plots nested within sites as the random effects) to individual arrival time data. We used back-casting (where arrival time data are used to document individual-level presence in plots through time) to track annual changes in species abundance and community weighted mean (CWM) trait values.We used standardised major axis (SMA) regressions to examine the effect of traits related to resource use strategy, herbivory avoidance, seed dispersal and disturbance response on species-level arrival times. We used LME regressions to test for changes in CWM trait values with stand age.Results: The earliest-arriving species had traits associated with herbivory avoidance, were abiotically dispersed and had short predicted dispersal distances. There was no evidence that traits linked to resource use strategy or disturbance response affected species arrival times. Every significant species-level relationship was recovered in community-level LME analyses.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that mammalian herbivore control and enhancement of biotic (bird) seed dispersal may be key management interventions in realising the full climate mitigation and adaptation potential of natural reforestation in post agricultural landscapes.

AB  - The timing and cause of megafaunal extinctions are an enduring focus of research interest and debate. Despite the developments in the analysis of coprophilous fungal spores (CFS), the proxy for reconstructing past megaherbivore changes, the environmental consequences of this fauna loss remain understudied. This is partly due to the general obscurity of such a signal in pollen records, as well as limitations in disentangling human and extinction ecological impact, and the lack of spatial information of megafauna changes in site-level sedimentary records. In Australia, the debate centres on the possibility that habitat loss through climate change, vegetation-fire change, human intervention, or a combination of these factors led to the extinction of some large animals during the Late Pleistocene. Pollen and plant isotope studies have also demonstrated that vegetation-fire responses following the Late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions were characterized by increased vegetation density and fire activity due to reduced grazing/browsing pressure. Here, we use a well-dated marine sedimentary core record from the Murray Darling Basin in southern Australia and apply palynological and functional palaeoecological approaches to reconstruct the Late Pleistocene megafaunal abundance changes, the timing and potential cause of extinction across the basin and investigate if extinction was associated with any signal of traitbased vegetation changes. We infer megafaunal abundance changes from the abundance of CFS and compare this with climatic proxies from the same core. We then link modern observations of fruit, seed and fire response traits of plant genera within the basin to the fossil pollen record to reconstruct palaeo vegetation community traits and determine if extinction was associated with any changes in plant community trait composition. Closely-spaced C-14 dates obtained from planktonic foraminifera and delta O-18 tie points place a major decline in CFS, and thus the timing of extinction, within the basin at similar to 43.3 ka. While climate-driven environmental changes largely controlled megafaunal presence, human arrival and frequent landscape burning are considered the most likely primary cause of extinction or, at the very least, megafauna decline in the Murray Darling Basin. We also found that the proposed period of megafaunal decline was also accompanied and followed by a decline in the prevalence of plants with larger seeds and fruits that were likely to have been once dispersed by megaherbivores. Our study supports the idea of a human-driven megafaunal extinction in mainland Australia and that the extinction caused changes in vegetation due to reduced plant dispersal and herbivory. However, high fire activity primarily linked to these vegetation changes was not observed, as humans were already practicing landscape burning before the period of megafaunal extinction and likely continued to do so afterward.

AB  - This study was conducted on the association of terrestrial insect herbivore communities with flora and plant communities in the riparian zone of an urban river in Daejeon, Korea. The survey was conducted in May, August, and October on three sites that are composed typical habitat diversity in the river. As a result of the analysis, the highest matching rate of insect herbivore host plant and flora of the site was site 1 with 93%. In addition, the dominant and subdominant species of the terrestrial insect herbivores showed a very close association with the dominant plant species that make up the plant community. As a result of analysis of similarity among the sites, the most heterogeneous group of terrestrial insect herbivore communities were in May, which presumed to be affected by changes in biomass of host plants before and after the rainy season. The results of this study can be used as data necessary for the conservation of biodiversity in riparian zone in the future.

AB  - Ecological carrying capacity (ECC), as an efficient approach in sustainable management, also was used to indicate ecosystem stability in vulnerable ecoregions. In this study, we proposed a new framework of ECC quantification focusing on vulnerable ecoregions and analyzed ECC on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) based on the ecogeographical regionalization. Some indicators were introduced in ECC assessing, such as effective vegetation cover required to make soil water erosion lower than the threshold of soil loss (EVCwater), effective vegetation cover required to make soil wind erosion lower than the threshold of soil loss (EVCwind), and aboveground net primary production that can be used for human activities (UANPP). The results showed that: (1) EVCwater increased from northwest to southeast on the QTP, and exceeded 70% in the southeastern QTP; (2) EVCwind for the entire Qinghai-Tibet Plateau increased from southeast to northwest, and was < 30% in most areas of the eastern QTP; (3) the UANPP in most study areas ranged from 0 to 408.69 g m- 2 yr-1, with a regional average of 95.06 g m- 2 yr-1, and areas with a UANPP < 0 g m- 2 yr-1 were mainly distributed in the HID1 ecoregion; and (4) the average ECC for alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is 1.47 sheep unit hm-2, although values increased gradually from northwest to southeast.

AB  - Landscape-scale forest loss threats biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but its effect on insect herbivory and pathogen infection on trees is not well understood. Little is known about how forest loss alters the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on foliar damages. Here, we assessed the relative importance of forest loss, microclimates, tree community attributes, leaf traits (e.g., specific leaf area, SLA), and arthropod abundance on insect and pathogen damage on laurel poplars in natural riparian forests in Xinjiang, China. We found that forest loss increased foliar insect herbivory directly through reduction of food availability and indirectly through reduction in tree diversity and host resistance (greater SLA). In comparison, forest loss only indirectly increased pathogen infection through lower tree diversity and associated higher SLA. Early season insect herbivory promoted later season pathogen infection. Microclimates were not associated with insect and pathogen damage, nor was arthropod abundance with insect herbivory. Our results suggest that forest loss reduced tree diversity which, in turn, changed host leaf traits and associational resistance and undermined bottom-up controls on insect herbivory and pathogen infection. Comparatively, top-down control of herbivory through predation was not significant. The positive relationship between tree diversity and host resistance (leaf traits, e.g., SLA) may be critical for maintaining forest health and ecosystem functioning in plantations and fragmented natural forests when insect pathogen damage at normal, non-outbreak conditions.

AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a critical tool for studying Arctic vegetation patterns and changes, but more knowledge is needed about its links with plant biomass and disturbances, especially in sparsely vegetated habitats in the High Arctic. Here, we investigate the relationship between NDVI and vascular plant biomass, summer temperature, goose disturbance, and winter damage in Dryas ridge and moss tundra habitats on Svalbard, all recorded in the corresponding year across a 5-year time series. We test these relationships using mixed-effect models at two spatial resolutions (10 cm and 10 m) and two extents with data from drone and Sentinel-2 imagery. We found that in our plots, an increase in biomass of 100 g m-2 increased NDVI from drone imagery by 0.08 +/- 0.03 (95% CI) for Dryas ridge and by 0.04 +/- 0.03 for moss tundra. Despite record-warm summers, temperature of the same summer was not associated with NDVI in our time-series. In moss tundra, severe goose disturbance had a negative relationship with drone NDVI in plots, while in Dryas ridge habitat, winter damage had no clear correspondence with NDVI. Our study provides an example of context dependencies highlighted in remote-sensing literature in the Arctic, encouraging future studies to include effects of disturbance on NDVI and to establish habitat-specific relationships with NDVI.

AB  - Context. The decline of birds in farmland is of global concern. Aims. The aim of this paper was to provide a local-scale case study of the bird fauna of temperate inland eastern Australia's sheep-wheat belt. Methods. Relationships between species occurrence and various habitat elements in the landscape were examined in a 342 km2 area of agricultural countryside near Wagga Wagga in southern inland New South Wales, Australia. The pre-agricultural bird fauna of this area was also investigated by collating records from previous studies of nearby larger woodland remnants. Key results. The study identified a bird fauna of 115 species compared to 160 species known from nearby woodland remnants. Significant relationships were found with the presence of farm dams, extent of local woodland cover and roadside woodland at the levels of individual species, guilds and total fauna. A small ephemeral wetland also contributed substantially to waterbird diversity. Conclusion. Twenty commonly recorded species typical of the farmland matrix and 15 species considered at particular risk of local extinction were identified. At the guild level, frugivore/granivores, small insectivores and hollow-users were found to be associated with remaining woodland elements in the agricultural landscape. Implications. Ecologically sustainable management of agricultural areas is essential to avoid further local extinctions. Hollow-using species are expected to be particularly affected by the anticipated widespread loss of trees in the landscape over the next century.

AB  - Climate change and land-use intensification are threatening soil communities and ecosystem functions. Understanding the combined effects of climate change and land use is crucial for predicting future impacts on soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in agroecosystems. Here, we used a field experiment to quantify the combined effects of climate change (warming and altered precipitation patterns) and land use (agricultural type and management intensity) on soil food webs across nematodes, micro-, and macroarthropods. Specifically, we investigated two types of agricultural systems-croplands and grasslands-under both high- and low-intensity management. We focused on assessing the functioning of soil food webs by investigating changes in energy flux to consumers in the main trophic groups: decomposers, microbivores, herbivores, and predators. While the total energy flux and detritivory, herbivory and predation in the soil food web remained unchanged across treatments, low-intensity land use-compared to high intensity-led to higher microbivory and microbial control under future climate conditions (i.e., warming and summer drought) in croplands and grasslands. At the same time, microbial and herbivore control were higher under low-intensity land use in croplands and grasslands. Overall, our results underscore the potential benefits of less intensive, more sustainable management practices for soil food-web functioning under current and future climate scenarios.

AB  - Managing agricultural environments in a way that maximises the provision of multiple ecosystem services is a significant challenge in the development of sustainable and secure food systems. Advances in network ecology provide a way forward, particularly in arable landscapes, as they incorporate mutualistic and antagonistic interactions associated with crop production. Here, we present an approach to identify mixes of non-crop plant species that provide multiple ecosystem services while minimising disservices. Genetic algorithms were applied to the Norwood Farm ecological network-a comprehensive dataset of antagonistic and mutualistic species interactions on an organic farm in the United Kingdom. We aimed to show how network analyses can be used to select plants supporting a high diversity of insect pollinators and parasitoids of insect pests, but low diversity of herbivores. Further to this, we wanted to understand the trade-offs in ecosystem service provision associated with conventional management practices that focus on individual ecosystem services. We show that multilayer network analyses can be used to identify mixes of plant species that maximise the species richness of pollinators and parasitoids (natural enemies of insect pests), while minimising the species richness of herbivores. Trade-offs between ecosystem processes were apparent with several plant species associated with a high species richness of both positive (pollinators and parasitoids) and negative (herbivores) functional taxonomic groups. As a result, optimal plant species mixes for individual ecosystem services were different from the mix simultaneously maximising pollination and parasitism of pest insects, while minimising herbivory. Synthesis and applications. Plant mixes designed solely for maximising pollinator species richness are not optimal for the provision of other ecosystem services and disservices (e.g. parasitism of insect pests and herbivory). The method presented here will allow for the design of management strategies that facilitate the provision of multiple ecosystem services. To this end, we provide a protocol for practitioners to develop their own plant mixes suitable for farm-scale management. This avenue of predictive network ecology has the potential to enhance agricultural management, supporting high levels of biodiversity and food production by manipulating ecological networks in specific ways.

AB  - Small burrowing herbivores play a crucial role in maintaining structure and function of grassland ecosystems. To date, our understanding of whether practicing ecological uniqueness can enhance plant diversity conservation under small herbivore disturbances remains limited. Here, we investigate the ecological uniqueness of plant communities, which include habitats disturbed and undisturbed by plateau pikas. In 30 geographic regions of alpine grasslands, plateau pikas lead to plant assemblages that differ from those in undisturbed habitats and reduce the ecological uniqueness. During this process, plant turnover dominate the changes in ecological uniqueness. In the presence of plateau pika, the influence of altitude is diminished, with plant relative abundance, species richness, and functional richness measurements emerging as core predictors of ecological uniqueness. Notably, the negative effect of relative abundance on ecological uniqueness shifts to a positive effect, supporting the status of the plateau pika as ecosystem engineers at larger spatial scales. A combined beta regression model incorporating bare patch areas and active burrow entrances explains 46% of the variation in the ecological uniqueness. Given the limited resources available for conservation, we propose prioritizing the protection of undisturbed and low-intensity plateau pika habitats, rather than pursuing eradication. Additionally, near-natural restoration (e.g., controlling pika populations, sustainable grazing) in highly disturbed habitats is crucial for maintaining ecological uniqueness. This study provides new insights into the roles of small burrowing herbivores at the regional scale, which can guide grassland conservation efforts.

AB  - Invasive omnivores may have profound impacts on ecological communities through diet selection, particularly when their functional roles differ from those in their native range. While the threat of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) to native plant communities in Hawai'i is well known, their trophic dynamics and the drivers of variation in their diet remain understudied. We investigated the feral pig trophic niche on Hawai'i Island using stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15) and Bayesian mixing models to identify drivers of variation in resource use. We also reconstructed intra-individual variability for six subsampled individuals to understand temporal variation in resource use and individual diet specialization. Our results revealed that feral pigs on Hawai'i Island exhibit a broad trophic niche characterized by diverse diets, with substantial overlap in resource use across districts and habitats. Differences in dietary composition in the transition from forest to open habitat were driven primarily by a decline in invertebrates and an increasing reliance on resources enriched in N-15, which may reflect a shift in protein sources with habitat. Pigs in forested areas exhibited a smaller trophic niche than those in open habitats, largely driven by differences in feeding strategies and resource availability. Diets for subsampled individuals varied little, suggesting feral pig resource-use strategies in Hawai'i tend to be relatively stable through time. Individual niche width was relatively narrow compared to that of feral pigs in Hawai'i at large, indicating the relatively wide feral pig dietary niche is characterized by substantial intraspecific diet specialization, likely as a result of strong intraspecific competition. Understanding the drivers of feral pig resource use offers key information for management strategies aimed at mitigating their ecological impacts in imperiled systems like Hawai'i.

AB  - Humans have reshaped the distribution of biodiversity across the globe, extirpating species from regions otherwise suitable and restricting populations to a subset of their original ranges. Here, we ask if anthropogenic range contractions since the Late Pleistocene led to an under-representation of the realized niches for megafauna, an emblematic group of taxa often targeted for restoration actions. Using reconstructions of past geographic distributions (i.e., natural ranges) for 146 extant terrestrial large-bodied (>44 kg) mammals, we estimate their climatic niches as if they had retained their original distributions and evaluate their observed niche dynamics. We found that range contractions led to a sizeable under-representation of the realized niches of several species (i.e., niche unfilling). For 29 species, more than 10% of the environmental space once seen in their natural ranges has been lost due to anthropogenic activity, with at least 12 species undergoing reductions of more than 50% of their realized niches. Eighteen species may now be confined to low-suitability locations, where fitness and abundance are likely diminished; we consider these taxa 'climatic refugees'. For those species, conservation strategies supported by current ranges risk being misguided if current, suboptimal habitats are considered baseline for future restoration actions. Because most climate-based biodiversity forecasts rely exclusively on current occurrence records, we went on to test the effect of neglecting historical information on estimates of species' potential distribution - as a proxy of sensitivity to climate change. We found that niche unfilling driven by past range contraction leads to an overestimation of sensitivity to future climatic change, resulting in 50% higher rates of global extinction, and underestimating the potential for megafauna conservation and restoration under future climate change. In conclusion, range contractions since the Late Pleistocene have also left imprints on megafauna realized climatic niches. Therefore, niche truncation driven by defaunation can directly affect climate and habitat-based conservation strategies.

AB  - Most parasites and parasitoids are adapted to overcome defense mechanisms of their specific hosts and hence colonize a narrow range of host species. Accordingly, an increase in host functional or phylogenetic dissimilarity is expected to increase the species diversity of parasitoids. However, the local diversity of parasitoids may be driven by the accessibility and detectability of hosts, both increasing with increasing host abundance. Yet, the relative importance of these two mechanisms remains unclear. We parallelly reared communities of saproxylic beetle as potential hosts and associated parasitoid Hymenoptera from experimentally felled trees. The dissimilarity of beetle communities was inferred from distances in seven functional traits and from their evolutionary ancestry. We tested the effect of host abundance, species richness, functional, and phylogenetic dissimilarities on the abundance, species richness, and Shannon diversity of parasitoids. Our results showed an increase of abundance, species richness, and Shannon diversity of parasitoids with increasing beetle abundance. Additionally, abundance of parasitoids increased with increasing species richness of beetles. However, functional and phylogenetic dissimilarity showed no effect on the diversity of parasitoids. Our results suggest that the local diversity of parasitoids, of ephemeral and hidden resources like saproxylic beetles, is highest when resources are abundant and thereby detectable and accessible. Hence, in some cases, resources do not need to be diverse to promote parasitoid diversity.

AB  - Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) may vary by tree mycorrhizal type. However, whether arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)-associated tree species suffer from stronger CNDD than ectomycorrhizal (EcM) and ericoid mycorrhizal (ErM)-associated tree species at different tree life stages, and whether EcM tree species can promote AM and ErM saplings and adults growth, remain to be studied. Based on the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest data in eastern China, the generalized linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze the effects of the conspecific density and heterospecific density grouped by symbiont mycorrhizal type on different tree life stages of different tree mycorrhizal types. The results showed that compared to other tree mycorrhizal types at the same growth stage, EcM saplings and AM adults experienced stronger CNDD. Heterospecific EcM density had a stronger positive effect on AM and ErM individuals. Species diversity and average relative growth rate (RGR) first increased and then decreased with increasing basal area (BA) ratios of EcM to AM tree species. These results suggested that the stronger CNDD of EcM saplings and AM adults favored local species diversity over other tree mycorrhizal types. The EcM tree species better facilitated the growth of AM and ErM tree species in the neighborhood, increasing the forest carbon sink rate. Interestingly, species diversity and average RGR decreased when EcM or AM tree species predominated. Therefore, our study highlights that manipulating the BA ratio of EcM to AM tree species will play a nonnegligible role in maintaining biodiversity and increasing forest carbon sink rates.

AB  - Baseline biodiversity surveys are necessary to assess organismal diversity across spatial and temporal scales. These surveys can be particularly useful for monitoring changes in organismal diversity and pathogen spread in response to climate change. Arthropod vectors such as ticks are susceptible to geographic range shifts with a warming climate, potentially resulting in the expansion of risk areas for vector-borne disease. Biodiversity data are deficient from South Texas, which is particularly concerning given the abundance of wildlife and livestock that may be important in perpetuating tick and pathogen populations. We performed a baseline biodiversity assessment of small mammals, ticks, and tick-borne pathogens in South Texas using a combination of fieldwork, collections-based research, and molecular approaches. We recorded 19 species of small mammals and 3 species of ticks, and we detected no tick-borne pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia or Rickettsia in the ticks or mammals. Given the continued emergence of tick-borne disease, we recommend collaborations with natural history collections and private landowners interested in land stewardship so researchers can develop a better understanding of changing small mammal, tick, and pathogen diversity with implications for human and veterinary health in this region of Texas.

AB  - Perceived predation risk varies in space and time. Foraging in this landscape of fear alters forager-resource interactions via cascading nonconsumptive effects. Estimating these indirect effects is difficult in natural systems. Here, we applied a novel measure to quantify the diversity at giving-up density that allows to test how spatial variation in perceived predation risk modifies the diversity of multispecies resources at local and regional spatial levels. Furthermore, we evaluated whether the nonconsumptive effects on resource species diversity can be explained by the preferences of foragers for specific functional traits and by the forager species richness. We exposed rodents of a natural community to artificial food patches, each containing an initial multispecies resource community of eight species (10 items each) mixed in sand. We sampled 35 landscapes, each containing seven patches in a spatial array, to disentangle effects at local (patch) and landscape levels. We used vegetation height as a proxy for perceived predation risk. After a period of three nights, we counted how many and which resource species were left in each patch to measure giving-up density and resource diversity at the local level (alpha diversity) and the regional level (gamma diversity and beta diversity). Furthermore, we used wildlife cameras to identify foragers and assess their species richness. With increasing vegetation height, i.e., decreasing perceived predation risk, giving-up density, and local alpha and regional gamma diversity decreased, and patches became less similar within a landscape (beta diversity increased). Foragers consumed more of the bigger and most caloric resources. The higher the forager species richness, the lower the giving-up density, and alpha and gamma diversity. Overall, spatial variation of perceived predation risk of foragers had measurable cascading effects on local and regional resource species biodiversity, independent of the forager species. Thus, nonconsumptive predation effects modify forager-resource interactions and might act as an equalizing mechanism for species coexistence.

AB  - This study investigates the ecosystem services (ES) associated with extensive sheep and goat farming in mountainous regions using advanced text mining (TM) and topic analysis (TA) methodologies. Mountain ecosystems are ecologically and socio-economically significant yet face challenges such as rural abandonment and climate change. The analysis of 135 scientific publications from 2009 to 2024 highlights the vital role of small ruminant farming in preserving biodiversity, maintaining cultural heritage, and providing sustainable livelihoods. Results identify eight key themes: ecosystem conservation; grazing effects on biodiversity; dimensions of sustainability; climate; people engagement; grazing and soil; transhumance; policies; and strategies. Findings underscore that small ruminant farming not only supports provisioning, regulating, and cultural services but also reveals ecosystem disservices (EDS) like soil erosion and biodiversity loss under poor management. Effective governance and adaptive management are crucial in integrating tools such as payment for ecosystem services (PES), certification systems, and advanced technologies. This study highlights knowledge gaps, including limited research on EDS and the need for standardised frameworks to assess ES. Future research should prioritise innovative technologies, region-specific grazing practices, and participatory governance to enhance the sustainability of these systems.

AB  - Context Assessing the distribution and abundance of marine fauna and the ecological status of coastal and pelagic ecosystems is key to biodiversity conservation, but the monitoring of mobile marine species raises multiple logistical and financial challenges.Aims The project describes the distribution, abundance and taxonomic assemblage of several marine megafauna taxa in three subregions of the western and central South Pacific Ocean (New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna, and French Polynesia).Methods Large-scale aerial surveys were conducted using a standardised multi-taxon protocol, to characterise the occurrence and abundance of marine megafauna over 2.5 million km2. Analysing more than 122 000 km of transects, the densities of 22 different taxa were estimated: seven taxonomic groups of marine mammals (Physeteridae, Kogiidae, Ziphiidae, Globicephalinae, Small Delphininae, Large Delphininae, and Dugongidae), a single group for hard-shelled sea turtles, three groups of elasmobranchs (including whale sharks), and 11 groups of seabirds (including Phaethontidae, Hydrobatidae, Fregatidae and Sulidae).Key results Contrasting patterns of species distribution were found. Marine mammal diversity increases north and west, with a distinct species assemblage in New Caledonia, compared to other subregions. A strong latitudinal gradient was observed across French Polynesia, independent of taxa.Conclusions This study provides the first comparison of marine species assemblages across the three oceanic subregions and sets a regional baseline for the biogeography of marine megafauna in the region.Implications The taxonomic and spatial extension of the results opens up new perspectives for the development of local conservation measures, especially for taxa with already documented population declines.
   This study simultaneously describes the spatial distribution and densities of 22 distinct taxonomic groups of marine mammals, sea turtles, elasmobranchs and seabirds over three large oceanic subregions of the western and central South Pacific Ocean. It demonstrates the value of multi-taxa monitoring applied to aerial surveys of offshore marine megafauna, and provides a baseline for future conservation measures.This article belongs to the Collection Marine Mammals in the Pacific.

AB  - For ungulates, it is not well understood how the interaction between habitat and reproduction affects movement behavior, space use, and habitat selection. We used known parturition (farrowing) data to validate First Passage Time (FPT) movement analysis to identify wild pig (Sus scrofa) parturition events from data collected with GPS collars. We examined home range and habitat selection during three physiologically distinct time periods in the reproductive cycle: late-gestation; farrowing; and neonate-care period. Sows exhibited a behavioral change 1-2 days prior to farrowing, suggesting FPT analysis can reliably identify parturition events for wide-ranging species that have a focused birthing area. Home range was smallest during the farrowing period, likely reflective of nest building, parturition, and protection of neonates. Home range size during the neonate-care period was intermediate between the late-gestation and farrowing periods, indicative of offspring care that may restrict maternal movement. Across all periods, sows avoided developed areas that have sparse canopy and ground cover and are associated with human activities. During late-gestation, sows avoided pine forests that have an open understory and less vegetative cover. During late-gestation and neonate-care, sows selected bottomland hardwood forests, habitat associated with ample food, cover, and water. During farrowing and neonate-care periods, sows selected upland hardwood forests, habitat with high quality food and cover for neonates. The physiological requirements of reproduction drive female habitat selection and spatial scale of movement patterns associated with parturition. Our study contributes to delineation of the appropriate scale at which to analyze movement data to provide insight about where individuals chose to place their home range, how much space to use, and how they use resources on the landscape to maximize reproductive success and fitness.

AB  - Climate change can have important effects on plant performance by altering the relationship between spring temperature and other abiotic factors, such as light availability. Higher temperatures can advance plant phenology so that seedling germination takes place when days are shorter, and affect light availability for understory plants by altering the relative timing of seedling germination and canopy closure. To predict the effects of climate-induced changes in phenology and light availability on plant performance and species interactions during the growing season, we need to determine i) how effects of plant phenology on plant performance and the plant-associated community depend on light availability, and ii) to what extent effects of phenology and light availability on plant performance are direct vs. mediated by changes in the plant-associated community. We conducted a multifactorial field experiment to test for the effect of germination timing and light availability on Quercus robur seedling traits and performance, as well as attack by specialist plant pathogens, insects, and small mammals. Germination timing strongly affected seedling performance whereas light availability's effects were limited. Likewise, germination timing strongly affected herbivore and pathogen attack, whereas light availability and its interaction with germination timing explained a minor part of the variation. Small mammals preferentially attacked later germinating seedlings, which strongly affected plant survival, while insect herbivores and pathogens did not mediate the effect of germination timing and light availability on plant performance. The results showed that the effect of germination timing can have greater influence than light availability on plant performance and plant attack, and that small mammal herbivores can play a larger role than diseases and insect herbivores in mediating the effect of spring phenology on plant performance. Together, these findings advance our understanding of the consequences of climate-induced changes in spring phenology and the abiotic environment on plant performance within a community context.

AB  - The loss of species from ecosystems can have cascading impacts on species interactions and ecosystem function. Australia has experienced the greatest loss of mammals globally in the past 200 years, but we know little of how the loss of this suite of ecosystem engineers and herbivores has affected vegetation. We used a threatened mammal reintroduction sanctuary to investigate effects of ecologically extinct mammals on plant assemblages. First, we tested the net effects of mammals using a long-term exclusion experiment within the sanctuary. Second, we used a three-year disturbance experiment to determine the relative roles of herbivory and physical disturbance in driving changes in plant assemblages. Third, we compared outcomes inside and outside the sanctuary to determine how effects of reintroduced mammals differed from contemporary mammal assemblages. Plant species richness was greatest in mammal exclusion plots and declined across all treatments from 2011 to 2018, probably due to drought. Plant composition changed in response to mammal exclusion, with six species increasing significantly, shrubs and myrmecochorous plants becoming more common and large-seeded species less common. Responses to experimental disturbance were less clear. Grass and resprouters were more common, and palatable and large-seeded plants were less common outside the sanctuary (exposed to contemporary mammal assemblage). Our study shows that reintroductions of ecologically extinct mammals have substantial impacts on plant assemblages, both through ecosystem engineering and herbivory, and these impacts differ from those of contemporary mammal faunas, suggesting that pre-European Australian ecosystems were markedly different from contemporary ecosystems.

AB  - Long-distance movements are hypothesized to positively influence population size and stability of mobile species. We tested this hypothesis with a novel modeling approach in which moving herbivores interact with the environment created by a dynamic global vegetation model using highly mobile Mongolian gazelles in the eastern Mongolian grasslands as a case study. Gazelle population dynamics were modeled from 1901 to 2018 under two scenarios, one allowing free movement and one restricting movement. Gazelles were 2.2 times more abundant when they could move freely and were extirpated in 71% of the study area when mobility was restricted. Mobility resulted in greater population increases during times of abundant forage and smaller population decreases during drought. Reduced thermoregulatory costs associated with climate change, combined with an increase in vegetation biomass, increased gazelle abundance. Since high abundances often resulted in overgrazing and, thus, extirpation when movement was restricted, mobility had an important role in maintaining higher densities. The novel modeling approach shows how accounting for not just herbivore but also plant ecophysiology can improve our understanding of the population dynamics of highly mobile herbivores, in particular when examining the effects of habitat and climate change. Since the model simulates herbivores based on general physiological mechanisms that apply across large herbivores and the vegetation model can be applied globally, it is possible to adapt the model to other large-herbivore systems.

AB  - Human activities have triggered profound changes in natural landscapes, resulting in species loss and disruption of pivotal ecological interactions such as insect herbivory. This antagonistic interaction is affected by complex pathways (e.g., abundance of herbivores and predators, plant chemical defenses, and resource availability), but the knowledge regarding how forest loss and fragmentation affect insect herbivory in human-modified tropical landscapes still remains poorly understood. In this context, we assessed multi-pathways by which changes in landscape structure likely influence insect herbivory in 20 Atlantic forest fragments in Brazil. Using path analysis, we estimated the direct effects of forest cover and forest edge density, and the indirect effect via canopy openness, number of understory plants and phenolic compounds, on leaf damage in understory plants located in the edge and interior of forest fragments. In particular, plants located in forest edges experienced greater leaf damage than interior ones. We observed that landscape edge density exerted a positive and direct effect on leaf damage in plants sampled at the edge of forest fragments. Our findings also indicated that forest loss and increase of edge density led to an increase in the canopy opening in the forest interior, which causes a reduction in the number of understory plants and, consequently, an increase in leaf damage. In addition, we detected that phenolic compounds negatively influence leaf damage in forest interior plants. Given the increasing forest loss in tropical regions, in which forest fragments become stranded in highly deforested, edge-dominated and degraded landscapes, our study highlights the pervasive enhancement in insect herbivory in remaining forest fragments-especially along forest edges and canopy gaps in the forest interior. As a result, increased herbivory is likely to affect forest regeneration and accelerate the ecological meltdown processes in these highly deforested and disturbed anthropogenic landscapes.

AB  - The on-going climate warming is promoting shrub abundance in high latitudes, but the effect of this phenomenon on ecosystem functioning is expected to depend on whether deciduous or evergreen species increase in response to warming.To explore effects of long-term warming on shrubs and further on ecosystem functioning, we analysed vegetation and ecosystem CO2 exchange after 20 years of warming in the forest-tundra ecotone in subarctic Sweden. A previous study conducted 9 years earlier had found increased evergreen Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum in the forest and increased deciduous Betula nana in the tundra.<br />Following current understanding, we expected continued increase in shrub abundance that would be stronger in tundra than in forest. We expected warming to increase ecosystem respiration (R-e) and gross primary productivity (GPP), with a greater increase in R-e in tundra due to increased deciduous shrub abundance, leading to a less negative net ecosystem exchange and reduced ecosystem C sink strength.<br />As predicted, vascular plant abundances were higher in the warmed plots with a stronger response in tundra than in forest. However, whereas B. nana had increased in abundance since the last survey, E. hermaphroditum abundance had declined due to several moth and rodent outbreaks during the past decade. In contrast to predictions, R-e was significantly lower in the warmed plots irrespective of habitat, and GPP increased marginally only in the forest. The lower R-e and a higher GPP under warming in the forest together led to increased net C sink. R-e was negatively associated with the total vascular plant abundance.<br />Our results highlight the importance of disturbance regimes for vegetation responses to warming. Climate warming may promote species with both a high capacity to grow under warmer conditions and a resilience towards herbivore outbreaks. Negative correlation between R-e and total vascular plant abundance further indicate that the indirect impacts of increased plants on soil microclimate may become increasingly important for ecosystem CO2 exchange in the long run, which adds to the different mechanisms that link warming and CO2 fluxes in northern ecosystems.

AB  - Assessing the heat tolerance (CTmax) of organisms is central to understand the impact of climate change on biodiversity. While both environment and evolutionary history affect CTmax, it remains unclear how these factors and their interplay influence ecological interactions, communities and ecosystems under climate change. We collected and reared caterpillars and parasitoids from canopy and ground layers in different seasons in a tropical rainforest. We tested the CTmax and Thermal Safety Margins (TSM) of these food webs with implications for how species interactions could shift under climate change. We identified strong influence of phylogeny in herbivore-parasitoid community heat tolerance. The TSM of all insects were narrower in the canopy and parasitoids had lower heat tolerance compared to their hosts. Our CTmax-based simulation showed higher herbivore-parasitoid food web instability under climate change than previously assumed, highlighting the vulnerability of parasitoids and related herbivore control in tropical rainforests, particularly in the forest canopy.

AB  - In landscapes with high elephant density, trees often exhibit more open canopies with fewer branches and foliage due to browsing pressure. This can result in altered tree morphology, with trees exhibiting stunted growth, multiple stems or unusual branching patterns in response to repeated damage from browsing. The objectives of this research were to (i) model the vegetation structure allometries, (ii) assess the impact of African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) herbivory on the vegetation structure and (iii) assess tree cover change and vegetation performance over time in Mana Pools National Park in Zimbabwe. We established 26 plots of 30 x 30 m size. Selection of sampling plots was done following several steps. First, a fish net grid with 30 x 30 m polygons was created and projected on the polygon of Mana Pools National Park. The polygons for exclusion zones were then clipped from the fish net grid using the clip tool in ArcGIS Pro 3.0. Then, selection of sampling plots was done initially by stratified random sampling using the Sampling Design Tool add in for ArcGIS Pro 3.0. Landsat images for the years 2003, 2013 and 2023 were used to assess land use land cover (LULC) time series and to calculate Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) for the period. A generalised linear model (GLM) was used to analyse tree allometries. Further statistical investigations were performed using Bayesian piecewise regression (BPR) and Bayesian regression modelling (BRM). Basal area, number of stems, height, long canopy, diameter and basal circumference were all significantly different (p < 0.05) across all sampled plots. The change in growing conditions occurring as a tree grows beyond the reach of the African savannah elephant browsing indicates a natural system breakpoint. The best-fitting models were a simple linear model and a two breakpoint model for the plant population exposed to elephant herbivory. LULC, NDVI and SAVI confirm evidence of high tree regeneration over 2 decades. Understanding the dynamics in vegetation and LULC changes is critical for effective conservation and management of the habitats for African savannah elephants, as well as for maintaining the health and resilience of forest ecosystems.

AB  - Recreational activities may have negative effects on wildlife, but there are very few studies specifically on the effects of free-flight activities (i.e., hang-gliders, paragliders and their powered derivatives) on wildlife. We review the existing scientific studies on this issue in order to identify the gaps in knowledge at the taxonomic-group level in order to develop guidelines to minimize the impacts of recreational free-flight on wildlife. We found that studies mainly concerned the effects on four ungulate species (chamois, red deer, roe deer and Alpine ibex) and, to a lesser extent, on raptors such as the golden eagle and two vulture species (bearded vulture and cinereous vulture). The studies have generally been carried out in high mountain areas (e.g., the European Alps). Data show that free-flight activities create disturbances and have negative effects on wildlife, resulting in increased energy expenditure, reduction of feeding time, abandonment of feeding areas, reduced breeding output, loss of body condition, increased predation risk and harm from flight accidents. However, the lack of studies on many species and areas, along with the small number of long-term studies, prevents proper assessment of the current situation regarding the impact of this activity on wildlife. We provide recommendations to improve the regulation of this activity.

AB  - Predicting the comprehensive driver of ecosystem multifunctionality is crucial for effective grassland management. However, the underlying biotic and abiotic mechanisms of ecosystem multifunctionality under global change and land use remain poorly understood. In this study, a 3-year field experiment was conducted in a semi -arid steppe in Inner Mongolia to investigate the relative importance of different biotic and abiotic factors in regulating aboveground ecosystem multifunctionality (AEM) and belowground ecosystem multifunctionality (BEM) in response to resource input after long-term grazing. The experiment involved three grazing intensities (1.5 low, 4.5 moderate, and 9.0 high sheep/ha) with a 7-year difference in grazing history. Precipitation (W) and nitrogen deposition (N) were manipulatively increased during the growing season. The study focused on exploring the effects of various biotic factors (e.g. species richness, functional diversity, plant functional groups) and abiotic factors (e.g. soil environment variables) on AEM and BEM. The results revealed asymmetric responses of AEM and BEM to resource input. Resource input enhanced AEM, but not BEM. However, increasing grazing intensity substantially reduced BEM, though we noted that AEM and BEM decreased the most under moderate grazing. Interestingly, the study found consistent responses of single ecosystem functions and ecosystem multifunctionality to resource input across the three grazing blocks. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicated that species richness primarily enhanced AEM, while soil environment played a major role in promoting BEM across different grazing history intensities and the whole grazed system. Multiple biotic and abiotic factors with varying relative importance in different grazing history scenarios controlled AEM and BEM. Species richness exhibited a strong influence on AEM and BEM, but within a narrow effect threshold range, whereas soil environment had a lesser effect size but a wider threshold range. This study provides the first evidence that grazing history and resource enrichment jointly regulate AEM and BEM. The findings highlight the importance of considering biodiversity conservation, soil health, and land use history in management practices aimed at maintaining ecosystem multifunctionality under climate change and human activities scenarios.

AB  - Grasslands are among the most threatened and least protected terrestrial biome. Grassland forbs: (1) account for most of the floral diversity; (2) are not well studied because they have been overshadowed by grass-centered research; and (3) have been a major source for biodiversity loss. The Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie (PNB) of North America is one of the most endangered grasslands on earth. Knowledge of vegetation community dynamics in the PNB is based primarily on bunchgrasses. There is a paucity of information related to the PNB's diverse native perennial forbs (hereafter "forbs"). Consequently, PNB forb community patterns and dynamics are largely unknown. We describe forb community structure and its relationship to environmental factors and phenology. We sampled 29 plots in the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range, northeastern Oregon, at three different times during 2016 (April; May; July). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) indicated that the dominant gradient in forb composition was related (R-2 = 0.66) to slope and soil P and K, contrasting flat, poorly drained soils (scabflats) at one end with steep, well-drained soils at the other end. The secondary gradient (R-2 = 0.16) contrasted deeper, finer textured soils at one end with shallow, rocky soils at the other. Forb richness decreased by similar to 40% from April to July. NMS and Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) showed that most forbs had affinities toward spring. Ubiquitous forbs (e.g., Triteleia grandiflora, Camassia quamash) were sparse to absent by July. Contradictory to general descriptions of the PNB, forb cover and richness in drought-prone sites were comparable to mesic sites when spring data were considered. Our findings suggest that PNB grasslands contain diverse forb communities that are structured primarily by water drainage and soil depth. Conventional sampling concomitant with peak grass biomass is insufficient to characterize PNB forb communities, particularly for scabflats and the most drought-prone soils.

AB  - Camelids (Camelidae) were a diverse and widely distributed group in South America during the Pleistocene. According to the fossil record, three species inhabited southern Brazil in the recent past: Hemiauchenia paradoxa, Lama guanicoe, and Vicugna vicugna. The analysis of carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios in bioapatite provides insight into the paleobiology of nonliving animals and the environment they used to inhabit. We applied this tool to investigate the diet of camelids from two geological localities in southern Brazil: Touro Passo and Santa Vitoria Formations (H. paradoxa, n = 7; L. guanicoe, n = 6; V. vicugna, n = 4). Carbon stable isotopes from enamel, dentin, and bone indicated that H. paradoxa and L. guanicoe had diets comprising mostly C-3 grasses, but the latter showed a broader diet due to one individual with a mixed diet, whereas V. vicugna had a mixed C-3-C-4 diet. These different foraging behaviors may have minimized interspecific competition and favored niche partitioning and the coexistence of related species. Combined oxygen and carbon isotope data showed a consistent diet according to climate, probably due to the greater availability in glacial periods of cool-season grasses, which mainly use the C-3 photosynthetic pathway. Given their adaptations to grazing, the climate amelioration, followed by the loss of grasslands, likely had a great impact on camelid populations, leading to their extinction in southern Brazil. These results, therefore, contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of paleocommunities in this region.

AB  - ContextAnthropogenic habitat degradation resulting from agricultural, mining, and urban development is a leading cause of global insect declines, but the recovery of insect communities and functional guilds is rarely assessed during ecological restoration.ObjectivesAssess the effects of vegetation community composition and structure on insect species richness, diversity, and abundance across various stages of ecological restoration to understand the patterns and drivers of the return of insect functional guilds to post-mining restoration landscapes.MethodsWe sampled the insect community using ultraviolet polypropylene vane traps and conducted floristic surveys to quantify the relationships between the insect community and vegetation community across a 40-year sequence of post-mining ecological restoration in south-western Western Australia.ResultsDespite the lack of convergence observed in the vegetation community, insects returned through natural processes of reassembly and dispersal such that the community resembled that of reference forest communities within approximately a decade of restoration activity. However, the insect community transitioned from an assemblage dominated by pollinators to one dominated by herbivores and detritivores along the ecological restoration age gradient. Our results indicate that plant abundance had a significant effect on the abundance of pollinators and parasitoids but the relationships between vegetation community metrics and other functional guilds were relatively weak.ConclusionsInsect functional guilds present complex and variable responses to vegetation re-assembly and maximising landscape spatiotemporal heterogeneity and habitat complexity in ecological restoration can increase the availability of suitable habitat for a diverse suite of insect taxa and the associated ecological services they provide.

AB  - Changes in the biosphere carbon (C) sink are of utmost importance given rising atmospheric CO2 levels. Concurrent global changes, such as increasing nitrogen (N) deposition, are affecting how much C can be stored in terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the extent of these impacts will help in predicting the fate of the biosphere C sink. However, most N addition experiments add N in rates that greatly exceed ambient rates of N deposition, making inference from current knowledge difficult. Here, we leveraged data from a 13-year N addition gradient experiment with addition rates spanning realistic rates of N deposition (0, 1, 5, and 10 g N m(-2) year(-1)) to assess the rates of N addition at which C uptake and storage were stimulated in a temperate grassland. Very low rates of N addition stimulated gross primary productivity and plant biomass, but also stimulated ecosystem respiration such that there was no net change in C uptake or storage. Furthermore, we found consistent, nonlinear relationships between N addition rate and plant responses such that intermediate rates of N addition induced the greatest ecosystem responses. Soil pH and microbial biomass and respiration all declined with increasing N addition indicating that negative consequences of N addition have direct effects on belowground processes, which could then affect whole ecosystem C uptake and storage. Our work demonstrates that experiments that add large amounts of N may be underestimating the effect of low to intermediate rates of N deposition on grassland C cycling. Furthermore, we show that plant biomass does not reliably indicate rates of C uptake or soil C storage, and that measuring rates of C loss (i.e., ecosystem and soil respiration) in conjunction with rates of C uptake and C pools are crucial for accurately understanding grassland C storage.

AB  - This study explores the role of branching patterns in determining sapling resilience to ungulate browsing, shedding light on the architectural traits that might shape regeneration dynamics in temperate forests. With ungulate populations rising and forest ecosystems increasingly impacted by browsing, understanding how architectural traits influence survival is vital for understanding how to maintain biodiversity and forest sustainability. We hypothesized that (1) browsing pressure varies significantly across tree architectural types and (2) these variations are most pronounced in the upper crown regions, critical for vertical growth. Data from over 2800 saplings growing in varied forest environments-ranging from dense canopies to open gaps-enabled us to classify six tree species into three functional groups: evergreen monopodial (EM), deciduous monopodial (DM), and deciduous sympodial (DS). Our findings reveal that trees with fewer lateral branches and lower shade tolerance, especially in the DM group, face the highest browsing impact in upper crown areas, which might severely hamper their vertical growth and prolong their vulnerability to browsing. In contrast, EM and DS groups displayed greater resilience due to the ability to develop lateral shoots, allowing them to withstand browsing while continuing to increase in height. Importantly, intense browsing pressure disproportionately affects DM species, which could limit the recruitment of ecologically important tree species into the forest canopy-especially in unmanaged stands. This limitation is likely to be exacerbated by climate change, as species such as Sycamore maple, anticipated to thrive in warming climates, may fail to establish due to increased browsing pressure. This study's architectural approach offers a new perspective on browsing effects, challenging traditional classifications, and emphasizing the need for adaptive forest management strategies that consider tree structural traits. Our work supports more nuanced predictions of how browsing pressure influences forest dynamics, aiming to safeguard ecosystem resilience amidst rising ungulate densities and climate change.

AB  - Northwest North America has unique high elevation Picea-Abies forests and parkland classified in British Columbia as the Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine-fir (ESSF) Biogeoclimatic zone. These ecosystems occur on a topographically and climatically complex landscape, juxtaposed with diverse vegetation types including alpine tundra, inland rain forest, dry conifer forest, and grasslands. Spatio-temporal ecosystem disturbance is varied, driven by factors such as climate variation, wildfire, volcanic eruptions, and insect herbivory. A pollen and charcoal record derived from a lake sediment core from the ESSF reveals a unique late-glacial to modern vegetation history progressing from alpine steppe through dry open conifer forest to moist spruce-fir ecosystems, the latter arising only 4600 years ago, late by comparison to other ESSF sites in the region. Repeated disturbance in the mid Holocene by wildfire coupled with volcanic ash deposition and increased climatic variation resulted in recurring Pinus contorta-dominated seral forest stands before cooling and moistening in the late Holocene led to stable Picea-Abies forest. With rapid climate change, changing disturbance regimes, and timber harvest, the management of dry ESSF forests needs to consider that this forest-type could transform into parkland or open seral pine stands, with a high frequency disturbance regime.

AB  - 1. Climate change stressors, including warming and heatwaves, can alter plankton composition and dominance patterns in temperate shallow lakes, which can disrupt ecosystem function and curtail ecosystem services. Understanding how these alterations could take place under future climates is therefore important.
   2. To understand such changes, we performed a year-long mesocosm experiment with controls reflecting present temperature conditions and a treatment reflecting a future climate change scenario, including heatwaves of 5-8 degrees C above ambient water temperatures.
   3. In the warmer conditions, the predatory invertebrate Mesostoma, exerted a strong top-down control on Daphnia, resulting in a switch in herbivore dominance to Ceriodaphnia in contrast to the controls where Daphnia remained dominant. A complementary predation experiment revealed that Mesostoma fed at a higher rate on Daphnia than on Ceriodaphnia and cyclopoid copepods. Cyclopoids were the least affected taxon but showed tendencies to sustain populations longer into the winter at elevated temperatures. Moreover, both total algal and cyanobacteria biomass increased with warming.
   4. Our experiments suggest that predator-prey dynamics may alter plankton community composition and dominance patterns in a warmer climate because thermophilic predatory invertebrates have the potential to induce cascading food-chain effects and alter the herbivore dominance patterns in lake zooplankton. This may have implications for the algal population dynamics and overall ecosystem function and processes in shallow lakes.

AB  - Human activities drive ecological transformation, impacting island ecosystems from species diversity to ecological traits, mainly through habitat degradation and invasive species. Using two unique long-term datasets we aim to evaluate whether species traits (body size, trophic level, dispersal capacity and habitat occupancy) can predict temporal variations in the abundance of endemic, indigenous (endemic and native non-endemic) and exotic arthropods in the Azores Islands. We found that body size is crucial to predict arthropod abundance trends. Small-bodied herbivorous arthropods showed a decrease in abundance, while large-bodied indigenous arthropods increased in abundance, mainly in well-preserved areas. Also, large-bodied exotic arthropods increased in abundance across the entire archipelago. Moreover, endemic canopy dwellers increased in abundance, while endemic ground-dwellers decreased in abundance. Simultaneously, exotic arthropods showed the opposite result, increasing in abundance in the ground while decreasing in abundance in the canopy. Finally, habitat influenced both endemic and exotic spider abundance trends. Endemic spiders that occupy solely natural habitats experienced a decline in abundance, while exotic spiders in the same habitats increased in abundance. Our study underscores the significance of arthropod species traits in predicting abundance changes in island ecosystems over time, as well as the importance of monitoring species communities. Conservation efforts must extend beyond endangered species to protect non-threatened ones, given the increased extinction risk faced by even common species on islands. Monitoring and restoration programs are essential for preserving island ecosystems and safeguarding endemic arthropod populations.

AB  - Wildlife is invaluable for natural development and biodiversity conservation. We investigated tourist cognition of rare species, as well as their economic value, in protected areas of the Qinling region, China. We focused on the tourist cognition and willingness to pay for the conservation of Giant Pandas, Golden Monkeys, Crested Ibises, and Takins. We also explored the influence of the tourist cognition of ecology and its perceived value on the willingness to pay for the conservation of different species. Results indicated that the tourists are more willing to pay for Giant Pandas and Golden Monkeys. The tourist cognition of species affects mainly the willingness to pay, while the tourist cognition of wildlife importance mainly affects the payment. The tourists' perceived emotional and cost values have significant positive effects on the willingness to pay for the conservation of Giant Pandas/Golden Monkeys and Crested Ibises/Takins, respectively. Education and income levels have significant positive impacts on the willingness to pay and payment, respectively; therefore, it is necessary to publicise rare species, such as Crested Ibis and Takin, through natural education and experience to improve the tourist cognition of species and ecological environment. In addition, innovative forms of product supply combined with the tourists' needs should be explored to improve their perceived emotional value and willingness to pay for wildlife conservation.

AB  - We know little about how parasitoids of herbivorous insects use herbivore-induced volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to locate potential hosts on saplings in forests, and how this depends on tree composition. Therefore, we performed an experiment in a forest in Poland where we placed pairs of oak saplings (Quercus robur or Q. petraea) in neighborhoods dominated by oak, beech, or pine trees. We treated one sapling in each pair with the phytohormone methyl jasmonate, which triggers induced responses in plants. We measured the VOC emissions of thirty-six saplings and placed Malaise traps with five of the pairs. We counted the parasitoids in the ten Malaise samples and identified them using DNA metabarcoding. We used parasitoids reared from oak-feeding caterpillars to estimate which species are associated with oaks. The two species of oak differed in both the proportions of VOCs and the specific VOCs that were elevated following the application of methyl jasmonate. We did not detect any overall effects of treatment on parasitoid abundance or community composition. However, some parasitoid species that were associated with oaks appeared to be attracted to elevated emissions of specific induced VOCs. The parasitoid communities differed significantly between sites and showed marginally significant differences between neighborhoods. Overall, our results suggest that parasitoids in the understory are affected by tree composition of the canopy, but the effects of VOC emissions are limited.

AB  - In contrast to the modern Arctic, high-latitude ecosystems of the Late Pleistocene supported a diverse range of large mammalian herbivores, including abundant bison (Bison priscus) and horses (Equus sp.). This 'mammoth steppe' biome has no extant analog and modern tundra vegetation is likely incapable of supporting such a high density of large mammals. Compared to modern Arctic ecosystems, higher diversity and biomass of Late Pleistocene large mammal populations may have been sustained by more nutritious forage and/or dietary niche partitioning. We used dental microwear texture analysis and dental mesowear analysis of bison and horses (Bison priscus, Equus sp.) to characterize diet and assess the degree to which dietary differences supported co-existence of these dominant and likely competing herbivores on the mammoth steppe. Additionally, we compared microwear and mesowear of Late Pleistocene specimens to modern Alaska bison (reintroduced Bison bison athabascae and introduced Bison bison bison) and published microwear and mesowear data for extant bovids and equids. Our results demonstrate that Late Pleistocene bison and horses had less abrasive diets than modern obligate grazers, suggesting that these "grazers" of the mammoth steppe likely incorporated more forbs in their diets than modern grazers. Furthermore, Late Pleistocene bison and horses ate foods with similar textures, indicating that dietary niche partitioning alone cannot explain their co-occurrence. However, taphonomic differences between bison and horse specimens indicate potential spatial or temporal niche partitioning during the Late Pleistocene.

AB  - The Puna grasslands support grazing systems that produce meat and wool in multi -species herds, especially from llama ( Lama glama ) and sheep. However, it is yet unknown whether grazing pressure can modify grassland structure and Plant Functional Types diversity and cover in Puna grasslands. We analyzed the relationship between grazing pressure and Plant Functional Types by comparing transects located near stockyards (high grazing pressure) and far from them (low pressure) and by evaluating the relationship between the Plant Functional Types cover to a Grazing Pressure Index (GPI). This index incorporates the heterogeneity of traditional pastoral management. At two ecological sites (Ci & eacute;nego and Tolar), we sampled paired transects (near -far). Plots near and far from corrals were similar in all the variables measured except for plots in Tolar, which tend to have higher total cover, possibly due to fecal fertilization near stockyards. Furthermore, we recorded an increase in total cover and grass cover at higher GPI in Ci & eacute;nego, while in Tolar we found lower values of total cover and herbaceous dicotyledonous cover at intermediate intensities of GPI. The only negative relationship found was the cover of clonal and non -clonal shrubs, possibly explained by the greater use of these shrubs as fi rewood near stockyards. In summary, our study does not show important changes in Plant Functional Types as a function of grazing pressure in the studied grasslands probably because grazing pressure is diluted or diminished when livestock rotates in different areas and grazing durations vary. Finally, the long grazing history with which the Puna has evolved could also contribute to the co-structuration between native vegetation and livestock farming.

AB  - Arthropods play a critical role in the functioning of grassland ecosystems, and are largely affected by herbivore grazing. However, the mechanisms of grazing affecting arthropod community, especially through modulating plant traits and soil properties, are still unclear. We investigated the variation in arthropod community variables including family richness, activity-density, biomass, and body size in typical steppe grasslands subject to grazing at four intensity levels (nil, light, moderate and heavy) in central Inner Mongolia (China), and analyzed the relationships of these variations with grazing-induced changes in plant traits, plant community attributes and soil properties. We found that (i) at the community level, arthropod family richness was lower in moderately-grazed than in both lightly- and heavily-grazed grasslands, but no significant difference was detected between grazing and no-grazing grasslands. The high arthropod community activity-density was found in plant communities with high plant leaf nitrogen content and low water content. (ii) With increasing grazing intensity, the biomass of arthropod community decreased, while the proportion of small-sized arthropods increased, and the family composition, especially the families of Coleoptera changed. (iii) The response of arthropods to grazing intensity differed among arthropod orders. The family richness of Coleoptera, Diptera and Homoptera increased with the increase of plant leaf water content and C:N ratio or the decrease of leaf nitrogen content; Orthoptera activitydensity declined with increasing grazing intensity, but showed no significant correlation with plant leaf traits, community attributes, or soil water content; Hymenoptera activity-density declined with the increase of plant height, biomass and cover, and the decrease of plant individual density and family richness; a greater Lepidoptera activity-density was found in the grassland with high vegetation cover and moist soil; and Diptera exhibited larger biomass and body size in grasslands with increased plant nitrogen content. (iv) Depending on grazing conditions, some arthropod families may alter their feeding preferences and select more stable environmental conditions for survival, potentially weakening the inherent relationship between arthropods and plants. Our study implies it is necessary to incorporate the dynamics of ground arthropods into the grassland management for conservation and sustainable use of grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are an introduced species that affect ecosystems through myriad pathways. They are the target of population control efforts, but one outstanding question is the extent to which native predators affect population demography. Cougars (Puma concolor) are a known predator of wild pigs and cooccur with wild pigs in several regions of the Americas. However, investigations of wild pig survival in regions with cougars are lacking. We investigated the survival and causes of mortality for wild pigs in California, USA where cougars could act as a predator. We also explored habitat selection of wild pigs with respect to cougar predation risk. We collared 69 wild pigs, 15 adults, 15 subadults, and 39 juveniles. Captures occurred in winter and spring and survival estimates primarily reflect spring and summer survival. We estimated 6-month survival of adults and juveniles to be 0.923 (95% confidence interval: 0.789-1.00) and 0.563 (0.416-0.762), respectively, which are similar to estimates from areas without cougars. Only juvenile and one subadult wild pig were killed by cougars, suggesting that cougars are a limited predator of adults. We also investigated feeding locations of 3 GPS-collared cougars to generate a spatial layer of cougar kill occurrence. We used this layer in an integrated step selection function for wild pigs and observed wild pigs selecting areas with low probability of cougar kill occurrence during times when cougars are most active. Combined, these results suggest that cougars are a minor source of mortality for wild pigs during the spring and summer and may be unlikely to provide substantial biological resistance against the spread of wild pigs. Our monitoring occurred when native prey (e.g. ungulate neonates) are most abundant which may influence cougar predation of pigs. It is likely that a preference for native prey, the novelty of wild pigs, wild pig habitat selection, and the potential danger of adult wild pigs reduces cougar predation.

AB  - The research aimed to investigate the perinatal pathology of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) through the study of four young subjects (at the age of 3 to 4 months) found dead in Valle d'Aosta, a region of northwestern Italy. The carcasses were submitted to necropsy followed by an examination of ecto- and endoparasites (ECP and ENP); samples from the gross lesions (in summary, cutaneous papilloma and crusts, ocular discharge, lobular haemorrhagic areas in the lungs, catarrhal-haemorrhagic enterocolitis) were analysed by bacteriological, histopathological, and biomolecular methods to define the etiological agent. The subjects, with various co-infection patterns, were affected by contagious ecthyma virus (ORFV) (agent of a highly diffusive pustular dermatitis transmissible to small ruminants and humans), Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (major etiological agent of infantile diarrhoea especially in developing countries), Mycoplasma conjunctivae (MC) (cause of an ocular infection common to goats and sheep), various ECP (ticks and keds) and ENP (lung and intestinal nematodes, and coccidia). This study emphasises the potential role of the Alpine ibex in the transmission of infectious diseases to other animals such as to humans and, secondly, the need to apply diversified analytical approaches, with the commitment of various specialistic skills, in order to define, in detail, the various and frequently overlapping causes that led a free-ranging animal to the death.

AB  - European bison (Bison bonasus) were widespread throughout Europe during the late Pleistocene. However, the contributions of environmental change and humans to their near extinction have never been resolved. Using process-explicit models, fossils and ancient DNA, we disentangle the combinations of threatening processes that drove population declines and regional extinctions of European bison through space and across time. We show that the population size of European bison declined abruptly at the termination of the Pleistocene in response to rapid environmental change, hunting by humans and their interaction. Human activities prevented populations of European bison from rebounding in the Holocene, despite improved environmental conditions. Hunting caused range loss in the north and east of its distribution, while land use change was responsible for losses in the west and south. Advances in hunting technologies from 1500 CE were needed to simulate low abundances observed in 1870 CE. While our findings show that humans were an important driver of the extinction of the European bison in the wild, vast areas of its range vanished during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition because of post-glacial environmental change. These areas of its former range have been climatically unsuitable for millennia and should not be considered in reintroduction efforts.

AB  - Herbivores in wetlands are key organisms that shape the structure and composition of wetland plant communities (algae and vascular plants). The detritus produced by herbivory contributes to nutrient cycling and provides important resources for other organisms in the ecosystem. Due to their importance, we decided to survey a set of 12 seasonal wetlands located in Andean Patagonian forests. We registered the biotic and abiotic variables of each wetland and the diversity and abundance of herbivores. We found two groups of wetlands: short hydroperiod and long hydroperiod. Despite this, the structure of the communities was not related to the hydroperiod length, abundance, or species composition. In particular, the abundance of herbivores was explained by chlorophyll, pH and dissolved oxygen, among others. Their diversity and abundance were (in decreasing order): rotifers, copepods, cladocerans, caddisflies, and amphibians. Probably, the species found in these wetlands are well adapted to different hydroperiod regimens and, even in short hydroperiods, can complete their life cycle. The results found here do not match with the model of hydroperiod gradient; however, other variables not measured here, such as diversity and abundance of aquatic plants or predation by invertebrates, could impact the composition and abundance of herbivores in these wetlands.

AB  - How to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic habitat alteration and restore ecological processes has become an imperative question facing applied ecology. One high-profile example in Canada is boreal woodland caribou, which are declining across North America largely due to anthropogenic habitat alteration and associated changes to predator-prey dynamics. Habitat restoration is increasingly being implemented to recover habitat, as is mandated by federal law. But given the extent of the disturbance and the cost to conduct restoration, evaluating the effectiveness of restoration treatments is needed for effective recovery of caribou populations. We evaluated the effectiveness of silvicultural treatments to reduce predator (wolf and bear) and prey (moose and caribou) use of linear features using a multiple lines of evidence approach. All four species were less likely to be present at treated sites than untreated sites, and daily photo capture rates of moose and wolves when present at treated sites also declined; though effect sizes were typically small. Complimenting the camera-based results, individual moose, bears, and wolves monitored with GPS collars also showed a decline in the use of treated linear features, particularly those with higher intensity treatments, though the response was non-significant. The reduction in the use of treated lines did not scale-up into a significant decline in overall line-use within the treatment area. While we found more evidence than not supporting that animals reduced use of the restoration sites, our study highlights the complexity of monitoring and evaluating the success of habitat restoration. Understanding long-term responses is imperative to ensure habitat restoration is effective.

AB  - The effects of grazing on natural grasslands' plant composition, diversity, and productivity depend on the intensity of grazing. Besides grazing intensity, animal composition is also important. However, whether and how sheep grazing intensity affects the temporal biomass stability of plant communities is unclear. Here, we conducted a 5-year grazing experiment to evaluate the effects of four grazing intensities on community biomass stability and the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that the higher grazing intensity significantly decreased community biomass stability, community-wide asynchrony, functional groups asynchrony, dominant species stability, and species dominance, but did not affect species richness. The results of structural equation modeling revealed that grazing decreased community biomass stability by decreasing dominant species stability and community-wide asynchrony, which was attributable to the reduction in plant functional group asynchrony. Our results highlight the importance of functional group composition and dynamics in predicting the changes in community function in sheep grazing grassland ecosystems. Under continuous seasonal grazing conditions, the sustainable function and human services of grasslands in the agropastoral ecotone might decrease in the future.

AB  - First quantitative dung beetle-feeding trophic network analysis for the Oriental region is carried out by investigating tmphic network interaction between dung beetles and mammal dung types in the moist forests of the Western Ghats a global biodiversity hot spot in south-western India. Dung-beetle assemblage associated with the dung of the prominent mammals, such as the macaque, boar, gaur, elephant and deer, showed differences in richness, abundance and composition among different dung types. Most dung beetles were generalists with low resource specificity and community-wide generalist feeding on herbivore and omnivore dung types. Dung beetles in the region displayed high species richness and abundance in boar dung. The high attraction and specificity of dung beetles towards the odoriferous boar dung indicate that the omnivore mammal Sus scrofa has a major role in maintaining the dung beetle community in the forests of the Western Ghats. Network interaction analysis shows that the vast majority in the assemblage are generalist species, and the few specialist species were all with low abundance. Low overall specialisation and low resource partitioning with high species richness is recorded in the assemblage. The assemblage's trophic level preference is reflected in the high dung specificity recorded in the omnivore and herbivore dung types.

AB  - Southern pines are important tree species in both silvopasture and woodland systems. Information on the dynamics of soil quality and growth of southern pines in these systems, especially when grazing animals are included in the system, is limited. Hypothesis of the study was that the soil quality and growth of southern-pine trees would be better in silvopastures vs. woodlands. The study objective was to evaluate the soil quality and growth of southern pines (loblolly, Pinus taeda and longleaf, Pinus palustris) in silvopastures and woodlands. Studies were conducted in silvopastures and woodlands, with six plots in each system (0.4-ha per plot). Silvopastures were developed from the existing woodlands in 2014 by removing the non-pine vegetation, thinning pine trees, and planting suitable cool- and warm-season forages. Woodlands consisted of longleaf and loblolly pines, hardwood trees, and several understory plant species. Understory vegetation present in both systems was managed with the rotational stocking of meat goats (Kiko) and hair sheep (Katahdin and Katahdin St. Croix cross). Soil bulk density and moisture were evaluated in 2019 and both plus carbon and nitrogen were measured in 2020. Tree height and diameter at breast height (DBH) were measured from 2018 to 2020. Soil carbon and nitrogen were greater in silvopastures versus woodlands (p < 0.05). Both loblolly and longleaf pines grew better in silvopastures versus woodlands, with a greater DBH (16-35%) and basal area (35-78%) in the former system (p < 0.0001). Tree species showed a significant effect (p < 0.001) on all growth parameters within each system, with loblolly pines having the greater height (6-9%), DBH (27-43%), and basal area (62-107) than longleaf pines. Results show that silvopastures offer a better environment for a faster growth of southern pine trees versus woodlands, when the understory vegetation present in both systems is managed with small ruminants.

AB  - Expanding grassy ecosystems through the late Cenozoic may have driven ecological and evolutionary change in hominins and other African mammals. However, we lack a sufficiently robust quantitative framework to understand how species should respond to changing vegetation structure or the magnitude of change needed to drive range shifts, speciation, extinction, or adaptation. A more detailed understanding of present-day species environment relationships at scales appropriate to paleoenvironmental records can help build this framework. Here, we use generalized additive models to estimate modern-day herbivore responses to woody cover gradients across 100+ present-day African parks and reserves. We examine these responses for 58 herbivore species (Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Proboscidea) and with species aggregated by tribe (for Bovidae) and dietary functional group (browser, grazer, mixed feeder, frugivore). At the spatial scales of our analysis (i.e., parks and reserves measuring-500-5000 km2), we find that few species have strong associations with open (<0.3 fraction woody cover) or closed (>0.7 fraction woody cover) environments. Most herbivores demonstrate a peak probability of presence around 0.5 fraction woody cover. The latter result is consistent with the ecological conditions previously shown to maximize herbivore diversity. At landscape-to-ecosystem spatial scales (102-103 km2), which average across finer-scale patches of distinct vegetation types (e.g., grassland, woodland, forest), our results indicate that a taxonomically and ecologically diverse group of species are expected to co-occur. We argue that spatiotemporal scale likely accounts for the ubiquity of mosaic habitat reconstructions in time-averaged fossil assemblages from the late Cenozoic of Africa. In addition, we propose that species' broad tolerances for gradients in woody cover renders the expansion of C4-dominated ecosystems an uncertain driver of macroevolutionary change (i.e., speciation and extinction) in Africa through the Plio-Pleistocene.

AB  - Oil palm is one of Southeast Asia's most common crops, and its expansion has caused substantial modification of natural habitats and put increasing pressure on biodiversity. Rising global demand for vegetable oil, coupled with oil palm's high yield per unit area and the versatility of the palm oil product, has driven the expansion of oil palm agriculture in the region. Therefore, it is critical to identify management practices that can support biodiversity in plantations without exacerbating negative impacts on the environment. This study focuses on day-flying Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), which contribute to the ecosystem functioning as pollinators, prey, and herbivore species. We assessed whether density and behaviours of day-flying Lepidoptera varied between different habitats within oil palm plantations and across seasons. We surveyed the density and behaviours of Lepidoptera communities in mature industrial oil palm plantations within the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function in Tropical Agriculture (BEFTA) Programme sites, in Riau, Indonesia. We surveyed two distinct habitats within the plantations in March and September 2013: Edge habitats, which were bordered by plantation roads on one side, and Core habitats in the centre of oil palm planting blocks. We conducted analyses on the effect of habitat type and season on both the overall density and behaviour of Lepidoptera communities and, independently, on the most common species. In our surveys, we observed 1464 individuals across 41 species, with a significantly higher density in Edge than in Core habitats. While there was no significant difference between overall density in March and September surveys, there was an interaction between season and habitat, with density increasing more markedly in Edge than Core areas in September. There was also a significant effect of habitat and season on behavioural time budget for the community as a whole, with more active behaviours, such as foraging and mating, being recorded more frequently in Edge than Core habitats, and more commonly in September than March. The effect of habitat type, season, and their interaction differed between the six most common species. Our findings indicate that Lepidoptera abundance is affected by habitat characteristics in a plantation and can therefore be influenced by plantation management practices. In particular, our study highlights the value of road edges and paths in plantations for day-flying Lepidoptera. We suggest that increased non-crop vegetation in these areas, achieved through reduced clearing practices or planting of flowering plants, could foster abundant and active butterfly communities in plantations. These practices could form part of sustainability management recommendations for oil palm, such as those of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.

AB  - The aims were to determine if the contact with estrous females stimulates testosterone and cortisol secretion in Iberian ibex bucks during or out of the breeding season and if their social rank affects this response. Nine Iberian ibex bucks (Capra pyrenaica), were challenged with estrous does during two periods: winter-spring and autumn (three tests at each season, separated 10 days). Individual success index (SI) was calculated in both season. Bucks were exposed to an estrous doe, their sexual and agonistic behavior was recorded, testosterone and cortisol concentrations were measured. There were no sexual interactions toward the estrous doe in any test. Testosterone concentration was unrelated to the SI in any season and was not modified with the tests. Cortisol concentration was greater in the first than in the second and third tests in both seasons (winter-spring: 99.7 & PLUSMN; 15.7 ng/mL, 65.9 & PLUSMN; 9.4 ng/mL and 62.3 & PLUSMN; 10.1 ng/mL P < 0.0001; autumn: 110.1 & PLUSMN; 15.8 ng/mL, 79.2 & PLUSMN; 13.4 ng/ mL, and 87.6 & PLUSMN; 13.5 ng/mL; P < 0.01).

AB  - The identification of drivers of bioelement concentrations in plant communities is crucial for our understanding of ecosystem functioning. In this respect, soil nutrients, plant biodiversity and functional groups are reported to affect the plant community bioelement composition. However, given the predominant focus on species richness and single elements (or stoichiometric ratios) so far, only little is known about the patterns of the whole suite of bioelements at the community level and whether these patterns can be predicted by evolutionary relationships between co-occurring species (phylogenetic diversity). To explore this knowledge gap, we used a comprehensive dataset of soil nutrients, plant community composition, phylogeny and aboveground tissue bioelement data from experimental sites established in central European semi-natural grasslands. Plant community bioelement composition was strongly and exponentially related to community calcium and magnesium (bioelements reflecting deep phylogenetic differences). Plant community bioelement composition and stoichiometry were best indicated by functional group composition (graminoids and forbs) and phylogenetic regularity, whereas phylogenetic richness, phylogenetic divergence and species richness were poor predictors. Bioelement-rich communities were poor in graminoids and rich in forbs, and tended to have evenly distributed phylogenetic distances (high regularity). No confounding effect of soil nutrients was observed. The links between functional group composition, phylogenetic regularity and plant community bioelement composition suggest that functional groups and phylogenetic diversity are mechanistically connected to ecosystem functions, such as primary production, decomposition, biogeochemical cycling or plant-herbivore interactions, through bioelements.

AB  - Grazing livestock and pikas, as the primary herbivores in grasslands, influence the health of grassland ecosystems through activities such as feeding, burrowing, and trampling. This study reviews 86 articles and examines the effects of varying grazing levels and pika activity on alpine grassland vegetation and soil in the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, providing scientific insights to guide grassland conservation efforts. The research shows that: 1) Both grazing and pika disturbance significantly reduce aboveground biomass (AGB) in alpine grasslands (p < 0.05). Moderate grazing increases diversity indices, while pika disturbance has the opposite effect. 2) As grazing intensity increases, there is a significant decrease in total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and soil organic matter (SOM) content (p < 0.05). However, moderate pika disturbance leads to a significant increase in TP and TN content (p < 0.05). 3) In grazing trials, bulk density (BD) and the Shannon-Wiener index are significant positive drivers. Conversely, during pika disturbance, the Shannon-Wiener index and total nitrogen (TN) act as significant positive drivers, while BD is a significant negative driver. The study's findings indicate that moderate grazing intensity and pika disturbance can enhance plant diversity indices in grasslands, as well as improve soil structure and nutrient levels. Therefore, establishing a reasonable grazing system and controlling the pika population are effective methods for managing alpine grasslands.

AB  - Top-down and bottom-up factors and their interaction highlight the interdependence of resources and consumer impacts on food webs and ecosystems. Variation in the strength of upwelling-mediated ecological controls (i.e., light availability and herbivory) between early and late succession stages is less well understood from the standpoint of influencing algal functional group composition. We experimentally tested the effect of light, grazing, and disturbance on rocky intertidal turf-forming algal communities. Studies were conducted on the South Island of New Zealand at Raramai on the east coast (a persistent downwelling region) and Twelve Mile Beach on the west coast (an intermittent upwelling region). Herbivory, light availability, and algal cover were manipulated and percent cover of major macroalgal functional groups and sessile invertebrates were measured monthly from October 2017 to March 2018. By distinguishing between algal functional groups and including different starting conditions in our design, we found that the mosaic-like pattern of bare rock intermingled with diverse turf-forming algae at Twelve Mile Beach was driven by a complex array of species interactions, including grazing, predation, preemptive competition and interference competition, colonization rates, and these interactions were modulated by light availability and other environmental conditions. Raramai results contrasted with those at Twelve Mile Beach in showing stronger effects of grazing and relatively weak effects of other interactions, low colonization rates of invertebrates, and light effects limited to crustose algae. Our study highlights the potential importance of an upwelling-mediated 3-way interaction among herbivory, light availability, and preemption in structuring contrasting low rocky intertidal macroalgal communities.

AB  - The diel activity pattern is a key factor in the coexistence mechanism of sympatric wild animals, enabling temporal niche partitioning. Although previous studies on sympatric ungulates (sika deer, Japanese serow, and wild boar) have reported dietary and spatial niche partitioning, temporal niche partitioning in these sympatric ungulates is not well understood. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the seasonal diel activity patterns of three sympatric ungulates in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, where they have been sympatrically distributed since 1978. We placed 21 camera traps from August 2017 to November 2019, and investigated diel activity patterns and photographic frequencies over three time periods (daytime, night-time, and twilight). Although we found no seasonal changes in diel activity patterns of three ungulates, but patterns showed differences among species. While sika deer showed crepuscular activity, wild boars and Japanese serows showed nocturnal activity. In addition, Japanese serows showed temporal niche partitioning against sika deer. Consequently, we suggest that the relationship between sika deer and Japanese scrow is competitive in terms of diel activity patterns.

AB  - Overharvest can severely reduce the abundance and distribution of a species and thereby impact its genetic diversity and threaten its future viability. Overharvest remains an ongoing issue for Arctic mammals, which due to climate change now also confront one of the fastest changing environments on Earth. The high-arctic Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus), endemic to Svalbard, experienced a harvest-induced demographic bottleneck that occurred during the 17-20th centuries. Here, we investigate changes in genetic diversity, population structure, and gene-specific differentiation during and after this overharvesting event. Using whole-genome shotgun sequencing, we generated the first ancient and historical nuclear (n = 11) and mitochondrial (n = 18) genomes from Svalbard reindeer (up to 4000 BP) and integrated these data with a large collection of modern genome sequences (n = 90) to infer temporal changes. We show that hunting resulted in major genetic changes and restructuring in reindeer populations. Near-extirpation followed by pronounced genetic drift has altered the allele frequencies of important genes contributing to diverse biological functions. Median heterozygosity was reduced by 26%, while the mitochondrial genetic diversity was reduced only to a limited extent, likely due to already low pre-harvest diversity and a complex post-harvest recolonization process. Such genomic erosion and genetic isolation of populations due to past anthropogenic disturbance will likely play a major role in metapopulation dynamics (i.e., extirpation, recolonization) under further climate change. Our results from a high-arctic case study therefore emphasize the need to understand the long-term interplay of past, current, and future stressors in wildlife conservation.

AB  - Simple Summary Investigating the interspecific interactions between species provides a suitable model for understanding the mechanisms of coexistence between sympatric species. We assessed the spatial and temporal partitioning of spaces between Japanese serows (Capricornis crispus) and sika deer (Cervus nippon), which are usually allopatric, in an area with early-stage invasion of sika deer into Japanese serow habitat. The habitat selection and activity patterns of the two species were evaluated using camera traps. Both species were recorded in >25% of the same camera sites and showed similar selection tendencies for water resources. The Japanese serows selected steep slopes, whereas the sika deer selected areas distant from human settlements, resulting in low spatial overlap. Additionally, the Japanese serows were more active during the daytime, whereas the sika deer were active at the crepuscule. The observed spatial and temporal partitioning likely reduces their encounter rates, thereby minimizing possible interference competition. However, spatial and temporal overlaps between the two species are likely to increase as the density of sika deer increases, potentially resulting in a decline in the density of Japanese serows with smaller body sizes. Trapping for deer management should be focused on areas with gentle slopes, away from valleys and human settlements, to reduce the unintentional capture of Japanese serows. The Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus) and sika deer (Cervus nippon) in Japan are usually allopatric. However, a recent expansion in the distribution range of sika deer, combined with an increase in abundance, has resulted in an overlap of the distribution ranges of the two species. We examined the habitat selection and activity patterns of Japanese serows and sika deer using camera traps placed at 83 sites within a 210 km(2) study area, where the distribution range of these two species has recently overlapped. Although both species were photographed throughout the study area, we observed a low spatial overlap between them. The Japanese serows selected steep slopes, and the sika deer selected areas far away from human settlements. In addition, the Japanese serows and sika deer exhibited temporal partitioning with diurnal and crepuscular activity patterns, respectively. The observed partitioning could be explained by differences in their species-specific habitat selections, rather than competition, because the photographic capture rate of the Japanese serows was not affected by that of the sika deer and vice versa. These partitioning behaviors are likely to reduce the rate of encounters between the two ungulates, which enables their coexistence considering the sika deer density remains low.

AB  - Characterizing energy flow and trophic linkages is fundamental to understanding the functioning and resilience of Arctic ecosystems under increasing pressure from climate change and anthropogenic exploitation. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to examine trophic dynamics and the relative contribution of terrestrial organic matter, water column phytoplankton, and phytobenthos (benthic micro- and macro-autotrophs as well as sea ice algae) to the food webs supporting 45 macroconsumers in three Arctic coastal lagoon ecosystems (Krusenstern, Sisualik, Akulaaq) and the adjacent Kotzebue Sound with varying degrees of connectivity in Cape Krusenstern National Monument, Alaska. A two-source (water column particulate organic matter and benthic sediment organic matter), two-isotope trophic dynamics model informed by a Bayesian isotope mixing model revealed that the Lagoon-Kotzebue Sound coastal ecosystem supported consumers along a trophic position continuum from primary consumers, including amphipods, copepods, and clams to trophic level five predators, such as seastars, piscivorous fishes, seals, and seabirds. The relative contribution of the three primary producer end members, terrestrial organic matter (41 +/- 21%), phytoplankton (25 +/- 21%), and phytobenthos (34 +/- 23%) varied as a function of: 1) consumer foraging ecology and 2) consumer location. Suspension feeders received most of their carbon from food webs based on phytoplankton (49 +/- 11%) and terrestrial organic matter (23 +/- 5%), whereas herbivores and detritivores received the majority of their carbon from phytobenthos-based food webs, 58 +/- 10% and 60 +/- 8%, respectively. Omnivores and predators showed more even distributions of resource reliance and greater overall variance among species. Within the invertebrates, the importance of terrestrial organic matter decreased and phytobenthos increased with increasing trophic position. The importance of terrestrial organic matter contribution increased with lagoon proximity to major rivers inputs and isolation from Kotzebue Sound. Several taxa with cultural and subsistence food importance to local communities showed significant reliance (30-90% of baseline carbon) on food chains linked to fresh terrestrial organic matter. Our study indicates that terrestrial-marine linkages are important to the function of Arctic coastal lagoon ecosystems and artisanal fisheries. These linkages are likely to strengthen in the future with regional changes in erosion and runoff associated with climate change and anthropogenic disturbance.

AB  - Objective Trueperella pyogenes has been considered a major causative agent of metritis, abortion, and death in a broad range of domestic and wild animals, including cattle, swine, sheep, goats, camels, buffalo, deer, antelopes, reptiles, and birds. Data description Here, we report the complete chromosome sequence of Trueperella pyogenes strain Arash114, isolated from the uterus of a water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) died due to the infection caused by this pathogen. The genome assembly comprised 2,338,282 bp, with a 59.5% GC content. Annotation of the genome showed 46 tRNA genes, 6 rRNA, 1 CRISPR and 2059 coding sequences. Also, several genes coding for antimicrobial resistance such as tetW and virulence factor including plo, nanH, nanP, cbp and 4 fimbrial proteins were found. This study will advance our knowledge regarding the metabolism, virulence factors, antibiotic resistance and evolution of Arash114 strain and serve as an appropriate template for future researches.

AB  - Tasmanian eucalypt forests are among the most carbon-dense in the world, but projected climate change could destabilize this critical carbon sink. While the impact of abiotic factors on forest ecosystem carbon dynamics have received considerable attention, biotic factors such as the input of animal scat are less understood. Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii)-an osteophageous scavenger that can ingest and solubilize nutrients locked in bone material-may subsidize plant and microbial productivity by concentrating bioavailable nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) in scat latrines. However, dramatic declines in devil population densities, driven by the spread of a transmissible cancer, may have underappreciated consequences for soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and forest productivity by altering nutrient cycling. Here, we fuse experimental data and modeling to quantify and predict future changes to forest productivity and SOC under various climate and scat-quality futures. We find that devil scat significantly increases concentrations of nitrogen, ammonium, phosphorus, and phosphate in the soil and shifts soil microbial communities toward those dominated by r-selected (e.g., fast-growing) phyla. Further, under expected increases in temperature and changes in precipitation, devil scat inputs are projected to increase above- and below-ground net primary productivity and microbial biomass carbon through 2100. In contrast, when devil scat is replaced by lower-quality scat (e.g., from non-osteophageous scavengers and herbivores), forest carbon pools are likely to increase more slowly, or in some cases, decline. Together, our results suggest often overlooked biotic factors will interact with climate change to drive current and future carbon pool dynamics in Tasmanian forests.
   Tasmanian devils are endangered scavengers that concentrate nutrients in their scat, potentially contributing to ecosystem functioning in ways that herbivorous species cannot. Here, we fuse experimental data and modeling approaches to predict changes to forest productivity and carbon dynamics under future scenarios including the extinction of Tasmanian devils and novel climate conditions. We find that under the most likely future climate scenarios, the long-term sequestration of carbon in Tasmanian eucalypt forests could be imperiled without conservation strategies that protect Tasmanian devil populations.image

AB  - In extensive livestock ranching, where animals are maintained at high numbers, competition between individuals is expected, but not generally assumed. To compensate for reduced food availability, herbivores modify their feeding behaviour, which can be used as an indicator of competition. We investigated behavioural changes of domestic sheep in Chilean Patagonia in response to herd size, food availability, and the presence of a wild competitor, the guanaco, considered a problem for sheep production by ranchers. Large sheep herds were associated with a decrease in sheep grazing, while food availability increased time spent feeding. Guanaco had no effect on sheep behaviours. Behavioural changes were mostly associated with competition between individual sheep and not with guanaco. We suggest that to improve sheep production, ranchers should focus on sheep management at appropriate herd sizes according to grassland capacities.
   In extensive livestock production, high densities may inhibit regulation processes, maintaining high levels of intraspecific competition over time. During competition, individuals typically modify their behaviours, particularly feeding and bite rates, which can therefore be used as indicators of competition. Over eight consecutive seasons, we investigated if variation in herd density, food availability, and the presence of a potential competitor, the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), was related with behavioural changes in domestic sheep in Chilean Patagonia. Focal sampling, instantaneous scan sampling, measures of bite and movement rates were used to quantify behavioural changes in domestic sheep. We found that food availability increased time spent feeding, while herd density was associated with an increase in vigilant behaviour and a decrease in bite rate, but only when food availability was low. Guanaco presence appeared to have no impact on sheep behaviour. Our results suggest that the observed behavioural changes in domestic sheep are more likely due to intraspecific competition rather than interspecific competition. Consideration of intraspecific competition where guanaco and sheep co-graze on pastures could allow management strategies to focus on herd density, according to rangeland carrying capacity.

AB  - 1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Ceratonia siliqua L. (Carob) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the International Biological Flora: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Ceratonia siliqua is a lowland evergreen shrub or tree, native around the Mediterranean basin and widely cultivated in areas with a warm temperate and subtropical climate, with more than 100 named cultivars. Carob grows on a wide range of soils including nutrient-poor and strongly calcareous, dry soils. 3. Carob is dioecious or rarely hermaphrodite although females dominate in cultivation due to their fruit. Pollination is primarily by insects and the relatively large seeds are spread mainly by ingestion of fruits by mammals. Seed dormancy is imposed by a hard seed coat and seeds germinate readily after natural or artificial scarification. 4. Drought tolerance is very high, acting as a drought avoiding water spender. Carob is also very tolerant of saline conditions and tolerant of fire and can act to restrict wildfire spread by generating fuel discontinuity. It shows high post-fire regrowth. Old individuals house a diversity of associated fauna and are comparatively unaffected by serious pests and diseases. 5. Carob has a long cultural history around the Mediterranean as a food source for humans and domesticated animals, in herbal and modern medicine and, more recently, for the carob bean gum used in a variety of domestic products and foods. Commercial production of fruits has declined over past decades but the low cultural care needed in growing orchards, potential new markets for fruit and seeds, and growing use of the tree to prevent soil erosion and sequester carbon gives carob a brighter future.

AB  - Simple Summary Unseasonably early blizzards in the northern Great Plains of the U.S. threaten large mammal populations unacclimated for winter conditions. This region averaged 22 blizzards per winter season during the 2010s and is anticipated to have 32 by the 2050s. Generally, expected weather-related deaths remain one of the highest non-predatory mortality causes for beef cattle and sheep at 16% for each species. But, for horses, expected weather-related deaths are correlated with colic, which represents 31% of equine mortality. For bison, expected weather-related deaths remain below 11%. However, in an early October 2013 blizzard that occurred across 16 counties of western South Dakota, the observed death loss of cattle was 223 times above expected background death loss, sheep were 63 times above expected, horses were 44 times above expected, and bison were 6.7 times above expected. Increased blizzard frequency in the future may threaten domestic ungulate populations in the northern Great Plains, but native ungulates may be well adapted to highly variable climates. For conservation and production systems, building adaptive capacity to support climate-resilient species will reduce losses economically and ecologically. Although similar mortality data for wildlife species other than bison are lacking, it seems plausible that other wildlife may share similar resilient traits to extreme weather events. Ranching bison may provide a ranch-scale alternative pathway for increasing red meat production resiliency in the face of climate change. Unseasonably early blizzards in the northern Great Plains threaten large mammal populations unacclimated for variable and extreme winter conditions. This region averaged 22 blizzards per winter season during the 2010s, up from 6 during the 1960s, and is anticipated to average 32 blizzards by the 2050s. In early October 2013, the fatal Atlas Blizzard affected four livestock and captive species in 16 counties of western South Dakota. Expected one-week total death losses for the study area were estimated from national average background mortality rates: 161 cattle, 102 sheep, 9 horses, and 6 bison. However, observed death loss varied significantly (McNemar's Test: p < 0.001) from the expected during the blizzard with: 35,682 cattle; 6428 sheep; 400 horses; and 40 bison. Observed proportional mortalities varied significantly from the expected proportional mortalities in cattle (83.9% vs. 58.0%); sheep (15.1% vs. 36.7%); horse (0.9% vs. 3.2%); and bison (0.1% vs. 2.1%; chi-squared goodness-of-fit: chi(2)(3) = 16.85, p <= 0.001). Husbandry practices, animal behavior, and physiology may also explain some of the inequitable death losses for each species. Bison appear to be resilient to blizzards and blizzards are expected to increase due to climate change, therefore, bison may offer viability for ranchers in the face of blizzards and more variable weather.

AB  - Coppice forests are socio-ecological systems especially rich in biodiversity. They have been transformed into high forest and abandoned across large areas of Europe over the past 200 years. Coppice loss is likely an important driver of insect declines. It is currently unclear whether habitat quality or decreasing connectivity of the remaining fragments is more important for the survival of insect populations. We related the abundance of two coppice-associated butterflies of conservation concern, Satyrium ilicis and Melitaea athalia, to indicators of habitat quality and habitat connectivity. We estimated butterfly densities using Distance Sampling along a successional gradient (time since last cut: 1-9 years; N = 130 plots) across one of the largest remaining simple oak-birch coppice landscapes in Central Europe. Both species reached abundance peaks within four to six years after the last cut, declining rapidly in abundance with subsequent succession. We found no evidence that coupe size, coppice availability and patch (= coupe) connectivity were related to the density of the species. Besides stand age, the cover of larval foodplants explained predicted butterfly densities well. Only Satyrium ilicis benefitted from high Red Deer densities.Implications for insect conservation: Our results suggest that habitat quality and sufficient availability of coppice of suitable age matters more than coupe size and fragmentation within a traditional managed coppice landscape. Coppice restoration aiming at the study species should ensure a shifting mosaic of successional habitat to provide a large availability of resprouting oak stools and bilberry vegetation that holds dense Melampyrum pratense stands.

AB  - Human activities shape the structure of landscapes in different ways and hence modify animal communities depending on the type and intensity of these activities. The Montes de Maria subregion of Colombia has experienced a heavy transformation of most areas despite covering one of the last remnants of dry forest, a critically endangered ecosystem. However, the effects of this transformation have been little explored. Here, we used a multispecies occupancy model (MSOM) to understand the relative influence of three components of land-use change - deforestation (remaining forest amount), degradation of forest integrity (forest quality) and fragmentation (landscape configuration) on mammalian habitat use across a mosaic of tropical dry forest in Colombia. Our data suggest that the percentage of forest cover was substantially important for herbivores, and consistently showed a moderate effect on the entire community and some individual species. High variability in species-specific responses to the examined variables hindered broad taxonomic generalizations, nevertheless, we detected a moderate positive effect of forest cover in both diet specialists and generalists species, as well as in species with small home ranges. Although omnivores responses, tended to use less complex landscapes (mosaics of land uses), there was high uncertainty in this response. The lack of substantial effects on most species, and the absence of threatened species across this anthropogenic landscape, suggests that the current community is composed of species tolerant to habitat modifications, but not only diet generalist species. This is most likely the result of a long filtering process caused by land use transformation and hunting which could have caused non-sensitive species to distribute relatively homogenously across this landscape. Our results suggest that conservation strategies in the study area should focus on conserving and expanding as much forest as possible rather than only improving the quality of already existing forest patches.

AB  - Climate warming allows generalist boreal consumers to expand into Arctic ecosystems. We present experimental and observational field data showing that a generalist boreal insect pest the winter moth (Operophtera brumata Linnaeus, 1758) is expanding its outbreak range out of the northern boreal mountain birch forest in northeast Fennoscandia and into the adjacent Low Arctic shrub tundra. This is the first documented example of an outbreaking boreal insect pest expanding into a tundra ecosystem. The expansion has coincided with a long-term advancing trend in the expected hatching date of moth eggs in spring for the study region. We show that the winter moth can complete development on Low Arctic willows and that the density of winter moth larvae in willow thickets is unrelated to the amount of mountain birch (the main host plant in northern boreal forest) in the thickets. However, we also demonstrate that larval densities on willows show a regional-scale spatial decline when moving away from the birch forest and into the shrub tundra. Continued monitoring is needed to establish whether the outbreaks will spread farther into the tundra. The expansion of outbreaking boreal pests into the tundra could alter conventional expectations of increasing vegetation productivity and shrubification in tundra ecosystems.

AB  - Introduction Terrestrial mammals play a pivotal role in tropical forest ecosystems, representing a rich and functionally diverse component of these biomes. However, they confront formidable threats globally, such as hunting, habitat loss, and fragmentation, amidst the expansion of human-altered landscapes in tropical regions. Understanding the impacts of these changes on mammal communities is crucial for designing effective conservation interventions. Northeast India's tropical forests, a biodiversity hotspot, host a diverse array of mammalian fauna. The primary challenge faced by these species involves anthropogenic activities leading to the shrinkage and fragmentation of forested habitats.Methodology In this study, we conducted systematic camera trapping in Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS) to assess mammal status and distribution. Employing single-season occupancy models, we evaluated factors influencing mammalian species' detection probability and spatial utilization within the landscape.Results The study documented 27 mammalian species, with 12 identified as "threatened" on the IUCN Red List. Species like clouded leopard, marbled cat, Gongshan muntjac, red goral, Mishmi takin, and sambar were recorded but observed infrequently. Notably, we reported the Asiatic brush-tailed porcupine's first sighting in Mehao. Our findings revealed that undisturbed forest habitats were preferred by all species. Mainland serow dominated most of the sanctuary's area, followed by northern red muntjac, yellow-throated marten, and masked palm civet.Discussion The response of mammalian species to ecological and anthropogenic covariates varied significantly, underscoring the necessity for species-specific management strategies alongside a landscape-scale conservation approach. These outcomes emphasize the urgency of managing and safeguarding rare and elusive mammalian species within and around Mehao WLS.

AB  - Algal blooms have profound impacts on freshwater ecosystems worldwide. This study investigates the dynamics of algal blooms in temporary wetlands within protected areas of northwestern Argentinean Patagonia. We characterised the algal community and biomass (measured by chlorophyll-a) in two wet meadows (Pitranto and Poza), assessing key environmental variables throughout the algal bloom. The blooms persisted from winter to early spring in 2023. Algal community composition varied between wetlands: at Pitranto, five green filamentous species, whereas at Poza, the community was primarily composed of the cyanobacterium Aphanocapsa sp., with a smaller proportion of filamentous algae. Excessive algal proliferation resulted in dense mats that blanketed the wetlands, attaching to vegetation and shading the water column, which, in turn, trapped macroinvertebrates within the mats. Cold winter temperatures triggered algal growth, and as water temperatures increased in early spring, the algae began to senesce. Chlorophyll-a concentrations and nutrient levels were lower than in previous years, likely due to nutrient depletion following efficient algal uptake. Sediment disturbance, exacerbated by invasive wild boar activity, may have altered nutrient dynamics and influenced algal blooms within these wetlands.

AB  - The natural regeneration of temperate forests is frequently depleted by anthropogenic practices such as overgrazing, excessive logging, and forest fires. In Mexico, biodiversity conservation is an important objective, although many small farmers who depend on native forest vegetation for extensive grazing to raise their herds. The objective of this work was to characterize the vegetation of the A. hickelii understory in Pico de Orizaba National Park and to evaluate the impact of sheep grazing on the regeneration and survival of A. hickelii seedlings on a temperate forest. Two experimental sites were established, one was used for natural regeneration and the other for transplanting of A. hickelii. Each site was divided into six paddocks, three for sheep grazing (a flock of nine lambs on rotational grazing for 134 days) and three ungrazed paddocks. Three cycles of grazing were carried out and in each of them the florist composition, the vegetation cover, the height of the seedlings, the number of terminal buds nibbled by the sheep, the number of dead trees and the body weight of the animals were measured. The impact of grazing on vegetation cover was significant (P < 0.05) in both sampling sites, going from 80 to 30% in the natural regeneration and transplanting of A. hickelii seedlings, respectively. There was a decrease in the number of herbaceous species present because of grazing in both experimental sites. However, the survival of A. hickelii seedlings was higher than 80% in both sampling sites and the dead trees did not show any physical damage due to the presence of the sheep herd. The lambs had daily weight gains of 63 g animal(-1) d(-1). In conclusion, the negative effects of sheep grazing on A. hickelii seedlings are low; therefore, it is feasible to promote silvopastoral systems with sheep in the temperate forests of A. hickelii.

AB  - Climate change-driven disturbances are reshaping ecosystems worldwide with profound implications for biodiversity. We leveraged a long-term dataset and a natural before-after-control-impact experimental framework to evaluate the impacts of wildfire and concurrent drought on jaguars and the terrestrial mammal community in northern Pantanal. Using camera traps and jaguar scats collected before, during, and after a large wildfire, we (1) assessed the immediate and short-term impacts of fire on jaguar demography, abundance, activity, space use, and diet; (2) determined whether changes in mammal species richness and relative abundance occurred; (3) assessed whether these changes were driven by fire, drought, or both; and (4) tested competing hypotheses regarding community structure. We hypothesized that abundant aquatic prey either allow jaguars to suppress terrestrial herbivores through apparent competition, or alternatively, terrestrial mammals are released from predation and instead regulated by bottom-up resources. We found that jaguar activity initially declined post-fire but rebounded over time, with a significant increase in abundance and recruitment 1 year post-fire. Annual recapture rates of individual jaguars remained similar after fire, indicating that resident jaguars survived the fires and maintained their home ranges, whereas a large number of immigrants arrived from other areas. Mammal species richness and relative abundance increased across the study period and were more strongly correlated with drought-induced changes than with fire-related impacts. Jaguars maintained their specialization on aquatic prey, supporting the hypothesis that consumption of aquatic prey reduces predation pressure on terrestrial mammals. Our findings suggest this area may serve as a climate refuge for jaguars and other wildlife, providing stability amid extreme climatic events. We emphasize the importance of maintaining such refugia and implementing proactive fire management to mitigate future disturbances.

AB  - Ungulates consume plants and seeds together with the insects that feed on them, which have consequences at the ecosystem level. We carried out an experiment to assess the effects of intraguild predation by livestock on the main acorn pest (Curculio spp. weevils) in Iberian oak Quercus spp. dehesas, a widespread traditional agroecosystem. Acorns are a key food source for free-range livestock (especially pigs), but, if properly managed, livestock could become a pest control agent. In three dehesa farms, we replicated eight experimental trios, each including one tree from which livestock was excluded, another from which all dropped acorns were removed manually (simulating intensified predation by livestock), and a control one in which livestock was allowed at standard densities. Removal of marked infested acorns by livestock, adult and larval weevil numbers, and acorn production/infestation rates were recorded at all trees. Livestock predated most weevil larvae within the prematurely dropped infested acorns before larvae had time to finish development. Hence, in those trees subjected to intensified predation, the local number of larvae decreased. Consequently, adult weevil abundance in the following year was lower than in trees within the exclosures of livestock. The consequence of the decrease in the number of adults was a reduction in the rates of acorn infestation in control oaks and intensified predation compared to those excluded from livestock (8% and 20%, respectively). C. elephas mobility is low, especially when trees are isolated, and acorn infestation is greatly dependent on the number of weevils emerging beneath the canopy of each oak. Therefore, a locally focused elimination of infested acorns may succeed in reducing the negative impacts of the pest. Synthesis and applications: We suggest intensifying livestock predation on prematurely dropped-infested acorns by allowing livestock foraging from October 1st onward. Pigs are usually released free range in early November, once weevil larvae have completed their development and escaped predation. The proposed management would increase the availability of healthy acorns, thus increasing the farm capacity and the economic profit by up to 20%, tens of millions of euros of additional profits when translated into the prices of the Iberian pork market.

AB  - Pleistocene glaciations had profound impact on the spatial distribution and genetic makeup of species in temperate ecosystems. While the glacial period trapped several species into glacial refugia and caused abrupt decline in large populations, the interglacial period facilitated population growth and range expansion leading to allopatric speciation. Here, we analyzed 40 genomes of four species of ibex and found that Himalayan ibex in the Pamir Mountains evolved independently after splitting from its main range about 0.1 mya following the Pleistocene species pump concept. Demographic trajectories showed Himalayan ibex experienced two historic bottlenecks, one each c. 0.8-0.5 mya and c. 50-30 kya, with an intermediate large population expansion c. 0.2-0.16 mya coinciding with Mid-Pleistocene Transitions. We substantiate with multi-dimensional evidence that Himalayan ibex is an evolutionary distinct phylogenetic species of Siberian ibex which need to be prioritized as Capra himalayensis for taxonomic revision and conservation planning at a regional and global scale.

AB  - Linear disturbances from geological exploration (i.e., seismic lines) have an extensive footprint across much of Canada's western boreal forest; however, how seismic lines interact with subsequent wildfire remains poorly understood. We assessed whether wildfires effectively mitigate the footprint of seismic lines by promoting forest recovery. We evaluated the forest structure of legacy seismic lines burned in 2001 and 2002 by comparing them against adjacent unburned control plots, using metrics derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data collected between 2007 and 2009. ALS metrics identified persistent differences in vegetation height and structure between seismic lines and adjacent forest controls, 7-9 years post-fire. Median canopy height was 2.90 m lower on upland seismic lines and 1.94 m lower on lowland seismic lines than on adjacent controls, corresponding to a 21% and 25% height reduction, respectively. Field surveys revealed greater graminoid and nonvascular plant cover, and lower tall-tree cover and dead vegetative matter, on seismic lines, in comparison with controls. Our results show that tree recovery remains significantly delayed on most upland and lowland burned seismic lines in our study area, and that additional management efforts or longer timescales may be required to restore these fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Genetic diversity is key for species' resistance (enabling them to endure disturbances with little alteration) and resilience (recovering swiftly to their original state or a similar condition). The prevailing view in population genetics is that species attempt to avoid the harms of inbreeding. We speculate that sometimes individuals do not reject mating requests from relatives when choosing mates. Moose (Alces alces cameloides) in the Greater Khingan Mountains (GKM) of China is a first-class key protected species. It represents the southernmost distribution of moose globally and serves as a thermosensitive species of global significance. Based on the state of moose in China, we used a non-invasive sampling method to conduct a series of studies on genetic diversity and inbreeding. The mitochondrial and nuclear genetic diversity of moose in this area are at a moderately high level worldwide, with good individual genetic quality, a high level of overall genotype heterozygosity. The Bayesian gene flow level indicates gene exchange between local populations. Molecular pedigrees revealed instances where individuals mated with their offspring or even grandchildren. The relatedness coefficient (r) between moose mating pairs were significantly higher than those of random mating. Therefore, there is no evidence that individuals in the GKM avoid inbreeding, and under these circumstances, there has not been a negative impact on genetic diversity of the moose population, as well as the genetic quality and genotype heterozygosity of offspring. In the context of future climate change and human activities, we need to closely monitor the long-term impact of this mating choice on the survival of the GKM moose population and promptly develop corresponding conservation and management strategies.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) enhance the quality of life in urban environments and serve as habitat corridors or refuge for organisms, including beetles and spiders. The attributes of UGS allow them to harbour species that offer essential ecosystem services. However, the ability of UGS to provide services is limited by the extent to which they have been altered anthropogenically. We described the taxonomic richness and functional composition of arthropods in a mountainous urban ecosystem of Ghana by focussing on the activity of both beetles and spiders at the family level. Two main land-use types (woodlands and built-up areas) were identified and characterised based on the presence or absence of certain vegetation attributes. Sixteen plots in each land-use type with sizes 20 x 20 m were demarcated and fitted with four pitfall traps in each plot to sample continuously for eight weeks, the activity density of both beetles and spiders. Samples were sorted into families and functional groups (detritivores, fungivores, herbivory and predators). The taxonomic richness and activity density were both significantly higher in the woodlands than in the built-up areas. Similarly, all functional groups showed a higher affinity to the woodlands than the built-up areas. Habitat attributes defined by plant diversity and structural complexity were the underlying drivers explaining the differences in arthropod communities between the land-use types. Though the built-up areas seem degraded and open, the remaining small vegetation patches still support the activities of some taxa that should merit the protection of such remnant vegetation in urban ecosystems.

AB  - Several caribou (Rangifer tarandus) populations co-occur with endemic or introduced populations of muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), which has led to concerns about the potential competition between the species, especially in regions where the growth of muskoxen populations coincides with caribou declines. We evaluated the potential for competition between migratory caribou and an introduced muskoxen population in northern Quebec, Canada, at multiple spatial scales, from 2017 to 2019. We investigated space use and habitat selection patterns of satellite-collared caribou and muskoxen, and analyzed fecal samples using DNA metabarcoding to assess diet overlap. Annual overlap between ranges was low and occurred primarily during caribou spring migrations on the coast of Hudson Bay, and during summer on the coast of Ungava Bay. During spring, muskoxen selected shrub-dominated areas close to the coast, whereas caribou selected rock-substrate tundra and low elevations within their overlapping ranges. Thus, co-occurrence was low and remained limited to the vicinity of the Hudson Bay. In summer, muskoxen selected productive coastal areas and caribou selected erect-shrub tundra; both species selected prostrate-shrub tundra. This led to a higher co-occurrence in the Ungava Bay study area relative to the Hudson Bay study area. We found similarities in the diets of the 2 species at the plant family level, with shrubs being commonly consumed by both species across seasons. We conclude that, at a broad spatial scale, there was limited potential for seasonal space use and diet overlap between caribou and muskoxen in our study area. Still, multiple sources of uncertainty remain such as local impacts of herbivory by muskoxen, demographic and distribution patterns of both species, trophic interactions with predators, shared diseases and parasites, and climate change. These sources of uncertainty could be mitigated through the elaboration of local management plans and community-based monitoring.

AB  - Questions Woody-shrub encroachment affects community structure and composition. However, most studies focus on their effects on understorey plant communities, and the relative importance of shrubs in affecting plants vs soil biota communities is poorly known. Location Inner Mongolian Steppe, China. Methods We examined the effect of shrubs on multiple community attributes, including plants, soil biota (bacteria, fungi and nematodes), and soil fertility, and quantified how these effects changed from semi-arid to hyperarid conditions (from 281 mm to 110 mm of mean annual precipitation). In addition, we assessed whether the effects of shrubs on plant communities were directly mediated by biotic filtering in seed germination and establishment, or indirectly mediated by plant biomass or soil fertility in the case of soil organisms. Results The effect of shrubs on soil biota was generally more positive than on plants, and it increased with aridity. We found that a larger proportion of below-ground taxa depended on shrub presence (36%) than plants (20%). Soil nematodes and soil bacteria were directly influenced by shrub presence whereas soil fungi were indirectly influenced by enhanced soil fertility. Shrubs also increased plant biomass under all conditions but only increased plant species richness in the most arid conditions. Despite the generally positive effect of shrubs, and the fact that they weakened the filtering effects of aridity on seed germination, aridity was a stronger predictor of changes in species composition than shrub presence was, particularly for plants. Conclusions Our results illustrate the variety of positive effects of shrubs and show that they are particularly important in supporting biodiversity in the most arid conditions. These strong and positive effects could partially buffer the impacts of increasing aridity on dryland soil biodiversity, but our study suggests that facilitative interactions may not be able to completely mitigate the impacts of increasing aridity on drylands.

AB  - Climate change has intensified the need for robust fire prevention strategies. Sustainable forest fuel management is crucial in mitigating the occurrence and rapid spread of forest fires. This study assessed the impact of vegetation clearing and/or grazing over a three-year period in the herbaceous and shrub parts of a Mediterranean oak forest. Using high-resolution multispectral data from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), four flight surveys were conducted from 2019 (pre- and post-clearing) to 2021. These data were used to evaluate different scenarios: combined vegetation clearing and grazing, the individual application of each method, and a control scenario that was neither cleared nor purposely grazed. The UAV data allowed for the detailed monitoring of vegetation dynamics, enabling the classification into arboreal, shrubs, herbaceous, and soil categories. Grazing pressure was estimated through GPS collars on the sheep flock. Additionally, a good correlation (r = 0.91) was observed between UAV-derived vegetation volume estimates and field measurements. These practices proved to be efficient in fuel management, with cleared and grazed areas showing a lower vegetation regrowth, followed by areas only subjected to vegetation clearing. On the other hand, areas not subjected to any of these treatments presented rapid vegetation growth.

AB  - Cryptogams, often neglected in vegetation dynamics studies, compose a large part of biomass and contribute to the biodiversity of sandy grasslands. Since the work of Verseghy (1970s), their productivity has not been analyzed in Hungary. We studied the lichen and bryophyte dynamics (hereinafter called cryptogams) at two Eastern Hungarian dry sandy grassland sites. The sites of Corynephorus canescens and of Festuca vaginata dominance, respectively, belonging to the community Festuco vaginatae-Corynephoretum have been monitored. We aimed at (1) quantifying the diversity and biomass of the cryptogamic communities; (2) exploring the cryptogamic response to management changes; and (3) studying the effect of experimental management (fencing) on the cryptogamic assemblages. The sites have been compared in 2013 and 2018, respectively. Forty microplots per site per management have been analyzed in both years. Samples of lichens and bryophytes were hand-sorted, dried and then measured. Fencing has led to increased biomass of cryptogams within a few years. Lichens in general benefited comparatively more from exclosure than bryophytes. The increase in lichen biomass (especially that of Cladonia rangiformis) is clearly due to the over 10-year absence of grazing. The only lichen favored by moderate grazing is the legally protected C. magyarica. Short spells of low-intensity grazing can promote the species richness of cryptogams in the community.

AB  - In peri-urban areas, many farmers are transitioning from conventional agriculture to agroecological practices to reduce pesticide input and preserving ecosystem services such as natural pest control. Field margins represent a stable habitat for arthropods, but community structure depends on many factors, including management type and vegetation features.We studied the effects of agroecological transitions and vegetation features on arthropods of horticultural field margins, focusing on three feeding guilds (herbivores, predators and parasitoids). We sampled arthropods using the beat-sheet method in five conventional fields and five under agroecological transition. We also measured vegetation height, richness, flower abundance and plant cover.Our results showed that arthropod diversity was higher in agroecological fields whereas herbivore abundance was lower, with a consistent pattern across most taxonomic orders. Vegetation features displayed multiple effects among functional and taxonomic groups. Herbivores did not respond to most vegetation variables whereas predators correlated with several, with similar trends among orders.We conclude that agroecological transitions and field margins with high vegetation richness and floral resources influence arthropod communities with potential benefits regarding pest regulation. These practices might be more effective if considered alongside other methods that enhance biodiversity and if they are consistent at a landscape scale.

AB  - Questions Regeneration success of semi-arid and arid regions worldwide is episodic and often linked to large rainfall events in consecutive years. It is also influenced by past and current land use, seed availability and herbivore grazing. This is particularly true for four dominant canopy trees - Allocasuarina luehmannii (Buloke), Casuarina pauper (Belah), Callitris gracilis (Slender Cypress Pine) and Myoporum platycarpum (Sugarwood) - within southeastern Australia semi-arid woodlands. These species also apply hedge-betting when responding to resource pulses with mass germination while low-level background recruitment continues. We asked if drought-breaking rainfall stimulated a germination pulse of these species and if it did, how did other external factors (grazing pressure from rabbits/hares, seed source, suitable seedbed) influence seedling abundance. We also asked if evidence of continuous recruitment had occurred during 14 years of drought by exploring trends in juvenile abundance. Location Victorian Mallee semi-arid woodlands, southeastern Australia. Methods We recorded seedling and juvenile abundance of the four dominant canopy species at 310 1-ha sites within semi-arid woodlands. Seedling presence was explored in relation to rainfall, tree density, ground cover and herbivory. Juvenile presence was explored in relation to rainfall, seedling and tree density, total plant cover and herbivory. Results Seedling and juvenile abundance were positively correlated with more mature trees, higher rainfall and no herbivory. Juvenile abundance was also positively correlated with more seedlings. There were more seedlings and juveniles at sites where rabbits/hares were present. Conclusions Above-average rainfall was positively correlated with initiation of recruitment; however, there was limited net recruitment of the four dominant canopy species indicating other factors are influencing germination (e.g. seed viability) or that seedlings are not surviving. The long-term survival of these semi-arid woodlands is in jeopardy without a concerted effort to maintain and improve their condition through revegetation works, weed removal and herbivore management.

AB  - Most research on boreal populations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) has been conducted in areas of high anthropogenic disturbance. However, a large portion of the species' range overlaps relatively pristine areas primarily affected by natural disturbances, such as wildfire. Climate-driven habitat change is a key concern for the conservation of boreal-dependent species, where management decisions have yet to consider knowledge from multiple ecological domains integrated into a cohesive and spatially explicit forecast of species-specific habitat and demography. We used a novel ecological forecasting framework to provide climate-sensitive projections of habitat and demography for five boreal caribou monitoring areas within the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, over 90 years. Importantly, we quantify uncertainty around forecasted mean values. Our results suggest habitat suitability may increase in central and southwest regions of the NWT's Taiga Plains ecozone but decrease in southern and northwestern regions driven by conversion of coniferous to deciduous forests. We do not project that boreal caribou population growth rates will change despite forecasted changes to habitat suitability. Our results emphasize the importance of efforts to protect and restore northern boreal caribou habitat despite climate uncertainty while highlighting expected spatial variations that are important considerations for local people who rely on them. An ability to reproduce previous work, and critical thought when incorporating sources of uncertainty, will be important to refine forecasts, derive management decisions, and improve conservation efficacy for northern species at risk.

AB  - Given the vulnerability of large and medium-sized mammal communities to climate change and human disturbances, understanding the spatial-temporal dynamics of these communities is essential for effective conservation planning. However, in many biodiversity hotspots, precise biological community assessments are insufficient. From 2012 to 2022, we deployed 784 camera traps in eight nature reserves (including sub-reserves) and one State Forest Farm (SFF, less strictly protected than a reserve) to study the composition and distribution of large and medium-sized mammals in tropical Xishuangbanna. The findings revealed the following: (1) Forty-three species, encompassing six orders, 17 families, and 37 genera, were documented. Among the species in historical data, nine species were not detected in this survey. (2) Smaller and more fragmented reserves lacked larger body-sized predators and herbivores, and most common species showed lower relative population abundance. Conversely, the SFF exhibited high mammal diversity. (3) The community composition of large and medium-sized mammals varied significantly across the nine sites, particularly among threatened species. Our findings highlight the uneven distribution of these mammal communities in Xishuangbanna, with rare and large-sized species facing increased vulnerability to rapid environmental changes. Moreover, the findings demonstrate the importance of considering species specificity and uniqueness in conservation planning for maintaining regional-scale biodiversity.

AB  - Potentilla fruticosa, a major alpine shrubland type, is widely distributed across the Tibetan Plateau, and grazing is the most common disturbance in the shrublands of P. fruticosa. However, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (STN), soil total phosphorus (STP), and their stoichiometry under different grazing intensities were unclear. In our study, we explored SOC, STN, STP, their stoichiometry, and their controlling factors in the grazing disturbance of heavy grazing (HG), moderate grazing (MG), light grazing (LG), and no grazing (NG) conditions in the Tibetan Plateau P. fruticosa shrublands. The grazing intensities were mainly assessed by considering the shrublands' ground cover, the indicators of the road density, the distance between sampling sites and cowshed or sheep shed, the amounts of cow and sheep dung, and vegetation that had been gnawed and stampeded. Our results indicated that soil physical properties of soil temperature and bulk density have decreasing trends with decreasing grazing intensities from HG to NG. The SOC, STN, STP, and soil C:N and C:P ratios have increasing trends with decreasing grazing intensities from HG to NG, while the changes in soil N:P ratio were relatively stable along grazing intensities. Our results indicated that HG generally had stronger effects on SOC, STN, and soil C:N and C:P ratios than NG, indicating substantial effects of grazing disturbance on biogeochemical cycles of SOC and STN in the shrubland ecosystems. Therefore, for the alpine shrubland of P. fruticosa, the HG should be avoided for sustainable cycling of soil nutrients and the balance of soil nutrient stoichiometry. The grazing types can directly affect plant conditions, and plant conditions can directly affect soil physical and chemical properties and litter standing crops. Finally, soil physicochemical properties and litter standing crop resulting from different grazing intensities directly control SOC, STN, and STP. For the soil stoichiometry, the soil's physical and chemical properties resulting from different grazing intensities have direct impacts on soil C:P and N:P ratios.

AB  - Climate change is predicted to increase the intensity and frequency of weather extremes (e.g., extreme heat and drought), which will likely affect wildlife species in significant ways. Maintaining landscape heterogeneity has been suggested as a potential conservation strategy to buffer animals from weather extremes. Because animal movement influences survival and population connectivity, understanding animal space use and movement in response to shifts in weather is useful for the conservation of wildlife. Nonmigratory species are predicted to be more negatively affected by climate change because they have a limited ability to disperse to find resources. We studied the Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter, bobwhite) to understand how weather alters habitat use and movement of a nonmigratory animal across a landscape. We collected telemetry locations on bobwhite across western Oklahoma during 2019-2020 and paired these data with meteorological and vegetation data. We analyzed the data at two temporal scales-hourly locations and 12-h paths. At the hourly scale, we analyzed tree cover use, shrub cover use, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) use using generalized or linear-mixed models. At the 12-h scale, we calculated three different movement metrics: cumulative distance, net displacement, sinuosity and analyzed each movement metric separately using generalized linear-mixed models. We found that bobwhite used denser tree cover and higher NDVI values as air temperature increased in conjunction with solar radiation. Bobwhite used denser shrub cover as air temperature increased and average wind speed was high as well as when air temperature and average wind speed were low. The interaction between variability in vegetation and climate influenced bobwhite movement. Bobwhite in areas with higher NDVI variance moved farther when mean air temperatures were > 0? than bobwhite in areas with low NDVI variance. When mean air temperatures were <= 0?, NDVI variance had little effect on the cumulative distance moved of bobwhite. Our findings show that some animals use different vegetation types during different weather conditions and that variability in vegetation on the landscape and weather together alters animal movement. Managing for landscape heterogeneity is a solution that may buffer animals from increased climate variability in the future.

AB  - Coastal biological invasions pose a wide-reaching threat to various ecosystems, affecting both vegetation and herbivores in native communities. Although herbivores often exert strong top-down control on vegetation, the impact of invasive species on consumers that strongly regulate native species in invaded ecosystems remains unclear. Therefore, through field surveys and feeding preference experiments, this study examined the effects of the invasive Spartina alterniflora Loisel. (hereafter, Spartina) on the native moth Laelia coenosa H & uuml;bner (hereafter, Laelia), a notorious pest that has been documented to cause significant damage to native Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. (hereafter, Phragmites) marshes in coastal wetlands of China. Field surveys showed that Laelia larvae were more abundant and had higher grazing rates in Phragmites than in Spartina marshes in summer, but these patterns reversed in autumn. Feeding experiments consistently showed that the dietary preference of Laelia larvae switched from Phragmites in summer to Spartina in autumn, likely because Spartina has a longer growing season and relatively higher nutritional quality than Phragmites in autumn. Thus, by providing shelters (i.e., dietary sources and habitats) during unfavorable seasons, Spartina invasions may facilitate this insect pest Laelia and potentially amplify its damage to native wetland vegetation. Our work reveals a novel, indirect mechanism of coastal invasion impacts and highlights the importance of incorporating seasonal variation in plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Forest management, especially understory vegetation conversion, significantly affects soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and soil C and N pools. However, it remains unclear what effect renovating understory vegetation has on GHG emissions and soil C and N pools in plantations. This study investigates the impact of renovating understory vegetation on these factors in Chinese hickory (Carya cathayensis Sarg) plantation forests. Different understory renovation modes were used in a 12-month field experiment: a safflower camellia (SC) (Camellia chekiangoleosa Hu) planting density of 600 plants ha-1 and wild rape (WR) (Brassica napus L.) strip sowing (UM1); SC 600 plants ha-1 and WR scatter sowing (UM2); SC 1200 plants ha-1 and WR strip sowing (UM3); SC 1200 plants ha-1 and WR scatter sowing (UM4); and removal of the understory vegetation layer (CK). The results showed that understory vegetation modification significantly increased soil CO2 and emission fluxes and decreased soil CH4 uptake fluxes (p < 0.01). The understory vegetation transformation significantly improved soil labile carbon and labile nitrogen pools (p < 0.01). This study proposes that understory vegetation conversion can bolster soil carbon sinks, preserve soil fertility, and advance sustainable development of Chinese hickory plantation forests.

AB  - The extinction of 80% of megaherbivore (>1,000 kg) species towards the end of the Pleistocene altered vegetation structure, fire dynamics and nutrient cycling world-wide. Ecologists have proposed (re)introducing megaherbivores or their ecological analogues to restore lost ecosystem functions and reinforce extant but declining megaherbivore populations. However, the effects of megaherbivores on smaller herbivores are poorly understood. We used long-term exclusion experiments and multispecies hierarchical models fitted to dung counts to test (a) the effect of megaherbivores (elephant and giraffe) on the occurrence (dung presence) and use intensity (dung pile density) of mesoherbivores (2-1,000 kg), and (b) the extent to which the responses of each mesoherbivore species was predictable based on their traits (diet and shoulder height) and phylogenetic relatedness. Megaherbivores increased the predicted occurrence and use intensity of zebras but reduced the occurrence and use intensity of several other mesoherbivore species. The negative effect of megaherbivores on mesoherbivore occurrence was stronger for shorter species, regardless of diet or relatedness. Megaherbivores substantially reduced the expected total use intensity (i.e. cumulative dung density of all species) of mesoherbivores, but only minimally reduced the expected species richness (i.e. cumulative predicted occurrence probabilities of all species) of mesoherbivores (by <1 species). Simulated extirpation of megaherbivores altered use intensity by mesoherbivores, which should be considered during (re)introductions of megaherbivores or their ecological proxies. Species' traits (in this case shoulder height) may be more reliable predictors of mesoherbivores' responses to megaherbivores than phylogenetic relatedness, and may be useful for predicting responses of data-limited species.

AB  - Insect outbreaks are major drivers of natural disturbances in forest ecosystems. Outbreaks can have both direct and indirect effects on the composition of soil arthropod communities through canopy opening, nutrient addition and predator-prey interactions. In this study, we aimed to understand the effects of forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria; FTC) outbreaks through cascading effects on ant communities in both temperate and boreal forests in Canada. Pitfall traps and Berlese funnels were used to compare the ant communities, as well as the surrounding arthropod communities, between control and outbreak sites in boreal and temperate forests (in Quebec, Canada). Using the Sorensen dissimilarity index, we determined the alpha and beta diversity of the ant community. Other arthropods collected in the traps were counted to evaluate the richness and abundance of potential prey for the ants and other potential predators of the FTC. We used an indicator species analysis to examine the species associated with sites defoliated by the outbreak. In the boreal forest, we found that FTC outbreaks caused decreases in species richness and increases in the evenness of ant communities in defoliated sites. In the boreal forest sites, species composition varied significantly between control and outbreak sites. This pattern was driven in part by the presence of other predators. A similar, but weaker pattern was observed in the temperate forest. We saw no changes in the beta diversity in the boreal forest, but did see a significant decrease in the temperate forest between the outbreak sites and the control sites. Ant species in the boreal forest tended to exhibit a more marked preference for either control or previously defoliated sites than species in the temperate forest. Our study showed that disturbances such as insect outbreaks can drive changes in the ant community. While we saw small effects of outbreaks, manipulation experiments using resource addition could help us validate the mechanisms behind these relationships.

AB  - There is mounting evidence that terrestrial arthropods are declining rapidly in many areas of the world. It is unclear whether freshwater invertebrates, which are key providers of ecosystem services, are also declining. We addressed this question by analysing a long-term dataset of macroinvertebrate abundance collected from 2002 to 2019 across 5009 sampling sites in English rivers. Patterns varied markedly across taxonomic groups. Within trophic groups we detected increases in the abundance of carnivores by 19% and herbivores by 14.8%, while we estimated decomposers have declined by 21.7% in abundance since 2002. We also found heterogeneity in trends across rivers belonging to different typologies based on geological dominance and catchment altitude, with organic lowland rivers having generally higher rates of increase in abundance across taxa and trophic groups, with siliceous lowland rivers having the most declines. Our results reveal a complex picture of change in freshwater macroinvertebrate abundance between taxonomic groups, trophic levels and river typologies. Our analysis helps with identifying priority regions for action on potential environmental stressors where we discover macroinvertebrate abundance declines.

AB  - Saltwater intrusion can dramatically transform coastal ecosystems, changing vegetation and impacting wildlife and human communities who rely on these natural resources. This phenomenon is difficult to measure over large and remote areas but can be inferred from changes in the distribution of salt-tolerant vegetation, such as mangroves, observable from satellite imagery. The northern coast of Brazil has the largest continuous mangrove forest in the world and very low human occupation. Even so, saltwater intrusion and changes to the coastline have been reported in this region, with potential consequences for mangrove carbon storage and for local livelihoods, but this has not been quantified due to the remoteness of the area. This study measured changes in mangrove distribution along the Northern Brazil coast in the state of Amapa, covering ca. 15,000 km(2), over the last 38 years using Landsat satellite imagery. We found that mangrove area in this region is highly dynamic, with significant gains and losses occurring over the study period, but with an overall net gain of 157 km(2). Mangroves have been systematically expanding inland and this growth has accelerated close to the shoreline and at the head of tidal channels in the last two decades, indicating rapid and large-scale saltwater intrusion in this region. This phenomenon is likely driven by sea level rise, which also accelerated in this region in recent decades, but anthropogenic impacts such as buffalo grazing may also play an important role.

AB  - Savannas are characterized by the coexistence of two contrasting plant life-forms: woody and herbaceous vegetation. During the last decades, there has been a global trend of an increase in woody cover and the spread of shrubs and trees into areas that were previously dominated by grasses. This process, termed bush encroachment, is associated with severe losses of ecosystem functions and typically difficult to reverse. It is assumed to be an example of a critical transition between two alternative stable states. Overgrazing due to unsustainable rangeland management has been identified as one of the main causes of this transition, as it can trigger several self-reinforcing feedback loops. However, the dynamic role of grazing within such feedback loops has received less attention. We used a set of coupled differential equations to describe the competition between shrubs and grasses, as well as plant biomass consumption via grazing and browsing. Grazers were assumed to receive a certain level of care from farmers, so that grazer densities emerge dynamically from the combined effect of vegetation abundance and farmer support. We quantified all self-reinforcing and self-dampening feedback loops at play and analyzed their relative importance in shaping system (in-)stability. Bistability, the presence of a grass dominated and a shrub dominated state, emerges for intermediate levels of farmer support due to positive feedback that arises from competition between shrubs and grasses and from herbivory. We furthermore demonstrate that disturbances, such as drought events, trigger abrupt transitions from the grass dominated to the shrub dominated state and that the system becomes more susceptible to disturbances with increasing farmer support. Our results thus highlight the potential of interaction networks in combinations with feedback loop analysis for improving our understanding of critical transitions in general, and bush encroachment in particular.

AB  - The addax antelope (Addax nasomaculatus) is a species under serious threat of extinction, as it is more abundant in captivity than in the wild. However, little is known about its basic biology. The aims of this study were to determine how locomotor, feeding, aggressive, marking, and sexual behavior of male addax allocated in all-male groups vary with season and with female contact (i.e., biostimulation). The study was conducted in captive conditions, in two groups of adult males: one with no-physical contact with females, aside from visual and olfactory interactions (CF group, n = 4), and another group completely isolated from females (IF group, n = 4). The frequency of behaviors was recorded during the daytime, 4 days per season (total time of observation = 256 h). Lying, standing, walking, aggressive, marking, grazing, and ruminating behaviors as well as water and supplement consumptions varied with season (all p < 0.05). The lying, walking, marking, grazing, and ruminating behaviors were more frequently observed for CF than IF males (all p < 0.05). Also, all behaviors, except for marking, varied with the interaction between the group and seasons (all p < 0.05). Sexual behavior was extremely scarce, so it was not possible to analyze how it varied with seasons and the group. The present study suggests that management program and housing conditions, especially in ex situ breeding plans, should consider the influence of the season and the sociosexual context on the behavior of addax males.

AB  - Long-term research in grassland biodiversity experiments has provided empirical evidence that ecological and evolutionary processes are intertwined in determining both biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) and biodiversity-stability relationships. Focusing on plant diversity, we hypothesize that multifunctional stability is highest in high-diversity plant communities and that biodiversity-stability relationships increase over time due to a variety of forms of ecological complementarity including the interaction with other biota above and below ground. We introduce the multiple-mechanisms hypothesis of biodiversity-stability - stability relationships suggesting that it is not an individual mechanism that drives long-term biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning and stability but that several intertwined processes produce increasingly positive ecosystem effects. The following six mechanisms are important. Low-diversity plant communities accumulate more plant antagonists over time (1), and use resources less efficiently and have more open, leaky nutrient cycles (2). Conversely, high-diversity plant communities support a greater diversity and activity of beneficial interaction partners across trophic levels (3); diversify in their traits over time and space, within and across species, to optimize temporal (intra- and inter- annual) and spatial complementarity (4), create a more stable microclimate (5), and foster higher top-down control of aboveground and belowground herbivores by predators (6). In line with the observation that different species play unique roles in ecosystems that are dynamic and multifaceted, the particular mechanism contributing most to the higher performance and stability of diverse plant communities might differ across ecosystem functions, years, locations, and environmental change scenarios. This indicates "between-context insurance" or "across-context complementarity" of different mechanisms. We introduce examples of experiments that will be conducted to test our hypotheses and which might inspire additional work.

AB  - 1. Fire and herbivory are fundamental top-down processes, structuring grass-tree ratios in ecosystems across a diversity of climates. Both are plant consumers that can strongly control the recruitment of woody seedlings and saplings to taller height classes. Without consumer control, many grass-dominated ecosystems would convert into woodlands or forests. While extensively studied in savannas, few have explored the effects of these disturbance regimes on woody recruitment under temperate conditions.
   2. We exposed saplings of five common European tree species to fire and herbivory in a full factorial experiment in a savanna-like wood-pasture. After 3 years, we evaluated the effects of fire and herbivory on tree sapling survival and height increment. The tree species used, varying in traits and in expected response to fire and herbivory, were Scots pine Pinus sylvestris, Norway spruce Picea abies, European oak Quercus robur, Silver birch Betula pendula and Small-leaved lime Tilia cordata.
   3. Fire and herbivory had a negative effect on sapling survival for all species except for Q. robur, which was not affected by fire. Both processes reduced height increment of B. pendula, while only herbivory reduced the height increment of P. sylvestris and Q. robur. At the same time, B. pendula and P. sylvestris had some of the highest increments, together with P. abies, which had unaffected height increment in all treatments. T. cordata, on the other hand, had a negative height increment across all treatments. Overall, the combined effect of fire and herbivory was similar to the effect of herbivory alone on both survival and height increment, indicating no additional effect of fire when herbivores were present.
   4. Synthesis. Our experiment showed how fire and herbivory can strongly affect the recruitment of European temperate tree saplings on a wood-pasture, potentially leading to comparable consumer control described for ecosystems elsewhere (e.g. savannas). Two strategies to deal with fire and herbivory were identified: tolerance (Q. robur) and avoidance (P. sylvestris and B. pendula). We conclude that both fire and herbivory may have been important drivers of structure and species composition in open ecosystems in temperate Europe in the past.

AB  - Wild ungulates seek out food resources at the bottom of mountain valleys in winter and spring, where their high density can negatively impact the production of hay meadows. This study determines the factors that explain the meadow use of four sympatric species: red-, roe-, and fallow-deer, and wild boar. In 2017, we counted the individuals of each species in 94 meadows for eight nights, between March and June, and estimated the frequency of meadow use as the proportion of positive censuses over the total censuses per meadow. We also recorded the presence of domestic ungulates. We inventoried the floristic composition in June. Species tended to use different meadows but only fallow- and roe-deer significantly segregated, indicated by the negative C-score index. As the ungulate frequency was skewed to 0, we used a generalized additive model (GAMLSS) to simultaneously simulate the probability of animals being absent and the frequency of positive censuses. Landscape features contributed to explaining the absence probability, while plant richness and legume cover explained the frequency of meadow use. The presence of domestic ungulates did not affect wild ungulate behavior. All studied species, except roe-deer, avoided exposed spots, preferentially using large meadows close to the forest. At meadow level, each species seemed to have different forage requirements. The frequency of fallow deer increased with the meadow forage quality, indicating a more grasses-based diet than the other two deer, and probably displacing roe-deer to suboptimum meadows. Red-deer used less plant-rich meadows, suggesting flexibility in their dietary choices.

AB  - Flexibility in activity timing may enable organisms to quickly adapt to environmental changes. Under global warming, diurnally adapted endotherms may achieve a better energy balance by shifting their activity towards cooler nocturnal hours. However, this shift may expose animals to new or increased environmental challenges (e.g. increased predation risk, reduced foraging efficiency). We analysed a large dataset of activity data from 47 ibex (Capra ibex) in two protected areas, characterized by varying levels of predation risk (presence versus absence of the wolf-Canis lupus). We found that ibex increased nocturnal activity following warmer days and during brighter nights. Despite the considerable sexual dimorphism typical of this species and the consequent different predation-risk perception, males and females demonstrated consistent responses to heat in both predator-present and predator-absent areas. This supports the hypothesis that shifting activity towards nighttime may be a common strategy adopted by diurnal endotherms in response to global warming. As nowadays different pressures are pushing mammals towards nocturnality, our findings emphasize the urgent need to integrate knowledge of temporal behavioural modifications into management and conservation planning.

AB  - Natural and anthropogenic disasters have the capability to cause sudden extrinsic environmental changes and long-lasting perturbations including invasive species, species expansion and influence evolution as selective pressures force adaption. Such disasters occurred on 11 March 2011, in Fukushima, Japan, when an earthquake, tsunami and meltdown of a nuclear power plant all drastically reformed anthropogenic land use. Using genetic data, we demonstrate how wild boar (Sus scrofa leucomystax) have persevered against these environmental changes, including an invasion of escaped domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus). Concurrently, we show evidence of successful hybridization between pigs and native wild boar in this area; however in future offspring, the pig legacy has been diluted through time. We speculate that the range expansion dynamics inhibit long-term introgression and introgressed alleles will continue to decrease at each generation while only maternally inherited organelles will persist. Using the gene flow data among wild boar, we assume that offspring from hybrid lineages will continue dispersal north at low frequencies as climates warm. We conclude that future risks for wild boar in this area include intraspecies competition, revitalization of human-related disruptions and disease outbreaks.

AB  - The Bathurst caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus ( Borowski, 1780)) herd declined from similar to 349 000 animals in 1996 to similar to 8200 in 2018. Climate-driven changes to tundra and boreal vegetation is one hypothesis for the decline. We modelled and mapped annual productivity and phenology across the herd's range using enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data derived from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series spanning 2000 -2017. Maximum annual EVI, growing season length, and time-integrated EVI increased significantly on 16%, 18%, and 49% of the core annual range, respectively. Trends toward longer growing seasons were driven entirely by earlier spring green-up and, along with time-integrated EVI, were most prevalent in tundra regions. Trends in forested regions were overwhelmingly related to the influence of forest fires, which burned more than half of the range below the forest -tundra ecotone since 1965. These trends suggest that climate-driven changes in production and phenology have occurred in the tundra and forest - tundra portions of the range and could have contributed to the recent herd decline. However, the trends may also be a result of herd decline itself, given the loss of this large herbivore from the landscape. Elucidating cause and effect will require comprehensive analysis of interactions between climatic variables, herd dynamics, and vegetation change, complemented by targeted field investigations.

AB  - Large herbivores-such as the South American marsh deer-are one of the groups more threatened with extinction, with their disappearance having severe consequences for entire ecosystems. Methods to estimate abundance of large herbivores robustly and efficiently are fundamental to evaluate the status and monitor fluctuations of their populations in time, as well as identify key areas for conservation planning. Here, we (i) explore the use of spatiotemporally replicated drone-based counts analysed with N-mixture models to estimate the abundance of large herbivores; and (ii) investigate how the local abundance of marsh deer varies in the landscape, for the dry season in the Pantanal wetland (Brazil). We fitted marsh deer drone-based counts using binomial and multinomial N-mixture models (for single and double observer protocols respectively) and modelled local abundance in relation to vegetation greenness, distance to water bodies, and jaguar density. Marsh deer local abundance presented a strong relation with what is expected to be the high-quality areas for the species: high levels of vegetation greenness (that are expected to provide high-quality forage) and close to water bodies. We identified key areas for the population in the remaining humid environments and, in the drier region, close to artificial water bodies. Spatiotemporally replicated drone-based counts may serve as an accessible and cost-effective protocol to estimate abundance and monitor large herbivores while accounting for imperfect detection.

AB  - In human-dominated landscapes, human activities shape prey spatial behavior, creating complex landscapes of risks. We investigated habitat selection of roe deer using resource selection functions in a human-dominated mountain system located in the southwestern Alps, characterized by a high presence of wolves and human disturbance. Our study aimed to assess how the interplay of hunting, presence of infrastructures, and recreational activities in the presence of wolves influenced roe deer spatial responses inside and outside a protected area. We documented that during the hunting period, roe deer increased selection of high-wolf-density areas, with the strongest effect observed during wild boar drive hunts, supporting the risk enhancement hypothesis, where avoiding one predator increases exposure to another, and highlighting the temporary yet significant impact of hunting on predator-prey dynamics. During the period of the wild boar drive hunt, roe deer also showed stronger selection for proximity to buildings, supporting the human shield hypothesis. Protected areas had an increased effect on roe deer avoidance of trails, where hiking and recreational activities are more concentrated. Our findings revealed the complex trade-offs that roe deer face in navigating multiple risks within human-modified landscapes, important for the development of effective conservation and human sustainability strategies.

AB  - The use of drones for vegetation monitoring allows the acquisition of large amounts of high spatial resolution data in a simple and fast way. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of vegetation cover estimation by drones in Mediterranean semi-arid shrublands (Sierra de Filabres; Almeria; southern Spain) after prescribed burns (2 years). We compared drone-based vegetation cover estimates with those based on traditional vegetation sampling in ninety-six 1 m(2) plots. We explored how this accuracy varies in different types of coverage (low-, moderate- and high-cover shrublands, and high-cover alfa grass steppe); as well as with diversity, plant richness, and topographic slope. The coverage estimated using a drone was strongly correlated with that obtained by vegetation sampling (R-2 = 0.81). This estimate varied between cover classes, with the error rate being higher in low-cover shrublands, and lower in high-cover alfa grass steppe (normalized RMSE 33% vs. 9%). Diversity and slope did not affect the accuracy of the cover estimates, while errors were larger in plots with greater richness. These results suggest that in semi-arid environments, the drone might underestimate vegetation cover in low-cover shrublands.

AB  - Few ecosystems are more sensitive to hydrological change than seasonally-flooded wetlands. Here, we investigate how changes in hydrological regimes caused by the construction of two dams have contributed to large changes in the structure and dynamics of the Kafue Flats, an internationally-important, partially-protected wetland ecosystem in Zambia. We use historical (1970) and contemporary (2013) data to describe changes in hydrology due to dam operations, and to compare the areal extent, distribution, and composition of the major wetland and dryland habitats in the pre- and post-dam periods. To understand the seasonal dynamics of the ecosystem and how these dynamics influence the seasonal movement and use of the ecosystem by the dominant grazing herbivore, the endangered Kafue lechwe, we combine data on annual hydrological variation with spatially- and/or temporally-explicit quantitative estimates of: (1) grass biomass and nutrient stocks, (2) distribution of lechwe across habitats, and (3) lechwe nutritional status. The operation of the dams has reduced hydrological variation, causing a loss of more than 50% of seasonally-flooded grasslands and probably promoting woody encroachment in some habitats. Our results demonstrate that Kafue lechwe is highly dependent on these seasonally-flooded grasslands during the dry season, when their nutritional status is otherwise critically low. In combination, we hypothesize that changes in the flooding regime driven by dam construction precipitated ecosystem-level changes that-together with other factors-may have contributed to a rapid historic, as well as ongoing decline in the lechwe population. Our study highlights potential consequences of the spatio-temporal homogenization of a previously highly variable ecosystem.

AB  - Mineral licks are indispensable habitats to the life history of large mammal herbivores (LMH). Geophagy at licks may provide the necessary minerals for LMH, while LMH may be ecosystem engineers of licks by altering vegetation cover and soil physicochemical properties (SPCP). However, the precise relationship between the LMH and licks remains unclear. To clarify the geophagy function of licks for LMH and their influence on soil at licks, we recorded visitation patterns of sika deer around licks and compared SPCP and microbial communities with the surrounding matrix in a firebreak adjacent to the Sino-Russian border. Our study indirectly supports the "sodium supplementation" hypothesis. Proofs included (1) a significantly higher sodium, iron, and aluminum contents than the matrix, while lower carbon, nitrogen, and moisture contents; (2) significantly higher deer visitation during sodium-demand season (growing season), along with an avoidance of licks with high iron contents, which is toxic when overdose. The microbes at the licks differed from those at the matrix, mainly driven by low soil carbon and nitrogen and altered biogeochemical cycles. The microbial communities of licks are vulnerable because of their unstable state and susceptibility to SPCP changes. Structural equation modeling (SEM) clearly showed a much stronger indirect effect of deer on microbes at licks than at the matrix, especially for bacteria. Multiple deer behaviors at licks, such as grazing, trampling, and excretion, can indirectly shape and stabilize microbes by altering carbon and nitrogen input. Our study is the first to characterize soil microbial communities at mineral licks and demonstrate the processes by which LMH shapes those communities. More studies are required to establish a general relationship between the LMH and licks to promote the conservation of natural licks for wildlife.

AB  - Identifying local adaptation in bottlenecked species is essential for conservation management. Selection detection methods have an important role in species management plans, assessments of adaptive capacity, and looking for responses to climate change. Yet, the allele frequency changes exploited in selection detection methods are similar to those caused by the strong neutral genetic drift expected during a bottleneck. Consequently, it is often unclear what accuracy selection detection methods have across bottlenecked populations. In this study, simulations were used to explore if signals of selection could be confidently distinguished from genetic drift across 23 bottlenecked and reintroduced populations of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). The meticulously recorded demographic history of the Alpine ibex was used to generate comprehensive simulated SNP data. The simulated SNPs were then used to benchmark the confidence we could place in outliers identified in empirical Alpine ibex RADseq derived SNP data. Within the simulated data set, the false positive rates were high for all selection detection methods (F-ST outlier scans and Genetic-Environment Association analyses) but fell substantially when two or more methods were combined. True positive rates were consistently low and became negligible with increased stringency. Despite finding many outlier loci in the empirical Alpine ibex SNPs, none could be distinguished from genetic drift-driven false positives. Unfortunately, the low true positive rate also prevents the exclusion of recent local adaptation within the Alpine ibex. The baselines and stringent approach outlined here should be applied to other bottlenecked species to ensure the risk of false positive, or negative, signals of selection are accounted for in conservation management plans.

AB  - Small burrowing herbivores often disturb the grassland soil. Although the plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) is widespread in alpine meadows in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, their detailed effects on ecosystem properties are not well-established. In this study, we investigated the effects of the densities of plateau pikas on plant char-acteristics, soil properties, and the composition and diversity of soil microbial communities. Plant coverage, height, aboveground biomass, and belowground biomass decreased with an increase in the densities of active plateau pika burrows. Additionally, pika disturbances led to distinct changes in soil moisture, soil bulk density (SBD), total phosphorus (TP), NH4+-N, available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) contents. Soil moisture, TP and AK contents were highest under moderate plateau pika disturbance levels, whereas the SBD and AP content were highest under the highest active burrow density. However, soil microbial diversity, as deter-mined by high-throughput sequencing, did not differ significantly among pika disturbance levels. Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size revealed that biomarker bacteria for various levels of disturbances belong to Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, and most biomarker bacteria were found at moderate disturbance level (D2), while biomarker fungi belong to Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and most biomarker fungi were found in the highest plateau pika disturbance level (D4). Pika disturbances significantly influenced the microbial community, possibly via alterations in the belowground biomass, SBD, AK and TP contents. Thus, plateau pika disturbances significantly influenced the plant and soil properties and microbial community structure.

AB  - Riparian ecosystems in montane areas have been degraded by mining, streamflow alterations, and livestock grazing. Restoration of ecological and economic functions, especially in high-elevation watersheds that supply water to lower elevation urban and agriculture areas is of high priority. We investigated the response of riparian vegetation and bank stability following channel treatments and riparian habitat restoration along a segment of the upper Arkansas River south of Leadville, Colorado. The study area has been historically degraded by heavy-metal mining and is designated a U.S. Superfund site. Additionally, trans-basin water diversions and livestock grazing have contributed to channel widening and altered vegetation composition and cover. We used a before-after-control impact study design in four reaches with varied contamination and grazing history to assess restoration success. Before restoration, streambanks were dominated by graminoids and total vegetation cover varied among reaches with willow cover less than 16% in three reaches. Post-restoration, changes in total vegetation cover fell short of projected goals, but willow cover was greater than 20% in all study reaches. The increase in woody cover likely contributed to reduced erosion and vegetation encroachment post-restoration. Differences in functional group cover among reaches persisted post-restoration and may be attributed to soil contamination levels and low willow seed rain and dispersal. These results highlight the importance of setting realistic restoration goals based on elevation and past land use. We recommend further remediation of fluvial tailings with low vegetation cover and continued monitoring of willow height and cover to determine if further restoration activities are needed.

AB  - ContextConsistent with the diversity-stability hypothesis, high wildlife diversity has been associated with increased resilience and stability of ecosystem services and functions. Nevertheless, ecological non-stationarity associated with climate change challenges the concept of stability. Furthermore, ambiguity surrounding appropriate diversity metrics to use has hindered the ability of natural resource managers to leverage the potential benefits of biodiversity conservation.Objectives and methodsWe aimed to infer how diversity and compositional stability might be affected by multiple climate and disturbance stressors, including management activity.MethodsWe used a spatially explicit landscape succession model to predict spatiotemporal patterns of beta diversity for terrestrial vertebrates representing three trophic groups (herbivores, insectivores, and predators) over an 80-year time span.ResultsTrends in diversity were driven by species gains at higher elevations and species losses at lower elevations, however, species reorganization was modified by both mean species turnover (i.e. replacement of species across space) as well as management intensity. Higher species turnover was associated with greater among-site compositional stability and decreased local compositional change attributed to species losses for all trophic groups. Increasing management intensity further increased beta diversity across all elevations whereas decreasing management intensity led to spatial homogenization of herbivores and insectivores at low elevations. High management intensity also weakened naturally occurring diversity-stability relationships at larger spatial scales.ConclusionsIncreasing management intensity may be beneficial at lower elevations where projections anticipate species losses and homogenization. Additionally, conserving areas of high diversity will likely be important for promoting future compositional stability for trophic groups that support key ecological processes.

AB  - Herbivore grazing has long-lasting effects on the structure and functions of grassland ecosystems, even after the grazing pressure has ceased. These lasting effects are known as grazing legacy effects and significantly affect plant productivity and biodiversity, with the magnitude increased with grazing intensity and further led to grassland degradation. Fencing is a common approach used for restoring degraded grasslands by excluding grazing. Moderate grazing representing a controlled level of grazing intensity is believed to be a useful way to restore ecological functions and thus mitigate grazing legacies. However, how fencing and ongoing moderate grazing affect grazing legacy effects remain unclear and rarely tested with field experiments, particularly with different grazing histories. Here, we investigated aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), species richness, litter, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil dissolved nitrogen (DON) and hyphal length density (HLD) in 2015 (fencing for 1 year) and 2018 (fencing vs moderate grazing for the subsequent 3 years) after 0, 2, 5, 7 and 12 years of free grazing in a meadow steppe to explore how moderate grazing and fencing affect grazing legacy effects with different histories. We observed a decline in ANPP and species richness with increasing grazing histories, and the magnitude of grazing legacy effects increased accordingly. In most grazing histories, moderate grazing had a greater impact than fencing in reducing the grazing legacy effects on ANPP and species richness. However, with a grazing history of 12 years, moderate grazing led to a smaller increase in ANPP compared to fencing. Additionally, the grazing legacy effects on ANPP and species richness weakened with longer fencing duration for excluding grazing. Litter, SOC, DON and HLD exhibited consistent patterns with the dynamics of ANPP and species richness. Our results indicate that grazing legacy effects on ANPP and species richness intensify with prolonged grazing histories, suggesting that grazing history have stronger impacts on grassland ecosystem functions and structure. The study implies that moderate grazing is an effective strategy for restoring degraded grasslands, particularly for species richness and with short-term grazing histories, instead of relying solely on fencing. The changes of soil variables underlie the grazing legacy effects and the interactions with fencing and moderate grazing.

AB  - Marine communities on continental shelves form through a combination of environmental filtering, biotic interaction, and dispersal-based processes. These shelves present depth-related environmental gradients from nearshore and seasonal upwelling systems, which periodically supply cold, dispersal-enhancing, nutrient-rich waters, providing an ideal setting to explore spatiotemporal trait-based assembly patterns and underlying mechanisms. Although eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems are well-studied, the role of upwelling in southwestern Atlantic benthic assemblages remains less understood, especially from a functional perspective. Here, we integrated the morphological, size, reproductive, and behavioral traits of annelids with environmental variables. We found that deeper, low-dynamic, coarser, poorly sorted sediments with moderate nutrient amounts and quality on the outer shelf maintained overdispersed annelid assemblages. Nevertheless, particularly in the Austral summer, cold bottom water from South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) on the northern S & atilde;o Paulo inner shelf promoted functional overdispersion, a pattern generally assumed to occur over evolutionary timescales. Immediately after SACW retraction, we observed trait clustering, typical of environmental filtering likely by intensifying hydrodynamics and lower-quality organic inputs expected for the area. RLQ (R, environmental data; L, species incidence data; Q, species trait matrix) analysis revealed the predominance of sedentary 'Scolecida' and 'Sabellida'-like traits on the inner shelf, whereas outer shelf traits were broader but dominated by errant, larger, mobile carnivorous annelids. However, high environmental heterogeneity, likely modulated by spatial contingency, resulted in random assemblages on the inner shelf overall. Our study highlights how long-established spatial gradients and short-term events can temporarily alter community assembly processes, underscoring the need for more nuanced temporal and functional approaches to marine biodiversity assessments and conservation strategies in upwelling-impacted shelf systems.

AB  - Pyric herbivory, a process by which grazing is driven by fire, has been shown to create heterogeneity in fire-prone grasslands. Patch-burn grazing (PBG) is a management tool used to harness pyric herbivory and contrasts with full burn (FB) which fosters homogeneity. Here we provide a comprehensive assessment of plant communities (vegetation composition, diversity, and heterogeneity), soil characteristics, and fire fuel consumption responses to PBG as compared to FB management in two different pasture-types (intensively managed pastures [IMP] vs. less intensely managed seminatural pastures [SNP]) in subtropical, humid grasslands in Florida, USA. In 2017, we established 16 experimental pastures at Archbold Biological Station's Buck Island Ranch that were 16-ha each, eight in IMP and eight in SNP. Of the eight pastures in each pasture-type, four were fully burned in 2017 (FB) while in the other four, one-third of the pasture was burned each year for three years (2017, 2018, and 2019) (PBG). PBG-treated pastures were expected to have greater plant richness, diversity, and structural heterogeneity due to the creation of patch contrast while in FB pastures, we expected homogeneous vegetation structure because patches would all have the same fire history. Fuel consumption by fire was greater in SNP vs. IMP and in burned patches within PBG vs. similar-size areas in FB. Recently burned patches had greater total native richness and Shannon diversity, driven by greater numbers and cover of forbs and sedges, but the magnitude of this response varied among years. PBG pastures had greater structural heterogeneity shortly after fire but this disappeared by the end of the growing season. PBG benefits both conservation and production goals in SNP, but incentive programs may be required to implement PBG in IMP to offset losses in forage production while gaining increased height heterogeneity and potential increases in vegetation diversity.

AB  - Invertebrates comprise the most diversified animal group on Earth. Due to their long evolutionary history and small size, invertebrates occupy a remarkable range of ecological niches, and play an important role as "ecosystem engineers" by structuring networks of mutualistic and antagonistic ecological interactions in almost all terrestrial ecosystems. Urban forests provide critical ecosystem services to humans, and, as in other systems, invertebrates are central to structuring and maintaining the functioning of urban forests. Identifying the role of invertebrates in urban forests can help elucidate their importance to practitioners and the public, not only to preserve biodiversity in urban environments, but also to make the public aware of their functional importance in maintaining healthy greenspaces. In this review, we examine the multiple functional roles that invertebrates play in urban forests that contribute to ecosystem service provisioning, including pollination, predation, herbivory, seed and microorganism dispersal and organic matter decomposition, but also those that lead to disservices, primarily from a public health perspective, e.g., transmission of invertebrate-borne diseases. We then identify a number of ecological filters that structure urban forest invertebrate communities, such as changes in habitat structure, increased landscape imperviousness, microclimatic changes and pollution. We also discuss the complexity of ways that forest invertebrates respond to urbanisation, including acclimation, local extinction and evolution. Finally, we present management recommendations to support and conserve viable and diverse urban forest invertebrate populations into the future.

AB  - Simple Summary Insect pests and their natural enemies can harbor in riparian zones. To determine the impact of insect communities on agriculture and ecology, we must quantitatively assess insect populations in riparian areas. To identify the appropriate methodology for effective insect sampling in riparian areas, we assessed sweep sampling within three plant communities using different numbers of subsampling units (50 sweeps carried out twice, or 10 sweeps over 10 times) over two years. The results reveal that effective insect sampling varies between different plant communities and insect orders. The similarities between terrestrial insect communities in the same plant community were relatively high, even in different years. The optimum sampling size to obtain approximately 80% of the total species was estimated for each survey site. Our results lay the foundations for providing techniques to assess insect populations within riparian areas to predict and prevent herbivorous insect pest invasions in the future. To investigate insect and plant community relationships in riparian zones, terrestrial insect communities were compared in plant communities in the riparian zone of the Miho River, Korea. The sweep netting method was used to sample insects in 50 m transects in three herbaceous plant communities. In 2020, each plant community-Chenopodium album, Beckmannia syzigachne, and Artemisia indica-was swept 100 times (50 sweeps x 2). In 2021, two communities had an additional 100 sweeps collected using 10 subsamples of 10 sweeps (excluding C. album communities). The surveyed dominant species or subdominant species of the insect community in each site preyed on the dominant plant species at the site. The Bray-Curtis similarity was significantly higher than the Sorensen similarity when comparing datasets across different years for the same plant species community. The predicted optimum sampling size to obtain approximately 80% of the total species estimated to be at each survey site, for effective quantitative collection of terrestrial insect herbivores in each plant community, was examined. Fifty sweeps were required for the A. indica community and 100 sweeps were required for the B. syzigachne community. The results of this study provide important data for riparian biodiversity conservation and future pest monitoring.

AB  - We evaluated forest road use by mammals in forest areas in northeastern Japan using a camera-trapping survey, considering road surface conditions. From August to December 2021, camera-trapping surveys were conducted on paved forest roads, forest roads without understory vegetation, forest roads with low-height understory vegetation, forest roads with high understory vegetation (herbs and shrubs), and forest interiors. We analyzed the differences in forest road use by mammalian species using non-metric multidimensional scaling and a generalized linear mixed model. We also assessed whether each species actively used forest roads using the road-use index, which indicates that individual animals walked along forest roads based on consecutive photographs. The paved forest roads and unpaved forest roads with no or low-height understory vegetation had a similar composition of species using the roads. The unpaved forest road with high-height understory vegetation showed a species composition similar to that in the forest interior; however, the results were different from those of the other three groups. Except for Japanese squirrels, mammals had little tendency to avoid forest roads and also indicated the existence of species (i.e., medium-sized carnivores) selectively using forest roads in the study area. Our results suggest that understory vegetation height on the forest road surface influences species composition through its effect on medium-sized carnivores and Japanese squirrels. This study provides useful knowledge on the relationship between human activities and wildlife, particularly in forest and wildlife management.

AB  - The main traditional livelihood in the high Central Andes Plateau, locally known as the Puna, is pastoral-ism. This system is based on llamas (Lama glama) and sheep (Ovis aries), which graze on natural veg-etation (shrub steppe, grasslands, and peatlands). So, the livelihood of Andean communities is strongly influenced by the spatial and temporal dynamics of vegetation. Most of the existing models on herbivory used to estimate sustainable livestock loads require information on the nutritional values and primary production of vegetation, which is lacking for the Argentine Puna. This work aimed to fill the gap by implementing a carrying capacity model using data on annual vegetation growth and herbivore feed-ing strategies collected in the field in different plant communities. The hypothesis that guided this work was that environmental heterogeneity affects management decisions and should be taken into account to model sustainable animal stocks in Andean pastoralist systems. We estimated carrying capacity based on the MSY logistic model, considering biomass and aboveground primary production of vegetation commu-nities, climatic features, and herbivore selective responses. We compared the estimated carrying capacity with real animal stocks in four production units within the study site in 2013, 2014, and 2017. The results indicate that the carrying capacity presents high spatial and temporal variability. In three of the produc-tion units assessed, the livestock-mixed herds of sheep and llamas-were above or near the estimated carrying capacity, even when the stocking rates were reduced during dry periods. The high stocking rates, along with evidence of land degradation, may indicate moderate to severe overgrazing. This work demon-strates the usefulness of estimating the carrying capacity to monitor the pastoral systems at fine space and time scales. These monitoring techniques can facilitate decision making among Puna herders in a biocultural context of knowledge dialog that may foster sustainability in pastoralist livelihoods.& COPY; 2023 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - Various authors have suggested that extinctions and extirpations of large mammalian herbivores during the last ca. 50,000 years have altered ecological processes. Yet, the degree to which herbivore extinctions have influenced ecosystems has been difficult to assess because past changes in herbivore impact are difficult to measure directly. Here, we indirectly estimated changes in (theorised) herbivore impact by comparing the functional composition of current large (>= 10 kg) mammalian herbivore assemblages to those of a no-extinction scenario. As an assemblage's functional composition determines how it interacts with its environment, changes in functional compositions should correspond to changes in ecological impacts. We quantified functional composition using the body mass, diet and life habit of all wild herbivorous mammal species (n = 502) present during the last 130,000 years. Next, we assessed whether these changes in functional composition were large enough that the resulting assemblages could be considered functionally novel. Finally, we assessed where novel herbivore assemblages would most likely lead to changes in biome state. We found that 47% of assemblages are functionally novel, indicating fundamental changes in herbivore impacts occurred across much of the planet. On 20% of land, functionally novel herbivore assemblages have arisen in areas where alternative biome states are possible depending on the disturbance regime. Thus, in many regions, the late-Quaternary extinctions and extirpations altered herbivore assemblages so profoundly that there were likely major consequences for ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Fire shapes animal communities by altering resource availability and species interactions, including between predators and prey. In Australia, there is particular concern that two highly damaging invasive predators, the feral cat (Felis catus) and European red fox (Vulpes vulpes), increase their activity in recently burnt areas and exert greater predation pressure on the native prey due to their increased exposure. We tested how prescribed fire occurrence and extent, along with fire history, vegetation, topography, and distance to anthropogenic features (towns and farms), affected the activity (detection frequency) of cats, foxes, and the native mammal community in south-eastern Australia. We used camera traps to quantify mammal activity before and after a prescribed burn and statistically tested how the fire interacted with these habitat variables to affect mammal activity. We found little evidence that the prescribed fire influenced the activity of cats and foxes and no evidence of an effect on kangaroo or small mammal (<800 g) activity. Medium-sized mammals (800-2000 g) were negatively associated with prescribed fire extent, suggesting that prescribed fire has a negative impact on these species in the short term. The lack of a clear activity increase from cats and foxes is likely a positive outcome from a fire management perspective. However, we highlight that their response is likely dependent upon factors like fire size, severity, and prey availability. Future experiments should incorporate GPS-trackers to record fine-scale movements of cats and foxes in temperate ecosystems immediately before and after prescribed fire to best inform management within protected areas.

AB  - Large herbivores in seasonal environments often experience mass variation due to temporal changes in the availability of critical resources like water and forage, as well as due to breeding events. Yet the documentation of mass variation in mammals of highly seasonal savanna habitats, which host the highest densities of grazing ungulates globally, has rarely been explored. Here, we showcase a method to evaluate seasonal mass variation in bovids. Our method used mineral-baited scales and camera traps to enable us to track the body mass of three species through a period of wet and dry seasons in a South African savanna ecosystem. To illustrate one potential application of the method, we related body mass data to time, weather and resource availability. This showed that individuals altered their body masses markedly between seasons with, for example, female Kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) gaining, on average, >21 kg over the 15-week wet-season period in 1 year. These changes were positively related to factors such as vegetation productivity (assessed using NDVI) and the frequency of rains. This method enables easy, non-lethal and non-invasive acquisition of mass data. The equipment is easy to deploy concurrently over large areas. Monitoring by this method has a variety of possible applications, potentially providing a useful early-warning indicator of body condition to inform management, or providing information about ecological states, such as parturition or the reproductive effort of males. Given the longer and harsher dry seasons experienced in many arid systems in recent decades, and projected in future, this method may provide a straightforward means of monitoring long-term body condition in animals as a result of environmental change.

AB  - With climate change, natural disturbances such as storm or fire are reshuffled, inducing pervasive shifts in forest dynamics. To predict how it will impact forest structure and composition, it is crucial to understand how tree species differ in their sensitivity to disturbances. In this study, we investigated how functional traits and species mean climate affect their sensitivity to disturbances while controlling for tree size and stand structure. With data on 130,594 trees located on 7617 plots that were disturbed by storm, fire, snow, biotic or other disturbances from the French, Spanish, and Finnish National Forest Inventory, we modeled annual mortality probability for 40 European tree species as a function of tree size, dominance status, disturbance type, and intensity. We tested the correlation of our estimated species probability of disturbance mortality with their traits and their mean climate niches. We found that different trait combinations controlled species sensitivity to disturbances. Storm-sensitive species had a high height-dbh ratio, low wood density and high maximum growth, while fire-sensitive species had low bark thickness and high P50. Species from warmer and drier climates, where fires are more frequent, were more resistant to fire. The ranking in disturbance sensitivity between species was overall consistent across disturbance types. Productive conifer species were the most disturbance sensitive, while Mediterranean oaks were the least disturbance sensitive. Our study identified key relations between species functional traits and disturbance sensitivity, that allows more reliable predictions of how changing climate and disturbance regimes will impact future forest structure and species composition at large spatial scales.

AB  - Forest disturbances are expected to increase in severity with climate change and intensified land use, threatening future delivery of several ecosystem services, including the climate-mitigating potential of forests. Alleviating these consequences through adaptive forest management demands a greater understanding of what drives the impacts of disturbances on forests, which, in turn, requires collection of high-quality data through large-scale and long-term monitoring programs. The Swedish National Forest Inventory has been recording "damages" on living trees across a forest area of 230,000 km2, in addition to a wide range of stand characteristics and environmental conditions. Using 15 years of these data, we investigated the frequency of different types of tree damages and the causes of these damages and modeled damage risk among tree species and across gradients in stand attributes and environmental conditions. We found that 94% of all surveyed trees had some type of damage, but for 65% of these, the underlying cause was not identified. Nevertheless, for all damage types and causes, we found that damage risk varied considerably among tree species and across gradients in tree species richness, tree height, and stand age. For a few damages, stand age or tree species richness interacted with climate to influence risks. Among identified causes of damage, "wind and snow" was most common (11.9% of surveyed trees), followed by "forestry" (6.9%). Further, for most causes of damage where stand age was significant, the risk was highest in young or the youngest stands. As such, our results indicate that there is great potential for reducing the risk of tree damages via adaptive management, such as altered tree species composition and increased rotation length. However, for a greater understanding of what is driving the frequency and magnitude of forest damages, and to be able to provide specific, useful information to stakeholders, collection of higher-quality data must be prioritized by monitoring programs.

AB  - Grazing is one of the main human disturbance factors in alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), which can directly or indirectly influence the community structures and ecological functions of grassland ecosystems. However, despite extensive field grazing experiments, there is currently no consensus on how different grazing management approaches affect alpine grassland diversity, soil carbon (C), and nitrogen (N). Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 70 peer-reviewed publications to evaluate the general response of 11 variables related to alpine grassland ecosystems plant diversity and ecological functions to grazing. Overall, the results showed that grazing significantly increased the species richness, Shannon-Wiener index, and Pielou evenness index values by 9.89% (95% CI: 2.75-17.09%), 7.28% (95% CI: 1.68-13.62%), and 3.74% (95% CI: 1.40-6.52%), respectively. Aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) decreased, respectively, by 41.91% (95% CI: -50.91 to -32.88%) and 17.68% (95% CI: -26.94 to -8.52%). Soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (TN), soil C:N ratio, and soil moisture decreased by 13.06% (95% CI: -15.88 to -10.15%), 12.62% (95% CI: -13.35 to -8.61%), 3.27% (95% CI: -4.25 to -2.09%), and 20.75% (95% CI: -27.89 to -13.61%), respectively, whereas, soil bulk density and soil pH increased by 17.46% (95% CI: 11.88-24.53%) and 2.24% (95% CI: 1.01-3.64%), respectively. Specifically, moderate grazing, long-durations (>5 years), and winter grazing contributed to increases in the species richness, Shannon-Wiener index, and Pielou evenness index. However, AGB, BGB, SOC, TN, and soil C:N ratios showed a decrease with enhanced grazing intensity. The response ratio of SOC was positively associated with AGB and BGB but was negatively related to the Shannon-Wiener index and Pielou evenness index. Furthermore, the effects of grazing on plant diversity, AGB, BGB, SOC, and TN in alpine grassland varied with grazing duration, grazing season, livestock type, and grassland type. The findings suggest that grazing should synthesize other appropriate grazing patterns, such as seasonal and rotation grazing, and, furthermore, additional research on grazing management of alpine grassland on the QTP is needed in the future.

AB  - Interspecific competition has strongly shaped the evolution of large carnivore guilds. In Africa, the lion (Panthera leo) and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta, hereafter hyena) exert direct and indirect competitive impacts on each other and on subordinate guild members. The impacts of competition on demography are complex and not well understood. With carnivore guilds now ubiquitously impacted by humans, disentangling the effects of interspecific competition and other drivers of hyena demography is important. Western Zambia's Greater Liuwa Ecosystem (GLE) provides a unique natural experiment where lions were functionally eliminated from the system. Hyenas are the apex predator, with an abundant prey base and low levels of human-hyena conflict. We measured GLE hyena survival and density using mark-recapture models fit to 10 years of data from 663 known individuals in 11 clans. GLE hyena densities were high, though slightly lower than other wildebeest-dominated systems, and stable over 10 years. Survival rates were high for all age-sex classes, and higher than those of other systems with high lion density, suggesting the possibility of competitive release from lion competition. These findings provide insights into long-term hyena demography in the absence of their top competitor but with an abundant prey base. As humans continue to alter ecosystems and fundamental ecological relationships such as interspecific competition, altered dynamics such as competitive release are likely to be widespread and should be a focus of future research.

AB  - The analysis of mechanisms underlying prey use and selection is crucial for understanding the potential for apex predators to shape ecological processes across trophic levels. Significant implications for the conservation and management of ecosystems can ensue, especially in humanmodified landscapes characterised by the recent recovery of apex predators, such as those of Europe. Generalist predators may show frequency-dependent prey selection, leading to prey switching; however, there is no ubiquitous support for positive relationships between prey abundance and prey selection. In a protected area recently recolonised by the wolf Canis lupus and hosting abundant wild prey ( >20 individuals/km(2) ), we assessed prey use and selection ( >3000 wolf scats analysed) throughout 7 years since wolf settlement (April 2016-to-March 2023), during which prey density was relatively stable. Wolf diet was dominated by wild boar Sus scrofa and fallow deer Dama dama ( >70 % of occurrences and volume); the roe deer Capreolus capreolus and coypu Myocastor coypus represented main secondary prey. The wolf showed a clear prey switching throughout the study. In the first two years, the fallow deer was the main prey and was positively selected. Then, wild boar replaced fallow deer as main prey, and was positively selected, with a progressive decrease in the use of fallow deer throughout the years. Selection indices of wild boar were negatively associated with those of fallow deer. The relationship between selection indices and population density was inconsistent across species, being negative for the wild boar and weakly positive for the fallow deer, although the latter showed no sharp decline in the area. Concurrent studies showed increased diurnal activity of fallow deer and a consequent reduced temporal overlap with the wolf throughout years since the settlement of this predator, suggesting temporal avoidance. By supporting a minor role of prey density in mediating prey switching, our results suggest a major role of other factors (e.g., antipredator behavioural responses). Alternative substantial prey are important to buffer apex predators not only towards changes in the abundance of main prey, but also towards the effects of other factors potentially reducing prey detectability, e.g., antipredator behaviour.

AB  - Grazing practices fundamentally shape plant community composition and biodiversity worldwide, more importantly in water-limited environments. This study aimed to investigate plant community composition, species distribution of occurrence and diversity indices in an arid rangeland under different grazing intensities. The quadrat method was used to select 90 x 1 m2 quadrats in heavy-grazing, light-grazing and ungrazed sites. Plant species frequency, relative frequency, abundance, relative abundance and density, as well as species richness, evenness, Shannon diversity index and Simpson's diversity index were calculated. A total of 46 plant species belonging to 17 families were recorded. The Asterace ae family was represented with the highest frequency (28%). Overall in the study area, around 95%, 70% and 40% of recorded plant families existed in light-grazing, ungrazed and heavy-grazing sites, respectively. The species richness of identified plants in light-grazing and ungrazed sites was 300% and 200% greater, respectively, than in the heavy-grazing sites. Around 85% of existing plants in heavy-grazing sites were therophyte plants. The species frequency, abundance, density and diversity indices were higher in light-grazing sites compared to those under heavy grazing, which indicates a more diverse, heterogenous and balanced plant community in the light-grazing site. Plant communities in light-grazing and ungrazed sites were similar, except for higher species frequency, density and evenness in light-grazing sites. This suggests that light-grazing intensities in the arid rangelands of Jordan enhance plant diversity more than grazing exclusion, which encourages decision-makers and environmentalists to implement regulations prohibiting intensive grazing in the arid rangelands of Jordan.

AB  - Simple Summary This study explores the genetic diversity of the casein gene cluster, a key component in milk protein production, across various Bovidae species, including cattle, buffaloes, and antelopes. The lack of genetic data for wild bovids hampers the understanding of milk protein expression and the improvement of dairy breeds. The researchers assessed the feasibility of using a cattle-specific SNP microarray to analyze genetic variation in 12 Bovidae taxa, representing 5 different subfamilies. The positive results enabled the examination of genetic variations and their potential impact on milk protein production. The findings revealed high genetic diversity in these genes among domestic cattle and certain wild species, such as the lechwe, suggesting variations in milk protein expression. The study demonstrated that cattle-derived SNP chips are effective tools for examining genetic diversity in other Bovidae species. Moreover, the relatively low cost of SNP microarrays and the ability of third-party companies to scan them make genomic analysis applicable to a wide range of research areas.Abstract The casein gene cluster spans 250 to 350 kb across mammalian species and is flanked by non-coding DNA with largely unknown functions. These regions likely harbor elements regulating the expression of the 4 casein genes. In Bovidae, this cluster is well studied in domestic cattle and to a lesser extent in zebu and water buffalo. This study used a cattle-specific SNP microarray to analyze 12 Bovidae taxa and estimate casein gene cluster variability across 5 bovid subfamilies. Genotyping identified 126 SNPs covering the entire casein gene cluster and 2 Mb of upstream and downstream regions. Dairy cattle, watusi, and zebu showed the highest polymorphism: 63.7-68.2% in the 5 '-upstream region, 35.6-40.0% in the casein cluster, and 40.4-89.4% in the 3 '-downstream region. Among wild bovids, only a 'semi-aquatic' lechwe revealed high polymorphism similar to cattle. Other species exhibited lower variability, ranging from 9.1-27.3% in the 5 '-upstream, 8.9-20.0% in the casein, and 4.2-10.6% in the 3 '-downstream regions. For the first time, genome variability data were obtained for impala, waterbuck, and lechwe. It appears that higher variability in cattle's casein gene cluster may relate to its intense expression. This study confirms the effectiveness of cattle-derived microarrays for genotyping Bovidae.

AB  - In temperate grassland, earthworms contribute to the major soil processes which determine most of the ecosystem services. The characteristics of plant communities in grassland are key factors in maintaining earthworm communities, however effects of different herbage management on earthworms remain largely unknown. In this context, the aim of the present study was to determine the long-term effects of herbage management on grassland plant and earthworm communities. Plants and earthworms were sampled in a 14-years-old experiment in upland grasslands (Massif central, France). Abandoned grasslands were compared with mowed grasslands and with pastures grazed by cattle (at low or high intensities) or grazed by sheep (at low intensity). Compared to abandoned grassland, herbage management by grazing or by mowing display higher leguminous plant, community-weighted mean Ellenberg light values as well as plant richness while they display lower percentage of plant litter and community-weighted mean Ellenberg nitrogen values. The differences in plant richness were associated with a significant change in plant community structure. Compared to the abandoned grassland, herbage management by grazing or mowing significantly display higher earthworm biomass and total richness. Except for pastures grazed by cattle at high intensity, earthworm abundance was at least twice that in the grassland at low grazing intensity or mowing compared to the abandoned grassland. Earthworm communities were significantly different between grazed and mown treatments notably due to changes within Aporrectodea anecic and endogeic earthworm species. Overall, herbage management by animals or by mechanical export is beneficial for plant and earthworm diversity although no clear differences between management practices for earthworm richness, total biomass or total abundance were observed. Our results highlight that abandonment does not preserve biodiversity (plant, soil macrofauna) while management of grassland by grazing or mowing is a necessary tool for biodiversity conservation and improvement.

AB  - Examining the ecological consequences of the late Quaternary megafaunal extinctions within biodiversity hotspots is crucial for our understanding of the potential consequences of contemporary extinctions. We present the first multi-species record of spores of coprophilous fungi (SCF) from Monquentiva and the high-Andean forests of Colombia to reconstruct Late Pleistocene and Holocene megafaunal abundance. Fossilised pollen and charcoal are used to examine the consequences of megafaunal declines on the surrounding vegetation and fire activity. Our SCF record indicates the presence of Pleistocene megafauna at least since 30,290 BP, with two waves of megafaunal decline at ca. 22,900 BP and 10,990 BP. At Monquentiva, megafaunal decline in the Early Holocene resulted in transitional non-analogue vegetation, loss of some herbivore-dispersed plant taxa, an encroachment of palatable and woody flora, and a rise in fire activity. Differences with other published South-American records suggest that ecological consequences of megafaunal declines were habitat-specific. Overall, we show that ecosystems in the eastern Colombian Cordillera were highly sensitive to the decline of megafaunal populations. Under the current biodiversity crisis, management and conservation efforts must account for the effects of local herbivore declines on plant dispersal, on fire activity, and the potential loss of ecosystem services.

AB  - Disease cross-transmission between wild and domestic ungulates can negatively impact livelihoods and wildlife conservation. In Pin valley, migratory sheep and goats share pastures seasonally with the resident Asiatic ibex (Capra sibirica), leading to potential disease cross-transmission. Focussing on gastro-intestinal nematodes (GINs) as determinants of health in ungulates, we hypothesized that infection on pastures would increase over summer from contamination by migrating livestock. Consequently, interventions in livestock that are well-timed should reduce infection pressure for ibex. Using a parasite life-cycle model, that predicts infective larval availability, we investigated GIN transmission dynamics and evaluated potential interventions. Migratory livestock were predicted to contribute most infective larvae onto shared pastures due to higher density and parasite levels, driving infections in both livestock and ibex. The model predicted a c.30-day anti-parasitic intervention towards the end of the livestock's time in Pin would be most effective at reducing GINs in both hosts. Albeit with the caveats of not being able to provide evidence of interspecific parasite transmission due to the inability to identify parasite species, this case demonstrates the usefulness of our predictive model for investigating parasite transmission in landscapes where domestic and wild ungulates share pastures. Additionally, it suggests management options for further investigation.

AB  - The overabundance of large herbivores can have detrimental effects on the local environment due to overgrazing. Culling is a common management practice implemented globally that can effectively control herbivore populations and allow vegetation communities to recover. However, the broader indirect effects of culling large herbivores remain relatively unknown, particularly on insect species such as ground-dwelling beetles that perform key ecosystem processes such as decomposition. Here we undertook a preliminary investigation to determine how culling sika deer on an island in North Japan impacted ground-beetle community dynamics. We conducted pitfall trapping in July and September in 2012 (before culling) and again in 2019 (after culling). We compared beetle abundance and community composition within 4 beetle families (Carabidae, Scarabaeidae, Geotrupidae, and Silphidae), across seasons and culling treatments. We found each family responded differently to deer culling. Scarabaeidae displayed the greatest decline in abundance after culling. Silphidae also had reduced abundance but to a lesser extent compared to Scarabaeidae. Carabidae had both higher and lower abundance after culling, depending on the season. We found beetle community composition differed between culling and season, but seasonal variability was reduced after culling. Overall, the culling of large herbivores resulted in a reduction of ground-dwelling beetle populations, particularly necrophagous species dependent on dung and carrion for survival. Our preliminary research highlights the need for long-term and large-scale experiments to understand the indirect ecological implications of culling programs on ecosystem processes.

AB  - The degradation of ground vegetation cover caused by large grazing herbivores frequently results in enhanced erosion rates in forest ecosystems. Splash erosion can be caused by drop impacts with a high throughfall kinetic energy (TKE) from the tree canopy. Notably larger canopy drips from structurally mediated woody surface points appear to induce even higher TKE and generate concentrated impact locations causing severe focus points of soil erosion. However, TKE at these locations has rarely been reported. This pilot study investigated the intensity of TKE at a concentrated impact location and compared it with general TKE locations under the canopy and freefall kinetic energy (FKE) outside the forest. We measured precipitation, TKE and FKE using splash cups at seven locations under Japanese beech trees and five locations outside the forest during the leafless and leafed seasons in 2021 in a mixed forest with evergreen coniferous trees and deciduous broadleaved trees in Japan. The TKE at the concentrated impact location was 15.2 and 49.7 times higher than that at the general locations under the beech and FKE, respectively. This study confirmed that canopy drip from woody surfaces could be a hotspot of soil erosion in temperate forest ecosystems. Throughfall precipitation at the concentrated impact location was 11.4 and 8.1 times higher than that at general locations and freefall, respectively. TKE per 1 mm precipitation (here, "unit TKE") at the concentrated impact location (39.2 +/- 23.7 J m - 2 mm - 1 ) was much higher than that at general locations (22.0 +/- 12.7 J m - 2 mm - 1 ) and unit FKE (4.5 +/- 3.5 J m - 2 mm - 1 ). Unit TKE in the leafless season was significantly lower than in the leafed season because of fewer redistribution of canopy drips induced only by woody tissue. Nevertheless, unit TKE at the concentrated impact location in the leafless season (36.4 J m - 2 mm - 1 ) was still higher than at general locations in the leafed season. These results show that potentially high rates of sediment detachment can be induced not only by throughfall precipitation but also by larger throughfall drop size distributions at the concentrated impact location, even in the leafless season. Further studies with more replication building on this first report are necessary to investigate how many of these concentrated impact locations may occur on average with different tree species to better assess the extent of the erosion risk under forests.

AB  - Organic by-products are released into the surrounding soil during the terrestrial decomposition of animal remains. The affected area, known as the Cadaver Decomposition Island (CDI), can undergo biochemical changes that contribute to landscape heterogeneity. Soil bacteria are highly sensitive to labile inputs, but it is unknown how they respond to shifts in dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and quality resulting from animal decomposition. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between soil DOM composition and bacterial activity/function in CDIs under a Canadian temperate continental climate. This was studied in soils surrounding adult pig carcasses (n = 3) that were surface deposited within a mixed forested environment (Trois-Rivi & egrave;res, Qu & eacute;bec) in June 2019. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and dissolved organic carbon analyses, we detected a pulse of labile protein-like DOM during the summer season (day 55). This was found to be an important driver of heightened soil bacterial respiration, cell abundance and potential carbohydrate metabolism. These bacterial disturbances persisted into the cooler autumn season (day 156) and led to the gradual transformation of labile DOM inputs into microbially sourced humic-like compounds. By the spring (day 324), DOM quantities and bacterial measures almost recovered, but DOM quality remained distinct from surrounding vegetal humic signals. All observed effects were spatially constrained to the topsoil (A-horizon) and within 20 cm laterally from the carcasses. These findings provide valuable insight into CDI organic matter cycling within a cold-climate ecosystem. Repeated CDI studies will however be required to capture the changing dynamics resulting from increasing global temperatures.

AB  - Natural and planted forests differentially regulate soil quality through vegetation-soil interactions. The effects of four types of planting covers on soil nutrients, enzyme activities, and microbial communities in the Guangxi Camellia nitidissima National Nature Reserve were studied, revealing the multi-dimensional influences of natural (broadleaf, shrubland) and planted forests (bamboo, pine) on soil quality. Surface soils (0-10 cm depth) were characterized for physicochemical properties (pH, TC, TN, NO3--N, AP), enzyme activities (alpha-amylase, urease, phosphatase, beta-glucosidase), and microbial composition (using 16S rRNA and ITS region sequencing). Mantel tests and PLS-PM modeling were employed to investigate interactions among vegetation, soil variables, and microbes. Natural forests exhibited higher pH, nitrate nitrogen, and enzymatic activities (urease, phosphatase, beta-glucosidase) alongside enhanced carbon-nitrogen accumulation and reduced acidification. Planted forests showed elevated available phosphorus and nutrient supply but lower organic matter retention. Microbial communities displayed higher similarity within natural forests, with fungal composition strongly linked to total carbon/nitrogen (p < 0.05). Vegetation type positively influenced bacterial diversity but negatively affected fungal communities. Natural forests maintained critical soil-microbe-plant interactions supporting ecosystem resilience through carbon-nitrogen cycling, while planted forests fostered divergent microbial functionality despite short-term nutrient benefits. These findings underscore natural forests' unique role in preserving ecological stability and reveal fundamental limitations of artificial systems in mimicking microbially-mediated biogeochemical processes. Conservation policy should prioritize the protection of natural forests while simultaneously integrating microbial community management with vegetation restoration efforts to enhance long-term ecosystem functionality and nutrient cycling efficiency.

AB  - Landscape-scale agricultural intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Highly mobile species, such as aerial invertebrates may be disproportionately affected by land cover at large spatial scales due to their ability to disperse. Assessing the efficacy of environmentally friendly farming, such as Agri-Environment Schemes (AES), therefore, requires establishing the influence of land cover beyond focal farms or fields, contextualising the impact of agricultural management. This study measured the response of aerial invertebrate functional groups to AES management in improved and semi-improved upland grasslands accounting for spatial autocorrelation and multi-scale effects of land cover within buffers varying from 100 m to 5 km at 88 paired fields. Total aerial invertebrate abundance and diversity, including detritivores, herbivores, nectivores, predators and parasitoids all responded to different land cover types at varying scales indicative of highly complex and idiosyncratic functional group responses to landscape.After accounting for spatial autocorrelation and multi-scale landscape composition, total aerial invertebrate abundance was unaffected by agricultural management but diversity was (5%) higher in AES than conventionally managed fields. Detritivore (mostly Mycetophilidae fungus gnat) diversity and abundance were higher in AES than conventional fields, but only on improved grasslands, while predator (adult Muscidae house fly, Scathophagidae dung fly and Dolichopodidae long-legged fly) diversity was lower but abundance higher in AES than conventional fields. Aerial invertebrate herbivores (Anthomyiidae rootmaggot flies and Cecidomyiidae gall midges and gnats), nectivores (Syrphidae hoverflies and Apoidea bees) and parasitoids (Ichneumonidae wasps) responded to landscape composition, but not agricultural management. Synthesis and Applications: this study suggests that landscape composition drives aerial invertebrate functional group diversity and abundance at multiple spatial scales. Nevertheless, the responses of some functional groups (detritivores and predators) to local agricultural management suggest that AES management may contribute to the maintenance or enhancement of ecosystem service delivery (nutrient cycling and pest biocontrol). Explicitly accounting for multi-scale landscape effects is necessary when assessing the impact of agricultural management on highly mobile taxa.

AB  - Herbivores are an integral part of Arctic terrestrial ecosystems, driving ecosystem functioning and sustaining local livelihoods. In the context of accelerated climate warming and land use changes, understanding how herbivores contribute to the resilience of Arctic socio-ecological systems is essential to guide sound decision-making and mitigation strategies. While research on Arctic herbivory has a long tradition, recent literature syntheses highlight important geographical, taxonomic, and environmental knowledge gaps on the impacts of herbivores across the region. At the same time, climate change and limited resources impose an urgent need to prioritize research and management efforts. We conducted a horizon scan within the Arctic herbivory research community to identify emerging scientific and management priorities for the next decade. From 288 responses received from 85 participants in two online surveys and an in-person workshop, we identified 8 scientific and 8 management priorities centred on (a) understanding and integrating fundamental ecological processes across multiple scales from individual herbivore-plant interactions up to regional and decadal scale vegetation and animal population effects; (b) evaluating climate change feedbacks; and (c) developing new research methods. Our analysis provides a strategic framework for broad, inclusive, interdisciplinary collaborations to optimise terrestrial herbivory research and sustainable management practices in a rapidly changing Arctic.

AB  - At the end of 2020, 18 European bison (Bison bonasus) were introduced to El Encinarejo estate, in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. This hunting-oriented estate has 956 hectares of dehesa, Mediterranean forest and scrubland in which about 400 red deer (Cervus elaphus) and 200 fallow deer (Dama dama) coexist with the bison. To know how trophic resources are used by these herbivore species, faecal samples were collected during the year 2021. The microhistological analysis technique was used to determine the percentage of epidermal fragments of the main functional groups (woody plants, graminoids, legumes and forbs) in each sample. The results showed significant differences between animal species and seasons of the year. Globally, woody plants are preferentially consumed in autumn and winter, graminoids in summer and legumes and forbs in spring. The woody component was the most abundant in the diet of the three species, accounting for 81% of the plant fragments present in red deer faeces, 52% in bison and 38% in fallow deer. This is the first study describing the dietary use of Pistacia lentiscus by European bison, the substantial use throughout all seasons indicates it as a very important diet source. In addition, the interspecific comparison showed that the bison significantly consumed more graminoids (21%), whereas legumes were more present in fallow deer diet (32%). Finally, red deer consumed less forbs than the other two species (8%). It is concluded that there is a certain distribution of trophic resources between the three species that may facilitate their coexistence.

AB  - Species distributions are one of the fundamental factors needed for understanding and conserving wildlife. While the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the primary applied reference for biodiversity conservation, limitations in data availability and analyses of the distributions of some species may limit accurate threat classification assessments and conservation recommendations. Improving the accuracy of species distributions in light of growing data and analytical methods is a key step to increasing the efficacy of the Red List. In this study, we reassessed the distribution of takin (Budorcas taxicolor tibetana), a large ungulate in Sichuan Province, southwest China, classified by the IUCN as vulnerable. Using species distribution models and reported habitat requirements, we updated the takin distribution map. Our updated distribution range in the study area (79,449 km(2)) was 61.31% of the current distribution range (CDR) on the IUCN Red List. This reduction was in large part due to the inclusion in the CDR of substantial areas of lowland plains, high human disturbance, and non-forest habitat, which provide no suitable habitat for takin. According to our results, suitable takin habitat covered 18.97% of the CDR, suggesting a substantially overestimated distribution. However, there are high proportions of habitat (40%) still covered by the nature reserve network, indicating the importance of protected areas (PAs) in the conservation threaten species. We recommend that experts apply the basic approach presented herein to update the Red List distributions for more species to increase the accuracy of assessments and resulting conservation applications.

AB  - Protected natural forests are critical for biodiversity conservation, but they are threatened by pervasive drivers of change that may not be mitigated by legal protection. Selective herbivory by non-native or hyper-abundant browsing mammals can affect forest composition and structure by suppressing palatable species and facilitating avoided species. Impacts can be severe, especially on islands, like Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ), which historically lacked herbivorous mammals. We used a national network of permanent plots with a 12-year record of stem census data to determine how species-level dietary preference and site-level abundance of non-native herbivorous mammals (possums and ungulates) were associated with mortality rates and recruitment rates into a 2.5 cm diameter class among common tree species in forests with different levels of legal protection. National parks (NPs) had higher legal protection and lower herbivorous mammal indices than non-national parks (NNPs) but across both there were 1702 live stems of species palatable to possums and ungulates recorded when plots were first measured but 1502 in the latest measurements. Mortality of these species exceeded their recruitment in both NPs and NNPs. The total tree population was stable, but while most species palatable to ungulates and possums were in decline, some species avoided by the herbivores had growing populations, with recruitment rates exceeding mortality. At current levels of abundance, non-native herbivorous mammals are driving significant compositional shifts in tree populations of both NPs and NNPs. Long-term (decadal) suppression of their abundance is needed to preserve the ecological integrity of NZ's protected forests.

AB  - Hundreds of studies now document positive relationships between biodiversity and critical ecosystem processes, but as ecological communities worldwide shift toward new species configurations, less is known regarding how the biodiversity of undesirable species will shape the functioning of ecosystems or foundation species. We manipulated macroalgal species richness in experimental field plots to test whether and how the identity and diversity of competing macroalgae affected the growth, survival, and microbiome of a common coral in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Compared to controls without algal competitors, coral growth was significantly suppressed across three macroalgal monocultures, a polyculture of the same three macroalgae, and plots containing inert seaweed mimics; coral mortality was limited and did not differ significantly among treatments. One macroalga suppressed coral growth significantly less than the other two, but none differed from the inert mimic in terms of coral suppression. The composition, dispersion, and diversity of coral microbiomes in treatments with live macroalgae or inert plastic mimics did not differ from controls experiencing no competition. Microbiome composition differed between two macroalgal monocultures and a monoculture versus plastic mimics, but no other microbiome differences were observed among macroalgal or mimic treatments. Together, these findings suggest that algal diversity does not alter harmful impacts of macroalgae on coral performance, which could be accounted for by physical structure alone in these field experiments. While enhancing biodiversity is a recognized strategy for promoting desirable species, it would be worrisome if biodiversity also enhanced the negative impacts of undesirable species. We documented no such effects in this investigation.

AB  - Non-native ungulates (sheep, goats, and pigs) have significant negative impacts on ecosystem biodiversity, structure, and biogeochemical function throughout the Pacific Islands. Elevated nitrogen (N) availability associated with ungulate disturbance has been shown to promote the success of resource-exploitive invasive plants. While ungulate removal is a common restoration intervention, evaluations of its efficacy typically focus on vegetation responses, rather than underlying nutrient cycling. We used multiple chronosequences of ungulate exclusion (10-24 years duration) in three Hawaiian ecosystems (montane wet forest, dry forest, and dry shrubland) to determine N cycle recovery by characterizing gross mineralization and nitrification, soil inorganic N concentrations and leaching, N2O emissions, and plant tissue delta 15N. Ungulate removal led to a 1-2 parts per thousand decline in foliar delta 15N in most species, consistent with a long-term decrease in N fractionation via ecosystem N losses, or a shift in the relative turnover of N forms. This interpretation was supported by significant (dry forest) or trending (wet forest) increases in mineralization and decreases in nitrification, but conflicts with lack of observed change in inorganic N pool sizes or gaseous losses, and increased leaching in the dry forest. While results could indicate that ungulate invasions do not strongly impact N cycling in the first place (no uninvaded control sites exist in Hawai'i to test this hypothesis), this would be inconsistent with observations from other sites globally. Instead, impacts may be spatially patchy across the landscape, or ungulate invasions (possibly in combination with other disturbances) may have permanently shifted biogeochemical function or decoupled elemental cycles. We conclude that eliminating ungulate disturbance alone may not achieve restoration goals related to N cycling within the timeframe examined here.

AB  - Grassland ecosystems have declined in their extent globally, driving declines in wild ungulate populations. Even within the remnant grasslands, ungulate distribution is highly heterogeneous for reasons that are not well understood. This in turn undermines both local and landscape level conservation efforts for these often-neglected ecosystems and the herbivores they support. We investigated grassland-ungulate relationships in the Terai region of North India, where wild ungulates are patchily distributed across alluvial grasslands, a besieged ecosystem. Specifically, we posited that spatial variation in grassland habitat use by swamp deer (Rucervus duvaucelii duvaucelii), hog deer (Axis porcinus) and spotted deer (Axis axis) would be explained by community composition, palatability of key grasses, and fire and flooding regimes in grasslands. Hierarchical clustering and multivariate ordination revealed that three dominant tall-grass communities and the narrowly distributed and more palatable short grass Cynodon-Oryza community were only marginally influenced by fire and flood histories. Ungulate habitat use, assessed using occupancy models for spatially correlated data, indicated that hog deer were ubiquitously distributed across the grasslands in the park (habitat use probability, Psi = 0.92, SE = 0.05) utilizing a diverse range of grassland types, while spotted deer (Psi = 0.80, SE = 0.17) and swamp deer (Psi = 0.45, SE = 0.10) occurrence within grasslands was relatively lower. Grass height and grassland extent positively influenced habitat use of swamp deer and spotted deer, respectively. However, grassland community composition, fire history, flood history and palatability were relatively uninformative predictors of fine-scale habitat use. Our study provides a robust baseline for future monitoring of grasslands and ungulates as well as insights for the design and implementation of grassland management interventions.

AB  - The iconic Cape buffalo has experienced several documented population declines in recent history. These declines have been largely attributed to the late 19th century rinderpest pandemic. However, the effect of the rinderpest pandemic on their genetic diversity remains contentious, and other factors that have potentially affected this diversity include environmental changes during the Pleistocene, range expansions and recent human activity. Motivated by this, we present analyses of whole genome sequencing data from 59 individuals from across the Cape buffalo range to assess present-day levels of genome-wide genetic diversity and what factors have influenced these levels. We found that the Cape buffalo has high average heterozygosity overall (0.40%), with the two southernmost populations having significantly lower heterozygosity levels (0.33% and 0.29%) on par with that of the domesticated water buffalo (0.29%). Interestingly, we found that these lower levels are probably due to recent inbreeding (average fraction of runs of homozygosity 23.7% and 19.9%) rather than factors further back in time during the Pleistocene. Moreover, detailed investigations of recent demographic history show that events across the past three centuries were the main drivers of the exceptional loss of genetic diversity in the southernmost populations, coincident with the onset of colonialism in the southern extreme of the Cape buffalo range. Hence, our results add to the growing body of studies suggesting that multiple recent human-mediated impacts during the colonial period caused massive losses of large mammal abundance in southern Africa.

AB  - Sound management of native forests used for cattle grazing requires understanding the dynamics of forage productivity in the openings. Despite their importance, forage productivity drivers in highly heterogeneous forested landscapes, or their variability over the year, are still unclear. The aim of this work is to find predictors of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) variation in the openings of native temperate forests and to evaluate how these predictors change within the growing season. We used high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery from NW Patagonia to separate forest openings from tree dense canopy. We obtained data of each opening related with herbaceous and shrub forage productivity and calculated landscape metrics. We estimated a multiple linear regression model for predicting NDVI in each season. Beyond known variables related with forage productivity (altitude, precipitation, etc.), the shape of forest' openings appeared as relevant in predicting NDVI. Higher values of forest opening perimeters were related with a decrease in NDVI in spring when soil water content is not limiting and conversely with an increase in NDVI in summer when water is limiting growth. These results suggest that environmental drivers such as temperature and soil moisture inside the opening, and competition or facilitation process between trees and grasses are mediated by the shape of the opening. Management of heterogeneous native forests for cattle raising requires considering the shape of the openings to maximize forage productivity.

AB  - Theory suggests that eutrophication impacts plant community biodiversity by constraining niche differences and increasing competitive inequalities among species, leading to the exclusion of weaker competitors. However, explicit tests of nutrient effects on the strength and direction of inter- and intraspecific plant-plant interactions that dictate coexistence are lacking, especially in complex field settings where multiple processes can simultaneously affect plant growth and reproduction. We conducted a field experiment in southeastern Vancouver Island, Canada, using four annual grassland plant species to test how species interactions responded to eutrophication and the covariation of herbivore pressure and neighbour species light- and moisture-use. We found that focal species reproduction was limited by nutrient availability and herbivory, such that the nature of species interactions was context-dependent. Competitive interactions failed to predict species persistence under these conditions. Instead, facilitation was critical-phytometers grown without neighbours consistently failed to produce seed under herbivore pressure meaning that fecundity significantly increased with neighbour density. Synthesis. Our work demonstrates the importance of species interactions in plant community responses to eutrophication but emphasizes that 'indirect' drivers of plant performance may influence or overwhelm nutrient effects on plant-plant competition. The widespread occurrence of mortality overcome primarily by facilitation highlights the importance of positive density dependence. Overall, our results suggest that knowledge of resource niche overlap may be insufficient to explain plant community responses to eutrophication. This highlights the necessity of considering the broader environmental context when leveraging ecological theory to understand global change effects in empirical settings.
   Theory based on resource competition was insufficient to explain eutrophication-driven changes in grassland plant-plant interactions as multiple processes, especially herbivory, overwhelmed nutrient effects and increased the importance of facilitation.image

AB  - Three-quarters of the planet's land surface has been altered by humans, with consequences for animal ecology, movements and related ecosystem functioning. Species often occupy wide geographical ranges with contrasting human disturbance and environmental conditions, yet, limited data availability across species' ranges has constrained our understanding of how human pressure and resource availability jointly shape intraspecific variation of animal space use. Leveraging a unique dataset of 758 annual GPS movement trajectories from 375 brown bears (Ursus arctos) across the species' range in Europe, we investigated the effects of human pressure (i.e., human footprint index), resource availability and predictability, forest cover and disturbance, and area-based conservation measures on brown bear space use. We quantified space use at different spatiotemporal scales during the growing season (May-September): home range size; representing general space requirements, 10-day long-distance displacement distances, and routine 1-day displacement distances. We found large intraspecific variation in brown bear space use across all scales, which was profoundly affected by human footprint index, vegetation productivity, and recent forest disturbances creating opportunity for resource pulses. Bears occupied smaller home ranges and moved less in more anthropized landscapes and in areas with higher resource availability and predictability. Forest disturbances reduced space use while contiguous forest cover promoted longer daily movements. The amount of strictly protected and roadless areas within bear home ranges was too small to affect space use. Anthropized landscapes may hinder the expansion of small and isolated populations, such as the Apennine and Pyrenean, and obstruct population connectivity, for example between the Dinaric Pindos population and the Alpine or Carpathian population. Our findings call for actions to maintain bear movements across landscapes with high human footprint, for example by maintaining forest integrity, to support viable bear populations and their ecosystem functions.

AB  - The Mediterranean Basin has distinct vegetation types shaped by fire, herbivory, and various human activities. Based on data from 83 belt transects of 10 x 40 m in 28 study sites for five physiognomic vegetation types (semi-closed forest, open forest, closed shrubland, open shrubland, and scrubland) in southwestern Anatolia (Turkey), we analyzed woody species diversity, woody community composition, and vegetation structure of study sites. We used the growth form and regeneration strategy for functional comparisons of physiognomic vegetation types. We found clear distinctions in diversity, species composition, and functional structure of woody plant community across five physiognomic vegetation types. The forest-shrubland-scrubland distinction was the most apparent one. Despite similarities in the woody species richness and Shannon diversity, open and closed vegetation states of forests and shrublands also differed regarding the density and cover of mature individuals and the density of saplings in different functional groups. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses and indicator species analyses also indicated clear distinctions among physiognomic vegetation types and openness states. Our findings indicate the necessity of a more complex description of vegetation types in the Mediterranean Basin. The results suggest that open and closed vegetation states of forests and shrublands are functionally distinct vegetation types.

AB  - Recent decades, vegetation restoration initiatives and land institutional reforms have profoundly altered practices of livestock husbandry in China. However, the understanding of how livestock production affects restoration effectiveness remains limited, impeding the advancement of sustainable grazing management. Taking the Loess Plateau as a case area, this study aims to examine the impacts of livestock production on key ecosystem services (ESs) under the Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP). Based on an improved estimation of available biomass for livestock, grazing intensity across the study area in 2015 was quantified. Then, by linking grazing intensity with associated livestock economies, a comprehensive framework reflecting livestock production was constructed to analyze its overall impacts on three ESs (water yield, erosion control, and forage provision). Finally, spatial effects of each component within livestock production on the ESs were discussed to inform grazing managements under the GTGP. The results indicated that the three ESs still suffered widespread negative impacts from grazing intensity, with 9.82% of the region experiencing high-level grazing in 2015. Although grazing had potential to mitigate water consumption due to vegetation growth, livestock density of most areas has exceeded its threshold (0.52 sheep or goat per ha, or 0.30 cattle per ha) for maintaining available water resource. Livestock economies demonstrated positive effects on the ESs to varying degrees. Nevertheless, as the positive externalities from ecological compensation are on the wane, challenges in livestock management have surfaced in both poverty-stricken and large livestock-intensive regions. This study offers insights into assessing regional grazing intensity, and enriches understanding of impacts of livestock production under vegetation restoration.

AB  - 1. Although several studies have focused on the influence of moonlight on deer-vehicle collisions, findings have been inconsistent. This may be due to neglect of the effects of cloud cover, a major impediment to moon illumination and circannual variation in both deer and human activity.
   2. We assessed how median cloud cover interacted with the illuminated fraction of the moon in affecting daily roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) roadkill in Slovenia (Central Europe). Data included nationwide roadkill (n = 49,259), collected between 2010 and 2019 by hunters, as required by law.
   3. Roadkill peaked under medium to high cloud cover and decreased during nights with low or extremely high cloudiness. This pattern was more pronounced on nights with a full moon. However, the effects of moon illumination and cloud cover had a lower predictive potential than circannual variation, as collisions clearly peaked in April/May, July and August/September.
   4. Our results suggest that moonlight could influence roe deer movements through compensatory foraging. However, on nights with a full moon, collisions could also be affected by weather. On bright nights, roe deer might be less active due to increased human presence and sustained vehicular traffic. Then, with medium to high cloud cover and also rainfall, human presence in the environment may be low enough to increase deer movements, but vehicular traffic can still be intermediate, maximizing the risk of collisions. Finally, with overcast skies, widespread rainfall can reduce both traffic volume and human outdoor activity, decreasing the risk of collisions.
   5. Moon illumination may indeed affect wildlife-vehicle collisions and roadkill, but its effects should be quantified as a function of cloud cover. Moreover, to make studies truly comparable, research about wildlife-vehicle collisions should also account for time of the year.
   6. Policy implications. Because collisions with roe deer peak at particular periods of the year, signs should be installed seasonally. By doing so, they would warn drivers about the risk, improve drivers' awareness and increase their safety. Moreover, as collisions also increase on nights with a full moon and overcast skies, interactive warning signs that are activated by ground illumination should also be useful.

AB  - Grazing plays a key role in ecosystem biogeochemistry, particularly soil carbon (C) pools. The non-trophic interactions between herbivores and soil processes through herbivore trampling have recently attracted extensive attention. However, their concurrent and legacy effects on the ecosystem properties and processes are still not clear, due to their effects being hard to separate via field experiments. In this study, we conducted a 2-year simulated-sheep-trampling experiment with four trampling intensity treatments (i.e., T0, T40, T80, and T120 for 0, 40, 80, and 120 hoofprints m(-2), respectively) in a typical steppe to explore the concurrent and legacy effects of trampling on grassland ecosystem properties and processing. In 2017 (trampling treatment year), we found that trampling decreased aboveground biomass (AGB) of plant community and community-weighted mean shoot C concentration (CWM C), soil available nitrogen (N) and available phosphorus (P), but did not affect plant species diversity and belowground biomass (BGB). We show that compared with T0, trampling increased soil bulk density (BD) at T80, and decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. After the cessation of trampling for two years (i.e., in 2019), previous trampling increased plant diversity and BGB, reaching the highest values at T80, but decreased soil available N and available P. Compared with T0, previous trampling significantly increased soil BD at T120, while significantly decreased CWM C at T80 and T120, and reduced SOC stocks at T80. Compared with 2017, the trampling negative legacy effects amplified at T80 but weakened at T40 and T120. We also show that trampling-induced decreases in soil available N, AGB of Fabaceae and CWM C were the main predictors of decreasing SOC stocks in 2017, while previous trampling-induced legacy effects on soil available P, AGB of Poaceae and CWM C contributed to the variations of SOC stocks in 2019. Taken together, short-term trampling with low intensity could maintain most plant functions, while previous trampling with low intensity was beneficial to most plant and soil functions. The results of this study show that T40 caused by sheep managed at a stocking rate of 2.7 sheep ha(-1) is most suitable for grassland adaptive management in the typical steppe. The ecosystem functions can be maintained under a high stocking rate through the process of providing enough time to rebuild sufficient vegetation cover and restore soil through measures such as regional rotational grazing and seasonal grazing.

AB  - The ability for migratory fishes to move commonly limiting resources such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) between discrete environments can have pronounced effects on recipient ecosystems. To further understand the geographic and taxonomic scope of migratory fish resource subsidies, we quantified N and P subsidies delivered by adfluvial suckers (Smallmouth Buffalo, Ictiobus bubalus) via excretion, eggs and carcasses to a small oligotrophic stream during their annual spawning migration. We also compared nutrient inputs from migrant buffalo with watershed nutrient export to assess the likelihood that delivered nutrients were ecologically important. We estimated that approximately 67,000 buffalo delivered 730 kg of N and 80 kg of P to Citico Creek as a result of excretion and egg subsidies across three migration waves. We estimated that carcasses delivered negligible amounts of N and P due to extremely low retention. The ratio of migrant inputs (M-w) to system export (E-w; M-w/E-w) varied amongst three migration waves and compounds (i.e. dissolved inorganic nitrogen, ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus), with values for M-w/E-w ranging from 0.25 to 5.10, reflecting the potential of nutrient subsidies to exceed nutrients exported from the system under certain conditions. Our findings suggest that suckers have the potential to deliver large resource subsidies to their spawning habitats and that these subsidies may be ecologically important, thus warranting additional consideration of the functional relevance of nongame fishes and their migrations.

AB  - Seismic lines in western Canada's boreal region are linear disturbances that affect the habitat of threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). To hasten the return of forest cover and ultimately to restore caribou habitat, restoration managers use silviculture treatments in wet areas that involve the mechanical mounding of seismic lines to create artificial hummocks. Tree planting then takes place on top of these hummocks. However, the effectiveness of this silviculture technique for restoring seismic lines in peatlands is largely untested. Here we sampled incremental height growth of coniferous seedlings at 41 seismic line plots in poor and rich treed fens in northeast Alberta, Canada. We compared lines that had been treated with inverted mounding (a type of mechanical mounding) and subsequent tree planting, to nearby lines that were left untreated for natural recovery. We used generalized linear mixed models to test the effect of silviculture treatments on 5-year growth increments of black spruce (Picea mariana) and tamarack (Larix laricina). Overall, we found that mounding and tree planting improved seedling growth compared to seismic lines regenerating naturally. However, growth responses were found to vary by species, ecosite, initial seedling size, and light availability. This suggests that site-specific prioritization of mounding within peatlands may be more efficient considering the widespread nature of seismic lines. Future experiments testing growth responses to other mounding techniques that are designed to preserve the soil profile. It is also important for managers to weigh restoration goals beyond tree establishment and an accelerated return to forest cover.

AB  - The Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) is a vast area of the central Pacific Ocean where the abyssal seabed is a focus for future polymetallic nodule mining. Broad-scale environmental gradients occur east-to-west across the CCZ seabed, including organic matter supply and nodule abundance, factors that influence benthic faunal community structure and function. A network of protected areas across the CCZ, called Areas of Particular Environmental Interest (APEIs), has been designated to cover this variation. Most previous studies of the benthic environment and megafaunal communities have focussed on the eastern CCZ, leaving the impact of these large-scale gradients unexamined and the network design untested. Seamounts are a further source of heterogeneity in the region. We examined the benthic megafaunal ecology of three APEIs in the western CCZ, spanning a range of environmental conditions. We used a combination of seabed photography and direct sampling to assess the environment and megafauna on the soft sediment habitats on the abyssal plain in three APEIs, and seamounts in two of those APEIs. We found that environmental conditions on abyssal plains differed between the three APEIs in terms of water depth, nodule abundance and coverage, sediment particle size distribution, and estimated organic matter flux. Megafauna were low density and high diversity, with few common morphotypes between sites and many morphotypes being observed only once. Xenophyophores dominated the assemblages. The density and diversity of invertebrates were greater at the sites with lower organic matter inputs and greater nodule abundance. Seamounts in the same APEIs were nodule-free and had coarser sediments than on the plain. Invertebrate megafaunal diversity was lower on the seamounts than on the plains, and most morphotypes recorded on the seamounts were only found on seamounts. Low morphotype overlap also suggests little connectivity between APEIs, and between seamounts and adjacent abyssal plains. Our results provide the first evaluation of the seabed habitats and megafaunal ecology in the western CCZ, highlighting environmental gradients that influence benthic communities, and are important for evaluating the design of the network of protected areas.

AB  - Estimating abundance is a key component of wildlife management and capture-mark-recapture (CMR) methods are commonly used. Photography has been widely explored as a method of 'marking' individuals for CMR. However, it is most often used on species with unique markings, and application to species without obvious marks remains challenging. We tested a likelihood-based photogrammetric method to identify individuals from four species of ungulates: muskox (Ovibos moschatus; 31 photos of 16 individuals), thinhorn sheep (Ovis dalli; 110 photos of 32 individuals), mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus; 47 photos of 19 individuals) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus; 60 photos of 30 individuals). Misidentification rates (false rejection [FRR] and false acceptance [FAR] rates) varied widely between species (FRR = < 1-13%, FAR = 2-22%), as did matching success rates (48-96%). Muskox and sheep had the highest matching success rates (96% and 88%, respectively), while those for goats (80%) and deer (58%) were lower. Automated matching success rate for deer and sheep, calculated based on the top-ranked photograph, was compared to a user-generated matching success rate. The latter was significantly higher in all cases, indicating that the final subjective step was important. Significant observer bias was found for deer, but not sheep. The main findings of our study were that a photogrammetric approach to individual recognition of ungulates was species specific and sensitive to the inclusion of horn measurements, season, photo quality, and final selection from top choices by the user. While matching success rates of photogrammetry was reasonably good (> 90%) for muskox, it was only moderately accurate 80-90% for sheep and goats, and poor (< 80%) for deer. Future work should address the temporal stability of horn measurements, seasonal effects, feasibility of capturing useable photographs from remote cameras, and application to other species.

AB  - In many areas of the boreal forests and temperate mountains of Canada, resource extraction activities have created forage conditions that are favourable to the growth of moose (Alces alces) populations. In turn, these increased moose populations buoy the abundance of wolves (Canis lupus), which then have negative impacts on caribou (Rangifer tarandus) populations. Consequently, caribou have been declining where increased resource extraction, moose, and wolves occur. To abate unsustainable predation pressure on caribou by wolves, the moose hunting quota was expanded for 17 years to reduce and then stabilize the moose population in the Revelstoke Valley, British Columbia, Canada. However, a reduction in forestry activity paired with habitat protections slowed the early seral conditions that favour moose. Consequently, both hunter-caused mortality and habitat loss may have been contributing to observed moose declines that occurred during this period. Within this changing regulatory and biophysical landscape, we sought to address two research objectives. First, we evaluated how increasing the moose hunting quota influenced the total yield of harvested animals. We expected that density-dependent responses by the moose population would bolster the number of harvestable animals on the landscape. Second, we tested how different forest harvest scenarios might influence moose habitat, wolf densities, and thus caribou population growth rates into future decades. We used data from moose GPS collars (39 individuals), eight aerial population surveys, hunter harvest statistics, estimates of carrying capacity thresholds, and forest harvest records. The latter data series spanned 1961-2020 and informed the resource selection function and calculations for our first research objective as well as the predictive modelling for our second research objective. Between 2003 and 2020, we found that the habitat amounts for moose declined by 44.8%. There were 42% more moose harvested under increased moose hunting quotas than were projected to be harvested under a simulated status quo quota. As the moose population declined and stabilized, we observed higher recruitment rates (e.g. calf:cow ratios) that further contributed to the number of harvested moose. Our simulations indicated that the only forest harvesting scenario where moose carrying capacity would be low enough to stabilize caribou population growth rates by 2040 was to cease forest harvesting entirely in 2020. Practical implication: an increased observed moose harvest quota mitigated the negative effects of forestry on caribou, aided in caribou recovery, and struck a balance that also provided food security and recreational opportunities for moose harvesters.

AB  - Fields dominated by nonnative grasses, such as tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus), are being restored to native plant communities across the eastern U.S. Upon restoration, disturbance is necessary to maintain native communities in an early seral stage, and plant response to different management practices is of interest to managers to guide habitat enhancement for various wildlife species. We evaluated effects of burning and mowing following restoration of native plant communities via 2 methods (planting native grasses and forbs and seedbank response without planting), across 11 replicated sites in Tennessee and Alabama, 2019-2020. We compared vegetation composition and structure, openness at ground level, forage availability, and nutritional carrying capacity (NCC) following 4 treatments (Seedbank Burned, Seedbank Mowed, Planted Burned, Planted Mowed, and tall fescue Control), and we related these measurements to the food and cover requirements for 3 popular game species: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). The combination of planting and mowing increased grass coverage, whereas units that were established via seedbank response and managed by burning had greater forb coverage. Visual obstruction above 25 cm was greater in all treatments than Control, which provided cover that has been described as selected nesting cover by wild turkey and bedding cover for deer. Openness at ground level, which is especially important for bobwhite and wild turkey broods, was 30% greater in Seedbank Burned than Planted Mowed where we recorded the least openness among treatments by the second year of treatment. Similarly, coverage of bobwhite food and deer forage plant species was greatest in Seedbank Burned. Biomass (kg/ha) of plant species known to be selected as forage by deer was greater in all treatments than in Control, and NCC (deer days/ha) was greatest in Seedbank Burned by year 2. Our results highlight differences in plant composition and structure following management of early successional communities. Where possible, we encourage managers to use fire instead of mowing to maintain plant communities, especially if food plants and enhanced structure at multiple levels for bobwhite, wild turkey, and deer are management objectives. Furthermore, our results illustrate planting native grasses and forbs is not necessary to restore native early successional plant communities on most sites.

AB  - The exclusion of herbivores in forest areas is a strategy used to reduce the impact of selective browsing and increase the regeneration of desired plant species. On Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada), selective browsing by white-tailed deer prevents the regeneration of balsam fir - white birch forests leading to their conversion into white spruce forests. Large deer exclosures were established for ca 10-12 years in clear-cuts with patches of residual forest from 2001 to 2006 to assist in the natural regeneration of fir stands and to provide shelter and food resources for deer. Our objective was to assess how deer use exclosures after the removal of fences according to their spatial configuration and habitat composition. We randomly distributed automatic cameras for periods of 14 days during summer in six exclosures ranging from 3.1 to 11.2 km(2) (n = 25 cameras per exclosure) from which deer were reduced for 10-12 years. We compared candidate occupancy models that included spatial configuration and food resource variables while simultaneously controlling for variables affecting detection probability. We obtained weak evidence that deer habitat use increased by 19% when forage resources, represented by the cover of Cornus canadensis, increased from 0 to 100%. None of the other variables (distance between the border of exclosures and cameras and distance between forest patches and cameras) was retained, suggesting that the use of regenerating forests by deer in summer after a period of exclusion is related to forage availability and therefore, any forest management that improves food production during summer should help maintain or increase habitat use by deer.

AB  - Sustainable ecosystem management relies on our ability to predict changes in plant diversity and to understand the underlying mechanisms. Empirical evidence demonstrates that abundance- and functional-based processes simultaneously explain the loss of plant diversity in response to human activities. Recently, a novel indicator based on percent cover (Cover(D)) and maximum height (Height(D)) of the dominant plant species - space resource utilization (SRUD) - has proven to give robust and better predictions of plant diversity dynamics than community biomass. Whether the superior predictive ability of SRUD is due to its capacity to simultaneously capture abundance- and functional-based processes remains unknown. Here, we tested this hypothesis by quantifying mechanistic links between changes in SRUD and biodiversity in response to nutrients and herbivores. Furthermore, we assessed the relative contribution of dominant, intermediate and rare species to reduced density of individuals by combining null model analysis with field experiments. We found that SRUD successfully captured changes in ground-level light availability and changes in the number of individuals to predict plant diversity dynamics, and each of Cover(D) and Height(D) partly and independently contributed to both processes. Comparative results from null model analysis and field experiments confirmed that individual losses of dominant, intermediate and rare species followed non-random processes. Specifically, compared with random loss process, rare species lost proportionally more individuals and thus disproportionately contributed to species loss, while dominant and intermediate species lost less. Our results demonstrate that SRUD captures both abundance- and functional-based processes thus explaining why SRUD provides more accurate predictions of changes in species diversity. Given that rare species can play an important role in shaping community structure, resisting against invasion, impacting higher trophic levels and providing multiple ecosystem functions, reducing the SRU of dominant species could alleviate the risk of exclusion of rare species by mitigating abundance- and functional-based competition processes.

AB  - Vegetation treatments have been widely implemented in efforts to enhance conditions for wildlife populations. Yet the effectiveness of such efforts often lack rigorous evaluations to determine whether these practices are effective for targeted species. This is particularly important when manipulating wildlife habitats in ecosystems that are faced with multiple stressors. The sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystem has been altered extensively over the last century leading to declines of many associated species. Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata wyomingensis) is the most widely distributed subspecies, providing important habitats for sagebrush-obligate and associated wildlife. Sagebrush often has been treated with chemicals, mechanical treatments, and prescribed burning to increase herbaceous forage species released from competition with sagebrush overstory. Despite many studies documenting negative effects of sagebrush control on greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat, treatments are still proposed as a means of improving habitat for sage-grouse and other sagebrush-dependent species. Furthermore, most studies have focused on vegetation response and none have rigorously evaluated the direct influence of these treatments on sage-grouse. We initiated a 9-year (2011-2019) experimental study in central Wyoming, USA, to better understand how greater sage-grouse respond to sagebrush reduction treatments in Wyoming big sagebrush communities. We evaluated the influence of 2 common sagebrush treatments on greater sage-grouse demography and resource selection. We implemented mowing and tebuthiuron application in winter and spring 2014 and evaluated the pre- (2011-2013) and post-treatment (2014-2019) responses of sage-grouse relative to these management actions. We evaluated responses to treatments using demographic and behavioral data collected from 620 radio-marked female greater sage-grouse. Our specific objectives were to evaluate how treatments influenced 1) sage-grouse reproductive success and female survival; 2) sage-grouse nesting, brood-rearing, and female resource selection; 3) vegetation responses; and 4) forbs and invertebrates. Our results generally suggested neutral demographic responses and slight avoidance by greater sage-grouse in response to Wyoming big sagebrush treated by mowing and tebuthiuron. Neither mowing nor tebuthiuron treatments influenced nest survival, brood survival, or female survival. Selection for nest and brood-rearing sites did not differ before and after treatments. Females selected habitats near treatments before and after they were implemented; however, the strength of selection was lower after treatments compared with pre-treatment periods, which may be explained by a lack of response in vegetation and invertebrates following treatments. Perennial grass cover and height varied temporally yet did not vary systematically between treatment and control plots. Forb cover and species richness varied annually but not in relation to either treatment type. Perennial grass cover and height, forb cover, and forb species richness did not increase within mowed or tebuthiuron-treated areas that received 2 or 6 years of grazing rest compared with areas that received no grazing rest. Finally, forb and invertebrate dry mass did not differ between treated plots and control plots at mowing or tebuthiuron sites in any years following treatments.
   Results from our study add to a large body of evidence that sage-grouse using Wyoming big sagebrush vegetation communities do not respond positively to sagebrush manipulation treatments. Management practices that focus on the maintenance of large, undisturbed tracts of sagebrush will best facilitate the persistence of sage-grouse populations and other species reliant on the sagebrush steppe.

AB  - BackgroundThe Mediterranean basin is currently facing major changes in fire regimes as a result of climate and land-use changes. These alterations could affect the ability of forests to recover after a fire, hence triggering degradation processes and modifying the provision of fundamental ecosystem services. Examining patterns and drivers of post-fire forest recovery, particularly for obligate seeders without specific fire-adaptive traits, thus becomes a priority for researchers and land managers. We studied the post-fire dynamics of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands affected by a mixed-severity fire in North-Western Italy, aiming to understand the impact of fire on soil properties and assess drivers, spatial distribution, and characteristics of short-term post-fire recovery.ResultsWe observed that fire did not significantly affect soil organic carbon (OC) content, while we detected significantly lower nitrogen (N) content in severely burnt sites. Regeneration density was particularly abundant in medium-severity areas, while it drastically decreased in high-severity patches. The most abundant tree species in the regeneration layer was Scots pine, followed by goat willow (Salix caprea L.), European aspen (Populus tremula L.), and, to a lesser extent, European larch (Larix decidua Mill.). Slope, fire severity, and distance from seed trees emerged as the most important drivers of post-fire forest regeneration patterns.ConclusionsOur results highlight the importance of preserving seed trees from salvage logging, even if they are damaged and have a low survival probability. Active post-fire management, such as tree planting, should be limited to large and severely burnt patches, where natural forest regeneration struggles to settle, increasing the risk of ecosystem degradation. These findings could be useful for informing land managers, helping them to enhance potential mitigation strategies in similar ecosystems and plan appropriate restoration approaches.

AB  - Understanding the factors influencing species range limits is increasingly crucial in anticipating migrations due to human-caused climate change. In the boreal biome, ongoing climate change and the associated increases in the rate, size, and severity of disturbances may alter the distributions of boreal tree species. Notably, Interior Alaska lacks native pine, a biogeographical anomaly that carries implications for ecosystem structure and function. The current range of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) in the adjacent Yukon Territory may expand into Interior Alaska, particularly with human assistance. Evaluating the potential for pine expansion in Alaska requires testing constraints on range limits such as dispersal limitations, environmental tolerance limits, and positive or negative biotic interactions. In this study, we used field experiments with pine seeds and transplanted seedlings, complemented by model simulations, to assess the abiotic and biotic factors influencing lodgepole pine seedling establishment and growth after fire in Interior Alaska. We found that pine could successfully recruit, survive, grow, and reproduce across our broadly distributed network of experimental sites. Our results show that both mammalian herbivory and competition from native tree species are unlikely to constrain pine growth and that environmental conditions commonly found in Interior Alaska fall well within the tolerance limits for pine. If dispersal constraints are released, lodgepole pine could have a geographically expansive range in Alaska, and once established, its growth is sufficient to support pine-dominated stands. Given the impacts of lodgepole pine on ecosystem processes such as increases in timber production, carbon sequestration, landscape flammability, and reduced forage quality, natural or human-assisted migration of this species is likely to substantially alter responses of Alaskan forest ecosystems to climate change.

AB  - Cattle (Bos taurus) grazing is often excluded from restored grasslands due to potential risks to grassland recovery. This restriction has often been applied to the 5.6 million acres of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) plantings designed to restore native grassland plant communities on former cropland. Because large herbivores historically played a key role in maintaining these grassland systems, excluding such grazers may hamper recovery of plant compositional and structural heterogeneity important to wildlife. We conducted a grazing experiment on 108 CRP sites in Kansas, quantifying the effects of periodic cattle grazing on plant communities restored via two CRP conservation practices (CP2, Establishment of Permanent Native Grasses and CP25, Rare and Declining Habitat) across a broad precipitation gradient. Cattle grazing was implemented during the growing season on 53 of the 108 sites in 2017-2018 with rest from grazing in 2019. Grazing reduced vegetation biomass and increased vegetation structural heterogeneity in 2017 and 2018. Grazing effects on plant community composition, specifically shifts in dominant grass abundances, were observed in 2018 but not 2017 or 2019. These effects were subtle and did not result in consistent changes to plant species richness, non-native abundance, or floristic quality. The effects of conservation practice were independent of grazing but strongly dependent on mean annual precipitation. Plant community composition differed significantly between CP2 and CP25 in the western (drier) and eastern (wetter) regions, but no differences were detected in the central region. Forb cover increased with precipitation at a greater rate on CP25 than CP2, indicating greater forb establishment in the eastern region. These results indicate that moderate, short-term grazing can enhance habitat structural heterogeneity that may be beneficial for wildlife while causing minimal plant community changes.

AB  - The arrival of Bison in North America significantly affected competitive relationships among herbivores and may have played an important role in the eventual extinction of contemporaneous Pleistocene megafaunal taxa. To investigate the dietary ecology of fossil bison and examine the potential for such an ecological impact, we analyzed the stable carbon and oxygen isotope composition of Bison latifrons and Bison antiquus tooth enamel from four regions with distinct climatic settings and vegetation. Newly sampled regions include American Falls, Idaho; Diamond Valley Lake, California; Central Florida; and Snowmastodon, Colorado. The Snowmastodon site contains the highest elevation assemblage known to contain B. latifrons. We compared this new isotopic dataset to all available published isotopic data for Pleistocene Bison sp. B. latifrons and B. antiquus were found to have isotopically similar diets when recovered from the same regions. Both species of bison consumed C4 vegetation but incorporated significant proportions of C3 plants into their diets based on mean delta 13C values. Independent paleobotanical records support the interpretation that the majority of specimens exhibited mixed feeding behavior. We detected statistically significant differences in bison diets between regions that correspond to mean annual temperatures. Serial oxygen sampling indicates different degrees of seasonal variation in the meteoric waters consumed by bison in each of the newly sampled regions. Bison from Diamond Valley Lake and Snowmastodon exhibit the strongest signals of seasonal differences in vegetation consumption, while animals from American Falls and Central Florida consumed similar vegetation year-round. Our results confirm the hypothesis that Pleistocene Bison exhibited more malleable dietary and habitat requirements than previously assumed. This dietary plasticity allowed Pleistocene bison to compete with other species of the North American megafauna until their eventual replacement by the modern Bison bison.

AB  - Invasive plants threaten biodiversity worldwide, but control of non-native species may affect native species in complex ways. Non-native tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) is widespread in western US riparian environments, and tamarisk beetles (Diorhabda spp.), a tamarisk-specific herbivore, were subsequently introduced as biocontrol. The primary effect of biocontrol is defoliation and branch die-back, with repeated defoliation killing the plant. We investigated the initial stages of site recovery after biocontrol and how tamarisk decline affected birds, their arthropod prey, and microclimate. We compared avian community diversity and composition, arthropod abundance, humidity, and temperature at sites along the Virgin River in Nevada and Arizona, USA characterized as either mixed native vegetation, tamarisk-dominated, or tamarisk-dominated where the majority of tamarisk died from biocontrol. We compared avian communities sampled after biocontrol to counts at the same locations before biocontrol. Prior to biocontrol, community compositions of all but one site grouped together using unbiased clustering algorithms. Following biocontrol, tamarisk-dominated sites grouped separately, and mixed sites grouped with the pre-biocontrol cluster. Comparison of pre- and post-biocontrol communities showed 7 common species declined by >= 30% in dead tamarisk sites, while one species did so at mixed sites and 3 at tamarisk-dominated sites. Individual census points in dead tamarisk had significantly lower Simpson diversity than the same points censused before biocontrol, unless native vegetation was present, suggesting tamarisk death was the cause of dominant species abundance changes. Tamarisk-dominated sites were hotter and drier than sites with native vegetation and supported fewer non-tamarisk-obligate arthropods, consistent with the hypothesis that bird reductions were driven by changes in microclimate and prey abundance. How long these effects last will depend upon the rate of native vegetation recovery after biocontrol, therefore we recommend monitoring sites to determine the trajectory of vegetative recovery and considering the need and feasibility of active restoration in those sites with slow or no native regeneration.

AB  - Ecological models predict that the effects of mammalian herbivore exclusion on plant diversity depend on resource availability and plant exposure to ungulate grazing over evolutionary time. Using an experiment replicated in 57 grasslands on six continents, with contrasting evolutionary history of grazing, we tested how resources (mean annual precipitation and soil nutrients) determine herbivore exclusion effects on plant diversity, richness and evenness. Here we show that at sites with a long history of ungulate grazing, herbivore exclusion reduced plant diversity by reducing both richness and evenness and the responses of richness and diversity to herbivore exclusion decreased with mean annual precipitation. At sites with a short history of grazing, the effects of herbivore exclusion were not related to precipitation but differed for native and exotic plant richness. Thus, plant species' evolutionary history of grazing continues to shape the response of the world's grasslands to changing mammalian herbivory.
   A NutNet experiment in 57 grasslands across six continents shows that when herbivores are excluded from grasslands with a long coevolutionary history of grazing plant diversity is reduced, while in grasslands without a long grazing history the evolutionary history of the plant species regulates the response of plant diversity.

AB  - Traditional approaches to guiding decisions about harvesting bushmeat often employ single-species population dynamic models, which require species- and location-specific data, are missing ecological processes such as multi-trophic interactions, cannot represent multi-species harvesting and cannot predict the broader ecosystem impacts of harvesting. In order to explore an alternative approach to devising sustainable harvesting strategies, we employ the Madingley general ecosystem model, which can simulate ecosystem dynamics in response to multi-species harvesting given nothing other than location-specific climate data. We used the model to examine yield, extinctions and broader ecosystem impacts, for a range of harvesting intensities of duiker-sized endothermic herbivores. Duiker antelope (such as Cephalophus callipygus and Cephalophus dorsalis) are the most heavily hunted species in sub-Saharan Africa, contributing 34-95% of all bushmeat in the Congo Basin. Across a range of harvesting rates, the Madingley model gave estimates for optimal harvesting rate, and extinction rate, that were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the estimates from conventional single-species Beverton-Holt model. Predicted yields were somewhat greater (around five times, on average) for the Madingley model than the Beverton-Holt, which is partly attributable to the fact that the Madingley simulates multi-species harvesting from an initially pristine ecosystem. Also, the Madingley model predicted a background local extinction probability for the target species of at least 10%. At medium and high levels of harvesting of duiker-sized herbivores, the Madingley model predicted statistically significant, but moderate, reductions in the densities of the targeted functional group; increases in small-bodied herbivores; decreases in large-bodied carnivores; and minimal ecosystem-level impacts overall. The results illustrate how general ecosystem models such as the Madingley model could potentially be used more widely to help estimate sustainable harvesting rates, bushmeat yields and broader ecosystem impacts across different locations and target species.

AB  - Many animals living in anthropized landscapes try to avoid encountering people by being active at night. By doing so, however, they risk being disturbed while at rest during the day. To mitigate this risk, diurnally resting species may be highly selective about where they rest. Here, we used GPS and activity sensors to study how wild boars (Sus scrofa) might adjust their resting site selection and revisitation patterns to the risk of disturbance by people. We evaluated the probability of daytime relocation to assess the efficacy of wild boars' resting strategy in reducing the risk of human encounter while at rest. We attempted to identify the cause of some relocations using audio recordings. Generally, we found that wild boars did not specifically avoid resting near villages or roads, that is, where the risk of encountering people is higher, if they could find sites with suitable vegetation cover. The risk of disturbance by people was low, even near villages. Resting sites located close to villages were visited more repeatedly than those located further away, suggesting that focusing on a few familiar and quiet resting sites was a successful strategy for resting undisturbed in an anthropized landscape.

AB  - Goats are being used increasingly to manage woody invasive plants in woodland habitats, but their specific impacts on those plants over a period of time during active, periodic browsing has not been documented. This study investigated bark-stripping by goats browsing on common buckthorn in savanna habitats (75 goats/hectare, 5 to 7 days), focusing on possible size-selective feeding and the cumulative effects of repeated, periodic browsing over a 3-year period. When surveyed after the first browsing period, bark was stripped selectively on buckthorn stems 20 to 60 mm in diameter. Approximately 60% of all stripped stems were completely girdled, but only 14-17% of stems were bark-stripped. After five browsing periods, 66% of standing stems displayed bark stripping and 39% were completely girdled. Buckthorn densities were reduced by 90% compared to the first browsing period, the decline resulting mostly from consumption of foliage and terminal shoots of small (< 20 mm) buckthorn and bark-stripping resulting in top-kill in intermediate-sized (20-60 mm) plants. Large buckthorn (> 60 mm) were largely unimpacted by goats. Relatively few (28%) seedling buckthorn were browsed by goats, although > 90% of 2nd-year plants were browsed. Buckthorn can be managed in part via goat browsing, but repeated, periodic browsing over 3 to 6 years may be necessary to produce a significant reduction in plant abundance, and other techniques will be needed to eliminate large, seed-producing plants.

AB  - Management of feral animals can be complicated by conflicting economic, social, cultural and political values of stakeholders. To visually demonstrate the ecological impacts of feral ungulates, natural resource managers often construct exclusion fences; however, lessons are not often widely shared in the scientific literature and Indigenous insights are rarely recorded. Here, we report on long-term (7-11 years) feral buffalo and pig exclusion fences that were constructed by the Yirralka Rangers in ephemeral coastal wetlands of the Laynhapuy Indigenous Protected Area, northern Australia. Elevation transects across fence boundaries suggested that feral ungulates may be eroding floodplains and therefore reducing elevation. Comparisons of intermittent photos and contemporary inside-outside fence floristic assessments suggested that feral ungulates have an obvious and significant effect on vegetation cover and composition which may also inhibit natural soil accretion. Interviews with senior Indigenous knowledge holders revealed that feral ungulate culling was broadly supported due to impacts on cultural and spiritual values. Synthesis of the results suggested that feral ungulates are having substantial impacts on the cultural use, flora and soil stabilisation of coastal wetlands. Further research on soil erosion and accretion in places with and without ungulates will elucidate the effects of ungulates on potential sea-level rise resilience of coastal wetlands. This paper highlights the benefits of cross-cultural and collaborative multi-disciplinary research such as producing holistic outcomes relevant to stakeholders that can inform management decisions.

AB  - Slugs are fungivores, herbivores, carnivores and decomposers that provide important ecosystem services and disservices in natural and disturbed habitats. Our aim was to estimate the effects of local vegetation structure (tree basal area and canopy openness) and landscape composition (land cover types) on the occurrence of native and non-native slugs in 13 cool-temperate forested wetlands across Nova Scotia, Canada. We collected 1437 slugs of eight species (five non-native species and three native species). The non-native Arion subfuscus and Arion fuscus were dominant, and together represented 84.3% of all the slugs collected. The native Deroceras laeve and the non-native Arion hortensis were also relatively common. Among Arion species A. subfuscus was positively associated with open wetlands within a 1000 m radius, whereas A. fuscus and A. hortensis were positively associated with road density within 250 and 750 m radii, respectively. The native species Deroceras laeve and Pallifera dorsalis did not respond to local vegetation and landscape composition. These findings suggest that forested wetlands across Nova Scotia are dominated by non-native Arion species that benefit from road systems and non-forested habitats in the surrounding landscape. The absence of effect on the native species D. laeve and P. dorsalis suggests these species can forage in multiple mainly forested habitats that were the dominant land use types in the studied landscapes. Such information is crucial to fill knowledge gaps and support priority actions for tackling biological invasions at appropriate spatial scales.

AB  - Extinctions are predicted to rise by an order of magnitude over the next century. Although contemporary documented extinctions are uncommon, local extirpations likely provide hints about global extinction risks. Comparing responses to global change of locally extinct versus extant species pairs in a phylogenetic framework could highlight why certain species are more vulnerable to extinction than others and which anthropogenic changes are most relevant to their decline. As anthropogenic changes likely interact to affect population declines, demographic studies partitioning the effects of multifactorial stressors are needed but remain rare. I examine demographic responses to nitrogen addition and deer herbivory, two major drivers of species losses in grasslands, in experimental reintroductions of 14 locally extinct and extant confamilial native plants from Michigan prairies. Nitrogen consistently reduces survival, especially in locally extinct species, and growth of locally extinct species benefits less from nitrogen than growth of extant species. Nitrogen reduces population growth rates, largely via reductions in survival. Deer herbivory, meanwhile, had inconsistent effects on vital rates among species and did not affect population growth. Nitrogen and herbivory rarely interacted to affect vital rates. These results link community-level patterns of species loss under nitrogen addition to the population-level processes underlying those losses.

AB  - The expansion of oil palm and cattle grazing in the tropics continues to alter numerous ecosystem functions. The generated land-use change is potentially impacting stream leaf-litter breakdown, a fundamental process for freshwater ecosystems. To assess the effect of land-use change, we studied breakdown rates of forest (Pachira aquatica, Pouroma aspera, Sloanea ampla, and Hippocratea volubilis) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) leaves after a 26-day immersion in streams surrounded by rainforests, grazing lands, or oil palm plantations with and without riparian buffers. In addition, we assessed breakdown drivers by deploying litter bags (248) of two mesh sizes (15 mm and 0.5 mm) allowing or restricting macroinvertebrates' access (134 coarse-mesh bags and 114 fine-mesh bags). Forest leaf breakdown by microbes (fine-mesh) was lower by 55% in the plantations compared to forests; while microbial oil palm-leaf breakdown was lower by 32% in the unbuffered plantations compared to forests (p < 0.05). Total litter breakdown was lower (p > 0.05) in the plantations but not when these preserved riparian buffers. Litter breakdown was driven primarily by microbes in all land uses except in the buffered plantations, possibly due to increased shredder biomass. These results suggest that oil palm agriculture may decrease microbial stream leaf-litter breakdown, especially in streams with no riparian buffers.

AB  - Sustainable ecotourism development and conservation depend on understanding factors that affect flagship species. This study analysed environmental factors and their effects on flagship species: African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), red-river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), duiker (Cephalophus spp.), and crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) distribution in Bomfobiri Wildlife Sanctuary (BWS). Secondary data (camp reports 2017-2019) showed flagship species distribution across four vegetation types in 14 sites. Field observations were used to reconstruct camp report information using GPS coordinates to show animal distribution. Environmental factors were assessed based on the scope and severity of their threats to the species. PAST ver.3.06 was used to analyse animal and vegetation data. A total of 995 individual animals were recorded. Riverine forest (n = 325) had the highest, followed by semi-deciduous (n = 316), and woodland Savanna (n = 192). Bushfire was the major predictive factor on animal distribution, followed by grazing pressure, farming activities, elevation, and erosion. These findings imply that an increased scale of disturbances reduces the chance of sighting flagship animals. A higher concentration of these species in riverine and semi-deciduous forests calls for increased patrols as a conservation measure. Constructing viewing platforms and hiking trails in areas of higher animal activity would improve ecotourism development.

AB  - Conflicts between people and wildlife have become widespread as people move to areas previously home to wildlife and as wild populations recover. In Patagonia, one of the main threats to guanaco Lama guanicoe conservation is the animosity of sheep ranchers towards the species. As key stakeholders in guanaco conservation we assessed ranchers' perceptions regarding guanaco abundance in Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. We contrasted these perceptions with estimated guanaco abundance and explored the socio-ecological factors influencing perceptions and how perceptions of overabundance are rooted in contextual factors rather than actual abundance. We performed semi-structured interviews with ranchers from Isla Grande and estimated guanaco abundance independently using density surface modelling. Ranchers were divided into three categories depending on their perception of guanaco abundance: 'too many', 'many' and 'normal'. Those in the 'many' and 'normal' categories perceived guanaco abundance as being similar to actual abundance, whereas those in the category 'too many' overestimated guanaco abundance. The perceived issues affecting livestock production varied between categories, although feral dogs emerged as the main problem. Negative perceptions of the guanaco stemmed from ranchers' beliefs that the species reduces forage availability for livestock, and from their disappointment about the government's handling of concerns regarding livestock production. Greater understanding and integration of the human dimension in conservation are needed to design more inclusive and resilient management plans.

AB  - 1. When non-native species invade ecosystems, coevolved plant-animal interactions and associated ecological functions are altered, often to the detriment of local biodiversity. While mutualistic interactions can benefit from-and assist with-ecological restoration through the removal of non-native species, community-level changes in antagonistic interactions due to restoration are less well understood. Insect seed predators provide important ecosystem functions, but can also have antagonistic effects through pre- dispersal seed predation which can cause fruit abortion or premature fruit drop, potentially affecting plant community composition.
   2. Here, we used a network approach and data on trophic interactions from a largescale field experiment to investigate the differences in insect seed predator communities between native restored sites (where non-native plants were removed) and unrestored sites dominated by non-native plants on the island of Mahe, Seychelles.
   3. Restored sites contained more individuals and species of seed predators (up by 81% and 50% respectively), and experienced a greater predation intensity (1.06 +/- 0.53 vs. 0.27 +/- 0.09), and predator specialisation compared to unrestored sites. The proportion of predated samples was similar between treatments (similar to 14%). Beta diversity, measured as species and interaction turnover, increased at restored sites.
   4. Synthesis and applications: : Our findings imply that vegetation restoration generates marked biodiversity benefits on native seed predator communities and their interactions. However, removing non-native plants did not result in the elimination of non-native seed predators, which might require targeted control measures. Our results highlight the importance of considering the effects of restoration on antagonistic interactions, in addition to those reported for pollination and seed dispersal services. Management practices should aim to control plant invasions for the conservation of native plant communities that serve as resources and refugia both for mutualists (e.g., seed dispersers and pollinators) and native insect seed-predator antagonists, both of which benefit native ecosystem function.

AB  - A portion of the Aransas-Wood Buffalo population of Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) stopover within the Central Platte River Valley (CPRV) annually. Past studies have found Whooping Cranes select herbaceous wetlands over agricultural fields when evaluated at a migration-corridor scale. However, recent studies conducted within the CPRV have reported Whooping Cranes selected agricultural fields and avoided herbaceous landcover classes. We hypothesized that much of this discrepancy was due to differences in landcover classifications used in previous studies, particularly those related to wetland designations. We used multiple existing, fine-scale geospatial data sources considering both landcover and hydrological factors to define unique and regionally specific ecotopes, which are the smallest homogenous and biologically relevant mappable units of analysis in landscape ecology (e.g., meadowmarsh, upland agriculture, etc.). We examined whether ecotope-based landcover, when evaluated at multiple spatial scales (i.e., 400 m and 1000 m), predicted terrestrial Whooping Crane occurrence within the CPRV. We used generalized linear mixed models within an information-theoretic approach to assess Whooping Crane occurrence within the CPRV. We found distinct ecotopes at the 1000m scale explained nearly 40% of the variation in Whooping Crane occurrence. Ecotope models outperformed models including only their component parts such as flooding frequency and wetland designation. Whooping Cranes occurred more frequently within wetland portions of both agricultural fields and natural herbaceous communities and were less likely to use analogous upland components. We also found that occurrence was positively associated with proximity to the main channel of the Platte River and that Whooping Cranes avoided roads and developed areas, as several other studies have reported. Our findings indicate herbaceous and agricultural wetland areas should be targeted for Whooping Crane conservation efforts within the CPRV and perhaps regionally.

AB  - The widespread woodland coverage (61%) in the southeast US may provide extended grazing and browsing opportunities for small ruminants. However, much of the vegetation present in woodlands is above small ruminants' browse height, suggesting that lowering the height of non-pine (understory) vegetation could increase forage availability for animals, resulting in better animal performance. This study assessed the vegetation utilization pattern at different heights by small ruminants and evaluated their performance in woodlands. Goats (Kiko wethers) and sheep (Katahdin rams) were rotationally stocked in plots with a southern pine overstory and an understory comprised of a mixture of herbaceous plants, shrubs, and hardwood seedlings and saplings. The non-pine plants were cut to one of three heights from the ground level (0 m, 0.9 m, and 1.5 m) or left uncut (control). Browsing height and animals' preference for different plant species were monitored after removing animals from each study plots. Live weight (LWt), body condition score (BCS), and FAMACHA score were collected before stocking animals in the study plots and fortnightly thereafter. Goats browsed from higher vegetation strata than sheep (1.2-1.6 m vs. 0.9-1.1 m). Vegetation in the uncut control was least eaten. The BCS (1-5: 1- severely thin, 5-obese) was within the range for healthy animals in both goats (2.4-2.8) and sheep (2.8-4.0). FAMACHA score (1-5: 1- no anemia, 5-severely anemic) ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 in goats and 1.0-2.7 in sheep suggesting no anemic condition. Maintaining non-pine plants at low heights (1.1-1.6 m) increased the vegetation utilization by small ruminants for acceptable performance.

AB  - The conflict between free-ranging livestock and wildlife is a serious conservation concern across rural communities worldwide. Livestock may affect wild herbivores via direct competition for resources due to spatial and diet overlap or via behavioural interference. It is imperative that we disentangle the effects of livestock on wildlife behaviour to obtain an empirical basis able to stir management and conservation decisions. Here, we studied the effect of livestock presence on the habitat selection in a free-ranging European mouflon (Ovis aries musimon) population in Sardinia, where the species is under strict protection. We collected spatial data on mouflon and livestock during two consecutive years to investigate whether the mouflon selection of key feeding grassland sites was negatively impacted by the livestock presence. We found that mouflon preferably selected grassland, and its selection significantly increased when grass was of better quality (greener). We showed that livestock presence led to the displacement of mouflon from such preferred feeding sites, an effect clearly exacerbated by livestock proximity. We indeed found that the selection of grassland by mouflon dropped significantly when the distance between livestock and mouflon was below similar to 650 m, providing a useful management threshold indication. Livestock presence in close proximity displaced mouflon to sub-optimal habitat, and its effects may have negative impact on the population dynamic of this species which is already characterized by low female productivity within harsh Mediterranean environment. Our results give clear management indications aimed at better managing livestock grazing within natural areas to ultimately improve wildlife conservation.

AB  - Bubalus mindorensis (tamaraw) and Sus oliveri (Mindoro warty pig) are emblematic of Mindoro Island as a faunal biodiversity hotspot in the Philippines. However, these endemic, red-listed mammals are of socioecological concern due to pressures within their contracting home ranges. Conservation efforts are logistically hindered by their elusive yet aggressive behavior and coexistence with indigenous tribes. This study aims to identify high conservation value areas (HCVAs), sites where both species are highly suitable. Ensemble species distribution modeling (SDM) based on nine algorithms was performed. For each species, three ensemble SDMs were calibrated following three proposed approaches in decreasing hyperparameter-based model complexity: standard, tuned, and limited. Across ensemble SDMs, complexity and True Skill Statistics (TSS)-based accuracy are positively associated. Still, the limited ensemble SDM of tamaraw (TSS = 0.740) and Mindoro warty pig (TSS = 0.855) retain good discriminatory performance. These coincidingly predict that known occurrence sites are areas of high suitability, which are spatially fragmented into four patches across the Mindoro Mountain Range: Mt. Calavite Wildlife Sanctuary, Upper Amnay Watershed, Aruyan-Malati, and Mts. Iglit-Baco National Park. In total, these prospective HCVAs cover 405.17 km2 (3.83%) of Mindoro Island, which represent areas of priority for the ongoing Mindoro Island Biodiversity (BD) Corridor Project. This study substantiates the need for strategic management of these HCVAs. Despite overarching study-specific limitations and uncertainties, this study advocates the informed use of ensemble SDMs for reserve selection, conservation planning, and wildlife-related policymaking in Mindoro Island.

AB  - Because of climate change, wildlife is facing altered environments, including profound shifts in temperature and precipitation regimes. In snow-dominated ecosystems, winter warming and resulting changes in snowpack properties impact forage accessibility for ungulates-often for the worse. The potential of individuals and populations to buffer negative fitness effects of harsh winters with "basal ice" (i.e., ice on the ground) and/or a harder or deeper snowpack depends on their ability to adjust behaviorally through changes in diet, dispersal, or small-scale habitat use. Here, we use ten years of late winter snowpack monitoring and population census data from three neighboring, semi-isolated coastal populations of high-arctic wild Svalbard reindeer to explore small-scale space use responses to annual variation in late winter-foraging conditions. Based on location data from the population censuses, we roughly classified individuals' spatial foraging strategy (i.e., habitat use) during late winter into "tundra" (foraging on tundra plains), "mountain" (foraging at high elevations, with low plant biomass but less snow and ice), or "shore" (foraging along the seashore, subsidizing terrestrial food with kelp and seaweed). Using multinomial logistic regression, we modeled the probability of reindeer adopting either of these strategies as a function of density-dependent winter severity. Our results suggest that effects of winter severity on habitat use are density-dependent and that snowpack depth and hardness (excluding basal ice, measured as "integrated ram hardness," IRH) have stronger influence on reindeer foraging behavior than basal ice, at least at such spatial scales. Particularly, high IRH increased the probability of reindeer seeking high-elevation and steep terrain instead of tundra lowlands, but not at low population density, that is, when competition for food is negligible. This strategy was most pronounced among adult males, possibly reflecting their risk-prone behavior and/or reduced competitiveness related to lack of antlers during winter. This study demonstrates important patterns of temporal, spatial, and demographic variation in reindeer's winter-foraging strategies, adding novel, nuanced insights into how climate change affects spatial processes in isolated ungulate populations. The results add to the impression of considerable behavioral flexibility, which may aid buffering the negative fitness effects of complex changes in foraging conditions due to environmental changes.

AB  - Introduction The relationship between ectoparasitic flies and bats is influenced by anthropogenic changes in natural environments. In the Amazon, various forms of disturbance contribute to ecosystem imbalance, potentially leading to the local extinction and disruption of ecological functions. Cacao cultivation has been expanding in the Amazon, but studies on its impacts on bat diversity are still limited, hindering the development of effective conservation strategies. This study aims to assess bat and batfly species to understand how land-use changes affect antagonistic interaction networks between ectoparasitic flies and Phyllostomidae bats.Methods We sampled urban areas, natural vegetation, and cacao plantations using 10 mist nets over 69 nights at 36 sites across 10 municipalities in Par & aacute;.Results The overall interaction network showed 42 host species and 52 ectoparasite species, showing high specialization, low connectivity, and insignificant nesting and parasite vulnerability. The highest ectoparasites richness was observed in natural vegetation (47), followed by cacao (30) and urban areas (29). The cacao-dominated network exhibited high modularity, natural areas had the highest occurrence of infracommunities, followed by urban areas and cocoa. Five bat species were present in all three environments, each infested with infracommunities. Notably, infracommunal associations were common among ectoparasite genera Speiseria, Strebla, and Trichobius.Discussion The species richness observed highlights Par & aacute; as a region of exceptional diversity for dipteran ectoparasites of bats (with 60 species). Our study suggests that cacao plantations can serve as suitable habitats for both bats and flies. Notably, we conducted this research on a small, family-run farm. While these types of farms are not substitutes for natural vegetation, they may help mitigate the impacts of rapid land-use and land-cover change. In fact, these small, family-operated farms demonstrated habitat suitability close to that of natural vegetation areas, supporting greater biodiversity within agricultural landscapes.

The intestinal microecology plays an important role in the host's maintenance of normal physical activities, such as substance metabolism, energy transmission, signal transduction, and the immune system. This study used high-throughput sequencing technology to sequence the fecal microbiota of sika deer (Cervus nippon) and wapiti (Cervus canadensis) in order to explore the composition of, and the similarity between, the fecal microbiota structures of sika deer and wapiti in the similar living environment. The species composition, relative abundance of fecal microbiota, alpha diversity, and differences in beta diversity were analyzed. The maintenance of the composition of the gut microbiota and a balanced intestinal environment through the diet plays a key role in maintaining the host's health. The results demonstrate that the fecal microbiota of sika deer and wapiti share a similar fecal microbiota structure, but there was some evidence showing that the gut microbiota of these two animals exhibit a clear divergence at the species level. Microbial symbiotic associations may be beneficial, neutral, or harmful to the host. Symbionts exploit the host space and nutrition or use hosts as carriers to spread to other environments. In order to investigate the fecal bacterial communities of wild sika deer (Cervus nippon) and wapiti (Cervus canadensis), this study aimed to sequence and explore the composition of, and similarity between, the fecal microbiota of sika deer and wapiti using high-throughput sequencing. The composition and relative abundance of fecal microbiota, alpha diversity, and differences in beta diversity between the two species were analyzed. We found that no pathogenic bacteria were present in large quantities in the hosts. The dominant bacterial phyla found in the two deer species were similar and included Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Spirochaetes. Moreover, the deer also shared similar dominant genera, including the Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, and Bacteroides. These results demonstrate that the sika deer and wapiti share a similar fecal microbiotal structure, probably due to their common diet and living environment, but there was some evidence of a difference at the species level. These analyses provide new insights into the health status of deer populations outside protected environments and offer a scientific framework for monitoring the health conditions of sika deer and wapiti.

AB  - The late Quaternary is characterized by the extinction of many terrestrial megafauna, which included tortoises (Family: Testudinidae). However, limited information is available on how extinction shaped the phenotype of surviving taxa. Here, based on a global dataset of straight carapace length, we investigate the temporal variation, spatial distribution and evolution of tortoise body size over the past 23 million years, thereby capturing the effects of Quaternary extinctions in this clade. We found a significant change in body size distribution characterized by a reduction of both mean body size and maximum body size of extant tortoises relative to fossil taxa. This reduction of body size occurred earlier in mainland (Early Pleistocene 2.588-0.781 Ma) than in island tortoises (Late Pleistocene/Holocene 0.126-0 Ma). Despite contrasting body size patterns between fossil and extant taxa on a spatial scale, tortoise body size showed limited variation over time until this decline. Body size is a fundamental functional trait determining many aspects of species ecologies, with large tortoises playing key roles as ecosystem engineers. As such, the transition from larger sized to smaller sized classes indicated by our findings likely resulted in the homogenization of tortoises' ecological functions and diminished the role of tortoises in structuring the vegetation community.

AB  - Agricultural practices shape arthropod communities in arable fields, consequently influencing their interactions and the resulting ecosystem services, in particular pest regulation. Predatory arthropods play a pivotal role by preying on herbivores, soil fauna, and on other predators. However, the intricate mechanisms through which agricultural practices shape the dietary preferences of predators, and regulate herbivore populations remain complex and inadequately understood. We assessed how fertilisation with organic fertiliser and extending crop rotations with perennial ley affected predation pressure across prey taxa. We mapped predator and prey trophic linkages with molecular analysis of carabid predator gut contents, and measured densities and taxonomic richness of predators, herbivores, and soil fauna in 19 cereal fields during three samplings across the growing season. We derived two food web structure metrics: prey vulnerability that is the average number of predators feeding on a selected prey, and predator trophic redundancy, that is dietary overlap. Prey vulnerability was compared among soil fauna, herbivores, and other predator species (that is interspecific intraguild predation) over the growing season, and across treatments. The mechanistic underpinnings of observed shifts in vulnerability of herbivorous prey at different crop stages were identified using information criteria to select among candidate variables related to the richness, density and interaction structure of the different guilds during both the current, and the previous crop stages. Agricultural diversification via organic fertilisation combined with perennial ley in the crop rotation decreased the vulnerability of both intraguild prey and soil fauna prey, and stabilised herbivore vulnerability. Mechanistically, the vulnerability of herbivorous prey at crop ripening emerges from the combination of predator richness and trophic redundancy during this sampling round, rather than from carryover effects from previous crop stages. Synthesis and applications: Our results suggest that locally provided resource continuity through diversified cropping practices bolster biological pest regulation, thus underline the importance of lesser disturbance in arable ecosystems for the provision of ecosystem services. Enhanced predator species richness together with availability of alternative prey through the season underpins this enhanced pest regulation.

AB  - Land abandonment has been increasing in recent decades in Europe, usually accompanied by biodiversity decline. Whether livestock grazing and mowing can safeguard biodiversity across spatial scales in the long term is unclear. Using a 48-year experiment in a salt marsh, we compared land abandonment (without grazing and mowing) and seven management regimes including cattle grazing, early season mowing, late season mowing, both early and late season mowing, and grazing plus each of the mowing regimes on plant diversity at the local and larger scales (i.e. aggregated local communities). Also, we compared their effects on community composition (both in identities and abundances) in time and space. Under land abandonment, plant diversity declined in the local communities and this decline became more apparent at the larger scale, particularly for graminoids and halophytes. All management regimes, except for late season mowing, maintained plant diversity at these scales. Local plant communities under all treatments underwent different successional trajectories, in the end, diverged from their initial state except for that under grazing (a cyclic succession). Year-to-year changes in local community composition remained at a similar level over time under land abandonment and grazing plus early season mowing while it changed under other treatments. Vegetation homogenized at the larger scale over time under land abandonment while vegetation remained heterogeneous under all management regimes. Synthesis. Our experiment suggests that late season mowing may not be sustainable to conserve plant diversity in salt marshes. Other management regimes can maintain plant diversity across spatial scales and vegetation heterogeneity at the larger scale in the long term, but local community composition may change over time.

AB  - Foraging by African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) and other herbivores tends to result in a piosphere effect around water sources, with increasing pressure on vegetation as distance to water decreases. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of pumped waterholes on woody vegetation in the southern portion of Zimbabwe's Zambezi National Park, a Baikiaea woodland ecosystem characterised by high elephant densities. The recent rehabilitation and addition of pumped waterholes has resulted in a dense waterhole network in the park, prompting concerns around potential negative impacts on vegetation. Sampling plots were located at different distances from four pumped waterholes in Baikiaea plurijuga and Terminalia sericea woodlands. Elephant browsing levels and vegetation structure were assessed across three plant height classes (0.2 -< 1 m; 1 -< 3 m and >= 3 m). Elephant dung counts were also conducted to provide a relative measure of elephant occupancy. A decline in elephant browsing with distance to waterholes was evident in both woodland types, though browsing was consistently higher in the Terminalia woodland. Structural impacts of elevated elephant browsing around waterholes were limited in the Baikiaea woodland. However, substantial reductions in the basal area and canopy volume of trees were evident closer to waterholes in the Terminalia woodland, with widespread conversion of woodland to shrubland. Elephant dung decreased with distance from waterholes in both woodland types, confirming that elephant occupancy was higher closer to waterholes. Overall, clear effects of pumped waterholes were evident. The ecological integrity of the Terminalia woodland in particular appears to be under threat, especially as the current surface water regime places most of it within 3 km of waterholes. The cessation of pumping at some waterholes was thus recommended, to achieve a more heterogenous browsing regime in the area.

AB  - The southern mountain caribou-a subpopulation of caribou found in British Columbia-is listed on Schedule 1 of the Federal Species at Risk Act as Threatened. Woodland caribou are diet specialists, relying on Cladonia subgenus Cladina lichen as a primary food source during winter months. Lichens are burned along with trees and other vegetation during stand-replacing wildfire events, a natural disturbance in caribou ranges. In an attempt to accelerate the return of post-fire forests to productive caribou winter terrestrial lichen habitat, this study examined the survival and cover of three species of transplanted lichens in a post-wildfire environment in north central British Columbia, Canada, both with and without forest litter amendments. Chlorophyll fluorescence was used to evaluate lichen survival by measuring potential photosynthetic activity. The results of this study demonstrate that transplanted fragments and mats of Cladonia subgenus Cladina had survived 5 and 6 years after being transplanted within a post-wildfire environment, and had significantly greater percent cover when compared to the controls. The Fv/Fm results indicated that transplanted lichens survived, regardless of species, propagule type, or whether amendments were applied.

AB  - This study presents the megafauna related to coral mounds (coral remains) and cold-water coral (CWC) reefs off Mauritania. The mound-specific megafauna was documented by comparing 47 trawl catches from coral mounds with 47 catches from off-mound areas, sampled from 1982 to 2022. Coral reef megafauna were described from eleven ROV dives conducted during two surveys held in 2020 and 2021. The mound and reef environment were documented using data from 2159 CTD profiles collected between 1995 and 2022. A detailed annotation of the ROV recorded videos was undertaken, and megafauna habitat relations were identified using multivariate statistics. The coral ecosystems that supported a rich megafauna were situated in the oxygen minimum zone at depths of 400 to 650 meters, with an average temperature of 10.55 degrees C. The coral mound hosted 31% more species than adjacent off-mound areas, and fish contributed 66% of the taxa of five groups, followed by crustaceans contributing with 20%. The five most common species were Helicolenus dactylopterus, Laemonema laureysi, Merluccius polli, Malacocephalus occidentalis and Hoplostethus cadenati. The CWC reefs hosted 120 taxa representing 11 different faunal groups, with fish as the most species rich group, contributing 39% of the recorded taxa, followed by cnidarians represented by several corals (18 taxa) and crustaceans (17 taxa). The most abundant taxa on the reefs, in addition to the reef-building coral Desmophyllum pertusum, were the anemone Synarachnactis cf. lloydii, the corals Acanthogorgia cf. hirsuta and Swiftia phaeton, the crustaceans Nematocarcinus africanus and Eumunida bella, the fish H. dactylopterus, the bivalve Acesta excavata and the sponge Cladorhiza corallophila. Live coral, sand and mud were environmental drivers of species distribution on the reefs, and separate communities were related to different reef habitats. This study provides the first comprehensive description of the megafauna related to the cold-water coral mounds and reefs off Mauritania. The rich megafauna associated with these ecosystems highlights the urgent need for conservation measures, particularly in light of increasing pressures from oil and gas activities, deep-sea fishing, and the impact of climate change.

AB  - Climate change disproportionately affects northern and alpine environments, with faster rates of warming than the global average. Because alpine and northern species are particularly well adapted to cool temperatures, most species must modify their behavior when temperatures exceed a critical threshold. Evaluating how temperature increases affect species inhabiting northern and alpine environments is therefore essential to understand the effects of projected climate change on these ecosystems. We analyzed the influence of temperature on the activity patterns and habitat selection of four populations of a cold-adapted, mountain specialist, the mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus). We collected GPS location and activity sensor data during 2010-2019 from 223 mountain goats from two distinct ecotypes: coastal and continental. Using a resource selection modeling approach, we determined that mountain goats of both ecotypes decreased selection for alpine meadows when temperatures increased. Reduced selection for open, forage rich habitat was associated with increased selection for habitat dominated by snow/ice patches in coastal areas, and by forests in continental sites. Mountain goats in continental environments selected higher elevation habitats only when temperature increased, whereas goats in coastal environments selected higher elevation habitat at all temperatures. Mountain goats of both ecotypes reduced the proportion of time spent active when temperatures increased during the middle of the day. Our study reveals that mountain goats use diverse tactics to mitigate thermal stress, and that these tactics vary between ecotypes, highlighting the need for considering adaptation to specific environments within a species when assessing climate change impacts on populations.

AB  - Fungal endophytes may alter plant responses to the environment, but how does the environment affect the communities of fungal symbionts within plants? We examined the impact of nutrient addition and herbivore exclusion on endophyte communities of the prairie grass Andropogon gerardii in a full factorial field experiment. Fungi were cultured from stems, young leaves, and mature leaves, ITS sequences obtained, and endophyte incidence, community richness, and composition analyzed. Results indicate that in plots where nutrient addition and herbivore exclusion treatments had been applied separately, fungal endophyte incidence, community composition or evenness did not differ, but that greater species richness was observed in plots with nutrient addition and herbivore exclusion treatments applied in combination, compared to other treatments. Further, although fungal community composition was significantly different in stem and leaf tissues, OTU richness was greater in all endophyte communities in nutrient addition plus herbivore exclusion treatments, regardless of tissue type. Our results indicate the distinct fungal endophyte communities found in different plant tissues respond similarly to environmental factors.

AB  - Under the pressure exerted by humans on forest ecosystems, agroforestry is promoted to maintain a balance between forest and agricultural ecosystems. Agroforestry systems are the center of interactions between crops and other plants and between fauna and flora. Within this faunistic diversity, ants occupy a prominent place through their protective association with some tropical plant species as natural enemies of their arthropod pests. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the diversity of trees associated with cashew trees and of cashew tree density on ant abundance/diversity in cashew agroforestry systems. The study was conducted in 12 cashew orchards in central Benin. Data on the diversity and densities of ground-dwelling and arboreal ant species were collected using hand and bait traps. The diversity of trees in the orchards and cashew tree density were also determined. Twenty ant species were collected among which the most abundant were Pheidole spp., Lepisiota sp., Paratrechina longicornis, Camponotus sericeus, Brachyponera sennaarensis, Camponotus spp., and Oecophylla longinoda. Tree diversity and cashew tree density in those orchards had significantly positive effects on the ant densities but not on ant diversity. Structural equation modeling showed that the abundance of ants increased the diversity of ants, which decreased the herbivory index. Based on the important role of ants as biological pest control agents, it is worth promoting agroforestry systems in cashew orchards to increase ant abundance, thereby improving their productivity.

AB  - The Mongolian marmot (Marmota sibirica) is a relatively large-bodied, social rodent that lives in colonies across the Mongolian steppes and adjacent parts of China and Russia. Marmots serve as ecosystem engineers that display multiple functions on the steppe environments they inhabit. Mongolian marmots experienced a >75% decline across Mongolia in the 1990s that led to their listing as endangered globally. The decline of marmots likely af-fected other species given their importance to the ecosystems they inhabit. To examine the role of marmots on herpetofauna, we established drift fence arrays with associated pitfall and funnel traps on active marmot colonies, inactive colonies, and control sites in the forest-steppe and semi-desert zones of Mongolia. In total, we identified 555 individuals representing 5 species of reptiles in Ikh Nart Nature Reserve (semi-desert) from 2010 - 2011 and 22 individuals of 3 species of reptiles and one amphibian species in Hustai National Park (forest-steppe) in 2014 and 2016. We found significantly higher species abundance and some diversity indices on active and inactive colo-nies compared to control sites in Hustai. Vegetation height and cover significantly affected the abundance and spe-cies richness of reptiles in Ikh Nart. In Ikh Nart, we found that under conditions of higher vegetation cover and height, reptiles were distributed more widely across the landscape, but with lower vegetation cover and height, reptiles associated more strongly with marmot burrows. Burrows likely provide shelter from extreme climatic con-ditions and refugia from predation. Our research provides insights into how marmots create important habitats for associated fauna. This and similar experimental approaches will allow us to better understand the biodiversity pat-terns in and around marmot burrows.

AB  - Ecotourism helps sustain protected areas (PAs) that in turn conserve Africa's declining fauna. Identifying ecotourist preferences and which species and landscapes benefit from ecotourism could therefore support African biodiversity conservation efforts. Due to historic associations with trophy hunting and subsequent ecotourism marketing efforts, ecotourist preferences have been thought to traditionally center around the 'Big Five': elephant, lion, buffalo, leopard, and rhinoceros. But these preferences may be evolving. Here, we ask two questions, one about the drivers and one about the consequences of ecotourism: (1) Which species and landscapes do ecotourists most prefer based on realized visitation data? And (2), differently, which species and landscapes benefit most from ecotourism? We gathered data on average annual tourist visits, the occurrence of nine mammals, bird species richness, forest cover, national wealth, local human population and accessibility for 164 Sub-Saharan African PAs. To address our first question, we used a Bayesian multivariable model to identify whether bird and megafaunal diversity explain visits to PAs while controlling for other factors. To address our second question, we used Bayesian univariate models to analyze the relationships between park visitation and each species/landscape. We found that tourist preferences extend beyond the Big Five to include bird diversity. We also observed that ecotourism may be well suited to conserve bird diversity, lion, cheetah, black and white rhinoceros, African wild dog and giraffe species. Collectively, our results may help inform how to leverage ecotourism to conserve African fauna.

AB  - Land use and climate change are the main drivers of biodiversity change. However, their relative roles in the decline of biodiversity are still insufficiently known. Climate change is expected to be globally most pronounced in the boreal biome, where another key driver affecting boreal species is forestry. In NW Europe almost all forest land outside protected areas is subject to systematic forest management practices including clear-cutting, thinning and replanting. In addition, a human-caused increase in herbivores, such as ungulates, may affect the forest vegetation structure and thereby also bird species. We studied population changes of a bird community in a southern boreal area in Finland over a period of 30 years and related changes in the bird community concerning both land use and climate variables. During the study the total bird density declined by 26%, i.e., 1%/year. Longdistance migrants and residents declined the most, both by 44%, and short-distance migrants by 29%, while partial migrants increased by 29%. Clear-cuts were the most important variable explaining the decline in the total bird density and the density change of long-distance and short-distance migrants and residents. In addition, the higher summer mean temperature was related to the decline of the total bird density and short-distance migrants, which were also moderately negatively affected by the ungulate density. The increase in partial migrants was mostly due to an increase in the numbers of two bird species, the great tit Parus major and the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus, which have benefitted from human actions in many ways. As a whole, the bird community did not recover to the level that prevailed before the clear-cuts in the study period. This indicates that recolonisation and the recovery rate by birds in maturing young stands cannot fully compensate for the loss of birds resulting from the clear-cuts. Forest management practices should adopt more biodiversity-friendly methods, such as continuous cover forestry, to better maintain populations of forest birds.

AB  - There has been a long-standing interest in understanding how interactions between fire and herbivory influence woody vegetation dynamics in savanna ecosystems. However, controlled, replicated experiments examining how different fire regimes interact with different herbivore groups are rare. We tested the effects of single and repeated burns, crossed with six replicated herbivore treatments, on the mortality and growth of woody vegetation in the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment plots located in a semi-arid savanna system in central Kenya. Burned plots experienced higher tree mortality overall, but differences between burns and non-burns were only significant in plots excluding all wild herbivores and in plots accessible to megaherbivores. Cattle ameliorated the negative effects of repeat burns on tree mortality, perhaps by suppressing fuel load accumulation. Across all herbivore treatments, trees experienced a significant reduction in height within the first two years after fire (top-kill), which was followed by a gradual recovery. Saplings and coppices subjected to repeated burns regrew faster than those that were burned once, except in the presence of megaherbivores. This study highlights strong context-dependent interactions between fire and different herbivore groups, and extends previous approaches to understanding fire-herbivory interactions, which have tended to lump the effects of different herbivore groups, or study them separately.

AB  - Coral reefs in the Florida Reef Tract have seen protracted loss of coral over the past several decades due to a variety of disturbances from marine heat waves, cold snaps, and disease events. Corals have not recovered despite abundant herbivorous fishes and relatively low macroalgal cover, two factors thought to facilitate resilience of corals. Thus, factors affecting the replenishment of coral populations may be hindering the recovery of corals. To study the potential factors affecting coral recovery in reefs of the Florida Reef Tract, we assessed benthic abiotic variables (substrate slope, depth, structural complexity, and abundance of sediment), fish assemblages, and benthic composition in three different reef habitats (groove, spur wall, spur top) located on three low-relief reefs and three high-relief spur-and-groove reefs. Herbivorous fish biomass ranged (44.7-107 g m(-2)), which is above average for the Caribbean. Yet there was low coral cover (similar to 1%) and low density (similar to 1 coral m(2)) of small adult corals, which likely reflects the cumulative effects of years of disturbances. The presence and density of juvenile corals were negatively correlated with the depth of the sediment layer trapped within long, sediment-laden algal turfs (LSAT), which are particularly abundant (> 50% cover) in low complexity reef habitats (low-relief groove, low-relief spur top, and high-relief groove). Our results indicate that current unsuitable habitat conditions (high sediment load) for early life stage corals may be an important factor preventing coral recovery. Consequently, the abundance of herbivorous fishes and coral cover trajectories appear decoupled in the region, and additional management initiatives considering LSAT composition are required to aid reef resilience.

AB  - Tropical theileriosis, caused by the apicomplexan hemoparasite of the genus Theileria, is a major constraint to livestock production in various parts of world, including South Asia. Several studies have been carried out over the last five decades; however, comprehensive information in this region regarding the diversity and distribution of Theileria is lacking. Therefore, keeping in mind the economic importance of theileriosis, we have systematically reviewed the current knowledge about Theileria spp. diversity and distribution affecting cattle, water buffaloes, goats and sheep in three countries included India, Pakistan and Bangladesh of the Indian sub-continent. The data collected indicated that the microscopic method is the widely used method for evaluating Theileria species in the three countries from 1970 to 2021. This is the first study in this region to compile a comprehensive knowledge about the diversity and distribution of Theileria. Our study revealed the existence of 11 different species of Theileria, including Theileria spp. Theleria annulata, T. orientalis, T. mutans, T. velifera circulating in cattle and buffalo while T. annulata, T. lestoquardi, T. luwenshuni T. ovis, Theileria spp. and T. lestoquardi-like spp., were infecting goats and sheep from various regions of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. We find that T. annulata can be found in both small and large ruminants and is widely distributed in the different regions of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. In addition, our analysis revealed that the existence of possible tick vectors of the genera Hyalomma, Haemophysalis, Rhipicephalus and Amblyomma may be responsible for the diverse and wide distribution of different Theileria species. However, the competence of these tick vectors for different Theileria species still need to be explored. Therefore, further studies are needed to bridge this gap and to improve the health and production of livestock and reduce economic losses due to theileriosis in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Furthermore, we selected representative 18S rRNA sequences for T. annulata from the different regions to infer phylogenetic relationship. Phylogenetic analysis of the selected isolates clustered in different clades which might be due to the variation in a hypervariable region of 18S rRNA. The outcome of this analysis is expected to provide a coherent and integrated framework about the different Theileria species prevailing in these countries and contribute to improving the surveillance and control plans of various Theileria species in the region.

AB  - Due to a dramatic increase in livestock, the impact of grazing on animal communities is a global conservation concern, especially in temperate forests. Recognizing the interaction between livestock and wildlife is essential for developing more effective and holistic strategies for wildlife conservation and sustainable livestock management. In this study, we conducted systematic camera trapping at 129 sites within the central portion of the Giant Panda National Park in China to assess the interspecific relationships between livestock and 21 sympatric wild species. Using the joint species distribution model, we fitted a null model and a constrained model to investigate the distinction between the spatial distribution relationship of species (as raw associations) and the interactions between livestock and wildlife (as residual associations). The results of raw associations showed that livestock exhibited a significant positive spatial co-occurrence with Temminck's tragopan, Himalayan porcupine, Chinese serow, Reeves's muntjac, and forest muskdeer (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, livestock exhibited negative spatial associations with greater hog badger, giant panda, Chinese goral, and Sichuan takin (p < 0.05). The variance partitioning of the constrained model showed that environmental covariates explained 77.1 % of the species cooccurrence pattern, with 35.5 % variation attributed to geography (including elevation, slope and aspect), 22.2 % to the distance from settlement. After accounting for environmental filtering, the residual associations revealed that there were no significant posterior probabilities between livestock and any of the species (p > 0.05), indicating no strong evidence of negative interactions between livestock and wildlife. Since livestock grazing is a source of income for residents, grazing management policies within the Giant Panda National Park should not prohibit all grazing practices.

AB  - Seed limitation can narrow down the number of coexisting plant species, limit plant community productivity, and also constrain community responses to changing environmental and biotic conditions. In a 10-year full-factorial experiment of seed addition, fertilisation, warming and herbivore exclusion, we tested how seed addition alters community richness and biomass, and how its effects depend on seed origin and biotic and abiotic context. We found that seed addition increased species richness in all treatments, and increased plant community biomass depending on nutrient addition and warming. Novel species, originally absent from the communities, increased biomass the most, especially in fertilised plots and in the absence of herbivores, while adding seeds of local species did not affect biomass. Our results show that seed limitation constrains both community richness and biomass, and highlight the importance of considering trophic interactions and soil nutrients when assessing novel species immigrations and their effects on community biomass.

AB  - Conserving large intact forest landscapes (IFLs) is one forest management strategy to mitigate industrial impacts on the environment. Measuring the IFL inventory at national scales has also been proposed as a means of assessing the conservation status at global scales. This paper explores the relationship between fire regimes and the size of intact forest landscapes required to meet specific conservation targets. In this paper, we demonstrate that variation in fire regimes results in changes in the minimum size of IFL required to meet habitat targets. In addition, minimum IFL size is also dependent on the nature of the habitat targets. Larger IFLs are required to improve likelihood of providing sufficient older habitat. There is significant risk of not meeting older forest age -class targets at higher annual area burned (AAB) rates, especially under climate change. In general, there is more risk of not meeting habitat targets associated with smaller IFLs, higher annual area burned (both due to spatial differences and between historical and projected burn rates under climate change), and for provision of older forests. We used habitat age-related targets as outlined in the recovery strategy for woodland caribou as an example to demonstrate the usefulness of this type of simulation experiment and risk curves to identify appro-priate IFL size along a gradient of natural disturbance intensity.

AB  - Stable oxygen isotope (delta O-18) compositions from vertebrate tooth enamel are widely used as biogeochemical proxies for paleoclimate. However, the utility of enamel oxygen isotope values for environmental reconstruction varies among species. Herein, we evaluate the use of stable oxygen isotope compositions from pronghorn (Antilocapra americana Gray, 1866) enamel for reconstructing paleoclimate seasonality, an elusive but important parameter for understanding past ecosystems. We serially sampled the lower third molars of recent adult pronghorn from Wyoming for delta O-18 in phosphate (delta O-18(PO4)) and compared patterns to interpolated and measured yearly variation in environmental waters as well as from sagebrush leaves, lakes, and rivers (delta O-18(w)). As expected, the oxygen isotope compositions of phosphate from pronghorn enamel are enriched in O-18 relative to environmental waters. For a more direct comparison, we converted delta O-18(w) values into expected delta O-18(PO4*) values (delta O-18(W)-(PO4*)). Pronghorn delta O-18(PO4) values from tooth enamel record nearly the full amplitude of seasonal variation from Wyoming delta O-18(W-PO4*) values. Furthermore, pronghorn enamel delta O-18(PO4) values are more similar to modeled delta O-18(W-PO4*) values from plant leaf waters than meteoric waters, suggesting that they obtain much of their water from evaporated plant waters. Collectively, our findings establish that seasonality in source water is reliably reflected in pronghorn enamel, providing the basis for exploring changes in the amplitude of seasonality of ancient climates. As a preliminary test, we sampled historical pronghorn specimens (1720 +/- 100 AD), which show a mean decrease (a shift to lower values) of 1-2 parts per thousand in delta O-18(PO4) compared to the modern specimens. They also exhibit an increase in the delta O-18 amplitude, representing an increase in seasonality. We suggest that the cooler mean annual and summer temperatures typical of the 18th century, as well as enhanced periods of drought, drove differences among the modern and historical pronghorn, further establishing pronghorn enamel as excellent sources of paleoclimate proxy data.

AB  - Background Animal movement is a key ecological process that is tightly coupled to local environmental conditions. While agriculture, urbanisation, and transportation infrastructure are critical to human socio-economic improvement, these have spurred substantial changes in animal movement across the globe with potential impacts on fitness and survival. Notably, however, human disturbance can have differential effects across species, and responses to human activities are thus largely taxa and context specific. As human disturbance is only expected to worsen over the next decade it is critical to better understand how species respond to human disturbance in order to develop effective, case-specific conservation strategies. Methods Here, we use an extensive telemetry dataset collected over 22 years to fill a critical knowledge gap in the movement ecology of lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) across areas of varying human disturbance within three biomes in southern Brazil: the Pantanal, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest. Results From these data we found that the mean home range size across all monitored tapirs was 8.31 km(2) (95% CI 6.53-10.42), with no evidence that home range sizes differed between sexes nor age groups. Interestingly, although the Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Pantanal vary substantially in habitat composition, levels of human disturbance, and tapir population densities, we found that lowland tapir movement behaviour and space use were consistent across all three biomes. Human disturbance also had no detectable effect on lowland tapir movement. Lowland tapirs living in the most altered habitats we monitored exhibited movement behaviour that was comparable to that of tapirs living in a near pristine environment. Conclusions Contrary to our expectations, although we observed individual variability in lowland tapir space use and movement, human impacts on the landscape also had no measurable effect on their movement. Lowland tapir movement behaviour thus appears to exhibit very little phenotypic plasticity in response to human disturbance. Crucially, the lack of any detectable response to anthropogenic disturbance suggests that human modified habitats risk being ecological traps for tapirs and this information should be factored into conservation actions and species management aimed towards protecting lowland tapir populations.

AB  - A shifting focus in forest management from timber production to resilience and multifunctionality in the face of changing disturbance regimes might entail altering the species composition of forests. Although the conifers Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and silver fir (Abies alba) currently comprise only a small proportion of Central European forests, the prospect of widespread planting of these species as a climate adaptation measure is currently widely debated by forest managers. To inform this debate, objective assessments of the multifunctional value of these species are required. Here, we introduce Pareto frontiers to objectively assess the value of tree species under competing objectives and considering an uncertain future. Using these frontiers, we explore trade-offs between financial performance and biodiversity aspects of German tree species portfolios with and without these currently rare conifers. We compare several potential biodiversity indicators (related to herbivores, saproxylic beetles, and deadwood decomposition rates) that can be derived from standard forest inventory data. Our results indicate that optimizing the biodiversity indicators generates gradual decreases in financial performance at first, but after an inflection point soil rent declines sharply. Portfolios excluding Douglas fir and silver fir achieved comparable biodiversity levels, but much weaker financial performance, than portfolios that included these conifers. Our novel approach of generating Pareto frontiers that integrate uncertainty can offer useful insights into ecosystem services trade-offs in contexts where risk is unequally distributed across management alternatives.

AB  - Browsing by ungulates is commonly assumed to target the upper parts of sapling crowns, leading to reduced vertical growth or even growth cessation. However, the extent to which browsing induces shifts in resource allocation toward lateral growth remains unclear. This study explores the impact of browsing intensity (BI) and light availability on the architectural traits of six temperate tree species, focusing on height-diameter ratio (H/D), crown slenderness (CL/CW), and crown irregularity (CI) across sapling height classes. Browsing pressure and architectural responses varied across height groups, reflecting diverse adaptive strategies. BI was weakly but negatively correlated with sapling height, indicating that even tall saplings (> 2 m) experience browsing, particularly in the lower crown. H/D consistently increased with BI across all height classes, with stronger effects in medium and tall saplings. Light influenced H/D differently between browsed and unbrowsed saplings: unbrowsed saplings showed reduced H/D only under high light conditions, while browsed saplings exhibited consistent reductions regardless of light levels. CL/CW was negatively but insignificantly affected by BI. Light increased CL/CW in unbrowsed saplings across all height classes but decreased it in browsed short and medium saplings, suggesting a 'pruning' effect of browsing that altered competition dynamics. Species-specific analysis of Fagus sylvatica revealed an increase in CL/CW with BI, reflecting unique adaptive responses. CI increased significantly with BI across all height classes, with the strongest effects in medium and tall saplings. Light reduced CI in browsed short saplings but had inconsistent effects on unbrowsed individuals. Variation partitioning showed that light explained most variation in H/D and CL/CW for shorter saplings, while BI predominantly influenced CI in taller ones. By integrating the effects of browsing and light, this study provides insights into juvenile tree adaptations and resilience under ecological stressors, advancing our understanding of tree growth strategies in challenging environments.

AB  - The bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) is an iconic freshwater fish native to North America that is in decline. Recent studies have revealed bigmouth buffalo exhibit a slow pace of life, yet demographic information on bigmouth buffalo outside of North Dakota and Minnesota is lacking. We used otoliths to investigate population demographics of bigmouth buffalo in Canada, and also monitored bigmouth buffalo spawning frequency and reproductive success in the wild. From a sample of 52 fish collected during 2018-2021 we found bigmouth buffalo from the Qu'Appelle system more than 125 years old. Only 13 year classes ranging from 1894-1997 were evident with one year class since 1948, indicating recruitment has been episodic. During the past decade (2013-2022) bigmouth buffalo have spawned only once (May 2013) in Buffalo Pound Lake. This spawning effort culminated in recruitment failure because the water-level recession rate was too rapid. Our findings indicate that bigmouth buffalo spawning attempts as well as recruitment occur within a narrow range of water-level fluctuations that may rarely occur, which is enabled by their supercentenarian lifespan, and has direct implications for the conservation of this species.

AB  - Invertebrates inhabiting grasslands benefit from uncut grass refuges, yet effects on the plant community have not been properly quantified. We experimentally investigated the effects on the vegetation of two different types of refuges. While both consisted in not mowing 10-20% of a meadow area, they differed in their rotation frequency: (1) in within-year rotational refuges (WYRR), the location of the refuge within a meadow was changed at each mowing operation, usually twice a year; (2) in between-years rotational refuges (BYRR), the refuge changed location only between years. A third mowing regime without any refuge was included as control (C) for comparison. The study was conducted in thirty extensively managed meadows across the Swiss lowlands. The vegetation was sampled at two 1-m2 plots within each of the four strata defined by a stratified random design that accounted for the spatial location of the uncut refuge over the years. There were no overall significant negative effects of WYRR on plant species richness and composition at the meadow scale, although a small negative effect was detected locally (i.e. at the refuge scale) where a WYRR had been implemented more than once in the preceding three years. Leaving BYRR negatively impacted plant species richness (-11%), even reducing the number of indicator plant species by 22% (from 4.5 to 3.5 per 2 m2), regardless of when and where refuges were left uncut. A beta-diversity analysis revealed no difference at community level between the two refuge types and control meadows. Previous studies had evidenced positive effects of uncut refuges on herbivore and pollinator communities, while this study shows that the plant community is not affected as long as the location of the refuge is changed at each mowing operation. We thus recommend this measure for promoting biodiversity in extensively managed grasslands.

AB  - Optical illusions have long been used in behavioural studies to investigate the perceptual mechanisms underlying vision in animals. So far, three studies have focused on ungulates, providing evidence that they may be susceptible to some optical illusions, in a way similar to humans. Here, we used two food-choice tasks to study susceptibility to the M & uuml;ller-Lyer and Delboeuf illusions in 17 captive individuals belonging to four ungulate species (Lama guanicoe, Lama glama , Ovis aries, Capra hircus). At the group level, there was a significant preference for the longer/larger food over the shorter/smaller one in control trials. Additionally, the whole group significantly preferred the food stick between two inward arrowheads over an identical one between two outward arrowheads in experimental trials of the M & uuml;ller-Lyer task, and also preferred the food on the smaller circle over an identical one on the larger circle in the experimental trials of the Delboeuf task. Group-level analyses further showed no significant differences across species, although at the individual level we found significant variation in performance. Our findings suggest that, in line with our predictions, ungulates are overall susceptible to the M & uuml;ller-Lyer and the Delboeuf illusions, and indicate that the perceptual mechanisms underlying size estimation in artiodactyls might be similar to those of other species, including humans.

AB  - Livestock summer grazing in mountains and forests in Norway is generally considered beneficial to biodiversity. In this study we investigated if this is the case for cattle in boreal production forest. We collected biodiversity data on field layer vegetation, floral resources and flower-visiting insects in young spruce plantations that were planted 2-10 years ago. We picked young spruce plantations inside and outside well-established cattle grazing areas. On each plantation, we sampled fenced and unfenced plots (20 * 20 m each). This study design allowed us to investigate long-term effects of cattle grazing as well as short-term effects of excluding cervids only and shortterm effects of excluding cervids and cattle. Long-term cattle grazing reduced the abundance of woody plants and reduced the abundance of flowers. Excluding cervids for two summers led to reduced height of woody plants (shrubs and heather) and to increased flower abundance. In contrast, excluding cervids and cattle for two summers led to increased height of graminoids, herbs and woody plants, to higher abundance of graminoids, higher flower abundance and higher abundance of flower-visiting insects. In conclusion, cattle affected the studied system in different ways and to a larger extent than native cervids. Our study shows that we must be careful when inferring results from cattle grazing studies on grasslands to forest ecosystems. As this study documents a negative effect of cattle on floral resources and flower-visiting insects, and we currently are facing a global pollination crisis, a careful consideration of the current practice of cattle grazing in boreal forest might be needed.

AB  - The reintroduction of extirpated species is a frequent tactic in rewilding projects because of the functional role species play in maintaining ecosystem health. Despite their potential to benefit both ecosystems and society, however, most well-known species reintroductions have adopted an eco-centric, "nature-in-people-out" approach. Rewilding theory and practitioners acknowledge that ignoring the role Indigenous people did and might once again play in shaping the distribution, abundance, movements, behavior, and health of wild species and ecosystems, is limiting. In this case study, we describe the technical steps we took and how Indigenous knowledge, ceremony, and cultural monitoring were woven into the recent reintroduction of plains bison to Canada's Banff National Park. Six years later, the reintroduced bison herd has grown from 16 to >100 animals, ranges mostly within 30 km of the release site, and, if current growth continues, will likely be managed with Indigenous harvesting. Transboundary bison policy differences are shifting and may lead to bison being more sustainable. The ecocultural approach, therefore, has increased the resilience of our rewilding project.

AB  - Agroecological farming uses crop and non-crop plant biodiversity to promote beneficial insects supplying pollination and biocontrol services to crops. Non-crop plants (sown or weeds) are integral to supporting these beneficial insect species interactions. How the uplift of biotic complexity by agroecological management (crop diversification, ecological infrastructure) influences mutualistic and antagonistic insect interactions regulating the reproduction of non-crop plants remains less understood. Using a pesticide-free farm-scale (125 ha) agroecological experiment, we tested how the individual reproduction of pollinator-dependent, non-crop plant species with different flowering phenology (Cyanus segetum, Centaurea jacea) and their mutualistic (pollinator) and antagonistic (seed herbivore-parasitoid) insect interactions were affected by agroecological practices. Seed set and species interactions of replicate C. segetum and C. jacea randomly introduced to field margins were correlated with floral resource heterogeneity at focal plant (e.g. flower display size), local community (floral richness/abundance driven by sown wildflower or grass margins) and local landscape (crop diversification, area of semi-natural habitat or mass flowering crops) scales. At the seasonal peak of non-crop floral diversity and abundance, antagonistic interactions weakly regulated C. segetum seed set with gains from pollinator activity predominating. Conversely, C. jacea, which flowered past the peak of non-crop floral diversity/abundance, benefited from the promotion of seed herbivore parasitism and pollinator activity by the local landscape cover of semi-natural habitat and mass flowering crops. Synthesis and applications. Agroecological management produced spatial and temporal gradients in crop and non-crop floral resources that interacted to modify pollinator or seed herbivore-parasitoid interactions and Cyanus segetum and Centaurea jacea seed set. The degree of phenological overlap between C. segetum and C. jacea flowering and floral resources in the local community or landscape dictated the type and level of exposure to insect interactions influencing reproduction. Design of agroecological practices to deliver pollination and biocontrol services must consider how effects will vary with species traits and the mutualistic (pollination) and antagonistic (herbivory, parasitism) interactions governing non-crop plant reproduction. Agroecological management supporting beneficial insect interactions may feedback to help restore functional non-crop plant populations and associated biodiversity, potentially reducing the frequency of management interventions (e.g. re-sowing wildflower strips).

AB  - The process of coral recruitment is crucial to the functioning of coral reef ecosystems and recovery of coral assemblages following disturbances. Fishes can be key mediators of this process by removing benthic competitors like algae, but their foraging impacts are capable of being facilitative or harmful to coral recruits depending on species traits. Reef fish assemblages are highly diverse in foraging strategies, and the relationship between this diversity with coral settlement and recruitment success remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate how foraging trait diversity of reef fish assemblages covaries with coral settlement and recruitment success across multiple sites at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. Using a multi-model inference approach incorporating six metrics of fish assemblage foraging diversity (foraging rates, trait richness, trait evenness, trait divergence, herbivore abundance, and sessile invertivore abundance), we found that herbivore abundance was positively related to both coral settlement and recruitment success. However, the correlation with herbivore abundance was not as strong in comparison with foraging trait diversity metrics. Coral settlement and recruitment exhibited a negative relationship with foraging trait diversity, especially with trait divergence and richness in settlement. Our findings provide further evidence that fish play a role in making benthic habitats more conducive for coral settlement and recruitment. Because of their ability to shape the reef benthos, the variation of fish biodiversity is likely to contribute to spatially uneven patterns of coral recruitment and reef recovery.

AB  - Observed links between parasites, such as ticks, and climate change have aroused concern for human health, wildlife population dynamics, and broader ecosystem effects. The one-host life history of the winter tick (Dermacentor albipictus) links each annual cohort to environmental conditions during three specific time periods when they are predictably vulnerable: spring detachment from hosts, summer larval stage, and fall questing for hosts. We used mixed-effects generalized linear models to investigate the drivers of tick loads carried by moose (Alces alces) relative to these time periods and across 750 moose, 10 years, and 16 study areas in the western United States. We tested for the effects of biotic factors (moose density, shared winter range, vegetation, migratory behavior) and weather conditions (temperature, snow, humidity) during each seasonal period when ticks are vulnerable and off-host. We found that warm climatic regions, warm seasonal periods across multiple partitions of the annual tick life cycle, and warm years relative to long-term averages each contributed to increased tick loads. We also found important effects of snow and other biotic factors such as host density and vegetation. Tick loads in the western United States were, on average, lower than those where tick-related die-offs in moose populations have occurred recently, but loads carried by some individuals may be sufficient to cause mortality. Lastly, we found interannual variation in tick loads to be most correlated with spring snowpack, suggesting this environmental component may have the highest potential to induce change in tick load dynamics in the immediate future of this region.

AB  - Forest management can affect both the functioning and stability of ecosystems. Constancy and persistence are key factors that contribute to the overall stability of an ecosystem. These factors can be highly variable and change across forest ecosystems. We studied the effects of forest management on the strength of resource-consumer interactions (bird predation and insect herbivory) as important measures of ecosystem functioning, as well as on their constancy in time in four different forested regions globally. Within each region, we selected (i) three heavily managed or plantation forests, and (ii) three urban/peri-urban forests or urban plantings, and paired each of them with pristine/semi-natural forests. Bird predation was estimated using plasticine caterpillars of different colors. Chewer, galler, and miner herbivory on leaves were estimated for 15 plants (shrubs and trees) per study site. Constancy was quantified as the invariability of both predation and herbivory during a period of three (exceptionally two) years. We found no consistent responses of either predation or herbivory to forest management practices across study regions. Bird predation was higher in urban/peri-urban forests than in pristine/semi-natural forests in Patagonian and boreal forest, with intermediate levels of predation in managed or plantation forests. These differences might be explained by the increase of resource availability during the winters and by the higher abundances of generalist predators due to increase of temperatures (i.e., urban heat effect), for those regions where winter temperatures could be a limiting factor. Chewing insect herbivory was lower in urban/peri-urban forests, probably due to the exclusion of certain herbivores in response to warming and the higher predation pressure relative to pristine forests. No differences were found in other types of herbivory, indicating that effects of urbanization are guild-specific. In addition, we consistently found no effects of forest management practices on predation invariability and herbivory, thereby demonstrating the high constancy of ecosystem functioning to different forest management practices across regions. These findings advance our knowledge of the generalized effects of forest management on ecosystem functions and stability by establishing a connection between the ecology and management and conservation of plantations and natural forests.

AB  - Sitatunga Tragelaphus spekii is an antelope species adapted to the dense swamps and marshes of Sub-Saharan Africa, where traditional population survey techniques have been ineffective and encountered difficulties in making estimations. The species formerly occurred alongside waterways throughout the lowland forest zone of West and central Africa, extending into swamp systems in the savanna zones of central, East, and southern Africa. In most parts of Africa, the sitatunga population is declining, and attracting the attention of conservationists. Furthermore, its geographical range has been recorded to have shrunk. The present study reviewed major threats to sitatunga, assessed previous and current management approaches, and proposed new approaches to effectively manage its declining populations in Africa. To achieve the study objectives, published literature, reports, online information, expert knowledge, and personal experience were reviewed to acquire relevant information. Results indicated that sitatunga are threatened due to increased habitat loss, population isolation, political instability, water level changes, habitat fragmentation, illegal hunting, and diseases. Current wildlife management approaches raise many doubts as to their effectiveness. National-level management may unsustainably segment management actions while the protected area approach manages only part of the range of wildlife. The current tenure system in most parts of Africa discourages human-wildlife co-existence, whereas human-wildlife conflict management approaches only treat the symptoms and not the root cause of the problems. If wildlife, including sitatunga, are to persist in Africa, management approaches should be changed and include re-focusing of the management context at the ecosystems and landscape level; assessing the genetic diversity of sitatunga; promoting better wetland management, including the aspect of human dimension in management; using non-invasive techniques to genetically estimate the minimum population size; assessing inbreeding; and enhancing the implementation strategy of wildlife policy in African countries. Changing the attitude of the local community may take time, but it is a pivotal point if humans and wildlife are to coexist.

AB  - Global coral reef ecosystems face various levels of disturbance pressure. Understanding the depth-structured variation in coral reef fish communities can help us to better grasp and predict the adaptive changes of the ecosystem under different stressors. This study applied eDNA metabarcoding technology to analyze the spatial distribution of the coral reef fish at various depths (0 m, 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m, 50 m, and 60 m) within the Xisha Islands of China. The results indicated that the eDNA technology detected a total of 213 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), including 33 species that were not identified using traditional methods. Herbivorous fish generally dominated in relative abundance across different depths. Moreover, the similarity among depth groups was largely absent, and significant differences existed in fish assemblages across depth gradients, consistent with the unique depth preferences of fish microhabitats. Importantly, our findings revealed distinct depth-structured variation among different functional groups of coral reef fish. Large carnivorous fish initially increased and then decreased along the depth gradient from 0 to 60 m, with a turning point around 20 m, while large herbivorous fish displayed the opposite trend. Small carnivorous and small herbivorous fish consistently declined along the same depth gradient. Additionally, the Margalef index (D) and Function richness (FRic) both displayed a consistent downward trend with increasing depth, while the Shannon-Wiener index (H '), Pielou index (J '), Quadratic entropy (RaoQ), Functional dispersion (FDis), and Functional evenness (FEve) initially increased and then decreased, peaking around 20 m. This study revealed that eDNA metabarcoding is an effective tool for evaluating coral reef fish biodiversity, community composition, and spatial distribution. It enhances our understanding of distribution dynamics and offers valuable insights for coral reef conservation and restoration efforts.

AB  - Biological pest control relies on interactions between herbivores and their natural enemies. Maintaining this ecosystem service requires considering herbivore and natural enemy interactions and their response to anthropogenic change at multiple scales. In this study, we used ecological networks to quantify the network structure of interactions between herbivorous insects and their parasitoids. We examined how herbivore host abundance, parasitism rates, and shifts in network structure relate to changes in local habitat management and landscape context. We sampled herbivores and parasitoids in Brassica oleracea plants at 22 urban gardens in the Central Coast of California. At each site, we measured local management characteristics (e.g., vegetation, ground cover, canopy cover) and quantified surrounding landscape composition (e.g., urban, natural, open, and agricultural cover). For the eight sites with large enough networks, we calculated three network structure metrics (interaction richness, vulnerability, and functional complementarity). We then used generalized linear and mixed models to examine relationships between herbivore host abundance, parasitism rates, garden management and landscape characteristics, and network metrics. We found that both local management and landscape composition influenced parasitism, while only local factors affected host abundance and network structure. Higher network interaction richness was marginally associated with enhanced parasitism rates for two host species and lower parasitism rates for one host species. Our results suggest that local garden management decisions may shift the structure of host-parasitoid networks, which may subsequently affect host parasitism rates, but outcomes for biological pest control will likely vary across host species.

Halmyris was the most easterly fort of the Danubian border in Roman times and probably served as a supply centre for the imperial fleet; Roman inscriptions inform on the existence of a 'mariner's village' named vicus classicorum. Given that the written information about this settlement is extremely incomplete, the study of animal and plant remains can answer important questions related to economic life (e.g., human use of biological resources) and the relationship between community and environment. This study contributes to understanding the process of Roman domination in the area (e.g., highlighting the improved type of cattle, brought and reproduced here by the Romans), as well as to the knowledge of environmental changes under anthropic pressure (e.g., animal extinction, such as aurochs). In 2014, extensive archaeological research took place in the extramural area of the fort. During research, a total area of 234 sqm was investigated through five trenches west-east oriented and perpendicular to vallum II but not intersecting with it. Phytolith samples were taken from the habitation levels dated to the 5th-6th centuries AD, and faunal remains were collected from four trenches dated to the 4th-6th centuries AD. Phytolith assemblages from the Halmyris site are composed mainly of grass phytoliths. We noticed important amounts of Elongate dendritic forms and a high proportion of silica skeletons. Phytolith analysis resulting from the processing of 12 samples shows that cereals were a relevant part of the subsistence economy of the site, revealing an important signal of cereal processing. Flax fibers, which are the strongest natural fibers, were also identified in samples from Halmyris. The exploited animal resources are varied, including molluscs, fish, birds, and mammals. Most of the skeletal remains belong to the group of mammals. Animal husbandry represented an important occupation; the identified domestic mammals are cattle, sheep, goat, pig, horse, donkey, and dog. The predominant species were cattle and sheep/goat, both by the number of identified remains and by the minimal number of individuals. Hunting had small importance for the settlement under study, red deer and wild boar having the highest proportion of wild mammals.

AB  - Deer management in forest ecosystems requires information on deer densities and impacts to inform culling decisions with a known target density for acceptable damage levels. In multi-ungulate assemblages, managers need knowledge of relative impacts by different species or guilds. In an extensive (195 km(2)) conifer forest in eastern England, we related Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) leader damage (% dominant shoots browsed) in 48 restocked stands (1-3 years growth) over multiple years (n = 79 observations) to species-specific annual muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi), roe (Capreolus capreolus), fallow (Dama dama) and "large deer" densities (composite of annual fallow and multi-year mean red deer Cervus elaphus) using generalized mixed effects models. Forest-wide density surface models were calibrated through intensive annual thermal imaging distance transects and local densities around stands resampled within confidence bounds. Models also examined effects of ground vegetation and hare presence (Lepus europaeus). More pine leaders were browsed at higher fallow or large deer densities (22% and 18%, respectively, increased leader damage across inter-quartile range). Leader damage intensity was not influenced by ground vegetation, hares, muntjac (across the range 8.3-41.6 individuals km(-2)) or roe deer density (1.7-19.4 individuals km(-2)). To reduce pine crop damage to economically acceptable levels, managers need to reduce fallow deer to a density as low as 0.6 individuals km(-2) (CI = 0.06-1.44, which is considered impractical) or reduce combined large deer density to 2.3 (CI = 1.18-3.46) individuals km(-2). Reducing muntjac or roe abundance would minimally affect leader damage in this system, but may be important for other tree species. Multi-species deer management requires species-specific understanding of impacts and robust density estimates.

AB  - Geographic variation in ecosystem function is often attributed to differences in climate and soil properties, with biophysical constraints assumed to dictate spatial patterns in nutrient cycling, carbon storage, and plant productivity. However, biotic interactions, particularly herbivory, also vary geographically and can generate feedbacks that influence ecosystem processes. Using a replicated three-year field experiment, we tested how population-level functional differences in a widespread arthropod herbivore mediate geographic variation in ecosystem function. Structural equation modeling revealed that herbivores exerted strong direct effects on plant biomass, soil carbon, and nitrogen mineralization, often surpassing the influence of historical conditions and geographic variation in climate. Moreover, functionally distinct herbivore populations had divergent effects on nutrient cycling and plant diversity, demonstrating that population-level differences introduce novel pathways of influence on ecosystem function. These findings challenge ecosystem models that prioritize abiotic constraints and highlight the need to incorporate consumer-driven feedbacks into ecological frameworks.

AB  - Urban waterbodies provide important services to humans and play a considerable role in biodiversity conservation. Yet, we still know very little about how urban pond ecosystems may respond to ongoing and future stresses operating at multiple spatial scales. Here we examined the littoral macroinvertebrates in 20 urban waterbodies as an indicator community to assess how local waterbody condition and urban land use affected their taxonomic and functional feeding group composition. Although macroinvertebrates were diverse (total richness of 60 family taxa ranging from 10 to 41), they were dominated by two major taxonomic groups, the Diptera Chironomidae (36%) and Annelida Oligochaeta (22%), which largely represent the dominant functional feeding group of the collector-gatherers (63%). Fuzzy clustering identified four different types of communities based on taxonomic and functional feeding groups. These reflected inversed gradients in the dominance of collector-gatherers versus ponds with higher abundances of herbivores (Gastropoda Pulmonata, Hemiptera, Trichoptera), collectors-filterers (Gastropoda Prosobranchia, Crustacea Ostracoda), predators (Odonata), and parasites (Nematoda, Hydracarina). Distance-based redundancy analysis identified macrophyte cover and green landscape (parks and buildings with green yards) within a 100-m radius as the best drivers to differentiate among the different waterbody clusters. Specifically, waterbodies characterized by high macrophyte cover and the presence of buildings with green yards within 100 m had the highest abundances and diversity. Our results illustrate the benefit of green spaces, beyond parks, up to 2000 m but especially within 100 m from ponds.

AB  - Nature reserves are an effective tool in protecting species that are threatened by anthropogenic factors. However, various subtle but significant human disturbances still negatively affect wildlife, such as the incursion of domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) into wildlife communities. We conducted camera trap surveys and tracked GPS-collared dogs in and around a network of 17 nature reserves, and examined the spatio-temporal responses of eight abundant large and medium-sized wild animals to domestic dogs, including seven mammals (leopard cat, Prionailurus bengalensis; wild boar, Sus scrofa; Reeve's muntjac, Muntiacus reevesi; tufted deer, Elaphodus cephalophus; hog badger, Arctonyx albogularis; Siberian weasel, Mustela sibirica, and yellow-throated marten, Martes flavigula), and one pheasant (golden pheasant, Chrysolophus pictus). Our occupancy models indicated that the presence of domestic dogs negatively affected the occurrence probability of all focal species except for the yellow-throated marten. For wild boar, Reeve's muntjac, leopard cat and golden pheasant that we had sufficient data to further examine their temporal response to domestic dogs, we found that three species but leopard cat demonstrated temporal avoidance of domestic dogs, and dogs temporally followed the detections of these species. By overlapping the predicted distribution of dogs with nature reserve boundaries, we estimated that wildlife in approximately 19.8% of the 17-nature reserve network were potentially under the negative impact by domestic dog activity. Our study revealed the urgent need for nature reserves within the giant panda range, and possibly elsewhere, to consider domestic dogs as a significant human disturbance.

AB  - Groundwater-dependent ecosystems are biologically diverse and productive ecosystems but constitute a small fraction of total land area in semiarid regions. Efforts to link remotely sensed data from satellite-based platforms to measurements of vegetation structure and function at smaller spatial scales have increasingly received attention, due to the need to manage diverse landscapes at scales relevant to management. In the semiarid western United States, grazing is a dominant land use and meadows can receive a high degree of grazing pressure. In this study we examined satellite-based and near-surface imagery to determine if they were useful in assessing grazed systems with different grazing management. We compared meadows that were chronically grazed by feral horses in conjunction with periodic cattle grazing to a meadow managed and grazed by cattle only. We examined the agreement between near-surface digital cameras (PhenoCams) and satellite-based indices of greenness and production for meadows in the Central Great Basin, United States. We also verified them with field-collected data on percent foliar cover by dominant functional groups. There was strong agreement between the Landsat normalized difference vegetation index and PhenoCam Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) (Pearson's r >= 0.61). Gross primary production modeled using Landsat satellite imagery and integrated over the growing season had a strong linear relationship with GCC integrated over the growing season (R-2 = 0.89). Furthermore, despite differences in spatial and temporal resolution, integrated metrics from both platforms were able to discern differences in grazing pressure. Meadows with chronic feral horse grazing plus 3 mo of livestock grazing had reduced integrated gross primary production and GCC in comparison with a meadow that had short-term grazing (for 2 mo) by livestock only. The ability to detect differences in grazed systems from PhenoCams and satellite platforms provides important tools for quantifying the effects of grazing in groundwater-dependent ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding the structure of communities across multiple scales is useful for predicting impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Scavenging, an important ecological function performed by scavenger assemblages, stands as a significant force shaping ecosystems. Using biodiversity partitioning, we assess the relative contribution of multiple scales (i.e., within and among individual carcasses, species and habitats) to the richness and Shannon diversity of vertebrate scavenger communities consuming anthropogenic food subsidies (i.e. livestock carrion) in central Argentina. We further evaluate the potential effect of carcass and habitat characteristics (including human impact) on the richness, abundance and diversity of vertebrate scavengers. A total of 31 carcasses, 22 of cow and nine of sheep, were monitored using remote cameras in cropland and natural habitats, recording consumption by 10 vertebrate species (four birds and six mammals). 50 % of scavenger species were observed at carcass level (alpha 1 = 4.94 species), a contribution lower than expected by chance. While the turnover of species among carcasses (beta 1 diversity) significantly contributed (40 %) to regional richness (gamma diversity), turnover of species between carrion types and habitats (beta 2 diversity) contributed a smaller fraction (10 %). Partitioning of Shannon diversity showed similar patterns to richness. Scavenger abundance increased during spring and was positively influenced by carcass weight; furthermore, carcasses in croplands supported less abundance that those located in natural habitats. Aligning with the theory of carrion unpredictability in maintaining biodiversity, our results suggest that scavenger species replacement (turnover) at human-mediated carcasses scattered in the field plays a significant role in shaping vertebrate scavenger assemblages.

AB  - Insect herbivores play important roles in shaping many ecosystem processes, but how climate change will alter the effects of insect herbivory are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified for the first time how insect frass and cadavers affected leaf litter decomposition rates and nutrient release along a highly constrained 4.3 degrees C mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient in a Hawaiian montane tropical wet forest. We constructed litterbags of standardized locally sourced leaf litter, with some amended with insect frass + cadavers to produce treatments designed to simulate ambient (Control = no amendment), moderate (Amended-Low = 2 x Control level), or severe (Amended-High = 11 x Control level) insect outbreak events. Multiple sets of these litterbags were deployed across the MAT gradient, with individual litterbags collected periodically over one year to assess how rising MAT altered the effects of insect deposits on litter decomposition rates and nitrogen (N) release. Increased MAT and insect inputs additively increased litter decomposition rates and N immobilization rates, with effects being stronger for Amended-High litterbags. However, the apparent temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of litter decomposition was not clearly affected by amendments. The effects of adding insect deposits in this study operated differently than the slower litter decomposition and greater N mobilization rates often observed in experiments which use chemical fertilizers (e.g., urea, ammonium nitrate). Further research is required to understand mechanistic differences between amendment types. Potential increases in outbreak-related herbivore deposits coupled with climate warming will accelerate litter decomposition and nutrient cycling rates with short-term consequences for nutrient cycling and carbon storage in tropical montane wet forests.

AB  - Disturbances play a central role in shaping biodiversity, influencing both community structure and ecosystem function. The responses of biodiversity to disturbance are inherently multidimensional, often leading to shifts in taxonomic composition, functional traits, and evolutionary dynamics within biological communities. Unraveling these dimensions offers valuable insights into ecosystem resilience and how communities adapt under changing disturbance regimes. This study examines the immediate effects of large-scale hurricane disturbance on the taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional dimensions of moth biodiversity in a tropical forest. We conducted monthly moth surveys in two forest types within the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico, 5 months before and 6 months after Hurricanes Irma and Mar & iacute;a (September 2017). We collected 6152 individuals from 244 species across 19 families, performed DNA barcoding for phylogenetic analysis, and classified them by functional traits such as body size, coloration, and proboscis presence. Our findings show that hurricane disturbance reduced species richness across all diversity dimensions, while functional diversity among dominant species increased, suggesting potential stabilization of ecosystem functions despite reduced richness. In addition, the hurricanes altered both taxonomic and phylogenetic composition, with smaller grass-feeding species increasing in abundance post-hurricane, while larger arboreal-feeding species, especially geometrid moths, declined markedly. These shifts highlight potential effects on trophic interactions, given moths' key roles as herbivores, pollinators, and prey. Although these systems have evolved under repeated hurricane disturbances, the long-term consequences of a changing climate remain uncertain, particularly as more frequent and severe hurricanes may reset successional pathways and hinder forest recovery. By integrating multiple dimensions of biodiversity, our study provides a more holistic understanding of the complex consequences of hurricanes on insect communities and can inform conservation strategies aimed at enhancing ecosystem resilience.
   Los disturbios juegan un papel crucial en la configuraci & oacute;n de la biodiversidad, influyendo tanto la estructura de las comunidades, as & iacute; como el funcionamiento de los ecosistemas. Las respuestas de la biodiversidad a los disturbios son inherentemente multidimensionales, lo que puede generar cambios en la composici & oacute;n taxon & oacute;mica, los rasgos funcionales y las din & aacute;micas evolutivas de las comunidades biol & oacute;gicas. Desligar estas dimensiones ofrece informaci & oacute;n valiosa sobre la resiliencia de los ecosistemas y sobre c & oacute;mo las comunidades se adaptan a reg & iacute;menes de disturbios en constante cambio. Este estudio examina los efectos inmediatos de huracanes de gran escala en la biodiversidad taxon & oacute;mica, filogen & eacute;tica y funcional de polillas en un bosque tropical. Muestreamos polillas mensualmente en dos tipos de bosque en las Monta & ntilde;as de Luquillo, Puerto Rico, 5 meses antes y 6 meses despu & eacute;s de los huracanes Irma y Mar & iacute;a (septiembre 2017). Recolectamos 6152 individuos de 244 especies pertenecientes a 19 familias, secuenciamos ADN para an & aacute;lisis filogen & eacute;tico y clasificamos por rasgos funcionales como tama & ntilde;o, coloraci & oacute;n y presencia de prob & oacute;scide. Los resultados muestran que los huracanes redujeron la riqueza de especies en todas las dimensiones de diversidad, pero aumentaron la diversidad funcional entre las especies dominantes, sugiriendo posible estabilizaci & oacute;n de funciones ecosist & eacute;micas pese a menor riqueza. Adem & aacute;s, los huracanes alteraron la composici & oacute;n taxon & oacute;mica y filogen & eacute;tica; las especies peque & ntilde;as que se alimentan de gram & iacute;neas aumentaron en abundancia, mientras que las especies m & aacute;s grandes que se alimentan de vegetaci & oacute;n arb & oacute;rea declinaron. Estos cambios podr & iacute;an afectar las interacciones tr & oacute;ficas, dado el papel clave de las polillas como herb & iacute;voros, polinizadores y presas. Aunque estos sistemas han evolucionado con huracanes recurrentes, el impacto a largo plazo del cambio clim & aacute;tico es incierto, especialmente si los huracanes m & aacute;s frecuentes e intensos interrumpen las trayectorias sucesionales y dificultan la recuperaci & oacute;n. Al integrar m & uacute;ltiples dimensiones de biodiversidad, nuestro estudio provee un an & aacute;lisis m & aacute;s hol & iacute;stico de las complejas consecuencias de los huracanes sobre las comunidades de insectos y puede contribuir a estrategias de conservaci & oacute;n dirigidas a fortalecer la resiliencia ecosist & eacute;mica.

AB  - The use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for wildlife surveying and research has widely expanded in the past decade, but with varying levels of success. Applying UAS paired with Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) technology to survey forest-dwelling species has been particularly challenging because of unreliable animal detection. We describe our application of UAS and FLIR technology to detect GPS-collared moose (Alces alces) and their calves in the heavily-forested region of northeastern Minnesota, USA, during 2018 and 2019. We conducted grid-pattern UAS thermal surveys over GPS-collared cows during the calving seasons (April to June) of 2018 and 2019 to determine the feasibility of using a FLIR-equipped UAS for detecting cow moose, and for quantifying the number of calves. We also collected data on environmental and flight characteristic variables to model moose detection. Our best fitting model of moose detection showed increased detection with more cloud cover at the survey site ((beta) over cap = 1.13, SE = 0.43), whereas increased forest canopy ((beta) over cap = -1.10, SE = 0.38), and vegetative greenness (enhanced vegetation index, EVI; (beta) over cap = -1.37, SE = 0.32) both reduced detection success. By adjusting our methodology based on our detection model findings, we increased our adult moose detection success from 25% during our first season, to 85% during our second season, and calf detection from 27% to 79%, respectively. We report on our methodological improvements and identify limitations to UAS-based wildlife research in forested systems. Overall, we found that UAS with FLIR sensing is a promising tool for quantifying moose calving success, twinning rate, and calf survival, and may be effective for monitoring the reproductive success and survival of other wildlife species in densely forested regions.

AB  - African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) can substantially modify their habitat through their interactions with woody vegetation. Nonetheless, the scale, intensity and characteristics of these relations are not yet fully understood. Consequently, it is unclear how vegetation-megafauna interactions can be disrupted by external factors, such as land management. This study attempted to quantify and characterize structural changes in vegetation caused by elephants, from landscape to tree level scales. We applied multi-scale geospatial tools, including airborne (ALS) and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), to address the following questions: (1) How do elephants shape landscape level vegetation structure in conservation areas? (2) Are the impacts of elephants evident on individual tree architecture? Our study area was located at the Taita Hills Wildlife Sanctuary in Southeastern Kenya. The occurrence of elephants was estimated using elephant observation records and proximity to elephant tracks. Landscape level structure was assessed using tree density maps calculated based on individually detected treetops from ALS data. Next, TLS measurements of 72 trees were processed using quantitative structural modelling to characterize their architecture. Our results demonstrate a widespread influence of elephants on both landscape and tree level structural characteristics. This influence was strongly mediated by management, as we observed differences in vegetation structure inside and outside conservation areas. Tree density was up to 42% lower (5.84 trees/ha) in conservation areas than in non-conservation areas (10.17 trees/ha). Trees were relatively larger with closer proximity to elephant tracks, while smaller trees were more often observed in areas further away from elephants. At an architectural level, trees closer to elephant tracks had lower ratio between the crown length and the tree height, demonstrating a substantial influence of elephants on the morphological characteristics of trees. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for vegetation fauna interactions when planning conservation areas in African savannahs.

AB  - Livestock grazing is the most extensive land use in global drylands and one of the most extensive stressors of biological soil crusts (biocrusts). Despite widespread concern about the importance of biocrusts for global carbon (C) cycling, little is known about whether and how long-term grazing alters soil organic carbon (SOC) stability and stock in the biocrust layer. To assess the responses of SOC stability and stock in the biocrust layer to grazing, from June to September 2020, we carried out a large scale field survey in the restored grasslands under long-term grazing with different grazing intensities (represented by the number of goat dung per square meter) and in the grasslands strictly excluded from grazing in four regions (Dingbian County, Shenmu City, Guyuan City and Ansai District) along precipitation gradient in the hilly Loess Plateau, China. In total, 51 representative grassland sites were identified as the study sampling sites in this study, including 11 sites in Guyuan City, 16 sites in Dingbian County, 15 sites in Shenmu City and 9 sites in Ansai District. Combined with extensive laboratory analysis and statistical analysis, at each sampling site, we obtained data on biocrust attributes (cover, community structure, biomass and thickness), soil physical-chemical properties (soil porosity and soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N ratio)), and environmental factors (mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, altitude, plant cover, litter cover, soil particle-size distribution (the ratio of soil clay and silt content to sand content)), SOC stability index (SI) and SOC stock (SOCS) in the biocrust layer, to conduct this study. Our results revealed that grazing did not change total biocrust cover but markedly altered biocrust community structure by reducing plant cover, with a considerable increase in the relative cover of cyanobacteria (23.1%) while a decrease in the relative cover of mosses (42.2%). Soil porosity and soil C/N ratio in the biocrust layer under grazing decreased significantly by 4.1%-7.2% and 7.2%-13.3%, respectively, compared with those under grazing exclusion. The shifted biocrust community structure ultimately resulted in an average reduction of 15.5% in SOCS in the biocrust layer under grazing. However, compared with higher grazing (intensity of more than 10.00 goat dung/m(2)), light grazing (intensity of 0.00-10.00 goat dung/m(2) or approximately 1.20-2.60 goat/(hm(2)& BULL;a)) had no adverse effect on SOCS. SOC stability in the biocrust layer remained unchanged under long-term grazing due to the offset between the positive effect of the decreased soil porosity and the negative effect of the decreased soil C/N ratio on the SOC resistance to decomposition. Mean annual precipitation and soil particle-size distribution also regulated SOC stability indirectly by influencing soil porosity through plant cover and biocrust community structure. These findings suggest that proper grazing might not increase the CO2 release potential or adversely affect SOCS in the biocrust layer. This research provides some guidance for proper grazing management in the sustainable utilization of grassland resources and C sequestration in biocrusts in the hilly regions of drylands.

AB  - Wildfires are increasing in size, frequency and severity due to climate change and fire suppression, but the direct and indirect effects on wildlife remain largely unresolved. Fire removes forest canopy, which can improve forage for ungulates but also reduce snow interception, leading to a deeper snowpack and potentially increased vulnerability to predation in winter. If ungulates exhibit predator-mediated foraging, burns should generally be selected for in summer to access high-quality forage and avoided in winter to reduce predation risk in deep snow. Fires also typically increase the amount of deadfall and initiate the growth of dense understory vegetation, creating obstacles that may confer a hunting advantage to stalking predators and a disadvantage to coursing predators. To minimize risk, ungulates may therefore avoid burns when and where stalking predators are most active, and use burns when and where coursing predators are most active. We used telemetry data from GPS-collared mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), cougars (Puma concolor) and wolves (Canis lupus) to develop step selection functions to examine how mule deer navigated species-specific predation risk across a landscape in northern Washington, USA, that has experienced substantial wildfire activity during the past several decades. We considered a diverse array of wildfire impacts, accounting for both the severity of the fire and time since the burn (1-35 years) in our analyses. We observed support for the predator mediating foraging hypothesis: mule deer generally selected for burned areas in summer and avoided burns in winter. In addition, deer increased use of burned areas when and where wolf activity was high and avoided burns when and where cougar use was high in winter, suggesting the hunting mode of resident predators mediated the seasonal response of deer to burns. Deer were not more likely to die by predation in burned than in unburned areas, indicating that they adequately manage fire-induced changes to predation risk. As fire activity increases with climate change, our findings indicate the impact on ungulates will depend on trade-offs between enhanced summer forage and functionally reduced winter range, mediated by characteristics of the predator community.

AB  - Hog deer (Axis porcinus) were once widespread throughout much of lowland Southern Asia, but numbers rapidly declined during the last two decades. In Cambodia, the species was considered extinct until 2006 when a small number of individuals (presumedly spp. annamiticus) was rediscovered along the western bank of the Mekong River, near Kratie. Since reliable data on this population are lacking, we conducted two camera trap surveys to investigate hog deer habitat use, activity patterns and density. In the first survey, camera traps were placed in a random regular grid covering all main habitat types in the region, enabling us to verify hog deer presence/absence and identify habitat use. We found that hog deer were confined to a remnant patch of tall moist grassland of approximately 2 km(2), at least in the dry season. The follow-up survey was conducted exclusively in this tall grassland patch, in which we estimated hog deer activity patterns and density using kernel density estimation and a simplified version of the random encounter model (REM). Cameras were active for a total of 1770 camera trap days, during which 609 independent hog deer encounters were recorded. Density was estimated to be 41.8 (CI: 37.93-45.72) individuals km(-2), equating to an estimated abundance of 84 individuals. Hog deer activity was mainly crepuscular and nocturnal. We conclude that the recently rediscovered hog deer population in Kratie province is extremely vulnerable to extinction due to its small size and its complete dependency on a tiny remnant patch of core habitat. Conservation and restoration actions to preserve and restore prime habitat are urgently required to prevent local extinction.

AB  - Human activities are altering terrestrial ecosystem biogeochemistry globally by augmenting the availability of multiple biologically essential nutrients, thereby potentially altering plant internal concentrations (i.e., stoichiometry) across a diverse array of elements. These shifts in plant nutrient concentrations may subsequently impact crucial ecosystem processes, including litter decomposition, herbivory by insects and large animals, and ecosystem productivity. However, most work on the alteration of plant stoichiometry has focused on a few macronutrients (e.g., nitrogen or phosphorus), despite the potential importance of many other elements. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive field experiment in the Inner Mongolia Steppe, manipulating eight distinct nutrients to examine their effects on both soil and plant tissue concentrations. Our findings reveal that adding most nutrients increased their corresponding available contents in the soil. In most cases, the addition of nutrients also increased their corresponding concentrations in plant tissues at both species and community levels. Besides, multiple nutrient additions had greater effects on soil available nutrient contents than on plant internal nutrient concentrations. Notably, the concurrent addition of multiple nutrients led to a significant homogenization of plant stoichiometry among different species within the same community. This homogenization might influence interspecific interactions and coexistence within grassland ecosystems. Our findings advanced our comprehension of how anthropogenic nutrient enrichment may simplify plant nutrient profiles, thereby influencing grassland biodiversity and ecosystem functionality.

AB  - In the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, characterized by its humid climate, large rural areas are being abandoned, mostly in less-favoured areas covered by heathlands, which present a low nutritive quality for livestock production. The high combustibility of these shrublands is driving a high wildfire incidence with negative environmental and economic effects. In this review, some aspects on wildfire occurrence and the potential of grazing livestock to reduce woody phytomass and fire risk in heathland-dominated areas whilst maintaining quality production and preserving biodiversity are summarized. Heathlands may be partially improved-converted to grassland-to better meet animals' nutritional requirements while acting as 'natural' firebreaks. The specific grazing behaviour offers the opportunity to combine different domestic herbivores (mixed grazing) to achieve sustainable systems utilizing heterogeneous resources. Cattle, sheep, goats, and horses may have a role in the provision of different ecosystem services such as food production and biodiversity conservation. Genotype x environment interactions shape the ability of animals to cope with poor vegetation conditions, with smaller species and breeds performing better than larger animals. Goats and horses are indicated to arrest woody encroachment. Sustainable grazing systems are affordable in heathland-grassland mosaics by selecting appropriate livestock species and breeds for quality production, thus favouring rural economies and lowering fire risk.

AB  - Silvicultural practices, effective fire suppression, and increased browser densities have profoundly altered structural diversity in boreal forests. Prescribed burning and retention forestry may counteract losses in structural diversity in managed forests by maintaining a higher deciduous admixture. We constructed an experiment on 18 sites with three types of timber harvesting (uncut, cut with retention, and clearcut) and burned half of these sites. Subsequently, we established a herbivore treatment with three compartments (unfenced, fenced excluding moose (Alces alces (Linnaeus, 1758)), and fenced excluding moose and hares (Lepus spp.)). In these compartments, we planted rowan ( Sorbus aucuparia L.), European aspen (Populus tremula L.), and silver birch ( Betula pendula Roth) seedlings and monitored these for 17 years. Birch and rowan mortality were lower on cut and burned sites, with retention further enhancing birch survival on these sites. Retention without burning did not lower seedling mortality of any tree species. While browsing resulted in greater mortality on cut sites, burning appeared to greatly reduce browsing on birch and rowan. On mature uncut sites, seedlings of all tree species exhibited high mortality. Our findings show that deciduous tree recruitment can be improved through prescribed burning, particularly for birch and rowan, and that browsing impacts on deciduous trees depend on forest age.

AB  - Overabundant ungulate populations have impacted forestry and agricultural systems, as well as natural ecosystems, worldwide. To effectively control the sika deer (Cervus nippon) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations, which are currently under limited hunting pressure in Japan, we evaluated the prefectures' past management experiences with 2 wildlife laws: a prefecture-determined management system for relaxing hunting regulations implemented in 2000 and municipality-determined damage control system for subsidized culling implemented in 2008. Time series data (1990-2014) of sika deer and wild boar harvest per hunter for each prefecture were grouped using dynamic time warping clustering analyses. All groups of both ungulates demonstrated significant increases in harvest per hunter after implementing both laws. The prefectures with the most experience in deer management could control sika deer populations through management planning, culling supported by subsidies, and enforcement of antlerless deer harvest. The strategies are likely ineffective for controlling wild boar populations because of the lack of effective selective harvesting and limited survey methods for population monitoring. Our findings suggest that prefectures' experience in hunting management influences the success of population reduction actions for sika deer.

AB  - Sediment density flows are large scale disturbances that can have dramatic impacts on seafloor animal communities in the deep sea. Seafloor imagery collected in Kaikoura Canyon (New Zealand), before and after a sediment density flow event that included debris and turbidity flows triggered by a 2016 M-w 7.8 Kaikoura Earthquake, shows the recovery trajectory of the animal community in the canyon head in the weeks, months, and years following the disturbance. The canyon community appears resilient to this event, with models estimating full recovery within a minimum of 4.5-5.1 years and as long as 12 years. The implications of the resilience of this deep-sea community are discussed in the context of the local marine protected area, the surrounding fishery, and global seabed mining.

AB  - The increasing use of artificial light at night has led to ecosystem exposure to light pollution worldwide. Aquatic ecosystems are particularly exposed, since lit road networks, urban development and industrial infrastructure are frequently located along river, lake, and sea shores. Although the negative effects of night-time lighting on the physiology, behaviour, and life-history traits of animals have been largely documented, there is a large knowledge gap about the responses of plants, especially regarding leaf functioning and resource-management strategies. Some authors have proposed contrasting hypotheses of mechanistic responses to dim light at night in plants, but empirical results are still lacking. Based on field measurements of nocturnal irradiance in freshwater ecosystems located in peri-urban areas, we performed a mesocosm experiment using three species of submerged aquatic plants. After 5 months of exposure to realistic dim light at night, four functional traits related to the resource management at the leaf level were measured. Artificial light at night had significant effects on the leaf physiology or chemistry, affecting their resource acquisition rate, but with different response intensities depending on the species. No effect was found on morphological or biomechanical traits for any of the studied species. These results support the hypothesis that plants could interpret dim light at night as a shaded environment and respond accordingly. We demonstrated that the effects of light at night on plants may have been underestimated in previous work. By modifying biotic interactions (e.g., competition and herbivory), these responses can have profound effects on community structure and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - The impacts of the expanding African elephant (Loxodonta africana) population in southern Africa leads to a shift in savanna vegetation community composition and structure. However, little has been done to understand the effect of elephants on the structure of keystone tree species like the baobab. We sampled two protected areas in Southeast lowveld of Zimbabwe to quantify the impact of elephants on the baobab (Adansonia digitata L.), one area with elephants (Save Valley Conservancy: SVC) and the other without elephants (Chipinge Safari Area: CSA). Data on elephant damage, baobab density, and structural variables (tree height, stem basal area, and canopy cover) were collected in seven 1 km2 plots. Baobab damage was classed into four categories, i) new, ii) old, iii) very old, and iv) none, to have a time series interpretation. Distances of every baobab tree from spatial variables, nearest management road, perennial water source and conservancy boundary were measured. Baobabs in the absence of elephants (CSA) were taller with higher basal area and canopy cover than those where elephants were present (SVC). Although SVC baobabs had smaller structural variables compared with CSA, their density was much higher 1.69 ha1 compared with 0.94 ha1 for CSA. More baobabs in the smaller size classes for SVC suggests that recruitment was higher than CSA. No elephant damage was observed in the CSA although 23 % of baobabs showed signs of very old harvesting of bark by humans. All trees in SVC showed signs of elephant damage in either trunks or canopies, with most of damage classed as very old. Baobab damage decreased with distance from roads and perennial water sources while it increased with distance from conservancy boundary. Our results demonstrate that elephants have a great impact on baobab structure but not necessarily recruitment as indicated by the presence of some baobabs in smaller size classes, suggesting that other factors may be more important in determining recruitment of this keystone species.

AB  - Riparian vegetation is crucial for maintaining terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity, but it is threatened by land-use activities. To assess the ecological impacts of riparian vegetation conversion to an oil tea (Camellia oleifera) plantation, we quantified the responses of small mammals in two natural habitats (mature forest and flood-meadow) and in Camellia forests at the community, population, and individual level. We found that the community diversity was similar between Camellia forests and mature forests, but higher than the flood-meadow. Meanwhile, the community composition differed across three habitats, with Camellia forests favoring habitat generalist species. At the population level, Camellia forests and flood-meadow had a similar population density, which were higher than mature forests. At the individual level, Rattus nitidus was less sensitive to this conversion, but the body condition index of Niviventer confucianus was higher in Camellia forests than in mature forests, and Apodemus agrarius in Camellia forests had more ectoparasite load than in the flood-meadow, indicating a species-specific response to the impacts of oil tea plantation. Our study highlights that the occurrence of habitat generalist species and high ectoparasite loads may threaten regional biodiversity and increase the risk of parasite transmission with enlarging the oil tea plantation area within riparian zones.

AB  - With the process of urbanization and the development of cities, trees in the urban environment are becoming increasingly important. Those trees represent a habitat and a food source for many organisms, among which insects are the most numerous and diverse. The insect communities inhabiting them frequently differ from those found in the rural environment. However, the transition from rural to urban habitat is rarely sharp, as there are many intermediary habitats that often represent the species rich areas. We investigated how the urbanization gradient affects the black poplar endophagous herbivorous insect community. To determine that, we compared the leaf miner and gallicolous aphid species richness, abundance, and diversity along rural-urban gradients. The research was conducted in 2019, in three cities in Serbia, in rural, suburban, and urban areas. We concluded that urbanization significantly influences the black poplar leaf miner community, while it does not have a significant effect on the black poplar gallicolous aphid community. Significantly lower leaf miner species richness and diversity were recorded in the urban environment, while their abundance was significantly lower in suburban areas. Contrary to most species, Fenusella hortulana (Hymenoptera) reacted positively to urbanization, while Aulagromyza populi (Diptera) and Phyllonorycter extrematrix (Lepidoptera) were not significantly affected. As about 80% of leaf miner species and 40% of gallicolous aphid species still manage to survive in the urban environment, the trees present in the urban environment are important for the preservation of their fauna.

AB  - Humans are increasingly recognized as important players in predator-prey dynamics by modifying landscapes. This trend has been well-documented for large mammal communities in North American boreal forests: logging creates early seral forests that benefit ungulates such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), while the combination of infrastructure development and resource extraction practices generate linear features that allow predators such as wolves (Canis lupus) to travel and forage more efficiently throughout the landscape. Disturbances from recreational activities and residential development are other major sources of human activity in boreal ecosystems that may further alter wolf-ungulate dynamics. Here, we evaluate the influence that several major types of anthropogenic landscape modifications (timber harvest, linear features, and residential infrastructure) have on where and how wolves hunt ungulate neonates in a southern boreal forest ecosystem in Minnesota, USA. We demonstrate that each major anthropogenic disturbance significantly influences wolf predation of white-tailed deer fawns (n = 427 kill sites). In contrast with the "human shield hypothesis" that posits prey use human-modified areas as refuge, wolves killed fawns closer to residential buildings than expected based on spatial availability. Fawns were also killed within recently-logged areas more than expected. Concealment cover was higher at kill sites than random sites, suggesting wolves use senses other than vision, probably olfaction, to detect hidden fawns. Wolves showed strong selection for hunting along linear features, and kill sites were also closer to linear features than expected. We hypothesize that linear features facilitated wolf predation on fawns by allowing wolves to travel efficiently among high-quality prey patches (recently logged areas, near buildings), and also increase encounter rates with olfactory cues that allow them to detect hidden fawns. These findings provide novel insight into the strategies predators use to hunt ungulate neonates and the many ways human activity alters wolf-ungulate neonate predator-prey dynamics, which have remained elusive due to the challenges of locating sites where predators kill small prey. Our research has important management and conservation implications for wolf-ungulate systems subjected to anthropogenic pressures, particularly as the range of overlap between wolves and deer expands and appears to be altering food web dynamics in boreal ecosystems.

AB  - The benefits of low-intensity mixed livestock-crop farming systems for Mediterranean farmland biodiversity have been widely documented. However, little is known about the effects of farming specialisation, even though the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has promoted the replacement of mixed systems by specialised livestock and crop systems. We investigated how specialisation affects birds in open farmland of southern Portugal, by analysing spatial associations between farming systems, land uses, and birds' species richness and occurrence. We found a dominant landscape gradient contrasting specialisation in either sheep or cattle. The sheep system was positively related to woodland/shrubland-related species, Galerida larks and Melanocorypha calandra, while the cattle system was negatively related to these species. The specialised crop system, when associated with olive groves (< 10 % of the area), was negatively related to fallow-related species, M. calandra and Calandrella brachydactyla and positively so to overall species richness and that of woodland/shrubland-related species. Land uses had strong effects on birds, regardless of the farming systems in which they were embedded. Fodders were positively related to woodland/shrubland- and cereal-related species, Emberiza calandra and Cisticola juncidis. Rainfed grain cereals were positively related to cereal-related species, C. juncidis and Coturnix coturnix. Pastures were positively related to fallows- and ploughed-related species, M. calandra, Tetrax tetrax, and Galerida larks. Results suggest that programs for grassland conservation should consider both farming systems and land uses. CAP should promote diversified farming systems with reduced livestock densities along with high-quality habitats for grassland birds like pastures, fallows, rainfed grain cereals and semi-natural features.

AB  - Many boreal populations of woodland caribou in Canada are declining, mainly due to the prevalence of anthropogenic disturbances which alter predator-prey dynamics. Climate change is expected to exert an additional negative influence on caribou populations in coming decades, but it is unclear whether or how human activities and climate change will interact to influence habitat suitability for caribou, and how important these agents of change will be relative to each other. In this study, we used the LANDIS-II forest landscape model to forecast boreal caribou habitat suitability across its distribution within the harvestable boreal forest in Que ' bec for the period 2020-2100, under three increasing anthropogenic radiative forcing scenarios (baseline, Representative Concentration Pathways [RCP] 4.5 and 8.5), and two contrasting harvest scenarios (with and without harvest). Our simulations revealed that harvesting was the dominant agent explaining future variations in caribou habitat suitability, although climate change also decreased habitat suitability, especially under RCP 8.5. Climate-induced decreases in habitat suitability mostly originated from increases in wildfires that burned mature conifer-dominated forests, i.e., high-quality habitat for caribou. Habitat suitability by 2100 was also predicted to vary spatially, with the northeastern and northwestern parts of the study area supporting better caribou habitat conditions regardless of scenarios. We show that reducing harvest activities in areas where habitat suitability is currently high could help maintain high-quality caribou habitat even under the most intense climate change scenario. Our results also suggest that highly-disturbed regions which currently provide low-quality habitat may not improve in the future unless active habitat restoration is performed. Our study helps disentangle the potential future effects of forest management and climate change as threats to caribou habitat, emphasizing the urgency of reconciling forest management with the conservation of this species at risk in Canada.

AB  - Nutrient dynamics in dryland river floodplains remain poorly understood, particularly where ungulate herbivory results in significant dung deposition. I assessed organic matter and nitrogen (N) losses from elk (Cervus elaphus) dung deposited on the floodplain of the unregulated Yampa River in semiarid northwestern Colorado. Intact elk fecal pellets were placed on relatively high, vegetated floodplain surfaces in loose piles or enclosed in mesh bags and monitored for up to 847 days. No pellets were inundated by Yampa floodwaters. Modified exponential decay models indicated intact pellets lost 50% of their initial ash-free dry matter (AFDM) and N content in 980 and 903 days, respectively, and 90% in 2,224 and 1,820 days, respectively. Macroinvertebrates appeared to be unimportant in decomposition. Based on dung deposited in <= 19 permanent 28-m(2) plots monitored from 1999 to 2006, elk added an average 13.7 g AFDM.m(-2) and 200 mg N.m(-2) to the floodplain each year. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) added an average of 2.85 g AFDM.m(-2) and 68.2 mg N.m(-2) each year. Fecal N deposited on the floodplain, but derived from foraging outside it, would add to the N in flood-deposited sediment hypothesized to explain the N buildup observed during succession on the Yampa floodplain. The roles of large herbivores and dung decay processes in N cycling and dynamics on this and other dryland floodplains warrant greater attention.

AB  - Increasingly, ecological rehabilitation is envisioned to mitigate and revert impacts of ocean sprawl on coastal marine biodiversity. While in the past studies have demonstrated the positive effects of artificial fish habitats in port areas on fish abundance and diversity, benthic colonization of these structures has not yet been taken into consideration. This could be problematic as they may provide suitable habitat for Non-Indigenous Species (NIS) and hence facilitate their spreading. The present study aimed to examine communities developing on artificial fish habitats and to observe if the number of NIS was higher than in surrounding equivalent habitats. The structures were colonized by communities that were significantly different compared to those surrounding the control habitat, and they were home to a greater number of NIS. As NIS can cause severe ecological and economical damages, our results imply that in conjunction with the ecosystem services provided by artificial fish habitats, an ecosystem disservice in the form of facilitated NIS colonization may be present. These effects have not been shown before and need to be considered to effectively decide in which situations artificial structures may be used for fish rehabilitation.

AB  - Given recent global endeavors to increase protected area coverage, it is crucial to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of various area-based conservation strategies in effectively reducing biodiversity loss. Here, we investigated the responses of wildlife populations to different protection levels and environmental variables at the landscape scale in the Katavi-Rukwa Ecosystem, western Tanzania. To this end, we conducted line distance sampling surveys and counted the dung of six target mammal species (elephant, giraffe, buffalo, zebra, topi, and hartebeest) along foot transects within areas differing in protection levels (from strict to less-strictly protected: national park, game reserve, forest reserve, game-controlled area, and unprotected areas). Based on these dung counts, we modeled the spatial distribution of these six mammal species using a species-specific density surface modeling framework. We found consistent effects of protection level and land use variables on the spatial distribution of the target mammal species: dung densities were highest in the national park and game reserves, intermediate in less-strictly protected areas, and lowest in unprotected areas. Beyond species-specific environmental predictors for dung densities, our results highlight consistent negative associations between dung densities of the target species and distance to cropland and avoidance of areas in proximity to houses. Our findings underpin differences in ecological effectiveness of protected areas within one ecosystem. Protection level and land use play crucial roles in moderating the spatial distribution of all considered mammal species. Our findings suggest that a landscape approach needs to guide effective conservation across the entire protection gradient of the Katavi-Rukwa Ecosystem.

AB  - Reintroduction is a highly effective strategy for rebuilding wildlife populations and restoring their ecosystem functions, but impacts on function are poorly documented. We addressed this gap by comparing the species richness and visit rate of mammals and birds that interact with rhino ( Rhinoceros unicornis ) latrines at two locations in Nepal: Chitwan National Park, with a stable rhino population, and Shuklaphanta National Park, where a rhino reintroduction program was conducted from 2003 to 2018. Camera-traps were used to monitor visitors to 30 latrines in both parks from 2020 to 2021 (669 camera-trap days). The reintroduction of rhinos to Shuklaphanta National Park has played a crucial role in restoring an important resource for other mammal and bird species. Despite a large difference in rhino abundance, and differences in the size, quality and some of the nutritional contents of latrines between sites, there were no significant differences in species richness of latrine visitors and in the frequency of most behaviours at the latrines. Visit rates of animals were higher at the reintroduction site, confirming latrines to be important, limited resources. Overall, 4 mammal and 4 bird species used the latrines to consume the dung, or insects and plants growing on and around the dung; a further two mammal species interacted only indirectly with the latrines. These findings provide evidence that even at low population densities, rhino reintroduction can successfully restore an important ecological function and provide vital resources for other species. Our study supports the rewilding of large-bodied animals to mitigate ecosystem deterioration.

AB  - Mediterranean landscapes are shaped by natural disturbances such as herbivory and fire that regulate vegetation structure and fuel loads. As a result of the cessation of traditional agricultural practices, land abandonment is a widespread phenomenon in these landscapes, leading to shrub encroachment and heightened fire hazard. This study reports the effects of grazing by domestic herbivores on vegetation structure in transitional woodland-shrubland systems across three case study areas in Portugal. The effects of low and moderate grazing intensity by cattle and horses on vegetation structure were assessed on three vegetation strata-canopy, shrubs, and grasses-using indicators to evaluate the influence of grazing on both horizontal and vertical vegetation structure. Moderate grazing shaped vertical vegetation structure by reducing shrub and grass height and by browsing and thinning the lower branches, creating a discontinuity between understorey and canopy layers. These effects on vertical fuel continuity are anticipated to limit the upward spread of flames and reduce the potential for crown fires. In contrast, low-intensity grazing showed limited effects on both vertical and horizontal vegetation structure. This work highlights the potential of using domestic herbivores as a tool to manage vegetation structure and its contribution to mitigating local wildfire hazards.

AB  - T & uuml;rkiye, due to its position as a bridge between Asia and Europe, encompassing three distinct biogeographic regions and its diverse climatic conditions and geographical features, exhibits the characteristics of a small continent in terms of biodiversity, hosting a very high number of mammalian species. However, information on these mammals' activity patterns and co-occurrence, specifically in T & uuml;rkiye, is limited. Our study aimed to reveal the daily activity patterns and temporal overlaps of mammalian species detected using camera traps in S & uuml;l & uuml;kl & uuml; Lake Nature Park. The white-breasted hedgehog was strictly nocturnal, while the European badger, gray wolf, European hare, wild boar, and beech marten tended to be nocturnal. The Caucasian squirrel was strictly diurnal, and the roe deer tended to be diurnal. The highest temporal overlap was found between the white-breasted hedgehog and the beech marten (triangle 4 = 0.84, 95% CI), followed by the red fox and roe deer (triangle 1 = 0.77, 95% CI). The lowest temporal overlap (triangle 1 = 0.081, 95% CI) was found between the white-breasted hedgehog and the Caucasian squirrel. The second lowest overlap (triangle 1 = 0.136, 95% CI) occurred between the Caucasian squirrel and the European badger. Our findings have provided new and detailed insights into the diversity of mammalian species within the nature park located in Northwestern Anatolia. These data will support and facilitate future research aimed at understanding the mechanisms of species coexistence in this ecosystem. The results obtained will enable a deeper examination of ecosystem dynamics and contribute to developing strategies for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - AimsShrub encroachment is a major challenge for livestock and wildlife management in semi-arid savannas. Shrub removal by land managers is widespread, but the long-term effects on vegetation structure and composition, which determine carrying capacity for herbivores, are poorly documented. This study aims to examine the effects of selective shrub removal to guide vegetation management in key land uses of semi-arid African savannas.QuestionsVegetation responses were assessed across land uses and treatments to answer the following questions: (1) does shrub removal increase the frequency of palatable plants and therefore herbivore-carrying capacity; (2) does selective shrub removal decrease woody vegetation structure 15 years after application; and (3) how do these effects differ between cattle and wildlife ranching?LocationMolopo region of the North West Province, South Africa.MethodsHerbaceous and woody vegetations were sampled within six transects each of three wildlife ranches and three cattle ranches in areas that had either been selectively shrub-controlled with herbicides 10-15 years previously or left untreated. To quantify effects of woody shrub control on herbaceous functional-group abundances and assemblages, tree equivalents, regrowth rate, and shrub abundance, we compared these variables across two treatments (treated and untreated) and land uses. Data were analysed using GLMMs, NMDS ordinations, PERMANOVA, and SIMPER.ResultsSelective shrub control effectively improved palatable herbaceous vegetation, especially on cattle ranches. Especially abundance of perennial grass was higher on wildlife ranches compared to cattle ranches. Tree equivalent was higher in untreated compared to treated plots, and these differences were more pronounced on wildlife ranches than on cattle ranches.ConclusionssSelective shrub removal improved the palatable herbaceous layer for both wildlife and cattle ranching and can be considered an effective management strategy in semi-arid rangelands.
   After 15 years of application, selective shrub control significantly enhanced palatable herbaceous vegetation, especially on cattle ranches. Wildlife ranches exhibited notably higher abundance of perennial grass, emphasising the lasting effectiveness of shrub control for rangeland improvement across different land-use types.image

AB  - The principal channel of carbon export from ecosystems to the atmosphere, and an important connection in carbon exchange between land and atmosphere, is ecosystem respiration (ER). It has a significant impact on the global carbon cycle and the rate of CO2 increase in the atmosphere. The effects of different vegetation types [Medicago sativa grassland (MS); Xanthoceras sorbifolium forestland (XS); Caragana korshinskii bushland (CK); Hippophae rhamnoides shrubland (HR); and Stipa bungeana grassland (SB)] on ecosystem respiration fluxes in Loess Hilly Region (LHR) were studied via the static chamber technique. The results showed that different vegetation types had significant effects on ER fluxes, and the decreasing order of the cumulative fluxes was HR > MS > SB > CK > XS. Throughout the study period, the largest value of ER occurred in the summer and the lowest value occurred in the winter. Temperature (air temperature, soil temperature) and soil moisture were both significantly and positively linked with ER. For the temporal change of ER, the joint effect of soil temperature and moisture was a key regulating factor. The temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration varies greatly between vegetation types and seasons. In the process of LHR vegetation restoration, the ER, carbon sequestration capacity and ecological benefits of different plant types should be considered in order to select the vegetation type that is most conducive to reducing the greenhouse effect.

AB  - Isolated, seasonal wetlands within agricultural landscapes are important ecosystems. However, they are currently experiencing direct and indirect effects of agricultural management surrounding them. Because wetlands provide important ecosystem services, it is crucial to determine how these factors affect ecological communities. Here, we studied the long-term effects of land-use intensification, cattle grazing, prescribed fires, and their interactions on wetland plant diversity, community dynamics, and functional diversity. To do this, we used vegetation and trait data from a 14-year-old experiment on 40 seasonal wetlands located within seminatural and intensively managed pastures in Florida. These wetlands were allocated different grazing and prescribed fire treatments (grazed vs. ungrazed, burned vs. unburned). Our results showed that wetlands within intensively managed pastures have lower native plant diversity, floristic quality, evenness, and higher nonnative species diversity and exhibited the most resource-acquisitive traits. Wetlands embedded in intensively managed pastures were also characterized by lower species turnover over time. We found that 14 years of cattle exclusion reduced species diversity in both pasture management intensities and had no effect on floristic quality. Fenced wetlands exhibited lower functional diversity and experienced a higher rate of community change, both due to an increase in tall, clonal, and palatable grasses. The effects of prescribed fires were often dependent on grazing treatment. For instance, prescribed fires increased functional diversity in fenced wetlands but not in grazed wetlands. Our study suggests that cattle exclusion and prescribed fires are not enough to restore wetlands in intensively managed pastures and further highlights the importance of not converting seminatural pastures to intensively managed pastures. Our study also suggests that grazing levels applied in seminatural pastures maintained high plant diversity and prevented tree and shrub encroachment and that in the absence of grazing, prescribed fire became crucial to maintaining higher species evenness.

AB  - Quantitatively estimating the grazing intensity (GI) effects on vegetation in semiarid hilly grassland of the Loess Plateau can help to develop safe utilization levels for natural grasslands, which is a necessity of maintaining livestock production and sustainable development of grasslands. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), field vegetation data, and 181 days (one goat per day) of GPS tracking were combined to quantify the spatial pattern of GI, and its effects on the vegetation community structure. The spatial distribution of GI was uneven, with a mean value of 0.50 goats/ha, and 95% of the study area had less than 1.30 goats/ha. The areas with utilization rates of rangeland (July) lower than 45% and 20% made up about 95% and 60% of the study area, respectively. Grazing significantly reduced monthly aboveground biomass, but the grazing effects on plant growth rate were complex across the different plant growth stages. Grazing impaired plant growth in general, but the intermediate GI appeared to facilitate plant growth rate at the end of the growing seasons. Grazing had minimal relationship with vegetation community structure characteristics, though Importance Value of forbs increased with increasing GI. Flexibility in the number of goats and conservatively defining utilization rate, according to the inter-annual variation of utilization biomass, would be beneficial to achieve ecologically healthy and economically sustainable GI.

AB  - Migration is a critical behavioral strategy necessary for population persistence and ecosystem functioning, but migration routes have been increasingly disrupted by anthropogenic activities, including energy development. Wind energy is the world's fastest growing source of electricity and represents an important alternative to hydrocarbon extraction, but its effects on migratory species beyond birds and bats are not well understood. We evaluated the effects of wind-energy development on pronghorn migration, including behavior and habitat selection, to assess potential effects on connectivity and other functional benefits including stopovers. We monitored GPS-collared female pronghorn from 2010 to 2012 and 2018 to 2020 in south-central Wyoming, USA, an area with multiple wind-energy facilities in various stages of development and operation. Across all time periods, we collected 286 migration sequences from 117 individuals, including 121 spring migrations, 123 fall migrations, and 42 facultative winter migrations. While individuals continued to migrate through wind-energy facilities, pronghorn made important behavioral adjustments relative to turbines during migration. These included avoiding turbines when selecting stopover sites in spring and winter, selecting areas farther from turbines at a small scale in spring and winter, moving more quickly near turbines in spring (although pronghorn moved more slowly near turbines in the fall), and reducing fidelity to migration routes relative to wind turbines under construction in both spring and fall. For example, an increase in distance to turbine from 0 to 1 km translated to a 33% and 300% increase in the relative probability of selection for stopover sites in spring and winter, respectively. The behavioral adjustments pronghorn made relative to wind turbines could reduce the functional benefits of their migration, such as foraging success or the availability of specific routes, over the long term.

AB  - Background Climate is an important driver of ungulate life-histories, population dynamics, and migratory behaviors. Climate conditions can directly impact ungulates via changes in the costs of thermoregulation and locomotion, or indirectly, via changes in habitat and forage availability, predation, and species interactions. Many studies have documented the effects of climate variability and climate change on North America's ungulates, recording impacts to population demographics, physiology, foraging behavior, migratory patterns, and more. However, ungulate responses are not uniform and vary by species and geography. Here, we present a systematic map describing the abundance and distribution of evidence on the effects of climate variability and climate change on native ungulates in North America.Methods We searched for all evidence documenting or projecting how climate variability and climate change affect the 15 ungulate species native to the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Greenland. We searched Web of Science, Scopus, and the websites of 62 wildlife management agencies to identify relevant academic and grey literature. We screened English-language documents for inclusion at both the title and abstract and full-text levels. Data from all articles that passed full-text review were extracted and coded in a database. We identified knowledge clusters and gaps related to the species, locations, climate variables, and outcome variables measured in the literature.Review findings We identified a total of 674 relevant articles published from 1947 until September 2020. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus), elk (Cervus canadensis), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were the most frequently studied species. Geographically, more research has been conducted in the western U.S. and western Canada, though a notable concentration of research is also located in the Great Lakes region. Nearly 75% more articles examined the effects of precipitation on ungulates compared to temperature, with variables related to snow being the most commonly measured climate variables. Most studies examined the effects of climate on ungulate population demographics, habitat and forage, and physiology and condition, with far fewer examining the effects on disturbances, migratory behavior, and seasonal range and corridor habitat.Conclusions The effects of climate change, and its interactions with stressors such as land-use change, predation, and disease, is of increasing concern to wildlife managers. With its broad scope, this systematic map can help ungulate managers identify relevant climate impacts and prepare for future changes to the populations they manage. Decisions regarding population control measures, supplemental feeding, translocation, and the application of habitat treatments are just some of the management decisions that can be informed by an improved understanding of climate impacts. This systematic map also identified several gaps in the literature that would benefit from additional research, including climate effects on ungulate migratory patterns, on species that are relatively understudied yet known to be sensitive to changes in climate, such as pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), and on ungulates in the eastern U.S. and Mexico.

AB  - The hypothesis that certain woody species may be prone to local extirpation under chronic elephant utilisation was examined for Colophospermum mopane open woodland, for an area within the foraging range of elephants from permanent water. Elephant density increased from nearly absent in the 1970s to >3 elephants km(-2,) with 0.62 adult bulls km(-2), by 2022. Study components of vegetation impact included a long-term elephant exclosure, a fence-line contrast with an adjacent communal area, comparison with an adjacent wildlife reserve carrying a fifth of the elephant density and the use of historical studies of the vegetation. A history of elephant utilisation resulted in woodland becoming hedged through pollarding of tree stems by elephants. Impacted woodland was characterised by a slightly lower tree density, reduced average height of trees, altered shrub composition and lower species richness. The dominant C. mopane and sub-dominant species had persisted. However, about 14 species were potentially trending towards local extirpation on account of very high levels of adult mortality, but had persisted because of a low level of seedling recruitment. Fleshy fruits were a shared attribute among most extirpation-trending species, which, together with a reduction in woody species richness that affects browsers, has ramifications for trophic flows.

AB  - Tiger (Panthera tigris) survival, as apex predators in forest ecosystems, largely depends on abundant prey in healthy, intact forests. Because large herbivore prey are drivers of plant biomass, we reasoned that tiger distribution and density are probably also closely linked with forest carbon (C) stock, the management of which is critical for mitigating climate change. However, whether tigers exert top-down control of forest C stocks or are passive surrogate C indicators bottom-up is a salient unanswered question in conservation and management, particularly in trophic rewilding. Here, we compiled estimates of global tiger presence and density to test the top-down effects of tigers on forest C stocks and tiger-carbon relationships along a gradient from "empty forests" without tigers to "target state" ecosystems with tigers living at different abundances. Our results showed that tiger presence was associated with higher forest vegetation C stocks, lower C emissions, and higher C inputs globally. Top-down effects via ungulate biomass were stronger in less established forests. Furthermore, forest vegetation or soil C stocks increased with tiger density or reached tiger-carbon peaks in four forest habitat types covering most of the tiger range. Our findings reveal that tigers, represented by their presence and density, are both an indicator and a driver of forest ecosystem C stocks, depending on underlying ecological conditions, and could safeguard forests against future C emissions and improve our understanding of climate-C cycle feedback.

KW  - MOVEMENTS
AB  - (Antilocapra americana) were translocated into the Flint Hills region of Chase County, Kansas, during the late 1970s through the early 1990s as a part of a statewide reintroduction into portions of historical pronghorn range. Since the last translocation in 1992, the Chase County pronghorn population has stabilized at approximately 30 individuals. Several research projects conducted in the 1990s provided important information on the Flint Hills population and local habitat conditions during initial translocations. However, land ownership and land management have changed over time, which may impact pronghorn habitat suitability. Habitat conditions were inventoried in 2021 to determine the current status of pronghorn habitat and potential limiting factors including bottom-wire fence heights, fence density, pasture size, vegetation composition, vegetation height, and coyote occupancy. Maximum bottom-wire height of fences composed of 100% barbed wire was estimated at an average of 41 cm with a minimum average of 30.7 cm, which is below the recommended minimum bottom-wire height of 46 cm. Additionally, only 27.3% of the fences sampled reached a maximum bottom-wire height >= 46 cm, while 100% of minimum bottom-wire heights fell below 46 cm, which suggests a low percentage of fences with adequate bottom-wire height for pronghorn passage. Fence density and pasture size was estimated at 1.8 km/km(2 ) and 2.6 km(2 )respectively. Vegetation height averaged 8.6, 10.0, and 11.1 cm for June, July, and August 2021, which falls below fawn habitat height recommendations (>25 cm) found in the literature. Coyote na & iuml;ve occupancy was determined to be 100% among 9 camera trap sites. We recommend that local landowners (1) raise the minimum average bottom-wire height to 46 cm to improve pronghorn passage and movement across the landscape and (2) maintain an average vegetation height >25 cm during June, July, and August to increase potential fawning habitat.

AB  - Populations of barren-ground caribou have declined steeply due to the combined effects of climate change, natural fluctuations, human harvest, and industrial activities. For the Indigenous peoples that rely on caribou for subsistence and cultural continuity, this decline presents a grave threat to a way of life. Wildlife managers are concerned about the potential effects of winter roads on the use of space by caribou. Roads, especially those with high levels of traffic, can act as semi-permeable barriers to movement by ungulates. In the central Northwest Territories, Canada, the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road services diamond mines located on the winter range of several populations of barren-ground caribou. Impeded movement could restrict the distribution or influence the habitats used by caribou during winter. We investigated the effect of traffic volume and other disturbance and environmental variables on the road-crossing decisions of caribou. We used GPS collars to monitor the location of caribou from 2018 to 2020 and contrasted observed and available road-crossing events. Of 62 collared caribou that were adjacent to the winter road (i.e., 5.2 km), only 33 crossed the road, for a total of 100 crossing events. Caribou rarely crossed the road when any level of traffic was present; the level of traffic, not the road right-of-way, was the underlying explanatory factor for that behavioural decision. Our results suggest that mitigation and associated monitoring should focus on strategies that minimize traffic volume or provide breaks in traffic when caribou are adjacent to winter roads.

AB  - Nematodes are among the most important faunal groups in soil food webs and serve as important bioindicators in evaluating subsurface ecological processes and ecosystem functioning. Although previous studies have reported the effects of vegetation types on soil nematode communities, the community patterns of soil nematodes at different soil depths during secondary forest succession remain unclear. Through a field survey, we investigated how soil nematode community characteristics changed at two soil depths (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) across subalpine forest successional stages consisting of grasslands, shrublands and forests in Southwest China. We measured soil properties and microbial biomass to analyze significant environmental factors influencing variations in soil nematode communities. With forest succession, we observed increases in the total nematode abundance and maturity index and a decreased plant parasitic index, indicating more stable food webs and lower root herbivory hazards in forests than in grasslands and shrublands. Fungivore diversity was significantly increased and herbivore diversity was significantly decreased during forest succession, despite no significant difference existing in the total nematode diversity among the three successional stages. The abundances of the dominant nematode genera Helicotylenchus and Tylencholaimus were significantly correlated with forest succession. In addition, the variations in soil nematode communities differed between the two soil depths, presumably due to various soil variables. NO-3-N and pH were the dominant determinants of the variations in soil nematode communities at 0-10 cm soil depth, while SOC was the dominant determinant at 10-20 cm soil depth. Overall, our results suggested that forest succession exhibited layer-specific effects on soil nematode communities via different soil variables, and that specific nematode genera could serve as useful bioindicators during forest succession.

AB  - Land managers in western North America often reverse succession by removing pinyon (Pinus spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) trees to reduce fire risk and increase forage for wildlife and livestock. Because prescribed fire carries inherent risks, mechanical methods such as chaining, roller-chopping, and mastication are often used. Mechanical methods differ in cost and the size of woody debris produced, and may differentially impact plant and animal responses. We implemented a randomized, complete-block, split-plot experiment in December 2011 in the Piceance Basin, northwestern Colorado, USA, to compare mechanical methods and to explore seeding (subplot) interactions. We assessed vegetation 1-, 2-, 5-, and 6-years post-treatment, and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) response via GPS locations 3-8 years post-treatment. By 2016, treated plots had 3-5 times higher perennial grass cover and similar to 10 times higher cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) cover than untreated control plots. Roller-chopped plots had both the highest non-native annual forb cover, and when seeded, the highest density of bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata), a nutritious shrub used by mule deer. Masticated plots had higher bitterbrush use during summer and fall, leaving less forage available for winter. Days of winter mule deer use from GPS point locations in chained and roller-chopped plots was similar to 70% higher than in control plots, while winter use in masticated plots was similar to control plots. Mule deer use appears related to a combination of hiding cover, resulting from residual woody debris, and winter forage availability. Roller-chopped plots provide the best combination of hiding cover and winter forage, but mastication or chaining, applied leaving dispersed security cover, may be better options at large scales or when invasive species concerns exist.

AB  - The Arctic is undergoing strong environmental changes, affecting species and whole biological communities. To assess the impact on these communities, including their composition and functions, we need more information on their current distribution and biology. In the High-Arctic tundra, dung from animals, such as muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), is a relatively understudied microhabitat that may be attractive for organisms like dung-feeding insects as well as gastrointestinal parasites. Using a DNA barcoding approach, we examined muskox droppings from two Greenlandic regions for dung-dwelling invertebrates. In 15% of all samples, we found the DNA of insect species in the orders Diptera and Lepidoptera. The saprophagous Diptera colonized dung differently in west versus north-east Greenland and summer versus winter. In addition, we found muskox dung harbouring endoparasitic nematodes in samples from both regions. However, we could not find traces of saprophagous arthropods, such as collembolans and mites, from the soil sphere. Our pilot study sheds a first light on the invertebrates living in this neglected Arctic microhabitat.

AB  - Argali, also known as wild sheep (Ovis ammon), is a prominent alpine mammal found in Central Asia. It is of conservation concern globally and domestically in China. Our study aims to unveil the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among argali populations in China using the mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) and control region (CR) sequences. We noninvasively collected a total of 77 fecal or tissue samples from various locations within Xinjiang, covering most of its range. Consequently, we identified 22 distinct haplotypic sequences for Cytb (1140 bp) and 36 for CR (1107-1260 bp). In our phylogenetic analyses, all sequences from China and abroad were grouped into 10 different clades, labeled as clade A through clade J. The network clustering pattern was consistent with the phylogenetic topology. The genetic distance and genetic divergence between clades ranged from 1.21% to 9.25% and from 0.30 to 0.94, respectively. Our analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) analysis also revealed that more than 70% of the variation was accounted for among the clades. The genetic differentiation between populations was positively corelated with geography distances (r = 0.472, p < 0.01). We observed significant differences in genetic diversity among the various populations. The mismatch distribution analysis showed a multimodal distribution for all clades. Fu's Fs and Tajima's D values were not statistically significant. In conclusion, we genetically identified 10 matrilineal populations, which may represent subspecies of argali population, eight of which were in China. The demographic history analyses suggest that the population size of all argali evolutionary populations remained relatively stable. Nonetheless, some populations need special attention due to their low level of genetic diversity.

AB  - Swayne's hartebeest Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei was once widely distributed in the Horn of Africa. By the early 20th century, however, it was extirpated across most of its range and is now limited to two relict populations in the Ethiopian Rift Valley and categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. In this study, we estimated the size and genetic diversity of these two remaining populations, with a particular focus on competition with livestock. We used a total block count method for both Swayne's hartebeest and livestock population counts, and faecal samples for a population genetic analysis. We estimated the total population of Swayne's hartebeest to be 1,528, with 518 individuals in Senkele Swayne's Hartebeest Sanctuary and 1,010 individuals in Maze National Park. Livestock densities were 212 and 153 times those of Swayne's hartebeest in Senkele Swayne's Hartebeest Sanctuary and Maze National Park, respectively. Among 73 mitochondrial D-loop sequences (34 from Senkele Swayne's Hartebeest Sanctuary and 39 from Maze National Park), we found 22 haplotypes (Senkele 12, Maze 16, shared 6). Population genetic parameters suggest only weak sub-structuring between the two populations (F-ST = 0.164). Despite the positive population trends in both protected areas, the spatial overlap with livestock may lead to future population decline as a result of resource competition and disease transmission. We therefore recommend further translocation to other protected areas within the species' former range.

AB  - Extreme climatic events can reshape the functional structure of ecological communities, potentially altering ecological interactions and ecosystem functioning. While these shifts have been widely documented, evidence of their persistence and potential flow-on effects on ecosystem structure following relaxation of extreme events remains limited. Here, we investigate changes in the functional trait structure - encompassing dimensions of resource use, thermal affinity, and body size - of herbivorous fishes in a temperate reef system that experienced an extreme marine heatwave (MHW) and subsequent return to cool conditions. We quantify how changes in the trait structure modified the nature and intensity of herbivory-related functions (macroalgae, turf, and sediment removal), and explored the potential flow-on effects on the recovery dynamics of macroalgal foundation species. The trait structure of the herbivorous fish assemblage shifted as a result of the MHW, from dominance of cool-water browsing species to increased evenness in the distribution of abundance among temperate and tropical guilds supporting novel herbivory roles (i.e. scraping, cropping, and sediment sucking). Despite the abundance of tropical herbivorous fishes and intensity of herbivory-related functions declined following a period of cooling after the MHW, the underlying trait structure displayed limited recovery. Concomitantly, algal assemblages displayed a lack of recovery of the formerly dominant foundational species, the kelp Ecklonia radiata, transitioning to an alternative state dominated by turf and Sargassum spp. Our study demonstrates a legacy effect of an extreme MHW and exemplified the value of monitoring phenotypic (trait mediated) changes in the nature of core ecosystem processes to predict and adapt to the future configurations of changing reef ecosystems.

AB  - Herbivores can exert a controlling effect on the reproduction and growth of shrubs, thereby counter-acting the climate-driven encroachment of shrubs in the Arctic and the potential consequences. This control is particularly evident in the case of abundant herbivores, such as reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), whose grazing patterns are affected by management. Here, we tested how different reindeer grazing practices on the border between Finland and Norway impact the occurrence of willow (Salix spp.) dominated patches, their above-ground biomass (AGB) and the ability of willows to form dense thickets. We used a combination of multispectral and RGB imagery obtained from unoccupied aerial vehicles field data and an ensemble of machine-learning models, which allowed us to model the occurrence of plant community types (Overall accuracy = 0.80), AGB fractions (maximum R-2 = 0.90) and topsoil moisture (maximum R-2 = 0.89). With this combination of approaches, we show that willows are kept in a browsing-trap under spring and early summer grazing by reindeer, growing mostly small and scattered in the landscape. In contrast, willows under the winter grazing regime formed dense stands, particularly within riparian areas. We confirm this pattern using a random forest willow habitat distribution model based on topographical parameters. The model shows that willow biomass correlated with parameters of optimal habitat quality only in the winter grazing regime and did not respond to the same parameters under spring and summer grazing of reindeer.

AB  - Post-collapse of seasonal blooms of gelatinous zooplankton (Cnidaria, Ctenophora, and Thaliacea) sinking carcasses transports labile carbon (jelly-C) to benthic continental margins and the deep sea. In recent decades, bloom frequency and intensity have increased globally; however, how sinking jelly-C affects benthic communities is poorly known. Further, as climate change and other anthropogenic impacts may increase gelatinous blooms in the future, understanding the contributions and impacts of jelly-C upon benthic communities is of pivotal importance. Thus, in this study, we assessed jelly-C deposits post-intense blooming of a pelagic species of marine colonial gelatinous tunicate in the Thaliacean class, Pyrosoma atlanticum. We studied the seabed using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) from 26 to 1,276 m, documenting jelly-C deposits and species of the megafaunal benthic community. Environmental variables from water column profiles at transects near our own off the Ivory Coast of West Africa were used in assessments. Jelly-C biomass peaked at 400 m (1,500 grC 100 m(-2)) and remained at the average (300 grC 100 m(-2)) through 1,276 m. Typically, in depth strata between 300 and 800 m, peaks in jelly-C biomass (500 to 1,500 grC 100 m(-2)) corresponded to areas with significantly reduced benthic megafaunal species abundances as well as diversity. From 800 to 1,276 m, we noted patchier jelly-C biomass deposits where individual megafauna species abundances and diversity correspondingly increased, yet total organism counts remained low. We observed 11 species from 5 phyla directly feeding on jelly-C and 10 single-species aggregations triggering megafaunal dominance events at various localized depth strata. Although such dynamics have been hypothesized and examined for some time with respect to phytodetritus biomass, they have been rarely described for jelly-C. Thus, our novel findings for jelly-C dynamics in the offshore regions can help to provide a better understanding of the ecological role that this component plays in marine benthic ecosystems and continental margins.

AB  - Background The data we present are part of the AGRO-ECOSERVICES project (Assessing ecosystem services and disservices provided by arthropod species in Azorean agroecosystems). The project aims to evaluate the relative importance of native and non-native organisms as ecosystem services (ES) and disservices (ED) providers, by combining novel, direct and quantitative tools for monitoring agro-biodiversity. Ecosystem services include evaluation of natural pest control by predation, seed predation on weed plants, pollination, decomposition and ecosystem disservices, herbivory and seed predation on crop plants. Active Aerial Searching (AAS) (only in maize-fields) and pitfall traps were used to sample the arthropod biodiversity (predatory spiders, true-bugs and beetles and main insect pests) on four agricultural habitats of Terceira Island, namely citrus orchards, low and high elevation maize fields and vineyards. New information We provided an inventory of all arthropods recorded in four Azorean agroecosystems (citrus orchards, low and high elevation maize fields and vineyards) from Terceira Island. A total of 50412 specimens were collected, belonging to four classes, 20 orders, 81 families and 200 identified species of arthropods. A total of 127 species are considered introduced (n = 22646) and 69 native non-endemic (n = 24117). Four endemic species were recorded with very few specimens (n = 14) and 3635 specimens belong to unidentified taxa recorded only at genus or family level. Five species are new records for Terceira Island, with Lagria hirta (Linnaeus, 1758) (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae) being also a new record for the Azores. This publication contributes to a better knowledge of the arthropods communities present in agro-ecosystems of Terceira Island and will serve as a baseline for future monitoring schemes targeting the long-term change in arthropod diversity and abundance.

AB  - The sedimentary sequence of La Narce du Be ' age Basin is one of the few natural archives covering the last 18 ka cal. BP in the French Massif Central. This paper focuses on the palaeoecological reconstruction of environmental and climatic changes affecting this shallow periglacial lake from the Late-Glacial to the Early Holocene. After field surveys and geophysical mapping, two cores (cores A and D) were extracted and dated. Plant macrofossils, pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) and diatom assemblages were compared within the cores to study vegetation, temperature, pH, water level and ice cover changes through time. During the Oldest Dryas (18-14.75 ka cal. BP), climatic conditions were the coldest with a short ice-free season allowing the development of periphytic diatoms only (ecologically comparable to Arctic ones). A cold and dry steppe landscape - exposed to severe erosion - comprised an herbaceous and shrub flora (e.g. Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Helianthemum, Ephedra, Hippophae center dot, Juniperus). Animal presence is suggested by coprophilous fungi. Periphytic diatoms and allochtonous pollen (Cedrus) underline windy conditions, and the possible erosion of neo-formed soils. Then, during the Bolling-Allerod interstadial (14.75-12.7 ka cal. BP), the ice-free season increased and some trees/ shrubs (Salix, Betula and Juniperus) established locally within open grasslands. During the Younger Dryas (12.7-11.7 ka cal. BP) cooler conditions favoured steppe taxa again (Helianthemum, Achillea, Artemisia, Car-yophyllaceae, Ranunculaceae) and erosion increased. The ice cover on the lake prevailed even if the conditions were not as cold as during the Oldest Dryas. During the Preboreal (11.7-10 ka cal. BP) Isoe center dot tes echinospora and I. lacustris developed in the eulittoral zone of the lake, which was surrounded by a swamp forest (with Betula nana and B. pubescens). Pinus sylvestris, Betula pendula, Corylus avellana and trees from the Quercetum mixtum rapidly established in the uplands. Occurrences of Gaeumannomyces and Xylomyces fungi - both phytopathogens on broadleaved trees - and decreasing herb values indirectly hint at a close forest canopy. At the beginning of the Boreal (10 ka cal. BP), aquatic and semi-aquatic taxa developed on open water due to longer ice-free seasons (diatoms, micro-algae, Alisma plantago-aquatica, Potamogeton, Typha). The final terrestrialization towards a mire occurred as a consequence of the Holocene warming and related to water chemistry changes (acidification, eutrophication).

AB  - Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing nets (i.e., ghost nets) strongly affect biodiversity in marine ecosystems of numerous localities around the world. Based on videos posted by different people in YouTube (TM), we accessed the negative effects of these gears in the Mediterranean Sea. We identified 86 species, from 12 groups, in 12 countries within the Mediterranean region (including in the Africa, Europe, and Asia). Of the species entangled in ghost nets, 10 are considered threatened with extinction according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Fishes and macrocrustaceans were the most recorded groups entangled in ghost nets. We also identified algae, other invertebrates (i.e., cnidarians, echinoderms, molluscs, poriferans, tunicates) and vertebrates (i.e., turtles and mammals). The larger number of ghost fishing events were recorded in Italy and Turkey. This is the most complete study showing the negative effects of ghost nets on marine biodiversity worldwide, based on data retrieved from digital media. With the available literature, our data are important to implement measures against ghost fishing nets in the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Identifying drivers of the spatial distribution of organisms is a key aim of ecology. Salt marsh ecosystems can exhibit extreme gradients in abiotic conditions, including orders of magnitude differences in physical conditions across the marsh platform, which may contribute to the spatial distributions of organisms found in marshes. Small-bodied consumers, such as crabs, have been identified as key residents of salt marshes, with strong impacts on salt marsh persistence and stability at local scales. However, due to a lack of consensus regarding crab impacts across larger biogeographic scales, continued investigation into the factors driving crab community spatiotemporal dynamics is needed. We used an observational approach to investigate the small-scale spatial patterns and environmental correlates of marsh crab abundance, burrowing activity, and community composition in a representative southeastern US salt marsh. We documented contrasting trends in crab abundance and burrowing activity across the marsh platform elevation gradient, with abundance increasing and burrow density decreasing from the creek bank to forest edge. Crab diversity generally increased with distance from tidal creeks, though the effect of marsh zone on crab diversity was site-specific. Finally, we demonstrated elevation as the key environmental predictor of marsh crab abundance, burrowing activity, and community diversity and identified specific elevations that serve as breakpoints in those metrics. Our results contribute to reconciling differences between small-scale manipulative experiments and large-scale biogeographic sampling of these ecosystem engineering salt marsh residents.

AB  - Most studies about benthic community use small-scale sampling methods focused on the infauna such as grabs or box-corers. The benthic data collected by scientific trawl surveys in all European waters, in the frame of the Common Fishery Policy Data Collection Multiannual Program, can be used to study the impact of large-scale fisheries such as trawling. However, the catchability of trawls is very dependent on the nature of the seabed as well as resulting ground-gear adaptations. Due to its non-destructive nature and its ability to focus on benthic macro-epifauna, towed video sampling appears to be a good alternative to monitor the impact of trawling on benthic communities. In the present work, we studied the influence of fishery induced seabed abrasion and video characteristics on nine indices, which can be used to monitor the effect of trawling on benthic communities, was studied. Among them, three indices specific to fishery effect detection based on biological traits appeared to be the best performing benthic indices with video data: modified-Trawling Disturbance Index, partial-Trawling Disturbance Index, and modified sensitivity index. The effectiveness of these indices to monitor the effect of trawling was evaluated and compared between trawl and video sampling. This work has highlighted that video sampling could be a good alternative, or at least a complementary method, to scientific trawling to monitor the effect of trawling on benthic communities in European waters.

AB  - Plants are involved in different interactions with animals that may have contrasting effects on their reproductive output. However, as multitrophic interactions are resource-mediated and density-dependent, the frequency at which these interactions occur is modulated by the demographical characteristics of the populations of interacting species. For example, while plant aggregation may increase pollinator attraction and consequently, pollination success, an increased seed set may also attract more seed predators. Therefore, the intensity of pollination and seed predation events may affect plant population dynamics. Although multitrophic plant-animal interactions are crucial for maintaining biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems, they have seldom been studied together, especially in restored habitats. To fill this gap, we used five restoration sites that used Inga vera trees at different densities to evaluate how density-dependent effects impact fruit set, seed predation, seed germination rate and the number of viable germinated seeds (i.e., the net effect of pollination and seed predation). Using structural equation models to assess the isolated effects of each predictor variable in each response variable and the cascading effects of each response variable on another, we found that density-dependent effects influenced I. vera reproduction. While I. vera trees in high density presented higher fruit set and seed predation rates, trees in low-density plantations presented lower fruit set, but seed predators consumed fewer seeds. The contrasting results of final seed germination rates revealed that density-dependent effects are pivotal to plant establishment and population dynamics. We argue that the study of density-dependent multitrophic plant-animal interactions is essential to guarantee that the efforts done in restoration initiatives can turn into successful results in terms of restoring ecosystem structure and stability.

AB  - Recent advances in ecology and biogeography demonstrate the importance of fire and large herbivores - and challenge the primacy of climate - to our understanding of the distribution, stability, and antiquity of forests and grasslands. Among grassland ecologists, particularly those working in savannas of the seasonally dry tropics, an emerging fire-herbivore paradigm is generally accepted to explain grass dominance in climates and on soils that would otherwise permit development of closed-canopy forests. By contrast, adherents of the climate-soil paradigm, particularly foresters working in the humid tropics or temperate latitudes, tend to view fire and herbivores as disturbances, often human-caused, which damage forests and reset succession. Towards integration of these two paradigms, we developed a series of conceptual models to explain the existence of an extensive temperate forest-grassland mosaic that occurs within a 4.7 million km(2) belt spanning from central Europe through eastern Asia. The Eurasian forest-steppe is reminiscent of many regions globally where forests and grasslands occur side-by-side with stark boundaries. Our conceptual models illustrate that if mean climate was the only factor, forests should dominate in humid continental regions and grasslands should prevail in semi-arid regions, but that extensive mosaics would not occur. By contrast, conceptual models that also integrate climate variability, soils, topography, herbivores, and fire depict how these factors collectively expand suitable conditions for forests and grasslands, such that grasslands may occur in more humid regions and forests in more arid regions than predicted by mean climate alone. Furthermore, boundaries between forests and grasslands are reinforced by vegetation-fire, vegetation-herbivore, and vegetation-microclimate feedbacks, which limit tree establishment in grasslands and promote tree survival in forests. Such feedbacks suggest that forests and grasslands of the Eurasian forest-steppe are governed by ecological dynamics that are similar to those hypothesised to maintain boundaries between tropical forests and savannas. Unfortunately, the grasslands of the Eurasian forest-steppe are sometimes misinterpreted as deforested or otherwise degraded vegetation. In fact, the grasslands of this region provide valuable ecosystem services, support a high diversity of plants and animals, and offer critical habitat for endangered large herbivores. We suggest that a better understanding of the fundamental ecological controls that permit forest-grassland coexistence could help us prioritise conservation and restoration of the Eurasian forest-steppe for biodiversity, climate adaptation, and pastoral livelihoods. Currently, these goals are being undermined by tree-planting campaigns that view the open grasslands as opportunities for afforestation. Improved understanding of the interactive roles of climate variability, soils, topography, fire, and herbivores will help scientists and policymakers recognise the antiquity of the grasslands of the Eurasian forest-steppe.

AB  - With growing recognition of the ecological importance of grasslands, efforts to prevent their degradation, enhance the soil quality, and maintain ecological balance have become central to temperate grassland management. However, many temperate grasslands experience varying intensities and modes of grazing. Effective grazing management is crucial to avoid damage and promote the sustainable development of temperate grasslands. This study adopts a variety of research methods. Firstly, through the collection and sorting of data, it is clear that the research content mainly focuses on more than 70 response variables. Secondly, the comprehensive effects of different grazing intensity, grazing mode, and grazing history on these response variables were studied, and then detailed studies were conducted to analyze the effects of different grazing intensity and grazing mode under different temperate grassland types on these response variables. According to the analysis of the comprehensive effects and effects of different temperate grassland types, significant heterogeneity was found in 13 response variables (H, R, E, Height, Coverage, Density, TB, PB-PF, SWC, TK, OK, and N(20-60 cm)). Finally, in order to study the source of heterogeneity of these 13 response variables, subgroup analysis was carried out to analyze whether it was caused by environmental factors (MAP, MAT, MAP xMAT), and then publication bias test and Egger's test were carried out to prove the reliability of the research results. The results showed that the heterogeneity of 12 response variables (R, H, E, height, coverage, density, TB, PB, PF, SWC, OK and N (20-60 cm)) was attributed to environmental factors. However, due to insufficient data after subgroup analysis, the heterogeneity of TK cannot be determined.

AB  - 1. Bison Bison bison are a keystone of a conservation system, but that system is vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate projected to alter land use through the 21st century.
   2. The current bison population of North America is approximately 400,000 animals and is maintained by a self-assembled bison management system (BMS) of various stakeholders focused on bison conservation and production. The BMS is comprised of public, for-profit private, Tribal and not-for-profit non-governmental organization (NGO) sectors, with complementary values, attitudes and practices that contribute to a robust conservation footprint for the species.
   3. Currently, the majority of grasslands (90%) and bison (85%) are privately owned which justifies the need for robust private land conservation strategies to maintain this iconic species and its grassland habitats.
   4. We assessed vulnerability of the BMS to 21st century consequences of climate change with a vulnerability scoping diagram that emphasizes exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, as well as environmental values, attitudes and practices. We surveyed 132 bison managers within both the private and public/NGO sectors. Respondents were predominantly educated white males located in the northern and central mixed grass prairies who manage bison herds of, on average, 51-100 animals.
   5. Overall, the BMS is moderately vulnerable to climate change. While the public/NGO and private sectors differ in adaptive capacity, specifically in measures of information exchange, external revenue, use of management plans and access to grazing leases, the sectors act as partners for exchanging bison and rely on sustained interchange of bison; dimensions of exposure and sensitivity appear similar between public/NGO and private sectors.
   6. The complementary, shared environmental values and attitudes of the private and public/NGO sectors shape the foundation for enhanced collaboration among the multi-sector BMS. But it is the sharing of diverse practices and respective consequences that will lead the BMS to discover credible, scalable adaptive solutions to climate change. This may lead to the bison community to decide whether to form a 'bison coalition' to seek solutions to adapt to climate change.

AB  - Understanding the recovery of soil macroarthropod communities during natural regrowth is crucial to demonstrate complete soil restoration. This is because these organisms can play a key role in shaping soil structure and community dynamics, making them essential to understanding these processes. This study investigates the recovery of soil macroarthropod diversity, density, and biomass across different stages of natural regrowth, focusing on the taxonomic groups and feeding guilds dynamics. Macroarthropod communities were analyzed along a chronosequence (young-age, middle-age, and old-growth) including their vertical distribution (litter, 0-10 cm, 10- 20 cm, and 20-30 cm). A total of 20 plots and 100 Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Programme (TSBF) soil monoliths were sampled. Results revealed an increase in total macroarthropod diversity, biomass, and density with regrowth, but these patterns do not occur in the same way for all macroarthropod groups, emphasizing the complexity of ecological succession. Termites were key ecosystem engineers, shaping community composition at each regrowth stage. Predators and decomposers also exhibited significant changes in response to regrowth, reflecting their sensitivity to ecological disturbances. In contrast, ants and some herbivores showed higher densities and biomass in pastures and early regrowth stages, with notable shifts in species composition over time. Vertical distribution of macroarthropods revealed higher activity at the 0-10 cm depth, with similarities in the composition in litter and 10-20 cm soil depth, highlighting soil microarthropod importance in soil mineralization and humification. These findings underscore the critical role of ecosystem engineers in soil restoration and highlight the need for the conservation of soil biology to enhance soil health.

AB  - Tree architectures reflect the main abiotic and biotic selection pressures determining tree growth and survival. Studies have shown that trees growing in herbivore-dominated ecosystems, such as savannas, develop denser, more divaricate 'cage'-like architectures in response to chronic browsing pressure (also known as 'brown world' architectures). In contrast, trees growing under resource-limited conditions develop traits that allow them to better compete for abiotic resources (referred to as 'green world' architectures); for example, light limitation can induce trees to form more pole-like structures that allow them to grow faster in height. In temperate forests, abiotic drivers have traditionally been assumed to be the main factors affecting plant architecture. However, gap dynamics typically characterize old-growth temperate forests, where disturbances such as storms create gaps with temporary high-light availability, but also attracting intense mammalian browsing. Under such conditions, one would expect tree saplings to exhibit high architectural plasticity enabling them to develop a 'cage' in response to high herbivore pressure, but when herbivore pressure declines switch to a more pole-like structure that allows them to grow quickly in height and compete for light. We tested the ability of five dominant European tree species to induce a 'cage' architecture (hereafter referred to as 'cage plasticity') under contrasting light and herbivory regimes in a full-factorial experiment in Bialowieza Forest. We planted 720 young tree saplings in six replicated blocks in which we manipulated ungulate browsing (exclosure vs. control) and light levels (gap vs. closed forest). Two out of the five species (hornbeam Carpinus betulus and lime Tilia cordata) were able to develop a cage when exposed to ungulate herbivores but only under high-light conditions. These two species had the highest survival rates in the herbivory treatment over a 10-year period. Synthesis. Cage plasticity in temperate forest tree species may reflect an overlooked adaptation to mammal herbivory originating in a past when large mammals exerted strong selection pressures in European ecosystems. Our findings challenge the view of closed-canopy forest communities being solely driven by abiotic drivers and call for a re-evaluation of the importance of large herbivores in shaping the functional traits of temperate tree species.

AB  - Our understanding of the role of fire and effect of ant species composition, beyond their diversity and abundance, on the effectiveness of mutualism defence is limited. Most of our knowledge of ant-plant defence in tropical Africa is biased towards East African savannas which have richer soil, higher primary productivity and a more diverse arthropods and mammal community than West African savannas. We assessed the diversity of ant species associated with Acacia species in the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve in the Dahomey Gap, and their impacts on elephant damage. Elephant damage, ant diversity and abundance were measured in stands of five Acacia species. Eleven ant species were identified in the Acacia stands. The composition of these ant communities varied across Acacia species. Pair of ant species co-occurred in only 2 % of sampled trees, suggesting a strong competitive exclusion. Within this annually burnt environment, ants were rare on small trees. The intensity of elephant-caused branch breaking did not vary between trees with ants and trees without ants, suggesting limited Acacia-ant mutualism. Such limited biotic defence may mask strong physical and chemical defence mechanisms of Acacia trees against elephant damage. Ant assemblages in West Africa, unlike those in the more productive East Africa, are particularly species-poor. However, there is a convergence between these two regions in low rate of ant co-occurrence which might indicate strong competitive exclusion. Our study suggests that such low ant species richness while limiting the efficacy of mutualism in controlling mega-herbivore damage may mask a strong defence syndrome.

AB  - Wildlife corridors are critical for the effective conservation of wildlife and for enhancing ecosystem services. Unfortunately, increased human pressure has increased the risk of species extinction in wildlife corridors. Studies on wildlife corridor connectivity have always used Geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) without information from ground surveys thus lacking comprehensive conclusions for effective management. We assessed wildlife corridor connectivity between the Wami-Mbiki Game Reserve???Nyerere National Park (WMGR-NYENAPA) in Tanzania, using a combination of ground transect surveys, RS, and GIS. Overall, the RS and GIS showed a decline in the woody cover types over the past 40 years. Forest and woodland declined by 9% and 17% respectively between 1980 and 2020. Conversely, the land conversions namely agriculture and settlement increased by 4.7% and 0.1%, respectively. The spatial distribution of the twenty-two (22) wildlife species recorded using ground surveys was negatively affected by increasing land conversions. Although plant diversity to support wildlife survival was abundant, suggesting the suitability of the corridor for wildlife, elephant movements were severed as one might predict in a degraded corridor. We urge protecting the remaining corridor area. We further recommend a combination of actions to secure the remaining part of the corridor including enforcement of existing land use regulations that restrict land clearance, improving cross-sectoral dialogues on sustainable conservation by harmonizing conflicting legislation between conservation and land development, formulating a specific organ with the mandate to manage cross-cutting issues on wildlife corridors and introducing community con-servation education and awareness through extension programs on poaching, sustainable utili-zation of natural land resources including REDD+ programs and adoption of alternative income source activities.

AB  - Questions Large spatial variation in damage intensity is a pervasive, but poorly explained, feature of herbivore-plant interactions. To predict herbivore effects on plant communities, ecologists need greater understanding of the mechanisms and relative importance of processes driving variation in damage at the spatial scales of individual plant, plant community, and landscape. We ask: (1) what are the relative strengths of traits of individual plants versus landscape context in affecting white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) browsing on saplings in oak woodlands; and (2) is browsing intensity on post oak (Quercus stellata) influenced by associational effects related to density or frequency of more-selected or less-selected species? Location Dry oak-dominated woodlands, Kansas, USA. Methods We sampled deer browsing on saplings in three woodlands, each containing five transects, with 21 10-m(2) plots per transect. Transects ran from woodland-grassland edges into woodlands. In each plot, we identified saplings to species, measured variables in individual-plant (height) and landscape contexts (distance from edge and proximity to deer trails), and quantified proportion of stems browsed per sapling. Results Browsing intensity varied greatly among the 18 tree species encountered. Browsing increased with sapling height and decreased with distance from woodland edges. The effect size of distance from edge was twice that of sapling height, although both effect sizes were small. Browsing on post oaks increased with local frequency of saplings of more-selected species. Conclusions Our comparison of individual-plant versus landscape context variables and our assessment of associational effects supports a substantial role for coarse-scale foraging decisions in explaining browsing damage. However, sapling species identity was most influential. Associational susceptibility of a less-selected species, post oak, near more-selected neighbors is consistent with a mobile herbivore choosing between patches. The pre-eminence of frequency of more-selected species in mediating associational susceptibility may reflect decreased handling time in pure patches and/or attempts to balance nutrients.

AB  - As an adaptive biological trait, group size may offer a useful metric for monitoring the welfare of wildlife species affected by their environmental surroundings. Here, we examine the drivers that cause variation in group size of the endangered mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni), including a range of natural ecological factors as well as the density of livestock. For this purpose, we collected data along transect lines during both wet and dry seasons focusing on the hitherto poorly studied populations in the Arsi Mountains National Park, Munessa-Kuke Controlled Hunting Area and Muktar Mountain Forest Reserve, which are managed for multiple use of a variety of natural resources. We found group sizes to be an average of 6.3, 4.4 and 4.1 individuals in the Arsi Mountains, Munessa-Kuke and Muktar Mountain study areas, respectively, and a combination of livestock density and habitat visibility explained as much as 74% of the variation in group size. We propose that whereas group size increases with forage availability (as measured by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index -NDVI) and in open habitats (probably due to a switch in antipredator strategy), the presence of livestock also has an independent, negative impact on group size because of the associated disturbance. The findings contribute to understanding the environmental drivers of variation in group size in social antelopes, particularly highlighting the need to improve livestock management to help conservation of species at risk.

AB  - Whether fragmented ecosystems can maintain diversity is a key ecological question. The ability of fragmented forests to support diversity is determined by both landscape-scale metapopulation dynamics and within-patch mechanisms that govern species coexistence. Within-patch dynamics can be affected by proximity to forest edges. Edge effects on abiotic and biotic processes can alter species' performance and species interactions, but it is unclear how edge effects bear upon the long-term ability of fragmented forests to maintain diversity.
   We apply modern coexistence theory as a framework to predict the impact of edge effects on species coexistence. Using field data for a tropical tree community, we parameterized a spatially explicit simulation model to quantify how habitat and density dependence during seedling establishment affect diversity of later life stages. We matched simulated future communities to observed patterns of diversity and community structure for established seedlings and adults, coupled with sensitivity analysis of simulated effects.
   We found that early recruitment dynamics contributed to community structure at older life stages, corroborating empirical work on the importance of early life-stage dynamics for diversity. Edge effects reduced the diversity maintained in patches. The progressive loss of diversity was not due to changes in relative competitive ability (fitness differences), but due to weaker stabilization via density-dependent seed mortality. Results were robust to wide changes in the absolute values of model parameters, suggesting that variation in the strength of individual processes did not change their relative importance for diversity.
   Synthesis. Weakening of stabilizing processes that promote species self-limitation in ecological communities could compromise the ability of habitat fragments to maintain diversity. Quantifying the relative importance of intraspecific versus interspecific interactions-to assess stabilizing mechanisms and fitness differences-can help evaluate when habitat amount versus quality plays a larger role in maintaining diversity of fragments.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of large herbivores on soil organic matter (OM) stability in Arctic permafrost and seasonally frozen ground ecosystems, focusing on the potential preservation effect of grazing. Soil samples were collected from Siberian and Finnish permafrost and nonpermafrost areas and organic carbon content, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, stable carbon isotopes as well as the content of n-alkanes and n-alcohols were analysed to assess OM stability. The results suggest that grazing activity, particularly in permafrost environments, preserves soil OM by reducing decomposition. Permafrost soils exhibit higher functionalized to nonfunctionalized biomarker ratios, indicating in general better preservation under frozen conditions. While differences in grazing intensities had minor effects, the data also showed variability due to soil heterogeneity, especially in seasonally frozen ground ecosystems. Nevertheless, there are slight trends toward enhanced OM preservation with increasing grazing intensity, especially in permafrost, emphasising the potential role of grazing in locally preserving Arctic soil OM. This pilot study offers initial insights into the impact of large herbivores on OM stability in cold-region ecosystems, suggesting that significant effects may require prolonged, intensive grazing pressure.

AB  - Canopy tree seedlings rarely grow in regions with overabundant deer in Japan, whereas Pieris japonica, a shrub species that is unpalatable to deer, has been expanding its habitat and occasionally forms dense pure stands in disturbed locations. Although this species could be the key to understanding vegetation structure and function under intense deer pressure, little information is available regarding the structural and functional aspects of P. japonica stands. Here, we examined aboveground mass (MA) and several structural parameters for 13 P. japonica stands of various developmental stages (3-64 years old as estimated from the number of growth rings of component plants); the stand MA and leaf area were estimated by developing relevant allometric equations for individual plants. The MA of P. japonica stands (<= 50 Mg ha(-1)) were less than a fifth of that recorded for neighboring forests consisting of deciduous broad-leaved trees and conifers. Leaf area index (<= 4.9 m2 m(-2)) and basal stem area (<= 62 m2 ha(-1), determined at 5 cm from the ground) of the stands reached the level comparable to tree forests, whereas canopy height (<= 4.4 m) was much shorter and plant density (>= 7,300 stems ha-1) was fairly high compared with those of average tree forests in neighboring regions. The stand structure lacked thick and long boles, resulting in low biomass accumulation in P. japonica stands. Thus, one possible consequence of the long-lasting deer pressure is the reduction of the carbon sequestration capacity to a fraction of that of the present forests.

AB  - Individual animals in natural populations tend to host diverse parasite species concurrently over their lifetimes. In free-living ecological communities, organismal life histories shape interactions with their environment, which ultimately forms the basis of ecological succession. However, the structure and dynamics of mammalian parasite communities have not been contextualized in terms of primary ecological succession, in part because few datasets track occupancy and abundance of multiple parasites in wild hosts starting at birth. Here, we studied community dynamics of 12 subtypes of protozoan microparasites (Theileria spp.) in a herd of African buffalo. We show that Theileria communities followed predictable patterns of succession underpinned by four different parasite life history strategies. However, in contrast to many free-living communities, network complexity decreased with host age. Examining parasite communities through the lens of succession may better inform the effect of complex within host eco-evolutionary dynamics on infection outcomes, including parasite co-existence through the lifetime of the host.

AB  - In temperate forests of the northeastern U.S., moose (Alces alces) populations are adapted for mixed-age heterogeneous landscapes that provide abundant herbaceous forage in warm months and coniferous forage during winter. Heterogeneity of forest stands is driven by management activities or natural disturbance, resulting in a multi-age forest at a landscape scale. Here, we present a method to estimate landscape carrying capacity of moose by combining remote sensing classification of forest cover class with literature or field-based estimates of class-specific forage abundance. We used Landsat imagery from 1991 to 2013 for the Allegheny National Forest and 2013-2018 for the Adirondack Park, and associated training polygons, to predict based on NDVI and SWI whether a forested landscape fit into one of three cover classes: mature forest, intermediate timber removal, or overstory timber removal. Our three-classes yielded a mean land cover prediction accuracy of 94.3% (Khat = 0.91) and 86.9% (Khat = 0.76) for ANFR and AP, respectively. In the AP, we applied previously calculated summer crude protein values to our predicted cover types, resulting in an estimated average carrying capacity of 760 moose (SD +/- 428) across all sampling years, similar in magnitude to a density estimate of 716 moose (95% CI = 566-906) calculated during the same time. Our approach was able to accurately identify forest timber treatments across landscapes at differing spatial and temporal scales and provide an alternative method to estimate landscape-level ungulate carrying capacity. The ability to accurately identify areas of potential conflict from overbrowsing, or to highlight areas in need of land cover treatments can increase the toolset for ungulate management in managed forest landscapes.

AB  - Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) is a widespread invasive species in North America with extensive effects on native ecosystems. Since 2012, there have been extensive outbreaks of the native leaf fungal pathogen, honeysuckle leaf blight (Insolibasidium deformans), on L. maackii. This pathogen infects leaves in the late spring/early summer and eventually kills the leaves. Our objective was to describe patterns of blight occurrence on L. maackii growing in both the forest understory and in the open in northern Kentucky, USA. Smaller shrubs had a larger fraction of blighted leaves, because they allocated more production to long shoots, which are more susceptible to leaf blight. Overall, blight occurrence was as high as 8% on the smallest shrubs, though it was an order of magnitude lower on the largest shrubs sampled. Leaf blight appears to be an emerging pathogen that fits the Pathogen Accumulation Hypothesis. We developed a growth model that suggested small (< 5 cm basal diameter) open shrubs would be most affected by blight. Thus, future work should focus on comparison of the survival and growth of small infected versus uninfected L. maackii plants, as they appear to be most affected by the leaf blight.

AB  - Simple Summary Native wild boar populations are expanding across Europe, causing concern due to their significant soil disturbances and considerable impact on ecosystems. However, little is known about how wild boar activities affect other organisms. This study investigated the effects of wild boars on the abundance of fungal sporocarps and their respective fungal guilds (i.e., symbiotic, saprophytic and pathogenic) in boreal forests in Sweden. We selected 11 forested sites in central Sweden: six with and five without the presence of wild boar. We determined the presence or absence of wild boar and rooting intensity at each site. Simultaneously, we investigated the abundance of fungal sporocarps and their fungal guilds. We found that the presence of wild boar and rooting intensity were associated with the abundance of fungal sporocarps. Wild boar rooting was positively correlated with saprotrophic fungi and negatively with symbiotic fungi. Pathogenic fungi were more abundant in plots with no rooting but in the presence of wild boar. We conclude that wild boar represents a recurrent disturbance agent and, based on sporocarp abundance, could eventually affect entire fungal populations. Native wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations are expanding across Europe. This is cause for concern in some areas where overabundant populations impact natural ecosystems and adjacent agronomic systems. To better manage the potential for impacts, managers require more information about how the species may affect other organisms. For example, information regarding the effect of wild boar on soil fungi for management application is lacking. Soil fungi play a fundamental role in ecosystems, driving essential ecological functions; acting as mycorrhizal symbionts, sustaining plant nutrition and providing defense; as saprotrophs, regulating the organic matter decomposition; or as plant pathogens, regulating plant fitness and survival. During autumn (Sep-Nov) 2018, we investigated the effects of wild boar (presence/absence and rooting intensity) on the abundance (number of individuals) of fungal sporocarps and their functional guilds (symbiotic, saprotrophic and pathogenic). We selected eleven forested sites (400-500 x 150-200 m) in central Sweden; six with and five without the presence of wild boar. Within each forest, we selected one transect (200 m long), and five plots (2 x 2 m each) for sites without wild boar, and ten plots for sites with boars (five within and five outside wild boar disturbances), to determine the relationship between the intensity of rooting and the abundance of sporocarps for three fungal guilds. We found that the presence of wild boar and rooting intensity were associated with the abundance of sporocarps. Interestingly, this relationship varied depending on the fungal guild analyzed, where wild boar rooting had a positive correlation with saprophytic sporocarps and a negative correlation with symbiotic sporocarps. Pathogenic fungi, in turn, were more abundant in undisturbed plots (no rooting) but located in areas with the presence of wild boar. Our results indicate that wild boar activities can potentially regulate the abundance of fungal sporocarps, with different impacts on fungal guilds. Therefore, wild boar can affect many essential ecosystem functions driven by soil fungi in boreal forests, such as positive effects on energy rotation and in creating mineral availability to plants, which could lead to increased diversity of plants in boreal forests.

AB  - Over the last century, Texas has been inundated with exotic ungulates, with as many as 67 species represented by captive and free-ranging populations. One of the most successful species to have established free-ranging populations is the Aoudad (Ammotragus lervia). Herein, we expand on previous genetic studies in Aoudad by including new genomic profiles based on double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing methods with the intent of better understanding the effects of >70 years of human-mediated translocations, population expansion, and gene flow among populations. Using a range of 4,338 to 5,529 single-nucleotide polymorphisms obtained from 73 individuals that potentially represented A. l. blainei, A. l. lervia, and A. l. sahariensis, we measured genetic patterns of diversity and connectivity between source populations from California and New Mexico and resultant aoudad populations in Texas. Principal component analyses identified phylogeographically structured populations across Texas. Further, we identified a signature of isolation by distance among Texas populations. To assess geographic regions that facilitated or blocked gene flow between populations, we used estimation of effective migration surfaces, which indicated 3 barriers to movement between populations as well as connectivity among populations in close proximity. Comparison of mtDNA haplogroups and nuclear genotypes among the 3 examined subspecies were discordant, indicating that the current subspecific taxonomic classification needs refinement. Given the vulnerable status of Aoudad in their native range of northern Africa and the exponential population growth and potential competition with native ungulates in Texas, we propose that efforts to manage non-native Aoudad should strive to maintain and preserve unique genetic units while minimizing competition and other detriments to native species in Texas. Conservation efforts are especially important given the vulnerable status of Aoudad within their native range of northern Africa.

AB  - The current biodiversity loss is alarming. Protected areas can be a key strategy to halt and reverse the downward trend. To evaluate their efficiency and to conduct global biodiversity assessments, the availability of reliable data on species occurrence, diversity, and abundance is critical. Camera traps provide these data and have been used extensively in areas with high species richness, such as, temperate and tropical ecosystems, and are currently becoming more prominent in hyper-arid regions. We augment the data from hyper-arid regions by providing one of the first studies on biodiversity of terrestrial mammals and birds using camera traps at sites in central Saudi Arabia. From the deployments at 64 locations in 1.5 years, we observed a total of 59 vertebrate species with 12 species categorized as threatened on the IUCN Red List and an additional 12 that are deemed to have a high conservation priority in Saudi Arabia. This information can contribute to global biodiversity assessments and confirms the importance of the study sites as regional places of refuge. Results from this study also provide information that can support conservation management. We show that water provision was especially important to the sand gazelle. Additionally, observations of newborns of reintroduced species and the presence of predators contribute to evaluating the effectiveness and suitability of reintroduction programs to restore native biodiversity.

AB  - Waterlogged alpine peatlands harbour substantial reserves of recalcitrant soil organic carbon (SOC) that is mainly decomposed by soil fungi. Even a slight fluctuation in peatland SOC can considerably alter C emissions, thereby impacting the future trajectory of climate change. These peatlands are often subject to yak grazing, which can affect ecosystem functions. However, how grazing regulates microbially mediated temporal variations in SOC in alpine peatlands remains largely unclear. Therefore, we conducted a field experiment on the Zoige Plateau to explore the effects of grazing on peatland soil C content and its association with soil fungal communities during different seasons (spring, summer, and autumn). Grazing significantly increased SOC in spring but not in the subsequent seasons. Furthermore, grazing significantly increased soil water contents in summer, dissolved organic carbon contents in autumn, and N-acetyl-(3-D-glucosaminidase and leucine aminopeptidase activities in spring and autumn, but decreased phenol oxidase activity in spring and summer. Grazing significantly reduced fungal diversity at alpha and (3 scales. The coefficient of variation of SOC was significantly reduced by grazing, whereas similar trends were not observed for dissolved organic carbon or for dissolved organic and inorganic nitrogen. In the fenced area, the coefficient of variation of fungal species richness was the most important factor for predicting that of SOC. In the grazed area, coefficient of variation of soil NH4+-N contributed the most to that of SOC. These findings underscore the pivotal role of fungal community in affecting SOC dynamics in alpine peatlands, which is crucial for understanding the ecological processes that maintain soil C cycling in alpine ecosystems.

AB  - The habitats of snow leopards (Panthera uncia) are heavily utilized as pasturelands on the Tibetan Plateau. Livestock can benefit the snow leopard populations via providing extra prey resources. However, livestock can negatively impact upon the distribution of snow leopards by competing with their wild prey. Therefore, how grazing affects snow leopard space use is variable and its underlying mechanisms are unclear. We used 188 camera traps to systematically investigate the activities of snow leopards, their main wild prey, i.e., blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur), and livestock (i.e. yaks) across 650 km2 of Gongga Mountain. We found that: (1) snow leopards were detected only in areas with higher occurrences of blue sheep, and the presence of blue sheep was crucial in driving snow leopard space use. (2) The detection frequencies of snow leopards and blue sheep were lower at sites with yaks than without yaks. (3) Yaks limited snow leopard space use mainly by competing with its main prey, blue sheep. Our results highlight that the competition pressure of livestock on wild ungulates can limit the activities of snow leopards. Grazing management should be improved for conservation of snow leopards at Gongga Mountain.

AB  - Himalayan ibex (Capra ibex sibirica) is a subspecies of Capra ibex, and is evenly distributed throughout the upper comparatively dry mountains of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. It is categorized as a Least Concern species globally as well as in Pakistan, however its presence in the Karakorum mountain plays a significant role in the economy of the region as dozens of trophy hunting of this specie takes place in the region every year and generates handsome money to the local inhabitants of the mountainous community. The characteristic habitat analysis and preference was important as the ibex move downwards during winter to cope the fodder shortage after heavy snowfall. This may expose the ibex to potential threats of predation by predators, poaching and competition for food with livestock during winter season. Therefore, the study was conducted to analyze the characteristic habitat feature and preference of Himalayan ibex during winter season in Hushe valley of Karakorum range.

AB  - Replacement of complex assemblages of native mammal fauna with livestock species reduces niche heterogeneity. This negatively affects taxa such as dung beetles, which depend on them and can, in turn, affect ecosystem functioning. We assessed the response of dung beetle diversity, biomass and body condition to cattle-farming pressures in protected areas (PAs) and adjacent farms in the savannah biome of northern Namibia. We hypothesized that rich native mammal assemblages are essential to maintain dung beetle diversity and overall biomass. We further explored whether the low-quality dung resources on farms would lead to a decrease in individual body size for species found on both farms and PAs. Overall dung beetle richness increased with higher mammal richness but not relative abundance, demonstrating that a rich native vertebrate assemblage promotes dung beetle richness. Overall dung beetle biomass was lower on farms, but abundance showed no difference. Large-bodied dung specialist species, which are known to be functionally superior, were absent on farms while smaller generalist species proliferated. Furthermore, a large proportion of individuals of species common to both farms and PAs were physically smaller on farms, indicating reduced body condition. Our results show that a high diversity of native mammals maintains dung beetle diversity and higher biomass on PAs. A decrease in native dung on farms leads to reduced body mass, likely negatively impacting ecological function. These results suggest that the conservation of dung beetles and their functions in the expansive African savannah ecosystems is dependent on a complex mix of native mammal species.

AB  - Tillage regimes directly impact soil disturbance and crop residue levels in the field, subsequently affecting soil macrofauna abundance and diversity, crucial for maintaining soil health and ecosystem functionality. The pre-sent study aimed to investigate the effects of different tillage regimes (no-tillage (NT), conventional tillage (CT) and reduced-tillage (RT)) on soil properties and macrofaunal communities in a typical black soil region of Northeast China. Our study revealed that, in comparison to CT and RT, NT significantly enhanced soil macro-fauna biodiversity and brought about modification in the community composition. Additionally, it reduced changes in the soil physical-chemical properties. Furthermore, the choice of tillage regimes impacted the trophic structure of soil macrofauna, manifesting in great density and species richness of herbivores and predators in NT plots with crop residue retention when compared to those managed with tillage. Overall, soil organic carbon (SOC) and pH played pivotal roles in regulating the soil macrofaunal community. The alternations observed in the soil macrofaunal community represented a comprehensive response to tillage practices and residue return, which in turn influenced soil properties and microenvironments, including food resources and microhabitats. Therefore, our findings indicated that conservation tillage exerted a notable influence on the soil macrofaunal community. This underscores the significance of soil environments and properties in molding the structure and composition of the soil macrofaunal community. The study will enhance comprehension of soil management practices and advocate for diversity within soil macrofaunal communities.

AB  - Tropical and subtropical forests are important for terrestrial gross primary production. These forests are limited by nutrient availability and are vulnerable to nutrient enrichment under global change. However, little is known about how and why belowground biodiversity responds to nutrient enrichment during litter decomposition in these forests - the fundamental process fuelling nutrients to the soil system while supporting carbon sequestration. We conducted a 6-year field microcosm experiment and used a linear mixed effect to investigate the effects of nutrient enrichment on micro-food webs (i.e., microbes and nematodes) of leaf and root litters in a subtropical plantation. We found strong effects of nutrient enrichment on diversity and structure of microbes and nematodes during litter decomposition. For instance, fertilization (nitrogen+phosphorus; N + P) significantly decreased fungal richness of diversity (OTUs richness) throughout the decomposition process, and shifted the litter biota toward lower bacterial evenness of diversity (OTUs evenness), with higher relative abundances of fungi and herbivores at the humus-near stage. Nutrient enrichment also modulated leaf and root litter micro-food webs in different ways. NP addition had stronger positive effects on leaf litter bacterial oligotrophs:copiotrophs at the early stage, and stronger positive effects on root litter fungi:bacteria, but stronger negative effects on leaf litter fungal oligotrophs:copiotrophs at the humus-near stage. Overall, our results indicate that nutrient enrichment significantly alters microbes and microfauna associated with litter decomposition in subtropical forests, with important consequences for nutrient replenishment and soil organic carbon formation.

(2025). It's time to go-Drivers and plasticity of migration phenology in a short-distance migratory ungulate. Journal of Animal Ecology. . Timing strongly influences the benefits animals derive from migration, particularly in herbivores that track vegetation phenology. Yet, despite increasing environmental variability under climate change, little research has focused on the plasticity of individuals' migration decisions and the population-level consequences of such adaptations. Chauveau et al. (2025) investigate the environmental drivers and sex-specific plasticity of migration timing in Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) by integrating long-term movement data from 17 populations, with a particular focus on individual variation. They find that males exhibit greater behavioural plasticity than females, especially in springs with unusually early or late peaks in vegetation green-up. The reduced plasticity in females' spring migration departure is suggested to arise from trade-offs between access to forage and predation avoidance. Interestingly, this difference disappeared when analysis was restricted to repeat migrants, with both sexes performing similarly well, challenging assumptions about fixed reproductive constraints on migratory plasticity. Instead, the patterns reported by Chauveau et al. (2025) seem to point towards a more complex combination of factors underlying migratory plasticity, including reproductive status, experience, social environment and susceptibility to heat stress. These results underscore the importance of long-term, individual-level monitoring to assess migratory patterns and plasticity. Chauveau and colleagues' work lays the foundation for a more nuanced understanding of migration, highlighting how individual traits and behavioural plasticity shape adaptive responses to shifting environmental conditions. Understanding individual behavioural variation may be key to assessing population resilience in the face of rapidly changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Sus scrofa L. (Wild Pig) are invasive, found throughout much of the US, and annually cause $1.5-2.2 billion in damage to natural and agricultural resources. Understanding habitat selection by Wild Pigs may inform control efforts by allowing managers to target their removal in frequently used habitats. Therefore, we used GPS tracking collars to study resource selection by Wild Pigs within their home ranges in an agro-forested landscape in southwestern Georgia, USA, during 2021-2023. Both sexes showed a greater probability of selecting areas near forested wetlands/riparian zones during both seasons, making this the most consistently selected landcover type. During the growing season (May-October), female Wild Pigs also showed a greater probability of selecting areas near unpaved roads but a lower probability of selecting areas near upland forests; during the dormant season (November-April), they showed a greater probability of selecting areas near upland forests and paved roads but a lower probability of selecting areas near unpaved roads, cropland, and buildings. In addition to forested wetlands/riparian zones, males showed a greater probability of selecting areas near cropland and buildings during the growing season; during the dormant season, they showed a greater probability of selecting areas near buildings and unpaved roads. Males showed a lower probability of selecting areas near paved roads during both seasons. During the growing season when Wild Pig damage to crops can be severe, Wild Pigs used cropland most often in the morning crepuscular hours. In an agro-forested landscape, efforts to remove Wild Pigs should prioritize forested wetlands and riparian zones year-round, while also targeting croplands specifically during the growing season. Removal of Wild Pigs from croplands may be male biased because males, but not females, selected crops during the growing season. Efforts to control Wild Pigs during the growing season may also reinforce fear of humans, resulting in decreased selection by Wild Pigs and subsequent declines in crop damage.

AB  - Vegetation is a crucial component of any ecosystem and to preserve the health and stability of grassland ecosystems, species diversity is important. The primary form of grassland use globally is livestock grazing, hence many studies focus on how plant diversity is affected by the grazing intensity, differential use of grazing time and livestock species. Nevertheless, the impact of the grazing time on plant diversity remains largely unexplored. We performed a field survey on the winter pastures in alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) to examine the effects of grazing time on the vegetation traits. Livestock species, grazing stocking rates and the initiation time of the grazing were similar, but termination times of the grazing differed. The grazing termination time has a significant effect on most of the vegetation traits in the winter pastures. The vegetation height, above-ground biomass, and the Graminoids biomass was negatively related to the grazing termination time in the winter pastures. In contrast, vegetation cover and plant diversity initially increased and subsequently decreased again as the grazing termination time was extended. An extension of the grazing time did not have any effect on the biomass of forbs. Our study is the first to investigate the effects of grazing during the regrowth period on vegetation traits and imply that the plant diversity is mediated by the grazing termination time during the regrowth period in winter pastures. These findings could be used to improve the guidelines for livestock grazing management and policies of summer and winter pasture grazing of family pastures on the QTP from the perspective of plant diversity protection.

AB  - Wild animals are infected with a large diversity and abundance of parasites that can affect their behavior, growth, body condition, and ultimately their survival. Although the adverse effects of parasites and the mechanisms involved in the interactions between a host and its parasites are generally well studied, much less is known about the additive or synergistic effects of multiple parasite species on a host. Moose populations in eastern Canada are infected by several species of endoparasites. In the last decades, the intensity of infestations by winter ticks, an ectoparasite, on moose have increased as a result of increased moose densities and favorable weather conditions that benefit winter tick survival. We aimed to document the diversity, intensity, prevalence, and distribution of different parasite species of moose in southern Quebec, Canada. We then evaluated the potential interaction between winter tick and endoparasites of moose, and we evaluated the effect of the simultaneous presence of ticks and endoparasites on moose body condition. To do so, we collected organs to identify and count endoparasite species, estimate winter tick abundance, and measure subcutaneous fat thickness from 174 hunted moose in fall 2019 in 8 regions of Quebec. Our results showed that the prevalence and intensity of winter tick and gastrointestinal parasites differed among regions, as well as the prevalence of the heart parasite Taenia krabbei and the intensity of lung parasite Echinoccocus granulosus. Moose body condition, however, was not influenced by the simultaneous presence of winter tick and endoparasites. The documentation of the interactive effects of multiple parasite species on a host is fundamental given that future environmental conditions in temperate climate will favor the reproduction, development, and survival of several parasite species, which could affect parasite diversity and abundance in the environment and modify host-parasite dynamics.

AB  - This work was done on 1996 and 1997, and presents an extremely valuable baseline to compare the recent and future changes on the insular shallow habitats of the Azorean islands. We examined the structure of the molluscan communities of the macroalgae Halopteris scoparia in Sao Miguel Island (Azores, Portugal). This island was chosen because it is the largest and the most populated of the archipelago, with polluted sites which are not common in the Azores. The relationship between the epifaunal assemblages and a set of environmental factors - geographical location (orientation), seawater temperature, depth, algal volume, degree of disturbance, and degree of exposure to the wave action - was investigated using distance-based redundancy analysis and significant variation in the distribution of richness of assemblages was found. Four environmental predictors were common to all the four analyses implemented (richness and assemblage structure using both AIC and BIC): algal volume (that correlates with algal dry weight), seawater temperature, coastal orientation and depth. Finally, the application in the Azores of this methodology favours a sampling program in Spring-Summer (when disturbance seems to be more susceptible to detection), and the use of H. scoparia in the subtidal zone, as the target alga is recommended due to its large covering of rocky shore substrates.

AB  - Human practices and local governance effects on plant communities is a major question in socioecological sustainability. Pastoralists' practices are intricately linked to governance systems and to their social-ecological context. For example, spatial-temporal mobility arises as a means to cope with seasonal variability of forage mass. This mobility might deeply influence plant biodiversity in rangelands by changing the ratio of perennial and annual life-forms. This study focuses on the commonly governed high- altitude rangelands of Castril, Santiago and Pontones (CSP) in North-Eastern Andalusia (Spain). CSP are grounded on three pastoralist communities who have self-organized into three different governance systems, that of Castril, Santiago and Pontones, for the use of three contiguous rangelands through extensive and transhumant grazing. Pastoralists undertaking Short-Distance Transhumance (SDT) or Long-Distance Transhumance (LDT) arrive on the CSP summer rangelands in early May and June respectively. We aim to identify plant community types within CSP to unravel the effect of community-based governances found in these three commons and the impact of the different transhumance types (SDT vs. LDT) on the plant community structure and composition. For this, during spring 2022 and 2023, we carried out 72 vegetation transects (point-contact monitoring methodology) spread in Castril, Santiago and Pontones encompassing the transhumance modalities. Plant data were analyzed through a Non-metric MultiDimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordination based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index. NMDS results revealed variability within the plant community distinguishing between perennials and annuals which belong to different phytosociological classes. This variability was partially related to transhumance modalities with LDT areas showing high density of perennials, whereas SDT areas showing high density of annuals belonging to the Tuberarietea-guttatae phytosociological class. Our findings suggest that LDT areas may provide more forage mass than SDT areas during summer drought. (c) 2024 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation in tropical regions are major threats to the persistence of endangered Malay tapir (Tapirus indicus). The Malay tapir distribution is largely constrained to fragmented habitats inside protected areas. However, it is unclear how the spatial patterns of habitat fragmentation affect its relative abundance. Here, we investigated the effects of habitat fragmentation on Malay tapir relative abundance in Thailand. We first quantified the spatial patterns of habitat fragmentation within nine of Thailand's protected areas. Second, we assessed the relationship of fragmentation metrics and relative abundance of Malay tapirs. Third, we identified the relative importance of the fragmentation metrics in explaining relative abundance. We found that tapir abundance remained unexpectedly high in the Southern forest complex despite the fact that tapir habitats were significantly more fragmented there than in the protected area in the western forest complex (p < 0.05). Additionally, we found a significantly negative relation with clumpiness index (R-2 = 0.51, p < 0.05). This suggests that other factors may also be influencing their populations, so that the Southern protected areas provide preferred habitat with higher relative proportions of moist evergreen forest, large habitat patch size, precipitation, and elevation. It highlights the importance of interconnected habitat for tapirs, and the benefit of conservation efforts in small, less recognized protected areas.

AB  - 1. The use of ecological replacements (analogue species to replace extinct taxa) to restore ecosystem functioning is a promising conservation tool. However, this approach is controversial, in part due to a paucity of data on interactions between analogue species and established taxa in the ecosystem.
   2. We conducted ecological surveys, comprehensively DNA barcoded an ecosystem's flora and inferred the diet of the introduced Aldabra giant tortoise, acting as an ecological replacement, to understand how it might have modified island plant communities on a Mauritian islet. Through further dietary analyses, we investigated consequential effects on the threatened endemic Telfair's skink.
   3. Dietary overlap between tortoises and skinks was greater than expected by chance. However, there was a negative correlation between tortoise and skink preferences in herbivory and minimal overlap in the plants most frequently consumed by the reptiles.
   4. Changes in the plant community associated with 7 years of tortoise grazing were characterised by a decrease in the percentage cover of native herbs and creepers, and an increase in the cover of an invasive herb when compared to areas without tortoises. However, tortoise dietary preferences themselves did not directly drive changes in the plant community.
   5. Tortoises successfully dispersed the seeds of an endemic palm, which in time may increase the extent of unique palm-rich habitat. We found no evidence that tortoises have increased the extent of plant species hypothesised to be part of a lost Mauritian tortoise grazed community.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Due to a negative correlation in tortoise and skink dietary preferences and minimal overlap in the most frequently consumed taxa, the presence of tortoises is unlikely to have detrimental impacts on Telfair's skinks. Tortoise presence is likely to be beneficial to skinks in the long term by increasing the extent of palm-rich habitat. Although tortoises are likely to play a role in controlling invasive plants, they are not a panacea for this challenge. After 7 years, tortoises have not resurrected a lost tortoise grazed community that we hypothesise might have existed in limited areas on the islet, indicating that further interventions may be required to restore this plant community.

AB  - Urbanization leads to an increase in built-up areas but also creates landscape element mosaics, providing various habitats for phytophagous species. Sap-feeding insects (Hemiptera) form a major component of arboreal insect communities with many highly damaging and difficult-to- control pests of urban trees. Outbreaks of their populations are often reported from city centers. Here, we studied how urbanization (defined as the proportion of impervious surfaces within a 200 and 500-m radius) affected canopy-dwelling phytophagous hemipterans (true bugs, true hoppers, and psyllids) on field maple (Acer campestre) trees. We also considered the amount of green urban areas (gardens and parks) in the surrounding landscape and the characteristics of the hemipteran species (origin, diet, and body size). We found that sap-feeding hemipterans did not show consistent responses to urbanization. The occurrence of only one species (Alebra wahlbergi) increased while the abundance of other native species (e.g., Acericerus ribauti, Palomenaprasina, and Rhinocola aceris) decreased with increasing level of urbanization. At the same time, the serious pest of urban trees, Metcalfa pruinosa, but also two major crop pests, Nezara viridula and Halyomorpha halys had the highest numbers at an intermediate level of urbanization with a relatively high proportion of gardens and parks in the landscape. We also found less native and more generalist hemipterans in highly urbanized sites compared to less densely built areas. Our results suggest that, apart from their substantial contribution to ecosystem services, green urban areas can favor some major insect pests of urban trees and agricultural crops.

AB  - Arctic habitats are changing rapidly and altering trophic webs and ecosystem functioning. Understanding how species' abundances and distributions differ among Arctic habitats is important in predicting future species shifts and trophic-web consequences. We aimed to determine the habitat-abundance relationships for three small herbivores on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska, USA by fitting data from 983 point counts (collected during 2019, 2021, and 2022) with N-mixture models that account for imperfect detection. These herbivore species, Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus), Rock Ptarmigan (L. muta), and Arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii), are fundamental to tundra food webs, and primary prey for Arctic raptors including Gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus). Second, we aimed to map herbivore densities within Gyrfalcon breeding territories. Third, we aimed to evaluate whether Gyrfalcons were more likely to occupy territories with higher prey densities using a multi-season occupancy model coupled with occupancy observations from helicopter surveys conducted during 2016-2022 at 97 Gyrfalcon territories. We found that male Willow Ptarmigan were more abundant in areas with greater cover of tundra, tall shrubs, and tussock tundra. Conversely, male Rock Ptarmigan were more abundant in areas with greater cover of sparse vegetation and tundra. Arctic ground squirrels were more abundant at higher elevations with greater cover of sparse vegetation and low shrubs. Willow Ptarmigan were widespread within Gyrfalcon breeding territories, whereas Rock Ptarmigan and Arctic ground squirrels had patchier distributions with few areas of high abundance. Lastly, Gyrfalcons were more likely to occupy territories with higher densities of Willow Ptarmigan and Arctic ground squirrels. As the Artic continues to warm, Rock Ptarmigan and Arctic ground squirrels may be vulnerable to ongoing shrub encroachment, whereas Willow Ptarmigan may benefit. By tying abundances of three prey to Gyrfalcon occupancy, our results contribute to understanding potential impacts on higher levels of this Arctic trophic web.

AB  - Sarcoptic mange affects mammal host species worldwide and, particularly, wild Caprinae throughout much of Eurasia. In the Iberian Peninsula, several outbreaks of sarcoptic mange in Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) have been reported since the 1980s. Using data from a period of long-term monitoring and a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA)-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model approach, we performed a time-series analysis of the monthly prevalence of sarcoptic mange in the Iberian ibex population in Sierra Nevada Natural Space in southern Spain. In January 2003-March 2021, we documented a significant negative trend in sarcoptic mange prevalence, albeit with some interannual peaks. These findings can only be explained if a certain level of resistance to sarcoptic mange exists in hosts that, along with other factors, could provoke this reduced prevalence. Prevalence values varied seasonally, with maximum values in spring and minimum values at the end of summer, which may be due to factors linked to climate, host behavior, and endocrine activity. Our model predicts that the prevalence of sarcoptic mange in the Iberian ibex will continue to decrease over the next 2 years. Despite the inherent challenges involved, diagnosing and monitoring of wildlife diseases are integral to obtaining reliable epidemiological data and designing appropriate management strategies.

AB  - Central/West Africa is one of the most biodiverse regions on earth and one of the largest producers of cacao, producing about 68.4 % of the world's chocolate. Here, cacao pests and diseases can cause losses of $761 million annually. However, no studies from Africa have quantified the role of flying vertebrates as pest suppressors in cacao plantations. We used an exclusion experiment to prevent access of bats and birds to cacao trees for 12 months and quantified how their absence affected arthropod communities, herbivory, and cacao crop yield. Overall, important pests such as mealybugs and other hemipterans were more abundant in exclosures (9 and 1.6 times increase, respectively), despite potential multitrophic interactions with simultaneously increasing predatory arthropods such as spiders and mantis. Under heavy shade (90 %), cacao trees with flying vertebrate exclosures had 3.9 times fewer flowers and 3.2 times fewer large pods than control trees, corresponding to estimated losses on average of $478 ha(-1)y(-1). Under low tree-level shade cover (10 %) however, the opposite pattern was evident: exclosure trees had 5.2 times more flowers and 3.7 times more large pods than control trees, corresponding to estimated savings on average of $796 ha(-1)y(-1). We demonstrate that the enormous potential of African flying vertebrates as pest suppressors in cacao plantations is dependent on local shade tree management and only economically relevant above 50 % of shade. Despite higher productivity at low shade levels, our findings encourage African policymakers and farmers to adopt more high shade cacao agroforestry systems to maximize pest suppression services provided by bats and birds.

AB  - The galls induced by cynipids in host oaks have been proposed as biodiversity hotspots. They constitute support for the development of arthropod communities of great diversity and functional complexity that find in them nutrition and protection from external abiotic and biotic elements which change according to environmental gradients. We characterize the abundance, richness, and diversity of gall-inducing cynipids associated with the galls of the host oak Quercus rugosa, through an elevation gradient. This study was conducted on 140 oak trees belonging to seven populations (20/site) in central Mexico. We identified 39 gall-inducing cynipid species (Cinipini), three inquiline species of galls (Synergini), and seven parasitoids of gall-inducing cynipid (Chalcidoidea), and the secondary fauna was characterized by eleven arthropod orders. We detected a positive and significant effect exerted by the altitudinal gradient on abundance, species richness, and diversity of gall-inducing cynipids, parasitoids, inquilines, and secondary fauna (order richness level). We documented positive and significant relationships between the gall-inducing cynipids and their parasitoids, inquilines, and secondary fauna in terms of species richness, diversity, and abundance of individuals. Arthropod community composition associated with gall-inducing cynipids differed among localities. This study suggests that gall-inducing cynipids in Q. rugosa act as ecosystem engineers that modify the host plant to offer a new habitat to other arthropods. Also, our results supported that Cynipid gall acts to protect the galls-associated arthropod community from unfavorable abiotic conditions throughout the altitudinal gradient.

AB  - 1. Semi-natural grasslands in Western Europe are degrading and declining. Their plant species diversity and associated fauna, such as arthropods, are decreasing fast making restoration crucial.
   2. Carabid beetles are an essential link in ecosystem functioning (e.g., through herbivory and predation) and provide important ecosystem services (e.g., pest control). As a diverse group from different trophic levels, they occupy a variety of ecological niches, making them good indicators of restoration success and habitat quality.
   3. To study how different aspects of carabid diversity change along a restoration gradient from degraded grasslands to restored semi-natural Nardus grasslands, we sampled carabid beetles in grasslands in Northern Belgium. We analysed differences in abundance, diversity and community composition and investigated carabid traits potentially influencing carabids' response to grassland restoration.
   4. Species richness did not change along the restoration gradient, but number of individuals decreased as grassland restoration time and effort increased and species composition changed, mostly caused by species turnover. As grassland restoration time and effort increased, carabid body size decreased and the proportion of dayactive carabids increased. Predators and habitat generalists were dominant along the entire gradient.
   5. Even though the target vegetation was restored, the carabid communities were not, or at least, did not possess yet traits to be expected from a restored community. The landscape in Northern Belgium might be too fragmented for larger species with low dispersal ability to recolonize restored grasslands. However, restored speciesrich grasslands are beneficial for conservation of meadow birds as day-active beetles thriving in restored grasslands are an important food source.

AB  - Top-down and bottom-up processes can mediate the structuring of biological communities. Several studies have provided separate support for those processes in pelagic and benthic compartments of reef systems but studies focusing on whole-reef processes are less common. Here, we sampled 3 'reef compartments' in the Alcatrazes Archipelago in Southeastern Brazil: benthic cover of colonial organisms, solitary organisms, and reef fish (i.e. pelagic) to identify the groups responsible for spatial community structure among reefs. A dynamic mosaic structure best defines the assemblages of each compartment, with substantial changes observed among sites over 2 consecutive years and at 2 depth strata, separated by a sharp thermocline. Changes in benthic cover of colonial organisms are largely due to the extent of the blooming of Sargassum canopies, algal turfs, and the zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum. Solitary organisms show a consistent monotonic change in the abundance of sea urchins, ascidians, and snails. Fish assemblage structure differed among reefs; however, we observed that large invertivore fish tended to concentrate in warmer water above the thermocline and small fish of different feeding habits were found in deeper and colder water in all reefs. We observed a potential strong link between the reefscape and solitary organisms, with a negative relationship between the abundance of urchins and the cover of Sargassum spp. suggesting top-down control. A second link is indicated by a positive relationship between low-lying cover composed of articulated turf and P. caribaeorum and larger invertivorous fish, suggesting bottom-up control through the provision of favorable foraging grounds.

AB  - Elevation gradient is an important factor affecting insect species composition, community structure, and the spatial pattern of diversity. At present, it is necessary to study the impact of environmental factors on the insect population structure and diversity patterns along altitudinal gradients in Guandi Mountain, China. This study revealed that altitude gradient could significantly affect the composition and distribution patterns of insect communities and the insect community showed certain differentiation characteristics with the altitude gradient in this area. Additionally, the results of redundancy analysis (RDA) and correlation analysis indicated that soil physicochemical properties were closely related to the distribution and diversity of insect taxa orders along the altitude gradient, and the soil temperature was the most significant environmental factor affecting the insect community structure and diversity on the altitude gradient. Our results suggest that the interactive effects of altitude and environmental variables play an important role in determining the community structure, distribution patterns, and diversity of insect populations.
   Understanding the distribution patterns and underlying maintenance mechanisms of insect species is a core issue in the field of insect ecology. However, research gaps remain regarding the environmental factors that determine the distribution of insect species along altitudinal gradients in Guandi Mountain, China. Here, we explored these determinants based on the distribution pattern and diversity of insect species from 1600 m to 2800 m in the Guandi Mountain, which covers all typical vegetation ecosystems in this area. Our results showed that the insect community showed certain differentiation characteristics with the altitude gradient. The results of RDA and correlation analysis also support the above speculation and indicate that soil physicochemical properties are closely related to the distribution and diversity of insect taxa orders along the altitude gradient. In addition, the soil temperature showed an obvious decreasing trend with increasing altitude, and temperature was also the most significant environmental factor affecting the insect community structure and diversity on the altitude gradient. These findings provide a reference for exploring the maintenance mechanisms affecting the structure, distribution pattern, and diversity of insect communities in mountain ecosystems, and the effects of global warming on insect communities.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a considerable threat to biodiversity worldwide. To minimize the effects of fragmen-tation, it is important to identify and conserve the existing habitat connections that facilitate dispersal and gene flow among populations. Connected populations are more resilient to the changing environment that affects local populations due to greater demographic stability and higher genetic diversity. Our study is the first attempt to identify the crucial habitats facilitating the dispersal of two key sympatric cervids -spotted deer Axis axis and sambar Rusa unicolor in central India. We use species distribution models followed by landscape pattern analyses and connectivity analyses to delineate the essential habitats. Thereafter, we estimated the relative contribution of habitats outside protected areas in maintaining the ecological network, using graph-based metrics. We then locate and predict the areas that have a high risk of human-influenced cervid mortality using a Bayesian regression model that accounts for spatial structure in the data. The results show that about 55% of the core habitats, integrated across both species, lie outside the protected areas and are important in maintaining the ecological network for these cervids. Some peripheral habitats have an increased risk of anthropogenic cervid mortality, which poses high demographic risk. There is an urgent need to regulate the nature and intensity of human activities in areas of human-wildlife coexistence to maintain habitat connectivity and ensure the survival of wildlife populations. Our results on cervids complement analyses on connectivity for large carnivores and thus enables one to account for important trophic interactions among wildlife species in land use planning.

AB  - Chinese serow (Capricornis milneedwardsii) is mainly distributed in the south of Yellow River in China, which has been listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, the reference genome of serow has not been reported and its taxonomic status is still unclear. Here, we first constructed a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome of C. milneedwardsii using PacBio long HiFi reads combined with Hi-C technology. The assembled genome was similar to 2.83 Gb in size, with a contig N50 of 100.96 Mb and scaffold N50 of 112.75 Mb, which were anchored onto 24 chromosomes. Furthermore, we found that the Chinese serow was more closely related to muskox, which diverged from similar to 4.85 million years ago (Mya). Compared to the karyotype of goat (2n = 60), we found the Chinese serow (2n = 48) experienced six chromosome fusions, which resulted in the formation of six central centromere chromosomes. We also identified two positively selected genes (MYH6 and DCSTAMP) specific to Chinese serow, which were involved in 'viral myocarditis' and 'Cardiac muscle contraction'. Interestingly, compared to other Caprinae animals, the MYH6 protein of Chinese serow occurred two mutations (E1520S and G1521S), which might be related to hypoxia tolerance. The high-quality reference genome of C. milneedwardsii provides a valuable information for protection of serows and insights into its evolution.

AB  - Wild lupine (Lupinus perennis) is a perennial plant originally found primarily throughout the United States and Canada in oak savannas, which are considered an ecotone between prairie and forest. Because of primary habitat loss, this early successional plant is declining and now persists in managed edge habitats such as power line rights-of-way and roadsides across much of its range. Many edge populations of wild lupine are small and isolated, which can hinder the reproduction of this pollinator-dependent plant. Here, we synthesize current literature about the biology and management of wild lupine and associated plants and insects. We also highlight current gaps of knowledge to guide future research on wild lupine and, more generally, on savanna-like habitats. The information provided here on lupine serves as a case study for how edge habitat conserves rare plant species reliant on disturbance. Overall, habitat characteristics that seem best for wild lupine include a gradient of canopy cover from moderate to open, well-drained soils, and a low abundance of understory woody plants. Land management, including prescribed burning, mowing, and mechanical thinning, can promote the conservation of wild lupine and other forest edge plants. However, additional research in regards to ideal management regimes and intensity is needed to further plant conservation in forest edge habitat.

AB  - We examine the main drivers that may elevate biomass and biodiversity of non-chemosynthetic benthic megafauna of the lower bathyal (800-3500m depth) of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the North Atlantic Ocean (MAR). Specifically: 1. Primary production in surface waters (10 degrees-48 degrees N) from remote sensing data 2002-2020 over the MAR was not significantly different from abyssal regions to the east and west. We reject the hypothesis that presence of a mid ocean ridge may enhance surface primary production. 2. The quantity of particulate organic matter reaching the sea floor was estimated as a proportion of surface export production scaled by bathymetry. Flux was 1.3 to 3.0 times greater on the MAR as a function of shorter vertical transport distance from the surface than on adjacent abyssal regions. 3. Depth variation effect on species richness. Demersal fishes living between 41 degrees and 60 degrees N showed a maximum of species richness at 2000 m depth and linear increase in regional (Gamma) diversity of 32 species per 1,000 m elevation of the MAR above the abyss. Elevated topography provides niches for species that cannot otherwise survive. 4. Substrate heterogeneity. The MAR >95% covered with soft sediment with frequent hard rocky patches spaced at a mean nearest neighbour distance of <500 m. Over 90% were <1 km apart. Animals are readily able to disperse between such patches increasing biodiversity through the additive effect of soft and hard substrate fauna on the MAR. 5. Presence of a biogeographic overlap zone. The MAR harbours bathyal species known from Western Atlantic and Eastern Atlantic continental slopes with meridional asymmetry resulting in bias toward predominance of Eastern species. The mix of species contributes to increased diversity to the east of the MAR. Multiple factors support increase in biomass and biodiversity on the MAR. Biological data are almost entirely absent from 12 degrees to 33 degrees N, the part of the MAR which may be mined for polymetallic sulphide ore deposits. This study enables some predictions of biomass and biodiversity but there is urgent need for intensive biological sampling across the MAR throughout the proposed mining areas south of the Azores.

AB  - Livestock grazing is a major driver shaping grassland biodiversity, functioning and stability. Whether grazing impacts on grassland ecosystems are scale-dependent remains unclear. Here, we conducted a sheep-grazing experiment in a temperate grassland to test grazing effects on the temporal stability of productivity across scales. We found that grazing increased species stability but substantially decreased local community stability due to reduced asynchronous dynamics among species within communities. The negative effect of grazing on local community stability propagated to reduce stability at larger spatial scales. By decreasing biodiversity both within and across communities, grazing reduced biological insurance effects and hence the upscaling of stability from species to communities and further to larger spatial scales. Our study provides the first evidence for the scale dependence of grazing effects on grassland stability through biodiversity. We suggest that ecosystem management should strive to maintain biodiversity across scales to achieve sustainability of grassland ecosystem functions and services.

AB  - Many South American dry woodlands lack good historical or paleoecological baseline data to inform restoration and conservation. However, functionalist approaches such as those popularized by rewilding suggest that functional interactions producing target ecosystem processes are valid even without data confirming compositionalist values such as a long coevolutionary histories or known historical range overlaps of target species. In central Chile, the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) has been extirpated but is known to browse trees in other regions of South America, and the tree Vachellia [Acacia] caven shows adaptations to browsing but has no extant browsers within its Chilean range. Both species are native to Chile but there are no data to assess their historical levels of interaction. Here we test the hypothesis that they can act as mutual "Eltonian proxy" species: interacting species for which we lack sufficient data (the Eltonian shortfall) to prove they are not proxies. Specifically we predict that they have complementary adaptations such that guanacos will browse Vachellia [Acacia] caven and the latter will show adaptive responses to their browsing. We introduced five guanacos into an enclosure of Vachellia [Acacia] caven "espinal" woodland, and over two years measured the growth responses of individual branches, compared to branches of trees in an area without browsing. We predicted that Vachellia [Acacia] caven would show compensatory growth in response to guanaco browsing resulting in an increase in branching. Guanacos browsed throughout the two years. In the presence of guanaco browsing, Vachellia [Acacia] caven branches grew longer, grew more sub-branches, and showed more densely streamlined branch architectures. These results indicate that guanacos could be used to substitute anthropogenic pruning as a restoration and management technique in Vachellia [Acacia] caven "espinal" woodlands. However, other extinct megaherbivores or extirpated deer may also be key components of a past herbivore community to which Vachellia [Acacia] caven was adapted. Further attention to a network of multiple interacting browsers, and their indirect and nontrophic effects, is an area for further research.

AB  - Temperature generally drives latitudinal patterns in the strength of trophic interactions, including consumption rates. However, local community and other environmental conditions might also affect consumption, disrupting latitudinal gradients, which results in complex large-scale patterns. This study assessed the relative effect of environmental variables and local consumer communities on predation and herbivory along more than 22 degrees of latitude (similar to 2500 km) of the Chilean coast. Consumption assays with animal prey (porcellanid crabs and squidpops) and the kelp Lessonia spp. were used to assess predation (after 2 h and 24 h) and herbivory (after 24 h) at 12 study sites where important environmental variables (seawater characteristics, habitat features and consumer community characteristics) were measured. For each prey type, we aimed to identify the variables that best explained variation in consumption. Predation rates were positively related to temperature, but also with dissolved oxygen and higher salinities, all variables that are thought to favour higher metabolic rates in consumers. Local habitat characteristics (i.e. higher bare rock cover) negatively affected predation rates on porcellanid crabs, likely because large predatory fish feeding on crabs (which also explain higher crab consumption) are less abundant in seaweed-free areas (kelp or understory algae). There was a decrease in herbivory with higher understorey algae cover, possibly due to the presence of alternative, more palatable seaweeds. The fact that the offered kelp blades were not consumed at latitudes where phlorotannin contents were very high suggests a relationship between consumption and seaweed palatability. Since many of the explanatory variables did not show a strict latitudinal trend, large-scale consumption patterns can vary with sources of local variation that affect the consumer metabolism, foraging efficiency and consumption pressure.

AB  - Despite their significance, how interactions of plant diversity at multiple spatial scales and soil microbial stoichiometry alter a series of ecosystem functions (multifunctionality, EMF) in response to anthropogenic nitrogen (N) input and herbivores are poorly known. We conducted a 17-year sheep grazing experiment with 6-year N addition to explore the impacts of grazing (0, 2.7, 5.3 and 8.7 sheep ha(-1)) and N addition (N0, N5, N10 and N20, i.e., 0, 5, 10 and 20 g N m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) on grassland functions and EMF via changes in plant alpha-and beta-diversity, and carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) of soil microbes in a typical steppe. The results show that grazing or N addition alone significantly affected EMF with a treatment order of 2.7 and 8.7 sheep ha(-1) > 0 and 5.3 sheep ha(-1) for grazing intensity or N5 > N10 and N20 > N0 for N addition, which resulted in a significant higher EMF in the combination treatment of 2.7 sheep ha(-1) and 5 g N m(-2) yr(-1). Plant alpha-and beta-diversity, and soil microbial C:N were the predominant drivers of changes in EMF. Grazing reduced EMF indirectly by decreasing the plant beta-diversity. N addition promoted EMF indirectly by decreasing plant alpha-diversity. In addition, lower plant alpha-diversity enhanced EMF indirectly by increasing soil microbial C:N. Our results suggest that the negative effects of herbivore on EMF were stronger at larger spatial scales compared to the smaller local communities, while N addition could maintain a higher level of EMF at smaller scales rather than at the larger ones. Our results highlight that multiple spatial scales should be considered to fully unravel the effects of herbivore and eutrophication on ecosystem functions. Our results also demonstrate the important role of soil microbe in maintaining higher grassland multifunctionality, thus we should include the soil microbial functions (i.e., C and N transformation) in further studies. Our results suggest that grazing at a low grazing intensity of 2.7 sheep ha(-1) with a low N supplementation of 5 g N m(-2) yr(-1) could maintain the most important ecosystem functions. Our work provides important insight into grassland conservation and management, aiming to maintain the capacity of grasslands to sustainably supply ecological and productive functions.

AB  - Plant diversity is known to influence ecosystem functioning, but the strength and direction of this relationship vary considerably among studies, most of which have a short duration. In communities with long-lived species, such as forests, traits of individual trees change from seedlings to maturity, and the environment in which trees grow also continually changes through stand development and forest succession. We argue that interactions between these individual and community-level effects over time will alter biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships, likely explaining at least part of the reported variation in BEF effects among studies. We outline a series of mechanisms through which temporal changes at the tree and stand levels can alter BEF relationships and illustrate these processes using data from the long-term Satakunta forest diversity experiments in Finland. We argue that long-term forest diversity experiments are essential to robustly characterize temporal dynamics emerging from the complex interplay between plant functional traits and environmental conditions over time. These experiments can provide critical insights for predicting the consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning and service provisioning over time.

AB  - Outbreaks of defoliator insects are important natural disturbances in boreal forests, but their increasing frequency under warming climate conditions is of concern. Outbreak events can shape ecosystem dynamics with cascading effects through trophic networks. Caterpillar defoliation can alter tree physiology, increase sunlight to the understory, and result in the deposition of large amounts of leaf litter and caterpillar frass to the forest floor. These modifications can thus affect soil organisms through direct (e.g., changes in soil temperature or moisture) or indirect (e.g., changes in detrital and root food webs) mechanisms. We assessed whether a recent (2015 to 2017) outbreak of the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) at the Lake Duparquet Teaching and Research Forest (Abitibi, QC, Canada) affected soil springtail communities, abundant microarthropods in forest soils. In 2018 and 2019, we sampled litter and soil (0-10 cm depth) at eight sites each in aspen-dominated (Populus tremuloides Michx) stands that were undefoliated or had a recent defoliation history. We found no significant difference in springtail abundance (specimens cm(-2)) or alpha diversity indices between undefoliated sites and those with defoliation history. However, we observed a transient change in springtail community composition 1 year after the outbreak (2018) with the absence of Folsomia nivalis, Anurophorus sp1, and Xenylla christianseni in sites with defoliation history, but no compositional differences were observed in 2019. Certain soil nutrients (P, C, Mg, Mn) were significant predictors of springtail community composition, but soil microbial biomass was not, despite its significant decrease in sites with defoliation history. Our results show that soil springtail communities respond in the short-term to the forest tent caterpillar outbreak with compositional shifts, but seem ultimately resilient to these events.

AB  - The introduction of exotic species to new habitats has been a historical human practice, ranging from utilitarian benefits to conservation efforts. This phenomenon has intensified over time, resulting in unexpected ecological and socio-economic impacts on receiving ecosystems. The case of the North African aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) introduction in the SE Iberian Peninsula in 1970 illustrates the multifaceted consequences and complexities associated with species introduction. Aoudad's introduction can be contextualized in four categories regarding socio-economic and ecological contexts, such as assisted colonization, hunting interest, taxon substitution, and trophic rewilding. Initially, the establishment of the species was promoted, and its growth favoured. However, its expansion along with ecological and socio-economic impacts led to conservation conflicts and impacts on human activities. Over the last two decades, aoudad management has shifted focus to active population control to mitigate ecological and socio-economic risks. Such species introductions highlight the challenge of predicting ecological and socio-economic outcomes, given the limited understanding of complex ecosystem dynamics and social context changes. Recent propositions regarding conservation strategies involving species introductions must heed the lessons from the aoudad case. The aoudad case emphasizes the importance of applying precautionary principles in species introductions, given the potential for irreversible consequences posed by established populations of introduced species.

AB  - In countries such as Mongolia, where globalization of the cashmere market has spurred herders to massively increase their livestock numbers, an important conservation concern is the effect of livestock encroachment on wildlife. This is especially important inside protected areas (PAs), which often represent the last refugia for threatened large mammals. We used camera-traps to sample four areas with different protection status across the Mongolian Altai Mountains, and targeted a predator-prey system composed of livestock, one large herbivore, the Siberian ibex, and two large carnivores, the snow leopard and the wolf. To determine the effect of livestock on habitat use by the wild species and their spatio-temporal co-occurrence we applied an occupancy framework explicitly developed for modelling interacting species. We recorded a widespread presence of domestic animals in the PAs, and observed avoidance of sites used by livestock by snow leopard and ibex, while wolves tended to co-occur with it. Snow leopard and ibex showed clear mutual co-occurrence, indicating a tight predator-prey relationship. Results provide evidence that, at the scale of sites sampled primarily to maximise snow leopard detections, grazing livestock interferes with wild species by inducing avoidance in snow leopards, and attraction in wolves. We suggest that (1) PAs management should enforce real grazing limitations on the ground, especially in the core areas of the parks; (2) new policies incorporating wildlife conservation into government subsidies to pastoralists should be envisaged, to prevent increasing displacement of snow leopards and ibex; (3) as wolves co-occurred with livestock, with the potential for human-wildlife conflicts, we encourage the use of a set of pre-vention techniques to mitigate livestock depredation.

AB  - Wildfires alter the composition of insect communities due to fire-induced mortality, and the post-fire vegetation and soil conditions also affect the initial re-colonisation and subsequent local emergence of adults from burnt soils. However, the impact of wildfires on re-colonisation and emergence of carrion-associated scavenging species from soils has previously been neglected. We established an experiment in an unmanaged heathland area that was affected by a severe wildfire in 2017 by adding wild boar carcasses to burnt and unburnt areas 204 days after the wildfire. Adult beetles were then collected with emergence tents at paired sites with and without carcasses and in burnt and unburnt areas from 27 April to 10 August 2018. The wildfire did not significantly affect the diversity or abundance of soil-emerging beetles. Community composition in the burnt area differed significantly from the unburnt area with higher numbers of Staphylinidae and lower numbers of phytophagous beetle families (Curculionidae and Elateridae) emerging from soils, probably reflecting the structurally simpler vegetation and reduced litter one year after the wildfire. Scavenging beetles generally colonise mammal carcasses in burnt areas to the same extent as in unburnt areas, but the post-fire conditions favoured some species with very specialised habitat preferences. A few rare species of conservation concern almost exclusively occurred in the burnt area and in most cases in combination with the presence of a carcass. This result highlights the joint importance of heathland wildfires and carcass resources for species conservation in beetle communities.

AB  - Present-day species distributions modeled with climate variables cannot provide potential future climate space for species that have contracted in range due to extirpations, regardless of abundant sample sizes within current ranges. My objective was to examine effects of range contractions on modeling of species to determine suitable space under climate change, exploring different approaches to modeling based on historical range maps. As examples of this issue, I estimated the current and future bioclimate envelopes of American bison (Bison bison) and elk (Cervus elaphus) from their current reduced ranges in the western United States compared to historical ranges immediately before extirpation. One solution for bioclimate envelope modeling is to generate presence samples from the historical range and pseudoabsence samples from outside of the historical range. By using the fullest climate space, the models identified areas of future suitable climate space that otherwise would be underpredicted (10%-27% of climate space, for these two examples) based on current ranges of species that have been extirpated from their historical range. Range contraction substantially reduced predictions of suitable climatic space under climate change. Therefore, species need to be evaluated for range extirpation before determining potential impacts of climate change on biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Seed predation and reduced predation risk with distance from conspecific trees are important influences on tree regeneration in tropical forests. Shifts in animal communities, such as an increase in rodents and other small mammals due to forest fragmentation, could alter patterns of seed predation and affect tree regeneration and community dynamics in forest fragments. We performed a field experiment on four native rainforest tree species in the Western Ghats, India, to test whether fragmentation increases seed predation by mammals and alters the distance dependence of seed predation. We monitored seed predation within open and mammal exclosure plots, near and far from the canopies of conspecific trees, in contiguous and fragmented forests. Seed predation of Cullenia exarillata, Ormosia travancorica, and Syzygium rubicundum was markedly higher in forest fragments, and more so within open plots than exclosures, while the predominantly insect-predated Acronychia pedunculata experienced similar predation in contiguous forests and fragments. Seed predation of C. exarillata and S. rubicundum was unrelated to distance from conspecific trees in open plots in both contiguous forests and fragments, in contrast to exclosures that showed marked near versus far differences in seed predation. Our findings suggest that by increasing overall seed predation risk and imposing similar seed predation risk near and far from adults variably across the tree species, small mammals could alter processes that shape tree diversity and species composition in fragmented tropical rainforests.

AB  - AimThe distribution of birds among islands is thought to be regulated by island physical geography (i.e. island area, isolation and latitude). In contrast, work on continents indicates that bird diversity is often regulated by plant diversity. Consequently, the (statistical) direct and indirect effects of physical geography on island bird distribution are poorly understood. We investigated the relative roles of physical geography and vegetation in determining island bird diversity in the South West Pacific at two taxonomic scales of resolution: total bird diversity and bird diversity within functional guilds.LocationEleven archipelagos in the South West Pacific.TaxonLand birds.MethodsWe created a dataset characterising total and functional guild diversity for land birds and seed plants (i.e. Spermatophytes) among archipelagos. We then used mediation analysis to disentangle the direct and indirect (i.e. mediated) effects of physical geography and vegetation on bird diversity.ResultsOn a broad taxonomic scale, total bird diversity was directly determined by total plant diversity, not the area, isolation or latitude of islands. On a fine taxonomic scale results differed between functional guilds. The diversity of herbivorous and frugivorous birds was directly determined by physical geography rather than plant total and trait diversity. Woody and herbaceous plant species diversity mediated the effect of physical geography on forest-dwelling, above ground nesting and ground nesting bird diversity. Granivorous, nectarivorous and grassland-dwelling bird diversities were unrelated to both physical geography and herbaceous plant diversity.Main ConclusionsPhysical geography and vegetation can have both direct and indirect effects on island bird diversity. Furthermore, relationships between physical geography, vegetation and bird diversity can vary markedly among functional guilds.

AB  - Deep-sea communities are impacted by several anthropogenic activities, such as fisheries, which still remain one of the most damaging on the marine environments in terms of biodiversity loss and habitat degradation. The north-western Ionian Sea (Central Mediterranean) experienced long-standing trawl fishing activity with the exploitation of deep-sea demersal resources. The integrate analysis with data of both benthic, demersal and benthopelagic species collected during a time series of experimental trawl survey, yearly carried out in the Ionian basin down to 800 m in depth, allowed to asses the current status of the Ionian deep-sea faunal assemblages and their potential changes overtime. Multivariate analysis and univariate indices, modelled using Generalized Additive Model (GAM) framework, confirm a depth zonation pattern of deep-sea faunal assemblages in the study area, with the presence of two distinct epibathyal and mesobathyal groups. GAM also highlighted a temporal effect on the biodiversity indices, with significant negative trends of diversity and evenness indices as well as a significant increasing of dominance one, over the study period 2012-2020. The benthic community is characterised by more generalist species and a simplified structure, with a severe depletion in habitat-former taxa whereas the demersal and benthopelagic fauna of the Ionian Sea show a general stability in the overall structure if compared with previous studies lasting over two decades. The presence of complex and heterogenous habitats unsuitable for trawl, like cold-water coral communities and canyon systems, provide Essential Fish Habitats (EFHs) for commercial species, acting as potential renewal areas for exploited resources in the neighbouring fishing grounds. These findings encourage an ecosystem-based management including spatial considerations for the objectives of biodiversity conservation combined with those of management of fishery resources.

AB  - 1. Vehicle pollution is a pervasive aspect of anthropogenic change across rural and urban habitats. The most common emissions are carbon- or nitrogen-based pollutants that may impact diverse interactions between plants and insect herbivores. However, the effects of vehicle pollution on plant-insect interactions are poorly understood. 2. Here, we combine a city-wide experiment across the Sacramento Metropolitan Area and a laboratory experiment to determine how vehicle emissions affect insect herbivory and leaf nutritional quality. 3. We demonstrate that leaf damage to a native oak species (Quercus lobata) commonly planted across the western US is substantially elevated on trees exposed to vehicle emissions. In the laboratory, caterpillars preferred leaves from highway-adjacent trees and performed better on leaves from those same trees. 4. Synthesis and applications. Together, our studies demonstrate that the heterogeneity in vehicle emissions across cities may explain highly variable patterns of insect herbivory on street trees. Our results also indicate that trees next to highways are particularly vulnerable to multiple stressors, including insect damage. To combat these effects, urban foresters may consider planting trees that are less susceptible to insect herbivory along heavily travelled roadways.

AB  - The livestock dung seed bank (DSB) plays an important role in the regeneration and sustainability of grasslands in grazing ecosystems. As global precipitation patterns change, the productivity of the above ground vegetation (AGV) in semiarid and arid regions may be substantially affected, as will both the size and composition of the livestock DSB. However, the effects of altered precipitation patterns remain to be determined. Dung was collected for three consecutive years (2018-2020) from horses, cattle and sheep in the desert region of the Qaidam basin, China. The seedling emergence method was used to examine species richness and seed density in the DSB, and the structure and composition of the DSB and the AGV were also investigated. Combined with precipitation data, a structural equation model was used to explore how precipitation affects the livestock DSB by quantifying changes in the AGV in the basin. The results showed that horses [seedling density 5.32 (2018), 6.30 (2019) and 7.44 (2020) g(-1) dung] had greater seed dispersal potential than cattle (3.91, 5.08 and 6.42 g(-1) dung) or sheep (0.88, 1.32 and 2.96 g(-1) dung), indicating that horse dung contributes the most to the AGV in the Qaidam basin. Furthermore, the seed composition of the DSB differed substantially from species of the AGV, implying that the DSB can promote the diversification of grasslands. An increase in precipitation increased both the productivity of the AGV (and hence livestock forage) and the size and composition of the DSB. These results highlight that the DSB is an essential driver of the development of grasslands in arid areas and that the indirect effect of precipitation on the livestock DSB for the regeneration and conservation of grasslands should be considered in arid regions.

AB  - Native herbivores can affect the structure and function of plant communities. Most studies of overabundant native herbivore effects on native plant communities in south-eastern Australia are observational or compare, at most, two levels of herbivory (ambient vs. none), and typically do not separate out the impacts of multiple herbivores. Several studies show that high densities of herbivores had mostly negative effects on plant regeneration and growth. These effects were usually attributed to palatability differences amongst plant species. Surprisingly, few studies have quantified vegetation responses across a gradient of herbivore density, and impacts on plant communities (i.e. species richness, composition, beta diversity) have not been well studied. Hence, there remains a need to better understand how native herbivores impact plant communities at different densities.

AB  - Fire modifies the composition and distribution of biodiversity, but the availability of broad elevational gradients for evaluating its effects is limited. Studies conducted along elevational gradients provide valuable insights into the impacts of large-scale disturbances. Due to their sensitivity to environmental changes and low palatability to invasive herbivores, bryophytes serve as effective bioindicators for analyzing disturbance levels in oceanic island ecosystems where herbivores have been introduced. Our research focused on examining how alpha and beta diversity and bryophyte species composition change along an elevational gradient from 200 to 2000 m a.s.l. in areas affected by fire 20 years ago compared to control areas that have been fire-free for at least 50 years. This study was carried out using different functional bryophyte groups in the pine forest of La Palma Island (Canary Islands), where this ecosystem is well represented. The findings revealed the sensitivity of the Canarian pine forest ecosystem to fire. Pine forest areas burnt 20 years ago were significantly poorer in bryophyte species than those in areas free from fire for at least 50 years. alpha-diversity is proposed as the most indicative parameter for analyzing the impacts of fire on the studied functional groups along the entire gradient analyses. However, beta-diversity is more dependent on environmental conditions, increasing in the wettest pine forests. The results suggest that the fire impacts vary depending on the specific functional group of bryophytes and the type of pine forest.

AB  - Hunter populations can provide a tremendous workforce of citizen scientists afield when queried for data. Soliciting incidental observations of non-target species from hunters may be a relatively important but untapped population monitoring resource in systems where hunter effort is common and widespread. During 2012-2016, we queried hunters of deer and elk for observations of a non-target species, moose, across their statewide distribution in Montana. We analysed data in an abundance-detection framework with n-mixture models and evaluated the effects of covariates such as hunter effort, survey response totals, weekly session and forest cover on detection probability before using models to predict moose abundance. We collected an average of 3409 moose observations per year and our best n-mixture model included effects of week, year (number of responses), site (proportionate forest cover) and site-year (hunter effort) on detection probability, as well as an effect of site (area of forest and shrub habitat) on abundance. Density estimates averaged 0.099 (range 0.002-0.439) moose/km(2) across sites or 0.200 (range 0.017-0.799) moose/km(2) when limited to density within shrub and forest cover specifically. Statewide abundance totals across the 5-year study period averaged 10,755 (range 9925-11,620). Goodness-of-fit tests showed that models were identifiable and overdispersion of the data was low, yet some caution is still warranted when extrapolating these data to abundance estimates. Querying a sample of deer-elk hunters for observations of a non-target species yielded thousands of spatially georeferenced detections per year and analysis in a temporally structured framework yielded estimates of both detection probability and abundance. Abundance estimates at this scale are unprecedented for moose in Montana and are encouraging for long-term monitoring over space and time.

AB  - Despite being absent from most regions of the contemporary world, megafauna species dominated the dynamics of ecological communities until the late Pleistocene. Trophic rewilding is a promising approach to restoring megafauna interactions, their functional roles and the consequent trophic cascades. Unintentional rewilding with large non-native herbivores, such as equids, offers outstanding opportunities for ecologists to understand the outcomes of using replacement species to restore the ecological functions of extinct native megafauna. In this context, it is relevant to understand the extent to which extant native predators can impose top-down control on non-native megaherbivores and how trophic cascades arising from novel predator- prey interactions influences biodiversity and ecosystem functions. In Death Valley National Park (United States), Lundgren et al. depict a natural experiment showing compelling evidence of native cougars overcoming ecological naivet & eacute;& mdash; that is, the mismatches between predator and prey species that do not share a common evolutionary history & mdash; and are now successfully preying on younger individuals of feral donkeys. These non-native donkeys, whose growing wild populations threaten the native biota, became cougars' most frequent dietary item in that region. In areas with cougars, donkeys changed their spatiotemporal foraging patterns, becoming diurnal and less active. On the other hand, donkeys remain more active and forage throughout the day and night in areas without cougars. The cougar- donkey interaction triggered a behaviourally mediated trophic cascade emerging from a "landscape of fear', that is, from the perception of spatial heterogeneity in predation risk by donkeys. Areas with cougars have less trampled ground, fewer donkey trails, and much more canopy cover and vegetation around water. Donkeys concentrate their activity mostly in topologically plain terrains lacking proper sites for the ambush behaviour of cougars and with more intense human presence, likely acting as a shield against the predators. Lundgren et al. present a promising model system for studying the effects of fearful grazers on community structure in the context of novel ecological interactions being established in the Anthropocene. Whether the emerging cascade is transient or persistent, the relative roles of consumptive and non-consumptive effects as underlying mechanisms, and their consequences for food web structure, functioning and stability, are questions of general interest. Addressing them can help us to elucidate the costs and benefits of using non-native megaherbivores in the functional restoration of permanently invaded ecosystems.

AB  - China announced the development of its first 5 national parks in 2021, the primary objective of which is to conserve the natural state and integrity of natural ecosystems. As such, ecosystem services and biodiversity levels are crucial assessment factors for the parks. For Giant Panda National Park (GPNP), we evaluated ecological sensitivity based on water and soil erosion and rocky desertification; ecosystem services based on headwater conservation, soil and water conservation, and biodiversity conservation; and presence of giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and sympatric species (e.g., takin [Budorcas taxicolor], Asiatic black bear [Ursus thibetanus]) habitat suitability derived from niche modeling to identify the ecosystem status and assess ecological problems within the park. From our results, we proposed ecologically critical areas to target to meet the park's goals. The suitable habitat for pandas and sympatric species encompassed 62.98% of the park and occurred mainly in the Minshan Mountains. One quarter of the total area (25.67%) contained areas important for ecosystem services. Ecologically sensitive and extremely sensitive areas covered 88.78% of the park and were distributed mainly in Qionglaishan and Minshan Mountains. This coverage indicated that there was much habitat for pandas and sympatric species but that the ecosystems in GPNP are vulnerable. Therefore, ecologically critical areas encompassed all suitable habitats for all the species examined and areas important and extremely important to ecosystem service provision,ecologically sensitive and extremely sensitive areas, encompassed 15.17% of panda habitat, accounted for 16.37% of the GPNP area, and were distributed mainly in the Minshan Mountains. Our results indicated where conservation efforts should be focused in the park and that by identifying ecologically critical areas managers can provide targeted protection for wildlife habitat and ecosystems and effectively and efficiently protect the composite ecosystem. Additionally, our methods can be used to inform development of new national parks.

AB  - Monitoring wildlife population trends is essential for resource management and invasive species control, but monitoring data are hard to acquire. Citizen science projects may monitor species occurrence patterns in time and space in a cost-effective way. A systematic management program of exotic wild boar (Sus scrofa) and axis deer (Axis axis) in a protected area of northeastern Argentina (El Palmar National Park) provided a framework for implementing a wildlife monitoring system based on park-affiliated hunters. We assessed the level of agreement between three indices of relative abundance: hunter sightings and camera trapping for wild boar, axis deer, capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), brown brocket deer (Mazama guazoubira), and crab-eating and pampas foxes combined (Cerdocyon thous and (Lycalopex gymnocercus), and catch per unit effort (CPUE) for both exotic ungulates only. Most (74%) hunting parties participated in the monitoring program and contributed to its sustainability. Bland-Altman plots displayed large levels of agreement between methods across species, with larger systematic differences between sighting and camera-trapping indices for native species. Restricting camera-trapping to the same time window as hunter sightings substantially increased the agreement between methods across species. Sighting and CPUE indices revealed similar temporal trends and large variations in spatial patterns between species. Comparison of the number of sighted and killed exotic ungulates indicated that, on average, 17% of wild boar and 75% of axis deer escaped hunters. The three indices were appropriate metrics for management purposes and corroborated the sustained, high-level abundance of axis deer and low numbers of wild boar in recent years.

AB  - Disentangling the relative influence of background versus disturbance related mortality on forest demography is crucial for understanding long-term dynamics and predicting the influence of global change on forests. Quantifying the rates and drivers of tree demography requires direct observations of tree populations over multiple decades, yet such studies are rare in old-growth forest, particularly in the temperate zone of Europe. We use multi-decade (1980-2020) monitoring of permanent plots, including observations of mode of mortality and disturbance events, to quantify rates and drivers of tree demography across a network of old-growth remnants in temperate mountain forests of Slovenia. Annual rates of mortality and recruitment varied markedly among sites and over time; census intervals that captured intermediate severity canopy disturbances caused subtle peaks in annual mortality (e.g., >2%/year), while rates of background mortality in non-disturbed intervals averaged about 1%/year. Roughly half of the trees died from modes of mortality associated with disturbance (i.e., uprooting or snapped-alive). Results of a Bayesian multilevel model indicate that beech (Fagus sylvatica) had a higher likelihood of disturbance related mortality compared to fir (Abies alba), which mainly died standing, and there was a notable increase in the odds of disturbance mortality with increasing diameter for all species. Annual recruitment rates were consistently low at sites (<0.5%) that lacked evidence of disturbance, but often exceeded 3% on sites with higher levels of past canopy mortality. Recruitment was dominated by beech on sites with more diffuse background mortality, while the less shade tolerant maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) recruited following known disturbance events. Our study highlights the important role of stand-scale, partial canopy disturbance for long-term forest demography. These results suggest that subtle climate-driven changes in the regime of intermediate severity disturbances could have an important influence on future forest dynamics and warrant attention.

AB  - There is a need to revise the framework used to project species risks under climate change (CC) and land-use/cover change (LUCC) scenarios. We built a CC risk index using the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change framework, where risk is a function of vulnerability (sensitivity and adaptive capacity), exposure, and hazard. We incorporated future LUCC scenarios as part of the exposure component. We combined a trait-based approach based on biological characteristics of species with a correlative approach based on ecological niche modeling, assigning risk scores to species, taxonomic (orders), and functional (trophic, body size, and locomotion) groups of terrestrial mammals occurring in Mexico. We identified 15 species projected to lose their climatic suitability. Of the 11 taxonomic orders, Eulipotyphla, Didelphimorphia, Artiodactyla, and Lagomorpha had the highest risk scores. Of the 19 trophic groups, piscivores, insectivores under canopy, frugivores-granivores, herbivores browser, and myrmecophagous had the highest risk scores. Of the five body-sized groups, large-sized species (>15 kg) had highest risk scores. Of the seven locomotion groups, arboreal and semi-aquatics had highest risk scores. CC and LUCC scenarios reduced suitable areas of species potential distributions by 37.5% (with CC), and 51% (with CC and LUCC) under a limited full-dispersal assumption. Reductions in suitable areas of species potential distributions increased to 50.2% (with CC), and 52.4% (with CC and LUCC) under a non-dispersal assumption. Species-rich areas (>75% species) projected 36% (with CC) and 57% (with CC and LUCC) reductions in suitability for 2070. Shifts in climatic suitability projections of species-rich areas increased in number of species in northeast and southeast Mexico and decreased in northwest and southern Mexico, suggesting important species turnover. High-risk projections under future CC and LUCC scenarios for species, taxonomic, and functional group diversities, and species-rich areas of terrestrial mammals highlight trends in different impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem function.

AB  - Extreme drought and insect herbivores can affect plant community non-independently, and their interaction may be influenced by drought pattern. However, few studies have explored the interaction on plant community structure, and no study has investigated whether the interaction is affected by drought pattern. We explored the interaction of different extreme drought patterns and insect herbivores with a manipulated experiment in a semiarid grassland. There were three treatments for drought: control-ambient precipitation; chronic drought-66% precipitation reduction in the growing season (May-August); intense drought-completely exclusion of rain events from June to July. Herbivores removal and present treatments were imposed within each drought treatment. We found that although herbivores had no significant effects on the impacts of droughts on total species richness, it alleviated the impacts of chronic drought on total cover, and the alleviating role decreased under intense drought. Comparing with intense drought, more increasing of grass cover led to more alleviation under chronic drought associated with the decrease of forb which has low leaf carbon and dry matter content, along with high starch, calcium, magnesium and manganese concentration. These results indicate that the interaction of drought and herbivores is affected by drought pattern, and the changes in leaf traits that reduce herbivores feeding in grass might alleviate the impact of drought on grassland.

AB  - Consumers, including megaherbivores and fire, are considered important limiting forces for woody plants and canopy closure in African savannas. However, climatic events like drought can also play a significant role in limiting trees and maintaining tree-grass coexistence in savannas. The extent to which top-down control (e.g. megaherbivores) and bottom-up resource limitation through drought and competition interact to influence savanna tree mortality and woody structure is unclear. Here, we compared the change in the number of large trees before and after a severe drought in a savanna with elephants (Loxodonta africana) and one without elephants. Elephants and drought both limited the number of large trees at our sites, but contrary to our predictions, there was no interactive effect of these drivers on overall changes in tree densities. However, there was a synergistic effect on the dominant tree species, Senegalia nigrescens, such that tree loss post-drought was greater where elephants were present compared to where they were absent. Hence, our results suggest that species-specific differences in drought resistance, as well as density-dependent factors, likely impact the severity of drought effects on savanna tree communities. In savannas, drought has the potential to exert strong control on tree survival and prevent canopy closure, thus partially filling the role of megaherbivores in limiting large trees when these consumers are absent. As drought severity and frequency are predicted to increase in the future, the influence of drought on savanna vegetation structure becomes increasingly important to consider.

AB  - The consequences of warming-induced 'shrubification' on Arctic soil carbon storage are receiving increased attention, as the majority of ecosystem carbon in these systems is stored in soils. Soil carbon cycles in these ecosystems are usually tightly coupled with nitrogen availability. Soil microbial responses to 'shrubification' may depend on the traits of the shrub species that increase in response to warming. Increase in deciduous shrubs such as Betula nana likely promotes a loss of soil carbon, whereas the opposite may be true if evergreen shrubs such as Empetrum hermaphroditum increase. We analyzed soil organic matter stocks and C-13 NMR fractions, microbial CO2 respiration, biomass, extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs), and their association with shrub density in northern Sweden after 20 years of experimental warming using open top chambers (OTCs). Our study sites were located in a tundra heath that stores high soil carbon quantities and where the OTCs had increased deciduous shrubs, and in a mountain birch forest that stores lower soil carbon quantities and where the OTCs had increased evergreen shrubs. We predicted that organic matter stocks should be lower and respiration and EEAs higher inside the OTCs than untreated plots in the tundra, whereas no effect should be detected in the forest. Soil organic matter stocks and C-13 NMR fractions remained unaffected at both sites. When expressed as per gram microbial biomass, respiration and EEAs for carbohydrate and chitin degradation were higher inside the OTCs, and contrasting our prediction, this effect was stronger in the forest. Unexpectedly, the OTCs also led to a substantially lower microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen irrespective of habitat. The decline in the microbial biomass counteracted increased activities resulting in no effect of the OTCs on respiration and a lower phenol oxidase activity per gram soil. Microbial biomass nitrogen correlated negatively with evergreen shrub density at both sites, indicating that 'shrubification' may have intensified nutrient competition between plants and soil microorganisms. Nutrient limitation could also underlie increased respiration per gram microbial biomass through limiting C assimilation into biomass. We hypothesize that increasing nutrient immobilization into long-lived evergreen shrubs could over time induce microbial nutrient limitation that contributes to a stability of accumulated soil organic matter stocks under climate warming.

AB  - Investigating the impact of ecological factors on sex- and age-specific vital rates is essential to understand animal population dynamics and detect the potential for interactions between sympatric species. We used block count data and autoregressive linear models to investigate variation in birth rate, kid survival, female survival, and male survival in a population of Alpine chamois Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra monitored over 27 years within the Stelvio National Park, Central Italian Alps, as function of climatic variables, density dependence, and interspecific competition with red deer Cervus elaphus. We also used path analysis to assess the indirect effect of deer abundance on chamois growth rate mediated by each demographic parameter. Based on previous findings, we predicted that birth rate at [t] would negatively relate to red deer abundance at year [t - 1]; survival rates between [t] and [t + 1] would negatively relate to red deer abundance at year [t - 1] and to the interactive effect of winter precipitation at [t + 1] and chamois density at [t]. Our results showed that birth rate was positively related to spring-summer precipitation in the previous year, but this effect was hampered by increasing red deer abundance. Kid and female survival rates were negatively related to the combined effect of chamois abundance and winter precipitation. Male and female survival rates were negatively related to lagged red deer abundance. The path analysis supported a negative indirect effect of red deer abundance on chamois growth rate mediated by birth rate and female survival. Our results suggest that chamois population dynamics was largely explained by the synergistic effect of density dependence and winter harshness, as well as by interspecific competition with red deer, whose effects were seemingly stronger on the kid-female segment of the population.

AB  - Litter decomposition plays a key role in the cycling and storage of nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems. However, very little is known about decomposition processes and their underlying drivers in tropical dry forests, particularly in human-modified landscapes. Here, we evaluate decomposition rates and nutrient concentrations and stocks in the litter of a Caatinga dry forest chronosequence, in northeast Brazil. Litter decomposition was monitored for a year across forest stands of varying ages and old-growth forests. The litter decomposition rate was highly variable across forest stands, although on average decomposition occurred slowly, with approximately 50% of the initial litter mass still present after one year. The decomposition rate is responsive to forest type and negatively affected by chronic disturbance. Litter nutrient concentration decreased along the decomposition process, exhibiting a nutrient-specific mineralization rate. Response to drivers was also nutrient specific, with precipitation and chronic disturbances playing prominent roles. Nutrient stocks in the remaining litter were higher in old-growth forests, and final stocks of certain nutrients also responded to multiple drivers. Our results suggest that the Caatinga dry forest experiences a slow rate of litter decomposition and mineralization, although rates exhibit considerable variability across forest stands and environmental conditions. Thus, chronic disturbance plays a role by either facilitating or reducing litter decomposition, mineralization rate, and the stocks transferred to the soil. Consequently, these factors have implications for nutrient availability, including goat consumption and subsequent loss of nutrients.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbance of tropical humid forests leads to habitat loss, biodiversity decline, landscape fragmentation, altered nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration, soil erosion, pest/pathogen outbreaks, among others. Nevertheless, the impact of these alterations in multitrophic interactions, including host-pathogen and vector-pathogen dynamics, is still not well understood in wild plants. This study aimed to provide insights into the main drivers for the incidence of herbivory and plant pathogen damage, specifically, into how vegetation traits at the local and landscape scale modulate such interactions. For this purpose, in the tropical forest of Calakmul (Campeche, Mexico), we characterised the foliar damage caused by herbivores and pathogens in woody vegetation of 13 sampling sites representing a gradient of forest disturbance and fragmentation in an anthropogenic landscape from well preserved to highly disturbed and fragmented areas. We also evaluated how the incidence of such damage was modulated by the vegetation and landscape attributes. We found that the incidence of damage caused by larger, mobile, generalist herbivores, was more sensitive to changes in landscape configuration, while the incidence of damage caused by small and specialised herbivores with low dispersal capacity was more influenced by vegetation and landscape composition. In relation to pathogen symptoms, the herbivore-induced foliar damage seems to be the main factor related to their incidence, indicating the enormous importance of herbivorous insects in the modulation of disease dynamics across tropical vegetation, as they could be acting as vectors and/or facilitating the entry of pathogens by breaking the foliar tissue and the plant defensive barriers. The incidence of pathogen damage also responded to vegetation structure and landscape configuration; the incidence of anthracnose, black spot, and chlorosis, for example, were favoured in sites surrounded by smaller patches and a higher edge density, as well as those with a greater aggregation of semi-evergreen forest patches. Fungal pathogens were shown to be an important cause of foliar damage for many woody species. Our results indicate that an increasing transformation and fragmentation of the tropical forest of southern Mexico could reduce the degree of specialisation in plant-herbivore interactions and enhance the proliferation of generalist herbivores (chewers and scrapers) and of mobile leaf suckers, and consequently, the proliferation of some symptoms associated with fungal pathogens such as fungus black spots and anthracnose. The symptoms associated with viral and bacterial diseases and to nutrient deficiency, such as chlorosis, could also increase in the vegetation in fragmented landscapes with important consequences in the health and productivity of wild and cultivated plant species. This is a pioneering study evaluating the effect of disturbances on multitrophic interactions, offering key insights on the main drivers of the changes in herbivory interactions and incidence of plant pathogens in tropical forests.

AB  - Given the importance of protected areas for biodiversity, the growth of visitation to many areas has raised concerns about the effects of humans on wildlife. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to temporary closure of national parks in the United States, offering a pseudonatural experiment to tease apart the effects of permanent infrastructure and transient human presence on animals. We compiled GPS tracking data from 229 individuals of 10 mammal species in 14 parks and used third-order hierarchical resource selection functions to evaluate the influence of the human footprint on animal space use in 2019 and 2020. Averaged across all parks and species, animals avoided the human footprint, whether the park was open or closed. However, although animals in remote areas showed consistent avoidance, on average those in more developed areas switched from avoidance to selection when protected areas were closed. Findings varied across species: some responded consistently negatively to the footprint (wolves, mountain goats), some positively (mule deer, red fox) and others had a strong exposure-mediated response (elk, mountain lion). Furthermore, some species responded more strongly to the park closure (black bear, moose). This study advances our understanding of complex interactions between recreation and wildlife in protected areas.

AB  - Tropical coral reef fish assemblages in the South China Sea (SCS) have not been well-studied; thus, this research investigated the species richness of coral reef fishes at Pulau Bidong and the surrounding islands of Terengganu, Malaysia. Fish surveys were conducted using the Stereo-Diver Operated Video System (Stereo-DOVs) technique from July to October 2019 at 14 sites with different underwater reef structural features. A total of 8259 individuals and 52 reef fish species belonging to 14 families with a density of 23.597 ind. m(-3) were identified and counted from the surveys. Among the families, Scaridae (parrotfish-herbivore), Labridae (wrasse-invertivore), Serranidae (grouper-carnivore), Lutjanidae (snapper-carnivore), and Chaetodontidae (butterflyfish-corallivore) were commonly recognized as indicator fishes for reef health. Based on trophic groups, the proportion of herbivores was significantly highest (51%), followed by carnivores (26%), invertivores (21%) and corallivores (2%). Among the indicator species, Scarus psittacus (Scaridae-parrotfish; Common Parrotfish, 0.829 ind. m(-3)) was predominant, followed by Lutjanus lutjanus (Lutjanidae-snapper; Bigeye Snapper, 0.463 ind. m(-3)) and Thalassoma lunare (Labridae-wrasse; Moon Wrasse, 0.229 ind. m(-3)). The fish communities found at each station were 80% similar between locations. The density at each station ranged from 0.280 to 4.834 ind. m(-3), the diversity index (H ') recorded was between 2.186 and 3.492 and evenness (J ') ranged from 0.610 to 0.862. The high abundance and diversity and significant proportion of indicator fishes might indicate that the coral reef ecosystems at Pulau Bidong and surrounding islands are in good condition. This study offers significant ecological data on fish assemblages of tropical coral reef ecosystems, specifically in the SCS region on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia.

AB  - Questions Bush encroachment, (i.e. disproportionate woody vegetation increase at the cost of grassland) has negative impacts for biodiversity conservation and tourism by homogenising habitat structure and decreasing grazing and game-viewing. While herbivory, rainfall, and CO2 all influence changes in woody vegetation cover, fire has the best potential for vegetation management. Changes in fire management can either encourage or suppress bush encroachment and a better understanding of how changes in fire regime affect vegetation structure is needed. Therefore, this study addressed three questions: (a) how has woody cover changed over two decades (1999-2019); (b) what is the role of land use, rainfall, and fire in influencing woody cover change; and (c) what are the management implications? Location Bwabwata National Park (BNP), Namibia. Methods The study used a novel combination of repeat ground photography and satellite-based remote-sensing products to explore the change in woody vegetation in relation to rainfall, land use, and fire seasonality. Results Woody vegetation has increased by 13% since 1999 in BNP. Change in vegetation structure differed in the east and west of the park. Early-season burns in the east of the park were associated with an increase in trees over 3 m tall consisting primarily of Dialium englerianum, Terminalia sericea and Burkea africana. Repetitive late dry-season fires in the west of the park were associated with an increase in shrubs under 3 m dominated by Baphia massaiensis and Terminalia sericea. Conclusions Both early- and late-season fires are of value in management of bush encroachment. Early dry-season fires appear to reduce the rate of bush encroachment and contribute to maintaining a heterogeneous vegetation structure. This fire management strategy reduces wildfire risk, conserves biodiversity, and promotes tourism and is, therefore, recommended for the park.

AB  - Degradation from overgrazing of global arid rangelands is of significant concern for this widespread terrestrial ecosystem, and the people who rely on its sustainable use. Addressing this degradation requires a better understanding of how livestock removal and conservation management actions affect the rehabilitation of land condition. However, the dominant effect of climate and meteorological variability on arid vegetation makes isolating management-induced change a difficult task. We present an analytically simple method for measuring relative land condition by assessing differences in remote-sensing-derived persistent fractional vegetation between adjacent stocked and destocked regions over time. The 22-year observation period focusses on vegetation recovery at a long-established sheep station after the removal of livestock and the introduction of conservation-focussed management. The study region, in the southern Australian arid rangelands, comprises sparsely vegetated chenopod shrublands and acacia woodlands across low-lying plains. Comparison is made to immediately surrounding stocked properties in a spatial design where climate and biogeographic variables remain consistent across the study area. We found an unequivocal relative increase in vegetation cover, and reduction of bare ground cover at the destocked property that became evident approximately 8 years after a reduction in grazing pressure. Distinctly higher persistent vegetation cover was maintained, even during periods of drought. Non-photosynthetic vegetation cover was most indicative of long-term change and increased by 1.1% relative to surrounding areas. Photosynthetic vegetation cover increased by 0.5%, while bare ground cover decreased by 2.1%. These cover changes, particularly in the non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare ground components spatially coincide with the fenced boundary of the destocked property. Synthesis and applications: The ability to quantify management-related impacts in land condition using freely available remote sensing data could support improved management by all stakeholders in these regions. The method leverages readily available satellite remote sensing data in a study design that is not dependent on large geospatial and climatic datasets that are not necessarily available in remote regions.

AB  - In fragmented forests, many factors can affect plant community establishment, including abiotic factors, below-ground root competition, aboveground seed predation, and seedling herbivory. Little is known about the relative effects of biotic and abiotic factors affecting the initial stage of seedling establishment: seed gemmation and early seedling survival. Here, we carried out a root competition exclusion experiment and a herbivory (including seed predation) exclusion experiment on 11 islands in Thousand Island Lake, China, using four native woody plant species that differed in functional traits (e.g., seed mass and dominance). The dominant species on islands showed the highest seedling survival, and there was no significant linear relationship between the proportion of surviving seedlings and island area under either treatment for any species. Compared to the control and excluding root competition treatments, excluding seed predation and herbivory significantly increased seedling survival after controlling for the environmental factors. However, abiotic factors had no effect on early seedling establishment. Our results suggest that seedling regeneration of rare species in fragmented ecosystems may be limited and that seedlings may be more susceptible to predators and herbivores in fragmented ecosystems. These results have significant implications for the conservation of plant diversity in fragmented forests.

AB  - Increasingly, climate change is pushing species to the limits of their thermal tolerance, with cascading effects across ecosystems. Animals use behavior to prevent these harmful physiological states, but their need and ability to do so varies with their traits. Within species, traits such as sex and reproductive status affect heat sensitivity, perhaps eliciting differences in behavioral responses to thermal extremes. We evaluated whether sex and reproductive status affected thermoregulatory behavior and its efficacy in moose (Alces alces), a heat-sensitive endotherm that relies on thermal refuge. We expected traits associated with elevated heat load would be linked to heightened selection for thermal refuge and that differences in selection would successfully alleviate differing risks of overheating. Thus, reproductive females and males, who are more heat-sensitive, would have stronger selection for thermal refuge than non-reproductive females. We assessed selection of thermal refuge at bed sites and generated biophysical models to evaluate if selection mitigated risk of overheating. Reproductive status did not elicit differences in selection by females. The sexes, however, differed in selection of the trade-off between solar cover and cooling from wind. Females selected refuge with canopy cover and avoided wind. Males did not select cover and had weaker avoidance of wind than females. Yet, both sexes were more likely to overheat in areas of low cover, even if wind speeds were high. Hence, males had weaker selection of refuge than females despite being more likely to overheat, and life history trade-offs failed to explain the sub-optimal thermoregulatory behavior. We identify sex-specific thermoregulatory trade-offs, highlighting the disproportionate effects of climate change on certain demographic groups. Moreover, we emphasize the relevance of trait-based approaches for studying changing ecosystems.

AB  - Climate change is becoming an important driver of biodiversity loss by altering the habitat, distribution and interspecific relationships of species. Japanese yew (Taxus cuspidata) is a first class protected plant in China, which has important ecological significance and occupies a certain position in the feeding habit of wapiti (Cervus elaphus) and Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus). Due to human and animal damage, the number of Japanese yew has gradually decreased. Therefore, understanding the potential distribution of Japanese yew and the suitable areas for deer to browse on it under climate change will help to further protect these three species in Northeast China, especially migrate to more suitable areas in different scenarios in the future. From July 2021 to July 2024, we collected the information of species distribution and the variables associated with the species' ecological limits in Muling National Nature Reserve to cross-reflect the current and future distribution and feeding area of the two species to assess each other's impacts with Maximum entropy model (MaxEnt). The results showed that under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, feeding pressure, driest quarter precipitation (BIO17) and seasonal temperature variation coefficient (BIO4) were the main variables affecting the distribution of Japanese yew, and the driest quarter precipitation (BIO17) and annual precipitation (BIO12) were the main variables affecting wapiti and Siberian roe deer foraging them. Under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, the suitable area of Japanese yew and the feeding area of the two species of deer gradually decreased from 2041 to 2100. Compared with wapiti, Siberian roe deer has a greater impact on the distribution range of Japanese yew, and the suitable feeding area is wider. It is expected that the potential centroid of Japanese yew, wapiti and Siberian roe deer will migrate to higher latitudes in the future. These findings provide a scientific basis for the reserve to develop relevant measures and plans and effectively protect the three species.

AB  - In boreal forests of North America, land managers often carry out preventive treatments of forest fuel for the protection of human infrastructure from wildfires. However, these treatments may negatively affect other ecosystem services, such as the capacity to sustain wildlife populations. Here, we examine the efficacy of a strategy aimed at preserving a critical movement corridor for boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in northern Quebec, Canada, by raising high-voltage power line conductors above the forest canopy. To assess the interplay between the caribou protection objectives and a reduction in power line's exposure to wildfires, we developed an optimization model that combines the objectives of protecting the power line from wildfires via fuel treatments and maintaining a suitable movement corridor for caribou. The model combines a critical node detection (CND) problem with a habitat connectivity problem that allocates a minimum-resistance fixed-width habitat corridor between isolated wildlife refuges. Our results identify the best locations to perform fire fuel treatments to lessen the threat of fire damage to human infrastructure while maintaining a connectivity corridor for caribou in present and future climate scenarios. The selected fuel treatment locations aimed to mitigate wildfire exposure to a power line. In small-budget solutions, the exposure of power line infrastructure to wildfires was reduced by 36-39% in current climate conditions and by 20-31% in future climate, compared with no-treatment scenarios. Despite the detrimental effects of wildfire on both the industrial asset and caribou habitat, the approach provides strategies that help achieve a compromise between these two values. Such knowledge is timely to help mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on human livelihoods and natural ecosystems.

AB  - Fencing to contain livestock movement, demarcate properties, and protect economic assets has been one of the main factors restricting wildlife movement. However, research assessing the impact of fences on large mammals in southern South America is scarce. We modified livestock fences by clipping the bottom wire to enable endangered huemul deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus) to cross in and out of forest plantations. Huemul showed a preference for crossing through areas where bottom wire strands had been removed. There was also a greater crossing frequency for fences located at lower elevation. Implementation of this simple management technique increased the availability of crossing areas, thereby facilitating huemul movement. Further fence modifications must seek to improve conditions of intervening habitat where huemul live and move, and thus prevent further population decline of this threatened species.

AB  - Browsing can be an environmental stress to forest ecosystems, where the composition and structure of plant communities depend on the balance between ungulate browsing and the ability of plants to tolerate and acclimate to this stressor. Tree planting is a management tool for restoring forest whose integrity has been compromised by the intensity and repetition of browsing. This tool may be insufficient when the stress leading to forest degradation is ongoing. Balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) plantations are used on Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada) to restore winter habitat for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann, 1780). To promote natural regeneration and growth of planted firs that are the staple winter forage of deer, enclosures were temporarily erected and deer densities reduced to decrease browsing pressure. The stress induced by heavy browsing at the time of fence removal and the density of competitors in regenerating cutblocks, however, could compromise fir growth and forest recruitment. Our objective was to identify factors influencing browsing intensity and balsam fir's growth following fence removal. We aimed to identify factors influencing lateral browsing intensity and number of trunk reiterations on fir at the landscape scale, including distance and size of the surrounding forests, and at the local scale through intraspecific density-dependence and interspecific associative effects. We then sought to identify the stressors most influencing balsam fir growth among browsing variables and a neighborhood crowding index (NCI). We measured browsing intensity and growth of 114 balsam firs 8 years following planting and again 2 and 4 years after dismantling two management enclosures. At the landscape scale, our results showed that when balsam fir was more than 150 m from a forest edge, the probability of browsing was close to zero and consistently a low percentage of shelter area surrounding a focal fir led to a decrease in browsing pressure. At the local scale, intensity of lateral browsing increased with the NCI of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). Fir growth was negatively influenced by the additive effects of browsing and NCI. Finally, our results showed that 19.7% (95 %CI: 4.5%, 42.6%) of the effect of the surrounding vegetation on growth was mediated by browsing. The success of forest ecosystem restoration through planting depends on density of neighboring tree species that can generate environmental stress by influencing growth indirectly through browsing as well as directly through competition for resources.

AB  - Ecological stoichiometry assessment provides insight into the interactions between foliar-littersoil dynamics among dominant tree species and facilitates their conservation. However, little research has been carried out on such trends within mixed forest ecosystems in national forest nature reserves globally. The present study fills this knowledge gap by examining the ecological stoichiometry of dominant tree species at various altitudes in desirable nature reserves in southern China. This study concentrates on six representative plant communities, each pivotal in maintaining carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) balances, along with energy flows. The selected communities encompass two plantations comprising Cunninghamia lanceolata and Phyllostachys edulis and four natural forests, including evergreen broad-leaved forest (Manglietia conifera), evergreen deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest (Daphniphyllum macropodum and Acer davidii), deciduous broad-leaved forest consisting of Fagus longipetiolata, and coniferous forest (Tsuga chinensis). Furthermore, this study involved the measurement of C, N, P, and K contents in foliage, litter, and soil. The outcomes revealed significant variations in foliar, litter, and soil contents and stoichiometric attributes across dominant plant communities. Correlation analysis highlighted substantial positive associations between N and P contents in foliar and litter components, while soil N and P contents exhibited insignificance. Broad-leaved forests generally displayed higher leaf N and P contents compared to coniferous forests. However, exceptions observed in the N content of M. conifera and the P content of D. macropodum and F. longipetiolata. The high-altitude T. chinensis forest exhibited one of the highest ecological litter and soil ratios. Notably, T. chinensis soil demonstrated richness in N but deficiency in K, impacting foliar growth by limiting N and K availability. Additionally, the low N and P contents in litter hindered decomposition. Furthermore, the nutrient content and ratios of other nutrients remained relatively stable except for soil K and plant K, soil C: K, and litter C: K, which were consistent with homeostasis theory. These findings provide scientific evidence for nutrient cycle regulation, ecosystem protection, and valuable insights into complex ecological relationships in mixed forests.

AB  - In natural ecosystems, arthropod predation on herbivore prey is higher at lower latitudes, mirroring the latitudinal diversity gradient observed across many taxa. This pattern has not been systematically examined in human-dominated ecosystems, where frequent disturbances can shift the identity and abundance of local predators, altering predation rates from those observed in natural ecosystems. We investigated how latitude, biogeographical, and local ecological factors influenced arthropod predation in Brassica oleracea-dominated agroecosystems in 55 plots spread among 5 sites in the United States and 4 sites in Brazil, spanning at least 15 degrees latitude in each country. In both the United States and Brazil, arthropod predator attacks on sentinel model caterpillar prey were highest at the highest latitude studied and declined at lower latitudes. The rate of increased arthropod attacks per degree latitude was higher in the United States and the overall gradient was shifted poleward as compared to Brazil. PiecewiseSEM analysis revealed that aridity mediates the effect of latitude on arthropod predation and largely explains the differences in the intensity of the latitudinal gradient between study countries. Neither predator richness, predator density, nor predator resource availability predicted variation in predator attack rates. Only greater non-crop plant density drove greater predation rates, though this effect was weaker than the effect of aridity. We conclude that climatic factors rather than ecological community structure shape latitudinal arthropod predation patterns and that high levels of aridity in agroecosystems may dampen the ability of arthropod predators to provide herbivore control services as compared to natural ecosystems.

AB  - Accumulation of exported macrophytodetritus (AEM) represent unique habitats formed by the dead material originating from macrophyte ecosystems (e.g., seagrass, kelp, other seaweeds). AEM can be found everywhere, from the littoral zone to the deepest canyons, and from high to low latitudes. Seagrass AEMs are among the most common detrital accumulations found in marine environments, and sometimes include macroalgae wrack that has been ripped from the substrate. In the Mediterranean Sea, Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile litter accumulations undergo pulses of new necromass all year, particularly in autumn, when dead leaves are shed. Here, macrofauna inhabiting AEM of Calvi Bay (Corsica, France) was sampled troughout an annual cycle (four seasons). By combining gut content examination and stable isotope analysis, we aimed to assess the effect of seasonal litter pulses on the trophic ecology of the dominant macrofauna species. Litter composition showed drastic variations throughout the sampling period, with the highest leaf litter quantity and contribution to AEMs in November. Dominant detritivores, herbivores, and omnivores responded positively to this increase by ingesting more seagrass material. A Bayesian stable isotope mixing model showed that the assimilation of carbon originating from seagrasses also increased. Additionally, isotopic niche modelling showed that consumer niches shifted towards seagrass isotopic composition in November. Predators did not shift their diet, but their isotopic composition was affected by the isotopic shift of their prey, demonstrating the transfer of seagrass carbon to higher trophic levels and the shift towards dead leaf material in the entire community. This response was, therefore, a rapid (days to weeks) parallel to that of the slow (months to years) decomposition of detrital material via physical alteration and microbial decomposition. This seemingly underestimated transfer route should be better characterised to understand the role of these seagrass beds in carbon sequestration in the marine environment.

AB  - The Asian tapir Tapirus indicus population has decreased as a result of habitat destruction and degradation, illegal hunting and negative human-tapir interactions. Although this species is categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is a protected species in Indonesia, where it occurs on Sumatra, studies of its ecology and behaviour and of interactions with people remain limited. We investigated the characteristics of local communities around tapir habitat in Batang Gadis National Park and the interactions of people with tapirs, and assessed the potential for future negative interactions. This study took place in March and October 2021 in Sopotinjak and Pagar Gunung villages. We conducted interviews, using questionnaires, amongst local communities that are familiar with tapirs. The communities belong to the Mandailing Tribe, comprising farmers that frequently access the adjacent forest to support their livelihoods. Local people need protein from animals, but they do not hunt the tapir. Negative human-tapir interactions could potentially increase in the future if tapir browsing intensity in community gardens increases and farmers suffer significant economic losses. We encourage Batang Gadis National Park authorities to develop a human-tapir co-existence management system and to protect tapir habitat.

AB  - Global climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of droughts, with major impacts on tropical savannas. It has been suggested that during drought, increased soil moisture and nutrients on termite mounds could benefit plants but it is unclear how such benefits could cascade to affect insect communities.
   Here, we describe the effects of drought on vegetation structure, the cascading implications for invertebrates and how termite mounds influence such effects. We compared how changes in grass biomass affected grasshopper and ant diversity on and off Macrotermes mounds before (2012) and during a drought (2016) at two locations that experienced large variation in drought severity (Skukuza and Pretoriuskop) in the Kruger National Park, South Africa.
   The 2013-2016 drought was not ubiquitous across the study site, with rainfall decreasing at Skukuza and being above average at Pretoriuskop. However, grass biomass declined at both locations. Grasshopper abundance decreased at droughted Skukuza both on and off mounds but decreased on mounds and increased off mounds at non-droughted Pretoriuskop. Ant abundance and species richness increased at Skukuza but remained the same on mounds and decreased off mounds at Pretoriuskop.
   Our results demonstrate the spatially extensive effects of drought. Despite above average rainfall in 2016 at Pretoriuskop, grass biomass decreased, likely due to an influx of large mammalian herbivores from drought-affected areas. This decrease in grass biomass cascaded to affect grasshoppers and ants, further illustrating the effects of drought on invertebrates in adjoining areas with higher rainfall. Our grasshopper results also suggest that increased drought in savannas will contribute to overall declines in insect abundance. Moreover, our recorded increase in ant abundance was primarily in the form of increases in dominant species, illustrating how drought-induced shifts in relative abundance will likely influence ecosystem structure and function.
   Our study highlights the phenomenon of spill-over drought effects and suggests rather than mitigating drought, termite mounds can instead become the focus for more intense grazing, with important consequences for insect communities.

AB  - Empirical testing of energy maximization models has been used to clarify the drivers of resource partitioning among large herbivores. Most studies, however, have not considered that predictions of optimal diet depend on the temporal scale of maximization. This omission can hinder the effectiveness of optimality principles in elucidating animal distributions, dietary choices, and the dynamics of species coexistence. We used movement analysis and scale-dependent energy gain modeling to study how three large herbivores share resources: red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), a 120-kg grazing ruminant; zebra (Equus quagga), a 300-kg grazing nonruminant; and eland (Tragelaphus oryx), a 460-kg ruminant, mixed feeder. We found that resource partitioning was achieved through a synergy of spatial segregation and interspecies differences in habitat selection and in the temporal scale of energy maximization. Radio-collared individuals of the three species spent 95% of their time >850 m from one another. Hierarchical movement analysis revealed that red hartebeest and zebra selected grasslands within which they selected patches maximizing their daily energy gains. Selection was particularly strong for red hartebeest, as expected for a ruminant of relatively small size. Unlike the other species, eland avoided grasslands; when they ventured into grasslands, they selected patches offering high short-term energy gains at the expense of daily gains. This selection for rapid energy gain could reflect relatively high missed opportunity costs when foraging in grasslands due to the broad range of feeding opportunities for this large mixed feeder. This finding is also consistent with the notion that larger herbivores tend to face stronger constraints from resources availability than digestibility. Overall, differences in selection strength and foraging currencies among these large herbivores are consistent with allometric theory. Our study illuminates the drivers of resource partitioning that can promote the coexistence of large herbivore species, while also showing that, to provide a useful and robust basis to explain animal movement and resource partitioning, energetic models should be based on a relevant scale of energy maximization.

AB  - Grazing is a key regulator of the biodiversity of the desert steppe in Inner Mongolia and has important ecological significance for the sustainable development of underground ecosystems. In a 14-year grazing intensity experiment, we systematically explored the changes in soil nematode communities in desert steppe soils and comprehensively evaluated the optimal grazing intensity for the sustainability of the desert steppe underground ecosystem. Using high-throughput sequencing, we analyzed the soil nematode communities and their relationships with environmental factors. The 14-year grazing experiment revealed a significant impact on the diversity and composition of the soil nematode community in the surface layer (0-10 cm) and on the soil nematode community in the whole soil layer (0-20 cm). Based on LEfSe multilevel discriminant analysis, we found that the relative abundances of Acrobeles, Cephalobus, Filenchus, Aphelenchus, Longidorella, Amplimerlinius, Aporcelaimellus, Acrobeloides, Dorylaimellus, Hemicycliophora, Thonus, Alaimus, and Oxydirus changed significantly under different grazing treatments. Considering the number and function of soil nematode communities, long-term light grazing was found to significantly promote an increase in soil nematode diversity and helped maintain soil nematode community stability. We determined that the most suitable grazing intensity for the sustainability of the soil underground ecosystem of the desert steppe in Inner Mongolia is light grazing (0.91 sheep hm(-2) 0.5 yr(-1)). We have, thus, provided a tool for determining and evaluating optimal grazing intensities for sustainable soil underground ecosystems.

AB  - Gut microbiome of animals is affected by external environmental factors and can assist them in adapting to changing environments effectively. Consequently, elucidating the gut microbes of animals under different environmental conditions can provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of their adaptations to environmental change, with a particular focus on animals in extreme environments. In this study, we compared the structural and functional differences of the gut microbiome of grazing yaks between the summer and winter seasons through metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. The results indicated that the composition and function of microbes changed significantly. The study demonstrated an increase in the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and a higher ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) in winter, this process facilitated the adaptation of yaks to the consumption of low-nutrient forages in the winter. Furthermore, the network structure exhibited greater complexity in the winter. Forage nutrition exhibited a significant seasonal variation, with a notable impact on the gut microbiota. The metagenomic analysis revealed an increase in the abundance of enzymes related to amino acid metabolism, axillary activity, and mucin degradation in the winter. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the gut microbiome of grazing yaks exhibits several adaptive characteristics that facilitate better nutrient accessibility and acid the host in acclimating to the harsh winter conditions. Furthermore, our study offers novel insights into the mechanisms of highland animal adaptation to external environments from the perspective of the gut microbiome.

AB  - The desert ecosystem is an important ecological barrier to prevent desertification and maintain the stability of arid zone ecosystem and regional security. The degree of change and species composition of pioneer species during the early spring recovery of the community can be used as important indicators of regional ecology and to predict subsequent ecological stability in the early spring. Rodents serve as ecological engineers in the ecosystem through their behavior, and they influence the composition of biological communities. In this study, we analyzed the correlations between soil physicochemical properties, community assembly, plant diversity and microbial diversity in the areas disturbed by gerbils (RD) and those not disturbed by gerbils (CK) with ephemeral plants in the arid zone and comprehensively evaluated the soil quality (SQI) and ecosystem sustainability (SI). The results showed the following: (1) soil nutrients within the two different areas were significantly different owing to disturbance, and the biodiversity in the RD was greater than that in the CK, but there was low homogeneity; (2) There were significant differences in plant diversity and microbial diversity within the two different; (3) The correlation analysis of community assembly showed that the niche width of the community in RD was higher and the community composition was more affected by deterministic factors, while that in CK was the opposite; and (4) The analytical results showed that the SI and SQI in the RD were smaller than those in the CK. In conclusion, disturbance by rodents enhances biodiversity in arid areas but detrimental to the long-term development of communities. Therefore, it is important to explore the rational use of disturbance relationships to "complement the strengths and weaknesses," provide a theoretical basis for future reasonable control of disturbance, maintain the ecological development of arid areas, and improve the ecological stability of desert arid regions.

AB  - When coral cover declines, numeric responses of parrotfish can facilitate top-down control of algae and help reefs recover. Yet many parrotfish are facultative corallivores and we know surprisingly little about how their numeric or functional responses to coral decline modify their interactions with coral prey to shape their impacts on surviving corals. Here, we use benthic and fish surveys conducted in the Florida Keys more than a decade apart to assess how coral communities have changed, and how these changes have impacted parrotfish and their predation rates on corals. We found that disturbances and disease have continued to drive declines in coral cover and changes in coral community composition, but that the parrotfish abundance has not changed. In turn, while parrotfish corallivory has remained relatively constant or even declined for some coral taxa, predation on preferred branching Porites species increased 10% in frequency and, when normalized to live tissue area, > 50% in intensity. These coral-mediated shifts in predation correlated with declines in conspecific cover and are indicative of depensatory predation, which can destabilize trophic interactions and drive prey to low densities or even extinction. While coral reefs cannot recover from disturbances without robust parrotfish populations, our study suggests that parrotfish corallivory has important ramifications for coral community structure and, after prolonged degradation, the ability of some diminished coral populations to recover or persist. In a world where corals bleach annually, understanding the functional responses of corallivorous parrotfish to changes in resource abundance will be increasingly important for effective ecosystem-based management.

AB  - Carbohydrates and proteins are essential to maintain the basic functions of animals. Over the course of one year we conducted a factorial experiment to determine the influence of carbohydrate (sucrose) and protein supplementation on the thermal tolerance, trophic position, overall abundance, species richness and composition, and on the strength of the protective effects of arboreal ants on their host tree (Caryocar brasiliense). Using Azteca ants as a model we found evidence of dietary and thermal plasticity among arboreal ants as colonies supplied with protein increased their trophic level relative to colonies that received no protein. Colonies that received sucrose increased their thermal tolerance on average by 1.5 & DEG;C over a six-month period, whereas those that did not receive sucrose did not change their thermal tolerance. Overall ant abundance was lower in control trees than in those that received any nutrient addition treatment. Species richness was also lower in control trees, but those receiving sucrose presented more species than those receiving only protein. There was greater similarity in species composition between the trees that received sucrose than between these and those receiving only protein or just water as control. Trees whose ant colonies received sucrose presented lower levels of leaf damage than those that did not. Overall, these results indicate that food resources can modulate the population and community ecology of arboreal ants as well as their interaction with the host trees. Interestingly, although arboreal ants are thought to be N-limited, it was the supplementation of sucrose-not protein-that elicited most of the responses.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are an invasive species in the mainland United States, where they are responsible for a wide range of negative impacts including damage to crops, livestock depredation as well as disease transmission, destruction of property and ecosystems, and depredation of wildlife. This manuscript summarizes a recent survey-based effort to estimate wild pig damage and control costs incurred by livestock producers by state and livestock type. The survey was distributed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistical Service in the summer of 2021 to a sample of livestock producers in the 13-state region. Findings indicated that predation and disease-related damage can be substantial in certain states and for certain types of livestock. In particular, damage to livestock operations, specifically cattle (Bos taurus) operations, in Texas, USA, was substantially higher than damage in other states and types of livestock operations. However, these amounts are dwarfed by the expenditure incurred by damage to property and the rooting of pasture. When aggregating across the entire 13-state region, we estimated that damage and control costs to livestock producers summed in 2020 to an annual amount of >$650 million USD, driven by damage to property ($375.5 million USD) and the rooting of pasture ($192.9 million USD). The findings from this survey provide valuable information to estimate the full scope of the economic impact of wild pigs in the United States.

AB  - Sargassum horneri, a brown macroalga, recently invaded the California coast, including into critical foundational communities such as kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) forests. Despite its rapid spread, empirical tests that evaluate mechanisms underlying S. horneri's invasion success are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted three field experiments on temperate rocky reefs in southern California using growth as a proxy for invasion success. We first tested whether S. horneri success differed with herbivory strength and native diversity by conducting a 2factor experiment varying site (with different baseline levels of urchin densities and native algal diversity) and urchin access. We found S. horneri growth only differed among urchin treatments and not sites. We then evaluated whether S. horneri could successfully invade established algal canopies as a driver or whether it required open space as a passenger via a 2-factor experiment varying S. horneri size (small, medium, large) and canopy type (S. horneri, kelp, -canopy). We found that all S. horneri sizes grew fastest when canopy was lacking and light was high and slower in both canopy habitats with lower light; overall, small S. horneri grew slowest. Finally, we evaluated whether herbivore consumption for native species could facilitate S. horneri's invasion by conducting a 2-factor experiment varying species (M. pyrifera, S. horneri) and herbivore access. We found uncaged algae were consumed and caged algae grew, but there was no difference between species. Taken together, our results suggest that S. horneri is a "passenger" invader that will take advantage of points in time and space where light is plentiful, such as when M. pyrifera is removed via disturbance. Further, our results suggest that herbivory and native algal diversity are likely not key determining factors of the invasion success of S. horneri.

AB  - Severe thermal stress events occurring on the backdrop of globally warming oceans can result in mass coral mortality. Tracking the ability of a reef community to return to pre-disturbance composition is important to inform the likelihood of recovery or the need for active management to conserve these ecosystems. Here, we quantified annual, temporal changes in the benthic communities for the three years following mass coral mortality at Jarvis Island-an uninhabited island in the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. While Jarvis experienced catastrophic coral mortality in 2015 due to heat stress resulting from the 2015/16 El Nino, significant annual shifts were documented in the benthic community in the three years post-disturbance. Macroalgal and turf dominance of the benthos was temporary-likely reflecting the high biomass of herbivorous reef fishes post-bleaching-giving way to calcifiers such as crustose coralline algae and Halimeda, which may facilitate rather than impede coral recovery. By 2018, indications of recovery were detectable in the coral community itself as juvenile densities increased and stress-tolerant genera, such as Pavona, exceeded their pre-disturbance densities. However, densities of Montipora and Pocillopora remain low, suggesting recovery will be slow for these formerly dominant taxa. Collectively, the assemblage and taxon-specific shifts observed in the benthic and coral community support cautious optimism for the potential recovery of Jarvis Island's coral reefs to their pre-disturbance state. Continued monitoring will be essential to assess whether reassembly is achieved before further climate-related disturbance events affect this reef system.

AB  - Reintroduction of species should be based on ecological knowledge, which is fundamental to enhancing the probability of success, but also in predicting the response to future changing landscapes. The addax (Addax nasomaculatus), an endangered antelope whose ecology is mostly unknown, was released in a fenced area of the Jbil National Park, Tunisia. Considering the extreme desert conditions of the area, seasonal changes should affect both habitat and diet selection. Addax occurrence, habitat selection and diet were assessed using an integrative approach, and analysed with multivariate statistics. During the wet season, preferred and avoided plant species abundance were highly correlated with addax occurrence; while in the dry season, preferred plant species abundance were positively correlated with addax presence. Micro-histological analysis of faecal samples indicated differences in diet between seasons. The integrative approach proposed represents a useful contribution for decision-making in the scope of reintroduction programmes and habitat restoration measures, by facilitating the assessment of habitat suitability for endangered antelopes in arid environments.

AB  - While migrating, animals make directionally persistent movements and may only respond to human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC), such as climate and land-use change, once a threshold of HIREC is surpassed. In contrast, animals on other seasonal ranges (e.g., winter range) make more localized and tortuous movements while foraging and may have the flexibility to adjust the location of their range and the intensity of use within it to minimize interactions with HIREC. Because of these seasonal differences in movement, animals on seasonal ranges should avoid areas that contain any level of HIREC, however, during migration, animals should use areas that contain low levels of HIREC, avoiding it only once a threshold of HIREC has been surpassed. We tested this hypothesis using a decade of GPS collar data collected from migratory mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus; n = 56 migration, 143 winter) and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana; n 70 migration, 89 winter) that winter on and migrate through a natural gas field in western Wyoming. Using surface disturbance caused by well pads and roads as an index of HIREC, we evaluated behavioral responses across three spatial scales during winter and migration seasons. During migration, both species tolerated low levels of disturbance. Once a disturbance threshold was surpassed, however, they avoided HIREC. For mule deer, thresholds were consistently similar to 3%, whereas thresholds for pronghorn ranged from 1% to 9.25% surface disturbance. In contrast to migration, both species generally avoided all levels of HIREC while on winter range. Our study suggests that animal responses to HIREC are mediated by season-specific movement patterns. Our results provide further evidence of ungulates avoiding human disturbance on winter range and reveal disturbance thresholds that trigger mule deer and pronghorn responses during migration: information that managers can use to maintain the ecological function of migration routes and winter ranges.

AB  - Facing the bushmeat crisis, tropical forests require effective monitoring for sustainable wildlife management. To gain credibility with local people and conservation officials, the monitoring needs indicators that comply with local knowledge and predict the available faunal resources. This study explores predictive indicators for bushmeat biomass-the total biomass of five main hunted mammals-in a Cameroonian rainforest. We employed camera trapping and the Random Encounter and Staying Time (REST) model to estimate the spatial variation in each species' population density and bushmeat biomass at three sites. We then calculated six indicators from camera-trap capture rate estimates and assessed their predictive performance for the total wild meat amount. Duikers generally increased with distance from the public road, but two red duiker species were more markedly affected by the distance than blue duikers. Spatial density patterns of brush-tailed porcupines and Emin's pouched rats differed between sites. Consequently, bushmeat biomass displayed exponential growth away from the road with varying degrees among the sites. Of the six indicators, the R/B ratio (red-to-blue duiker ratio) and the D/R ratio (duiker-to-rodent ratio) exhibited positive linear-like correlations to bushmeat biomass at all sites. The correlation lines were moderately similar across sites in the R/B ratio but largely different in the D/R ratio, suggesting that the latter is unsuitable for sharing information between neighbouring communities. Synthesis and applications. The two indicators based on captured animal composition may effectively predict the total biomass of the main target species for bushmeat hunting, given a reasonably large sample size. The R/B ratio (red duikers/blue duikers) is recommended as a first choice; the D/R ratio (duikers/rodents) can be a good alternative when information sharing is not essential. Because local hunters are aware of depletion-related changes in species composition of caught animals, these indices may be effectively incorporated into community-based wildlife monitoring.

AB  - In this study we have compiled the information from official databases about Iberian ibex, Capra pyrenaica, hunting yields, hunting trophies and hunting licenses in the Spanish regions where the species is present and hunted. Such quotas showed an increasing trend between 2005-2021 and, on average, during this period, approximate to 6400 animals were yearly harvested. Despite this number decreased in 2019 and 2020 (in this last year, mainly due to the lock down caused by the COVID pandemia), the annual quota raised, reaching over 12,000 ibexes in 2021. The number of trophies increased since the 1970s and peaked in the period 2001-2005, and then declined during the period 2006-2020. At national level, the number of hunting licenses decreased from 2006 to 2021 by a 36.5%. The regional average hunting yield was significantly correlated with a regional-based ibex abundance estimation. The current situation of continued population increase together with the trophy reduction might suggest that the overall population is exceeding the carrying capacity. In this context, if hunting activity was one of the main factors involved in local extinction of the species, currently it should be considered a tool for sustainable managing of ibex populations in an scenario of increasing demographic trends and generalized absence of predators.

AB  - The Qilian Mountain Grassland is an important animal husbandry production base in northwestern China. Horses, cattle, and sheep are the main livestock, which are widely distributed in the desert grasslands and alpine meadows around the Qilian Mountains. Grazing livestock produce large amounts of feces, and the germinable seeds in feces constitute the seed banks. Research on the size, plant species composition, and distribution of livestock dung seed banks in the Qilian Mountain grasslands may help understand the interactions between grass species and livestock and inform the comprehensive management practices for grazing livestock. In mid-October 2018, we collected the dung of horses, cattle, and sheep in the alpine meadows and desert grasslands of the Qilian Mountains and estimated the composition and size of the dung seed bank by the greenhouse germination method. Seeds of aboveground vegetation in the same location were also collected to determine the relationships between the size and composition of dung seed banks and the seed traits (i.e., mass and shape). A total of 30 plant species germinated from the dung seed banks of the three livestock species, of which 22 species (73%) were perennial. The seedling densities for horse, cattle, and sheep dung were 11.91, 10.80, and 7.60 seedlings per gram dung, respectively. The species richness, species diversity, and Jaccard coefficients of similarity between dung seedling and aboveground vegetation of horse dung were significantly greater than that of cattle and sheep dung. Regression analyses indicated that medium-sized (10-30 mg) and spherical (0.04-0.10 shape index) seeds had the greatest germination potential. Our study suggests that, of the three livestock species tested, the horse dung seed bank contributes most to grassland recovery and restoration of the Qilian Mountains. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - As the number of humans living in cities has grown, interest in the value of community gardens to provide agricultural products has increased. However, neighborhoods with different land cover patterns and socioeconomic characteristics often differ in their ecological attributes, leading to potential differences in biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services (e.g., pollination and pest control). Here we ask, how do impervious surface and socioeconomic features of the urban matrix around community gardens impact arthropod biodiversity and pollination and pest control services? We collected arthropods (insects, arachnids, myriapods, and isopods) across community gardens in Boulder Co., CO, and used experimental jalape & ntilde;o pepper plants as a sentinel crop to measure herbivory damage and pollination services. We categorized arthropods into functional guilds to see how impervious surface and neighborhood wealth in the urban matrix surrounding a site impacts the abundance of three focal groups - pollinators, herbivorous pests, and predators. We also looked at how bee Hill-Simpson diversity responded to these variables. Through structural equation modeling, we found that fruit size increased as bee biodiversity increased, and bee biodiversity and overall pollinator abundance were negatively related to neighborhood wealth. Additionally, pollinator abundance was lower in gardens surrounded by higher amounts of impervious surfaces. Neighborhood wealth and impervious surfaces were positively correlated with herbivore and predator abundances, but these abundances had no relationship with herbivory damage in our plants. This research shows that reducing the amounts of impervious surface in the urban matrix can help increase bee biodiversity and abundance and improve pollination services in urban community gardens.

AB  - Context Anthropogenic disturbance alters animal movements. Large mammals require vast areas to meet their needs, and they encounter anthropogenic disturbances frequently during daily movements. Objectives We assessed the impact of disturbance on the daily movement of two large threatened mammals, and examined the nuances of movement response to type and regeneration of disturbance across seasons. Methods We calculated daily net displacement (Euclidian distance between first and last GPS location) and sinuosity (total path length divided by displacement) of grizzly bears and caribou in west-central Alberta, Canada using GPS locations. We assessed links between daily movement and densities of roads, pipelines, seismic lines, harvest blocks, and wellsites. We also considered the effect of harvest block and seismic line regeneration based on LiDAR-derived vegetation height. Results During early winter, net displacement of caribou increased in relation to the density of wellsites and harvest blocks. Grizzly bear net displacement increased and sinuosity decreased in relation to the density of non-linear disturbances (harvest blocks, wellsites) during spring. During summer, grizzly bear net displacement increased in relation to secondary road density and decreased in relation to wellsite density. During fall, grizzly bear net displacement decreased in relation to secondary road density and increased in relation to harvest block and pipeline density. Conclusions Caribou and grizzly bears adjusted their movement in response to disturbances, but each species responded differently and in accordance with its seasonal ecology. Assessing the impacts of disturbance on threatened species across spatiotemporal scales and seasons provides useful insights for multi-species conservation strategies.

AB  - What determines the presence (or lack) of trees in grasslands is a long-standing question in ecology. Views of trees in grasslands have shifted from generally considering grasslands as degraded forests that need to be restored, to a more recent perspective on many regions as ancient grassy biomes that have long been neglected and are, according to their climate conditions, maintained as stable biomes by internal feedbacks involving fire and/or herbivory. In addition, there are currently concerns about trends of woody expansion or "encroachment" in grasslands, i.e. potential transitions between grassy and wooded ecosystems driven by local and global changes. In this study, we use high-resolution local databases and generalized additive models (GAMLSS) to analyze the factors that determine forest cover in the Campos grasslands of Uruguay in southeastern South America. We consider climate, local conditions, land use and disturbances to understand what explains the distribution of forests. Forests were associated with areas of steeper slopes, watercourses and higher surface runoff, in deeper soils with higher water availability, along a longitudinal climatic gradient, with less livestock and land-use intensity and higher human presence. We discuss how, in ancient grasslands such as this one, sub-regional geology and local topography can be permanent features that generate spatial heterogeneity in forest cover probability by mediating resource availability and influencing land use and disturbance regimes.

AB  - Reliable estimates of the distribution of species abundance are a key element in wildlife studies, but such information is usually difficult to obtain for large spatial or long temporal scales. Wildlife-vehicle collision (WVC) data is systematically registered in many countries and could be used as a proxy of population abundance if the number of WVC in each territory increase with the population abundance. However, factors such as road density or human population should be controlled to obtain accurate abundance estimations from WVC data. Here, we propose a hierarchical modeling approach using the Royle-Nichols model for detection-non-detection data to obtain population abundance indices from WVC. Relative abundance and individual detectability were modeled for two species, wild boar Sus scrofa and roe deer Capreolus capreolus at 10 x 10 km cells in mainland Spain from WVC data using environmental, anthropological and temporal covariates. For each cell, a detection was annotated if at least one WVC was recorded at each month (used as survey occasion). The predicted abundance indices were compared with raw hunting statistics at region level to assess the performance of the modeling approach. Site specific covariates such as road density or administrative region and the month of the year, affected individual detectability, with higher WVC probability between October and December for wild boar and between April and July for roe deer. Wild boar and roe deer abundance can be explained by both, bioclimatic and land cover covariates. Abundance indices obtained from WVC data were significantly positively correlated with regional raw hunting yields for both species. We presented empirical evidence supporting that accurate wildlife abundance indices at fine spatial resolution can be generated from WVC data when individual detectability is considered in the modeling process.

AB  - The conversion and fragmentation of natural environments in urban areas can have major consequences on species diversity and ecological interactions. Plant-insect interactions may be dramatically altered because many plants and insect species are unable to tolerate the biotic and abiotic changes associated to urban ecosystems. In the present study, we tested if the network structure between host plants and galling insects changes along urban, peri-urban and rural areas. Our study was performed in nine areas of Cerrado sensu stricto (Neotropical savanna) along an urbanization gradient in the municipality of Montes Claros, Brazil. In total, we sampled 100 galling insect morphospecies and 54 host plant species. Our results show a negative effect of urbanization on the species richness of host plants and galling insects. Furthermore, urbanization increases connectance and reduces the modularity of plant-galling networks. Our findings indicate that the plant-galling communities become poorer and less specialized as they approach more urbanized environments. In this way, our results show that the plant-herbivore communities tend to be functionally depauperate as Cerrado environments are disturbed.Implications for insect conservationOur results show that urbanization has negative effects on insect conservation, resulting in less diverse and specialized plant-galling networks in urban environments. This suggests that plant-herbivore communities can be taxonomically and functionally impoverished in urbanized habitats.

AB  - Non-native plants can significantly affect biodiversity and ecological functions of local ecosystems. The effects of Kandelia obovata introduction and Spartina alterniflora invasion on benthic bacterial communities, predicted ecological functions and interactions between macrobenthos and microorganisms were studied. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate the bacterial communities in sediments covered by S. alterniflora and K. obovata at different stand ages. Bacterial communities showed obvious spatial variation. With increasing in planting age, K. obovate sediments were occupied by higher proportions of bacteria involved in degradation of organic carbon compounds, including various sulfate reduction bacteria, Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria, and pathogenic bacteria Vibrio, while the relative abundances of Actinomatinales and Sulfurovum were more abundant in younger K. obovate sites. Compared to adjacent mudflat, higher abundances of sulfate reduction bacteria were observed in S. alterniflora. This study indicated that K. obovata introduction had greater effects on bacterial communities, and sediment pH, grain size, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorus contents were main environmental factors affecting variation in bacterial communities. Tax4fun analysis further suggested that higher potentials of nitrogen fixation and dissimilatory sulfate reduction were observed after K. obovata restoration and S. alterniflora invasion. There were significant correlations between macrobenthos and bacterial communities, especially variations in relative abundance of infaunas and herbivores after K. obovata introduction and S. alterniflora invasion, which significantly affected bacterial communities and potentials involved in nitrogen cycling. The present study provided valuable information in scientific assessing the impacts of non-native plant disturbance on local ecosystems.

AB  - Climate-induced mass bleaching events are one of the greatest threats to coral reefs, causing widespread loss of coral cover. Drivers of recovery and adaptation for coral reefs in the face of repeated large-scale disturbances are unclear, with marked differences across geographies. Using a monitoring dataset lasting from 2005 to 2018, we documented the response of coral reefs of northwest Mahe in the granitic Seychelles islands following the 1998 and 2016 mass bleaching events. We analysed trends in coral cover, coral community composition and key fish trophic group densities for 24 sites. Coral cover increased almost fourfold from 2005 to 2015 with 42.1% mean coral cover in 2015, highlighting a recovery from the 1998 bleaching event dominated by Acropora growth forms. Impacts of the 2016 bleaching event were less acute than the 1998 one. However, following the 2016 bleaching event, coral cover significantly decreased to 16.1% mean cover in 2017, marked by a sharp decrease of Acropora corals and branching growth forms. Corallivorous, herbivorous and piscivorous fish densities were positively correlated with coral cover from 2005 to 2016. These findings highlight the dominant role of Acropora in recovery from mass coral bleaching events. It also shows the importance of time-series datasets in understanding coral recovery dynamics and their use in an integrated management approach to building reef resilience.

AB  - Canada's federal recovery strategy for boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) classifies areas burned by forest fire as disturbed habitat. This assignment of fire as a disturbance has potential economic and social implications across Canada, and influences plans and actions to achieve caribou conservation and recovery. Previous researchers have reported caribou avoid burned habitat, but these studies did not typically consider unburned residual patches within fire perimeters. Additionally, the implications of burned habitat on individual caribou survival is unclear. We examined resource selection by boreal woodland caribou of burns, and unburned residual patches, using global positioning system (GPS) locations for 201 caribou across 6 caribou populations in Alberta, Canada. We also examined if burned habitat affected the survival of adult female caribou. Caribou avoided burns and unburned residual patches. Increased use of burned habitats, however, did not lower the survival of adult caribou. Collectively, these results provide evidence to support current assertions that burns, and the embedded unburned residual patches are not preferred caribou habitat and increase our understanding of the implications of forest fire for caribou vital rates. Our investigation offers important information about the role of forest fire in caribou ecology and enhances the identification of disturbed habitat under recovery strategy guidelines to effectively address caribou population declines.

AB  - Biological disturbances are integral to forest ecosystems and have pronounced effects on forest resistance, resilience, and diversity. The Hyrcanian mixed forest, in northern Iran, is at risk of declining resistance, resilience, and diversity due to ongoing pressure from land use change, harvesting, and biological disturbances. We analyzed the resistance and resilience of this area under two biological disturbances (i.e., oak charcoal fungus, Biscogniauxia mediterranea, and alder leaf beetle, Galerucella lineola) and in concert with proposed harvesting. We used a simulation modeling approach whereby we simulated 12 combinations of biological disturbances and harvesting scenarios using the LANDIS-II landscape change model. We estimated the correlation between forest resistance and resilience and tree species diversity to harvesting and biological disturbance. We analyzed the full species composition and age class for 30 and 100 years after disturbances in order to assess resistance as the change in species composition over time. We considered resilience as the ability to recover from a disturbance back to a similar initial state. Results indicate a positive effect of biological disturbances and harvesting on diversity. Our simulations resulted in a negative relationship between diversity-resistance and diversity-resilience within high diversity areas. Our simulation of the Hyrcanian forest reveals that harvesting and biological disturbances, as tested, fulfill the goal of maintaining forest diversity. However, increasing diversity does not always follow by increasing forest resistance and resilience. Scenarios with oak charcoal fungus, both with and without harvesting indicate the lowest decrease in resilient and resistant.

AB  - The American bison (Bison bison) is iconic of the Great Plains of North America, yet the genus has had to overcome near extinction in the recent past prior to being re-established for food production. This scoping review summarizes the literature on the Plains Bison as a large ruminant species adequate for modern-day meat production in order to evaluate the species' appropriateness as a sustainable meat source and to identify knowledge gaps hindering the sustainability evaluation of bison production. To date, we can anecdotally assume that bison husbandry could contribute to sustainability based on its positive contribution to biodiversity, physiological robustness, economically higher price per kg, and nutritive values, despite their decreased growth and performance rates compared to beef cattle. However, targeted and system-based research is required in order to unequivocally assess the sustainability of bison production in North America.

AB  - center dot Parasites can catalyze or inhibit interactions between their hosts and other species, but the ecosystem-level effects of such interaction modifications are poorly understood. center dot We conducted a large-scale field experiment in temperate grasslands of China to understand how foliar fungal pathogens influenced top-down effects of cattle on plant diversity and productivity. center dot When foliar pathogens were suppressed, cattle grazing strongly reduced biomass of the dominant grass, Leymus chinensis, generating competitive release that significantly increased community-level species richness and evenness. In the absence of grazing, pathogen attack on L. chinensis had no measurable effect on host biomass. However, pathogens disrupted top-down effects of herbivory by inhibiting grazing effects on plant biomass and species richness. Mechanistically, fungal pathogens were linked to increased alkaloid and reduced nitrogen levels in leaf tissue, which appeared to deter cattle grazing on L. chinensis. center dot In conclusion, foliar pathogens can suppress top-down effects of large herbivores on grassland community composition and ecosystem function by modifying the strength of their host's interactions with dominant consumers. Parasites may act as modulators of ecosystem function when their direct effects on host abundance are overshadowed by powerful influences on host traits that modify their interactions with competitors, herbivores, or predators.

AB  - Habitat loss and land-use intensification are major threats to biodiversity in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, particularly for bat assemblages that provide key ecosystem services. In this study, we examined how landscape composition (forest and pasture cover) and local forest structure influence the richness and abundance of phyllostomid bats across 20 forest fragments in southern Bahia. Bat sampling was conducted using mist nets, and forest structure was quantified using tree measurements and vertical foliage stratification. We applied structural equation modeling to test the direct and indirect effects of landscape and local variables. Our results show that forest cover has both direct and indirect positive effects on bat diversity, mediated by improved forest structure. In contrast, increased pasture cover negatively affected forest structure and was weakly associated with bat diversity. The most abundant species were generalist frugivores, such as Carollia perspicillata and Rhinophylla pumilio. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining forest cover and structural complexity to support bat diversity in agroforestry-dominated landscapes. Conservation strategies that integrate habitat protection with sustainable land-use practices are crucial to maintaining biodiversity and the ecological functions provided by bats in this globally threatened biome.

AB  - Successful wetland restoration depends on the development of the vegetation community post-restoration. Woody vegetation provides functional and structural support to the wetland ecosystem and community development post-restoration dictates restoration outcomes. We investigated basal area, stem density, and species richness of woody vegetation in 40 restored wetlands across West Virginia, USA, ranging in age from 1 to 29 years post-restoration. We aggregated field-collected data into eight indicators at the site scale and investigated stem size distribution to describe the overall woody vegetation community. Generalized linear regression shows native species richness slightly declined as wetland site age increased. In contrast, the total basal area increased over time since restoration. Total stem density did not vary by age. Regardless of age, all sites were dominated by woody vegetation with a stem diameter < 9.1 cm, whereas the frequency of stems > 9.1 cm increased as wetland age increased. This study demonstrates that the development of woody vegetation post-restoration occurs over decades in central Appalachian wetlands and shows the diverse conditions between restoration sites.

AB  - Indigenous knowledge provides valuable information on wildlife health and ecology, contributing to a broader understanding of the patterns and phenomena observed. Muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), an important species for the subsistence and culture of Inuit communities in the Arctic, are increasingly exposed to diverse stressors linked to rapid climate change and other anthropogenic changes. Identifying and understanding these stressors and their impacts on muskoxen will inform management, health monitoring, and future research. To achieve this understanding, we documented Indigenous knowledge through seven semi-structured small group interviews, each involving two to three purposely chosen muskox harvesters in Kugluktuk, Nunavut, Canada to (1) establish the characteristics of healthy muskoxen, (2) determine the factors considered to impact muskoxen, and (3) understand, from an Indigenous knowledge perspective, the results from a study on the sex, seasonal, and annual patterns of glucocorticoids (described as "stress hormones" for the purposes of the interviews) in muskox hair. Key outcomes include (1) a more holistic understanding of muskox health and what it encompasses, (2) recognition and exploration of a rich One Health perspective expressed by participants around factors influencing muskoxen in a changing world and highlighting the multiple socioecological connections, and (3) a broader comprehension of the glucocorticoid (stress) patterns measured in muskox hair, the various factors that influence them, and their interrelations. This study represents a meaningful advancement in the process of actively involving communities at all steps of the research and highlights the important contributions Indigenous knowledge can offer to the complex field of wildlife endocrinology research.

AB  - Wildlife management and conservation requires monitoring of species distribution and population indicators, especially when the unbalanced demographic changes of some species can affect the whole ecosystem functioning. The populations of wild boar (Sus scrofa) have, over the past few decades, undergone an expansion around the world, reaching situations of overabundance that can cause serious economic, ecological and health problems. This numerical increase of wild boar and its new spatial invasion can affect certain vulnerable species in sensitive ecological zones, such as the main inland wetland complex in SW Europe.
   In this context, we aim to (i) examine the association of wild boar abundance and that of lagomorphs, and waterbird productivity, controlling the possible effects of wild carnivores and other environmental predictors, and (ii) applying a survey method useful for managers to evaluate expected effect of wild boar abundance.
   Overall, the presence of wild boar has been detected in 80.8% of the monitored wetlands (n = 26), but a high variation of abundance rates was found. Wild boar abundance negatively associated with the productivity of the entire community of waterbirds, a priori highly vulnerable, breeding on shores or islands, both colonially (genus Gelochelidon, Himantopus, Recurvirostra, Sternula, Glareola, Tringa and Phoenicopterus) or solitary (genus Anas, Spatula, Mareca, Charadrius, Vanellus, Anser, Ardea, Aythya, Fulica, Netta, Oxyura and Tadorna).
   In addition, we evidenced a clear negative association of wild boar and wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) population abundance in the monitored wetlands. Rabbits are a keystone species in the study area and represent stable prey for many endangered predators.
   Our results suggest that potential impacts caused by high wild boar abundance may be already reaching unsustainable levels for some wetlands. Inter-species integrated monitoring is key to address the population management plans of wild boar populations in wetlands and to preserve the most vulnerable species.

AB  - The use of ground cover vegetation is becoming a prominent way of promoting biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in Chinese orchards. Despite the large number of studies that have addressed the effects of ground cover vegetation on promoting natural enemy populations and related pest control, it is still unclear whether enhanced natural pest control can increase yield and reduce the use of pesticide. We performed an experiment comparing three cover vegetation practices (ryegrass, clover and hairy vetch) versus a bare ground control in commercial pear orchards in the Yangtze River Delta of East China (YRDEC), China. Natural enemy density (predator and parasitoid abundance), invertebrate herbivore performance (piercing-sucking herbivore abundance and branch-boring and fruit-boring percentage), pesticide input, and pear fruit yield were recorded. The results indicated that cover vegetation decreased herbivore abundance and boring percentage by 50% and 64%, respectively, thus decreasing pesticide use by 26%. We also found that cover vegetation increased the abundance of natural enemies by 621%, and increased pear fruit yield by 7%. Piecewise structural equation modelling confirmed that increased natural enemy densities, decreased herbivore performance by 102%, pesticide use by 51% and increased fruit yield by 10%. This study suggests that the use of ground cover vegetations, especially with clover and hairy vetch, is an effective way of promoting biocontrol services and associated ecosystem services in pear orchards.

AB  - Mediterranean temporary ponds (MTPs) are seasonal wetland habitats usually flooded during the rainy season but drying out during the warmer months. Due to their biodiversity, uniqueness, and numerous threats, they are listed as a priority for conservation under the Habitats Directive. Despite all the efforts made so far, they are still in poor conservation status in the Mediterranean biogeographic region, making it urgent to define efficient conservation and restoration actions. In this work, we used two case studies to evaluate the conservation status improvement of MTPs located on the southwest coast of Portugal, following the implementation of different management techniques. Sampling was based on floristic surveys to assess plant richness and species frequency, namely of characteristic MTPs species. In the first case, we tested three management techniques (direct grazing, vegetation cutting, and biomass cut/removal, followed by topsoil plowing-simulating wild boar trampling and wallowing) in plots installed in three MTPs between 2017 and 2018. Plots subject to wild boar simulation disturbance showed higher species richness, higher frequency of characteristic species, and lower dominance of Agrostis stolonifera. In the second case, we upscaled this technique as an ecological restoration action by using it in 10 MTPs between 2018 and 2021. We observed a positive effect on the habitat's structure and conservation status, although the possible influence of recurrent drought periods in the last decade is discussed. This study provides insights into a rare wetland habitat based on lessons learned from hands-on conservation actions, while also identifying new challenges and knowledge gaps.

AB  - Disturbances are an essential component of forest functionality and composition; however, when communities become disrupted, these disturbances may restrict the growth and productivity of species present. Illawarra subtropical rainforest (ISRF) is a threatened ecological community that is influenced by both native and exotic vertebrate herbivores and exotic plant pressures. The ability of ISRF to regenerate following the removal of large herbivores was assessed in fenced and unfenced sites within fragments of rainforest. To investigate the extent to which herbivory was limiting the restoration of ISRF, five native seedlings of each of eight species were planted at six sites, and growth and herbivore activity was compared between fenced and unfenced sites. We investigated seed bank capacity and composition to determine whether recruitment limitation is also preventing regeneration. Over 46 weeks, seedlings in unfenced sites experienced significantly lower growth, which varied amongst species and sites. High activity of feral deer and swamp wallabies caused significant reductions in seedling heights and the number of leaves. Herbivores reduced the growth of seedlings of Brachychiton acerifolius, Planchonella australis, and Breynia oblongifolia more than other species. Pittosporum multiflorum seedlings were not eaten. Only 297 seeds (10% of all seeds germinating) of 21 native species typical of ISRF communities germinated in the seed bank germination trial in the glasshouse. Most native species were missing, reflecting poor recruitment opportunities from a soil-stored seed bank. Seed banks were dominated by 21 exotic species (2125 seedlings-74% of total), presenting a significant risk to the regeneration of the community. Our results indicated that ISRF communities are unlikely to regenerate naturally and require active planting coupled with effective protective measures from all herbivores to restore fragmented vegetation.

AB  - We assessed vegetation cover density and distribution in Eastern Jordanian rangeland reserves (2411 km(2)) using a series of Landsat images (34 year's period) and ground cover survey (2020) to identify proper sites for reintroducing Arabian Oryx (Oryx leucoryx). The natural reserves were Burqu Nature Reserve site-1, and site-2 (Dmetheh), and Al Dahek Nature Reserve. Satellite sensor data from Landsat-8-OLI and Landsat- 5-TM were used to derive Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between 1986 and 2020 and across growing seasons (March and April). The Dmetheh site had the highest vegetation cover density over the growing season and across years (1986-2020). Scattered shrubs and grasses (NDVI: 0.1-0.2) consistently covered more than 40% (600-700 km(2)) of the Dmetheh reserve, while in the other reserves vegetation cover were inconsistent and covered less than 500 km(2). Considering the Landsat- NDVI results, Dmetheh site was selected for further assessment. Ground survey of Dmetheh site showed that there were 54 palatable species (53% of total plants) and total ground vegetation cover (%) of the site in March was about 22.5%. The relationship between Landsat-NDVI values and ground vegetation cover was significant (R-2=73.3, P<0.001). Overall, remotely-sensed data hold promise for the assessment process of identifying proper sites to reintroduce Arabian Oryx in arid environments.

AB  - Islands of fertility associated with tree/shrub patches in arid grasslands create spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrients. Faunal activities under these trees/shrubs may contribute to diverse characteristics of these fertile patches of soil due to different faecal inputs. This study used the tree islands of fertility (TIFs) created by camelthorn (Vachellia erioloba) and shepherd trees (Boscia albitrunca) and these species that also host sociable weavers (Philetairus socius) nests (bird islands of fertility; BIFs) in the Kalahari Desert to investigate the diversity in islands of fertility. We hypothesized that grasslands, the TIFs, and the BIFs differ in both the concentrations and stoichiometries of soil nutrients due to the sources of nutrients and that this subsequently determines the growth and foliar nutrient concentrations and stoichiometries of plants that grow on these soils. We predicted that seedlings grown on soils from BIFs would have greater growth, higher biomass yield, and higher foliar nutrients than those grown on soils from TIFs and grasslands. We sampled and grew camelthorn seedlings in soils from BIFs, TIFs, and matrix grasslands. Despite the higher soil nutrients in TIFs than in grasslands, there were no significant differences in seedling growth. However, we observed significantly higher seedling growth in BIF soils compared to TIF soils. Seedlings grown in soils from BIFs and grasslands allocated more growth to shoots and roots, respectively, while those grown on TIF soils were intermediate. The foliar nutrient stoichiometries of seedlings grown in BIF soils were similar to the stoichiometric ratios in BIF soils and in sociable weaver faecal matter. This shows that the faecal input of the sociable weaver accounts for the growth differences in these islands of fertility. The ecological engineering activities of the sociable weaver address nutrient limitations for camelthorn seedling growth, which TIF soils could not address despite the high faecal input of mammals.

AB  - AimDeforestation of the Atlantic Forest of eastern Paraguay has been recent but extensive, resulting in a fragmented landscape highly influenced by forest edges. We examined edge effects on multiple dimensions of small mammalian diversity.LocationForest fragments of eastern Paraguayan Atlantic Forest.MethodsWe trapped small mammal species at different distances from the forest edge (DTE) in reserves and estimated multiple dimensions of diversity per site. Similarity analysis identified species clusters that best described the patterns of diversity across reserves. Multivariate ordination and linear mixed models were used to determine the influence of DTE on various dimensions of small mammal diversity.ResultsThere was an increase in richness and abundance along a DTE gradient, and remnants with higher edge:area ratios showed higher richness and abundance, independent of remnant size. Species at edges were generalists, open-habitat species or exotic species (spillover effect). We found higher phylogenetic diversity and functional richness and divergence towards forest edges. Spillover of non-forest and invasive species best explained richness, generalist forest species best explained total abundance, abundance of Hylaeamys megacephalus best explained diversity and evenness metrics and the presence of Marmosa paraguayana best explained various phylogenetic diversity models. None of the models that included megafauna or social factors were shown to be important in explaining patterns as a function of DTE.Main ConclusionsWe found strong support for a spillover effect and mixed support for complementary resource use and enhanced habitat resources associated with ecotones. Generalists characterized edge assemblages but not all generalists were equivalent. Edges showed more phylogenetically and functionally distinct assemblages than the interior of remnants. There was a conservation of functional diversity; however, open-habitat species, habitat generalists and exotic species boosted diversity near forest edges. Mechanisms governing diversity along forest edges are complex; disentangling those mechanisms necessitates the use of multiple dimensions of diversity.

AB  - In wild boar, Sus scrofa, from Europe, domestic pig-typical ancestry is traced at varying levels. We hypothesised wild boar with pig-typical gene pool characteristics, i.e., "introgression", congregate more in peri-urban habitats, because of less shyness and better adaptation to anthropogenic stress. We used 16 microsatellites to study introgression levels of 375 wild boar from peri-urban Vienna, Austria, and rural regions in comparison to commercial slaughter pigs, Mangaliza, and Turopolje pigs. We also expected more introgression in locations of warmer climates and lower precipitation. Despite discrimination of wild boar and pigs with 99.73% and 97.87% probability, respectively, all wild boars exhibited pig-typical gene pool characteristics, mostly at a very low level. Recent hybridisation was suspected in only 0.53% of wild boar, corresponding to the current largely indoor pig breeding/rearing in the region, with no chance of natural gene exchange between pigs and wild boar. Rather, pig ancestry in wild boar stems from incomplete gene pool differentiation during domestication and/or historical introgressions, when free-ranging pig farming was common. Individual introgression levels were lower in wild boar from peri-urban habitats, possibly reflecting the largely historical absence of pig farms there. Moreover, a marginal precipitation effect, but no temperature effect on introgression was observed. The latter, however, needs to be explored further by a more comprehensive data set.

AB  - Geographic heterogeneity, encompassing both species-environment interactions and interspecific relationships, significantly influences the ecological attributes of wildlife habitat selection and population distribution. However, the impact of geographic heterogeneity on the distribution of target species within predator-prey systems, particularly in human-dominated landscapes, remains unclear. By conducting line transect surveys, utilizing a monitoring network, and applying logistic geographically weighted regression (GWR) in conjunction with generalized linear models (GLM), we examined the spatial heterogeneity of habitat selection by the Amur tiger, Amur leopard, and their main ungulate prey, wild boar and roe deer, in Northeast China. Our results suggest that the factors affecting the spatial distribution of predators are more complex than those for prey. More significantly, the selection coefficients of roe deer and wild boar for certain habitat factors serve as crucial explanatory variables in the Amur tiger and leopard models. Our findings emphasize the importance of spatial non-stationarity in predator-prey habitat selections, and the heterogeneous selection by prey may drive dispersals of large felids across complex road landscapes. This study offers new insights into how to help apex predators cross road barriers by effectively managing prey habitat selection in a landscape dominated by roads, providing valuable guidance for future habitat conservation policies.

AB  - Imagery has become a key tool for assessing deep-sea megafaunal biodiversity, historically based on physical sampling using fishing gears. Image datasets provide quantitative and repeatable estimates, small-scale spatial patterns and habitat descriptions. However, taxon identification from images is challenging and often relies on morphotypes without considering a taxonomic framework. Taxon identification is particularly challenging in regions where the fauna is poorly known and/or highly diverse. Furthermore, the efficiency of imagery and physical sampling may vary among habitat types. Here, we compared biodiversity metrics (alpha and gamma diversity, composition) based on physical sampling (dredging and trawling) and towed-camera still images (1) along the upper continental slope of Papua New Guinea (sedimented slope with wood-falls, a canyon and cold seeps), and (2) on the outer slopes of the volcanic islands of Mayotte, dominated by hard bottoms. The comparison was done on selected taxa (Pisces, Crustacea, Echinoidea, and Asteroidea), which are good candidates for identification from images. Taxonomic identification ranks obtained for the images varied among these taxa (e.g., family/order for fishes, genus for echinoderms). At these ranks, imagery provided a higher taxonomic richness for hard-bottom and complex habitats, partially explained by the poor performance of trawling on these rough substrates. For the same reason, the gamma diversity of Pisces and Crustacea was also higher from images, but no difference was observed for echinoderms. On soft bottoms, physical sampling provided higher alpha and gamma diversity for fishes and crustaceans, but these differences tended to decrease for crustaceans identified to the species/morphospecies level from images. Physical sampling and imagery were selective against some taxa (e.g., according to size or behavior), therefore providing different facets of biodiversity. In addition, specimens collected at a larger scale facilitated megafauna identification from images. Based on this complementary approach, we propose a robust methodology for image-based faunal identification relying on a taxonomic framework, from collaborative work with taxonomists. An original outcome of this collaborative work is the creation of identification keys dedicated specifically to in situ images and which take into account the state of the taxonomic knowledge for the explored sites.

AB  - Simple Summary Wildlife corridors play a pivotal role to support free ranging wildlife in rapid changing landscapes which remains vulnerable due to growing human population, together with unplanned urbanization, industrialization, developmental activities and the inverse impacts of climate change. This triggers for undertaking urgent actions to not only ensure their long-term survival, but also securing sustainable socio-economic and environmental development. Using landscape genetics approach, we in the present study examined the movement and dispersal patterns of a wild mountain ungulate, Himalayan ibex which is considered an ecological engineer and also imparts a major prey base to the large carnivores in Indian trans-Himalayan Region. We identified the Lahaul-Zanskar-Sham valley (L-Z-SV) corridor supports the bidirectional movement of Himalayan ibex, and suggest science driven management interventions for the conservation of Himalayan ibex and other sympatric ungulates in the trans-Himalayan region. Wildlife corridors that connect mosaic habitats in heterogeneous mountainous landscapes can be of high significance as they facilitate the genetic and demographic stability of free-ranging populations. Peripheral populations of widespread species are usually ignored in conservation planning. However, these populations retain locally common alleles and are genetic reservoir under the changing climatic conditions. Capra sibirica has widespread distribution, and its southern peripheral population is distributed in the Indian trans-Himalayan region (ITR). In the present study, we studied the spatial distribution and genetic make-up of Himalayan ibex from the ITR following the landscape genetics approach. We obtained 16 haplotypes at the mitochondrial d-loop region and found a stable demography in the past with a recent decline. With 10 nuclear microsatellites, we ascertained 111 unique individuals assigned into two clusters following Bayesian and non-Bayesian clustering analysis with several admixed individuals. We also recorded 25 first-generation migrants that reflected relatively high dispersal and gene-flow across the range. We identified a 19,835 sq.km suitable area with 13,311 sq.km in Ladakh and 6524 sq.km in Lahaul-Spiti. We identified a novel movement corridor for Himalayan ibex across the Lahaul-Zanskar-Sham valley (L-Z-SV) that displayed a fairly good conductance with low genetic divergence among the samples collected on the L-Z-SV corridor. We propose declaring a protected area in the Lahaul and Kargil districts to prioritize dedicated conservation efforts for the Himalayan ibex and other sympatric ungulates that impart a major role in the diet of large carnivore and balancing ecosystem services in the trans-Himalayan region.

AB  - Transboundary conservation is critical to halting global biodiversity loss, yet transboundary species represent a particular challenge in terms of who is primarily responsible for their conservation and how to coordinate between range states. Based on intensive field surveys from 2010 to 2023 and systematic data compilation from multilingual literature, we developed the first quantitative framework for assessing national conservation responsibilities for Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica) across its 11-country distribution. We integrated ensemble species distribution models with systematic conservation planning to identify 48 Landscape Conservation Units (LCUs), then applied an entropy weight method to quantify each country's conservation responsibility based on ecological importance, protection effectiveness, and national capacity. Our assessment reveals a three-tier classification: high-responsibility countries (China, Turkmenistan, Mongolia), medium-responsibility countries (Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, India), and low-responsibility countries (Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan). China holds the highest responsibility (score = 0.678) due to its extensive LCUs (45.68 % of total LCUs) and high national capacity, though its low protected area coverage (15.18 %) indicates urgent need for conservation investment. While climate change threatens future habitat availability, anthropogenic pressures from infrastructure development and inadequate protection networks pose more immediate challenges. Our responsibility assessment framework provides a replicable protocol for other transboundary migratory species, helping countries work together more fairly and effectively to prevent extinctions.

AB  - The lower 10 km of the Buffalo River, a tributary to Lake Erie, was designated as an Area of Concern (AOC) in 1987 through the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement because sediment contamination and habitat alteration from past industrialization caused several Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs). Extensive reme-diation efforts conducted between 2011 and 2015 removed approximately 688,100 cubic meters of con-taminated sediment from the Buffalo River AOC, and subsequent chemical analysis of sediments indicated that most remedial goals had been achieved. Benthic macroinvertebrate communities and sed-iment toxicity were evaluated in the AOC and an upstream reference area in 2017 and 2020 to determine whether remediation has improved benthic conditions sufficiently that the benthos BUI designation can be removed. Community condition was characterized using the New York State multi-metric index of biological integrity and bed sediments were used for 10-day toxicity tests with Chironomus dilutus and Hyalella azteca. Macroinvertebrate communities were classified as moderately to slightly impacted at most AOC sites compared to slightly impacted at most reference sites, but toxicity tests did not identify any evidence of toxicity in sediments from the AOC. A linear mixed effects model indicated that total organic carbon concentration in sediments, distance upstream from the river mouth, and the relative dominance of zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha were the primary predictors of macroinvertebrate community condition. These findings are consistent with those from other AOCs in New York which indi-cate that contemporary benthic communities are generally shaped by legacy habitat alterations rather than AOC-specific sediment contamination and toxicity.

AB  - Red and roe deer are the most numerous cervids in Europe, and they occur in sympatry in most regions. Roe deer were considered to be an inferior competitor in studies in which they co-occurred with fallow deer or muntjac. Despite the remarkable overlap of their ranges, there are few studies on the competition between the red and roe deer. Since interspecific interactions among ungulates are often related to their mutual densities, the current study focused on the effects of high red deer density on the roe deer numbers and spatial distribution in the unhunted Slowinski National Park (SNP) in northern Poland and forest districts open to hunting bordering the park. Using fecal pellet group counts, it was found that in the forest districts (where red deer densities were 2-3 times lower than in the SNP), roe deer densities were significantly higher than in the park. The red-to-roe deer density ratio was 10.8 and 2.7, in the SNP and the surrounding forest districts, respectively. Moreover, in the SNP, the roe deer distribution was negatively affected by the red deer habitat use, while in the hunting areas, such an effect was not recorded. The negative influence of the red deer on the roe deer population in the park was most probably due to the red deer impact on food availability. The biomass of the plant groups forming the staple food of the roe deer (Rubus spp., forbs, dwarf shrubs) was significantly higher in the fenced plots than in the unfenced ones. Lack of hunting in the protected areas may benefit only some species in ungulate assemblages which, in turn, may contradict one of their objectives-to maintain viable and ecologically functional populations.

AB  - Context. Helicopter-based shooting has been widely used to harvest deer or control overabundant populations in Australasia, but the effectiveness and cost of this method as a deer control tool has seldom been evaluated. Aims. We evaluated the effectiveness and costs of helicopter-based shooting of fallow deer (Dama dama) and chital deer (Axis axis) in eastern Australia by quantifying (1) reductions in density, (2) the relationship between numbers killed per hour and deer density (i.e. the functional response), (3) the costs of control and (4) the effort-outcome and cost-outcome relationships. Methods. We evaluated the costs and effectiveness of 12 aerial shooting operations aiming to reduce fallow deer (n = 8) or chital deer (n = 4) population densities at nine sites in eastern Australia. Sites were characterised by fragmented woodland, and all but one operation aimed to reduce grazing competition with livestock. We used precontrol population density estimates and operational monitoring data to estimate the costs and outcomes of each operation. We combined data from all operations to estimate the relationship between shooting effort and population reduction, as well as costs associated with different levels of effort. Key results. Population reductions for operations ranged from 5% to 75% for fallow deer, and from 48% to 88% for chital deer. The greatest population reductions occurred when effort per unit area was greatest, and the largest reductions in deer density occurred when shooting was conducted in consecutive years. The functional response of hourly kills to deer density was best described by a modified Ivlev model, with the asymptotic kill rate estimated to be 50 deer per hour. There was no support for the existence of a prey refuge, that is, a threshold population density below which no deer could be shot. Helicopter charter was the primary cost of helicopter-based shooting programs, followed by labour; firearm and ammunition costs were relatively minor. Conclusions. Helicopter-based shooting can rapidly reduce deer populations over large geographic areas, but the magnitude of the reduction depends on the effort (hours of shooting) per deer per km(2). Implications. Aerial shooting operations should include a pre-control population survey so that (1) measurable objectives can be established, (2) the likely level of effort and cost required for objectives to be met can be estimated and planned for, and (3) the realised population reduction can be estimated.

AB  - The gray wolf (Canis lupus) is one of the most conflictual mammals in Europe. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) are an essential part of gray wolf diet in central Europe, but after the emergence of African swine fever (ASF) in Europe, a sharp decline of the wild boar occurred. We examined how the wild boar population decline, due to African swine fever outbreak and mitigation efforts, affected the number of livestock killed by wolves in Poland using long-term data on wild ungulate and livestock population sizes and wolf-induced mortality between 2013 and 2019. We examined the influence of multiple factors on livestock kill rate, and the influence of wild boar population declines on the number of Cervidae killed by wolves using linear mixed models. We also explored the possibility of predicting a dramatic decrease in the wild boar population based on livestock depredation patterns. The number of livestock killed by wolves decreased with wild boar and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) population size, and increased with red deer (Cervus elaphus) population size. A decline in the wild boar population was significantly correlated with an increase in the number of both red and roe deer killed by wolves. A drastic decline of wild boar population (over 30%) could be predicted by the numbers of livestock killed by wolves. Our study confirms that large changes in the number of naturl prey can increase livestock depredation, although these changes may be difficult to detect when the fluctuations in the numbers of natural prey are smaller. In our opinion, this indicates that the assessment of factors influencing livestock depredation should consider historical changes in prey dynamics. We suggest managers and conservationists use the predator population as a 'first alert system' for indirect monitoring of prey species. In this system, a sudden increase in wolf attacks on livestock across a large area of should trigger an alarm and prompt verification of the number of natural prey in the environment.

AB  - The small mammalian fauna plays pivotal roles in ecosystem dynamics and as crucial biodiversity indicators. However, recent research has raised concerns about the decline of mammalian species due to climate change. Consequently, significant attention is directed toward studying various big flagship mammalian species for conservation. However, small mammals such as the hog badgers (Mustelidae: Arctonyx) remain understudied regarding the impacts of climate change in Asia. The present study offers a comprehensive analysis of climate change effects on two mainland hog badger species, utilizing ensemble species distribution modeling. Findings reveal concerning outcomes, as only 52% of the IUCN extent is deemed suitable for the Great Hog Badger (Arctonyx collaris) and a mere 17% is ideal for the Northern Hog Badger (Arctonyx albogularis). Notably, projections suggest a potential reduction of over 26% in suitable areas for both species under future climate scenarios, with the most severe decline anticipated in the high-emission scenario of SSP585. These declines translate into evident habitat fragmentation, particularly impacting A. collaris, whose patches shrink substantially, contrasting with the relatively stable patches of A. albogularis. However, despite their differences, niche overlap analysis reveals an intriguing increase in overlap between the two species, indicating potential ecological shifts. The study underscores the importance of integrating climate change and habitat fragmentation considerations into conservation strategies, urging a reassessment of the IUCN status of A. albogularis. The insights gained from this research are crucial for improving protection measures by ensuring adequate legal safeguards and maintaining ecological corridors between viable habitat patches, which are essential for the conservation of hog badgers across mainland Asia. Furthermore, emphasizing the urgency of proactive efforts, particularly in countries with suitable habitats can help safeguard these small mammalian species and their ecosystems from the detrimental impacts of climate change.

AB  - 1. Decline in species richness as well as changes in community evenness or functional diversity have been hypothesised to jointly affect ecosystem functioning. However, disentangling the relative effects of these changes in community structure is hard as these different aspects often covary with species richness in real-world ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the individual and interactive effects of functional diversity and community evenness of predators on the level of control of herbivorous prey.
   2. Using a highly replicated mesocosm experiment, we crossed three levels of functional diversity of arthropod predators with two levels of community evenness while controlling for the effect of species richness. Using this experimental setting, we hypothesised that the effect size of functional diversity of predators depends on community evenness. We expected a positive effect of functional diversity of predators on top-down control at high level of community evenness while we thought that species identity and their associated traits should drive most of the effect on top-down control at low level of community evenness.
   3. Our results did not provide any evidence for an interaction between functional diversity and community evenness nor any beneficial effect of increased functional diversity overall on predation rates of herbivorous prey. In addition, our results revealed that species and functional identity drives most of the effects of predator community composition on top-down control of their prey in our study system. Assemblages composed of active hunters with low handling time and no starvation ability tended to have the highest impacts on prey biomass.
   4. By indicating that top- down control of herbivorous prey by arthropod predators is mainly driven by species and functional identity and not by functional diversity, our study provides insights into the consequences of ongoing species loss on ecosystem functioning. Future research should now explore the predictability of trophic interactions based on functional traits of predator and herbivorous prey to anticipate the consequences of changes in species composition on ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Herbivory and fire promote changes in vegetation patches of arid environments, and recruitment plays a key role in their maintenance. We studied seedling dynamics in seven sites with different land use histories related to grazing and fire in north-eastern Patagonian Monte, Argentina. We selected shrub patches in grazed/burned areas. On each shrub patch, we established seven microsites along an under-canopy windward/leeward transect. Seedling recruitment of perennial grasses (PGR) and annual species (ASR) were registered on each microsite. PGR was higher in sites with low-intensity disturbances, and lower in those severely disturbed or not disturbed. PGR was similar on the leeward side, suggesting that shrubs generate similar microsites for their establishment on that side whatever the surrounding disturbance. Severe disturbances promoted non-native ASR. PGR overall was low and apparently, conditions that enhanced ASR also decreased PGR. This situation leads to the replacement of a native-dominated community to one dominated by non-native AS. Our findings suggest that vegetation cover in heavily grazed sites in this semiarid region are sustained mainly by grass re-sprouting capacity, as recruitment is scarce. In contrast, sites that have a fire background and/or are ungrazed show higher PGR, especially in under-canopy microsites.

AB  - Feral swine (Sus scrofa) inhabit 35 states in the United States with an estimated population of 6 million animals. The feral swine population is greatest in Texas with an estimated population of at least 2.5 million. Monitoring swine landscape use and activity patterns is the first step to understanding effects on plant communities and potential zoonotic disease spillover events with livestock. Feral swine population densities are greatest in forested regions, but as their range expands, they will continue to encounter novel ecosystems. The Rolling Plains ecoregion of Texas presents a unique landscape in which feral swine are found in midgrass prairies primarily used for livestock production. Two 405-ha survey areas were chosen from a ranch in north Texas to stratify game cameras across three vegetation types: bottomland, deep upland, and shallow upland. From June 2021 to May 2022, cameras monitored animal movement. Swine image captures were logged and tagged with date, time, and temperature. Vegetative surveys were also conducted to estimate biomass production and vegetation height around the camera locations. Total swine captures ( n = 242) over the study period were analyzed through mixed model analysis with terms of season, time, and vegetation type with interaction models run. Swine captures were significantly greater at bottomland sites than deep upland sites in the fall, winter, and spring ( P = 0.01), as well as during midmorning time blocks (8:00-11:59) ( P = 0.03). Temperature was also a significant driver of swine activity ( P < 0.01) with low camera captures occurring at the extremes (<= 0.0 degrees C and >= 30.0 degrees C). Biomass production and vegetation structure were not good predictors of swine vegetation association. These results can better inform producers where and when feral swine may be present, increasing the efficiency of feral swine management.

AB  - Megabenthic communities on continental margins benefit from structural complexity of the seafloor and sedimentary dynamics. These communities were tested in the outer margins of the Yucatan continental shelf (YCS) during August 2016 to evaluate the relationships between community attributes with environmental variables. The total capture was 1,366 10(3) ind km(-2) and 2,078kg ash free dry weight (AFDW) km(-2), distributed among 319 species. Crustaceans and molluscs were co-dominant in abundance (576,629 ind km(-2) similar to 42.2% and 481,372 ind km(-2) similar to 35.2%), while crustaceans and sponges were the greatest contributors to community biomass (699.84kg AFDW km(-2) similar to 33.6% and 47.8kg AFDW km(-2) similar to 23.0%). Local diversity was higher than reported for other areas of the GoM, showing a pseudo-latitudinal gradient of richness related to the karstic bottom and autogenic species. Beta diversity showed no species loss in these communities. The BIOENV test pointed to longitude, temperature, sorting, vanadium, 2.6-dimethyl naphthalene, latitude, chlorophyll, average grain size, n-C-16 and n-C-23 as the most important variables. Hydrocarbons were recorded at lower concentrations than the threshold effects level (TEL) reference values; however, the significant correlation between richness and dibenzothiophene must be evaluated. Beta diversity exhibited a high turnover and functional diversity showed an absence of regional distribution. Differences in benthic megafauna among sites were because of gradients in latitude and concentrations of aliphatic compounds which can be attributed to the distance from the stations to the coastline or groundwater flow. Environmental monitoring programmes are recommended because of petrogenic compounds that influence the community structure.

AB  - Climate change is impacting marine ecosystem community dynamics on a global scale. While many have assessed direct effects of climate change, indirect effects on marine ecosystems produced by biotic interactions remain poorly understood. For example, warming-induced range expansions and increased consumption rates of herbivores can lead to significant and unexpected changes in seagrass-dominated ecosystems. To better understand the threats tropicalization presents for the functioning of turtlegrass (Thalassia testudinum) meadows, we focused on the extensive turtlegrass beds of St. Joseph Bay, Florida in the northern Gulf of Mexico, a location with increasing numbers of tropically-associated green turtles. Our goals were to investigate experimentally how different grazing rates (natural and simulated),including high levels reflective of green turtle herbivory, coupled with nutrient supply, might alter turtlegrass structure and functioning in a higher latitude, subtropical turtlegrass meadow. We found that 4 months of varying levels of herbivory did not affect turtlegrass productivity, while 7 months of herbivory reduced percent cover, and 10 months reduced shoot density. Nutrient additions had few important effects. Ten months into the study, a massive recruitment of the herbivorous sea urchin (Lytechinus variegatus), whose densities reached 19 urchins/m(2) completely overgrazed our study area and a large portion of the lush turtlegrass meadows of St. Joseph Bay. While local turtlegrass overgrazing had been previously noted at these urchin densities, a total loss of seagrass in such a large area has rarely ever been recorded. Overgrazing of the kind we observed, likely a result of both urchin and increasing green turtle grazing, can result in the loss of many key ecosystem services. As tropicalization continues, understanding how changes in biotic interactions, such as increased herbivory, affect higher latitude seagrass meadows will be necessary for their proper management and conservation.

AB  - Formally protected areas are an important component of wildlife conservation, but face limitations in their effectiveness for migratory species. Improved stewardship of working lands around protected areas is one so-lution for conservation planning, but private working lands are vulnerable to development. In the Greater Yel-lowstone Ecosystem (GYE), ungulates such as elk (Cervus canadensis) use both protected areas and private lands throughout their annual migrations. We studied patterns of landownership, protection, and conservation chal-lenges within the ranges of migratory elk in the GYE. We used GPS data from 1088 elk in 26 herds to define herd -level seasonal ranges, and extracted covariates related to landownership and protection, land use, and human infrastructure and development. All elk herds used land encompassing >1 ownership type. Most elk herds (92.3 % of herds, n = 24) used the highest proportion of private land in the winter (mean = 36.2 % private land). Most elk herds' winter ranges contained the highest building densities (mean = 1.24 buildings/km2), fence densities (mean = 1.02 km fence/km2), and cattle grazing (mean = 1.9 cows/km2), compared to migratory and summer ranges. Out of all ranges, 36.5 % of ranges did not have any zoning regulations, indicating the potential for future development. Our results show that elk in the GYE rely on habitat outside of protected areas, and face landscape -scale conservation challenges such as habitat fragmentation from human development, particularly in winter ranges. Future conservation strategies for wildlife in this system need to encompass coordination across both public and private land to ensure migratory connectivity.

AB  - Species phenotypes are driven by persistent selective pressures that condition their adaptation to the environment. However, stochastic critical events, such as disease outbreaks, may also act as selective pressures because of drastic population decline. External structures like horns of ungulate species may reflect the consequences of these selective pressures on animal fitness. Using a generalized linear model approach, we analysed how a massive mortality event caused by a sarcoptic mange outbreak in 1992 affected the horn size of an Iberian aoudad population (dataset from 1980 to 2014) by comparing horn length before and after the outbreak. We found that this episodic, albeit massive, outbreak changed long-term trends in age-size horn relations. Both females and males presented shorter horns after the sarcoptic mange outbreak, although more marked in males. Even when animals reached mature ages, horn length did not increase with age to the same degree as before the outbreak. We consider that two processes may have acted on the population: a bottleneck favoured "shorter horns" phenotype and a post-mange enzootic period limited horn growth, as infected animals may invest more resources in the immune system. Overall, our results show a top-down regulation of a fitness trait for an ungulate population mediated by a parasite. This disease outbreak showed long-lasting effects on the ungulate population, with ecological and management implications.

AB  - The community ecology and microhabitat association of tanaidaceans in three rocky intertidal areas of central-eastern Taiwan were investigated in April and August 2012. Typhoon Saola impacted the study areas 2 weeks before the August survey, providing an opportunity to examine community responses to extreme wave exposures. Among the 3,622 individuals and 12 species collected, Chondrochelia taitungensis, Paraleptochelia setosa, Synapseudes hansmuelleri, Zeuxo shitipingensis, and Zeuxo zorro comprised approximately 95% of the total abundance. Surprisingly, the tanaidacean abundance, diversity, composition, and microhabitat specialization exhibited little impact from the typhoons, indicating that these tube dwellers can resist such extreme wave impacts. Spatial variation in the abundance of dominant species, species diversity, and composition among tanaidacean communities was attributed to differences in rock formations, microhabitat availability, and species' limited dispersive ability and potential interspecific competitive interactions. While the dominant species exhibited a more generalized microhabitat association, the relatively rare species displayed some specialization. This study pioneers investigation into microhabitat associations among rocky intertidal tanaidaceans. Future studies should incorporate sustained monitoring of community dynamics and microhabitat associations, integrating essential climatic variables into the analysis to predict community responses to natural or anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Forestry plantations have increased considerably over recent decades to fulfil human demand for wood, pulp and paper. Eucalyptus globulus Labill is one of the most abundant plantation species, particularly in Europe, where its largest presence is in Portugal. Furthermore, plantations in Mediterranean areas, such as Portugal, frequently suffer from forest fires, and thus it is crucial to understand their impacts on vertebrates. This is especially relevant for some species, like small mammals, that use landscapes at smaller scales for which even small changes in forest cover may have a profound effect. In this study, we evaluate the effects of several environmental, disturbance and habitat drivers on the relative abundance of rodents (Muridae) in Eucalyptus plantations in central Portugal. Specimen capture took place across two seasons and at eight study sites representing six different stages of Eucalyptus plantations and two native forests from 2019 to 2020. Using a structural equation modelling approach, we show that the relative abundance of rodents was promoted by recent wildfire events and was higher in areas where carnivores and wild boar were more abundant. By contrast, abundant deer and increased percentages of herbaceous or litter cover and bare soil limited the abundance of rodents. We did not detect a significant relationship between Eucalyptus plantations and the relative abundance of rodents. The presence of other species, either by direct contact (carnivores) or by inducing habitat changes (ungulates), and vegetation structure, likely linked to plantation management or fire regime, are the more important factors dictating the population dynamics of rodents across plantation forests in central Portugal.

AB  - Nematodes play a significant role in soil biogeochemical cycling. However, our understanding of their community carbon budget response for a shift in the environmental conditions of natural and planted forests is limited. Therefore, we investigated the nematode community composition, daily carbon used in production and daily carbon budget, environmental variables, and the interaction among trophic groups in the moss, litter and 0-5 cm soil layers of natural subalpine spruce forest and plantations in western Sichuan, China. The result revealed that plantations increased the total nematode daily carbon budget by approximately 52% through the herbivore channel in the 0-5 cm soil layer. The herbivorous nematodes' daily carbon budget and production in the moss layer of plantations decreased by approximately 60% compared to natural forests. Nematode daily carbon used in production and carbon budget had a strong negative correlation with genus richness. The water content and total carbon was the most important environmental factor that affected the nematode carbon budget and production, respectively. However, the environmental factors indirectly affect the daily carbon budget of herbivore nematodes through omnivore top-down control in subalpine forest ecosystems. Our findings highlight that the planted ecosystems have a certain capacity to maintain abundance, richness, and carbon budget of soil nematode but increase the risk of herbivorous pests.

AB  - Human-induced habitat modification can affect species interactions and ecological networks composed of specialized species may be more susceptible to these effects. Immature and adult insect herbivores have different mobility and specificity levels related to their host plants, which can affect their tolerance to anthropic disturbances. In the present study, we compared the structure of plant-herbivore networks composed of adult and immature insects in 16 Neotropical savanna sites under different land-use intensification levels. We compared insect species richness, insect abundance, connectance, specialization, generality, vulnerability, modularity, and nestedness in plant-immature insect and plant-adult insect networks occurring in preserved and non-preserved areas. In total we sampled 328 individuals of 98 species of host plants and 557 individuals of 310 species of insect herbivores (275 individuals of 143 species of immature insects and 479 individuals of 196 species of adult insects). Although the richness of insect species did not differ between the networks, plant-immature insect networks had a lower insect abundance, generality and nestedness than networks of adult insects. On the other hand, connectance was lower for networks of adults than for networks of immature insects. Our results also show that the effects of habitat modification are more pronounced for immature insects than for adults, as network connectance increases and network vulnerability decreases between preserved habitats and disturbed habitats. Our findings support previous warnings that habitat modification can alter plant-herbivore interactions, and advance the understanding of how these effects can be different for assemblages composed of adult and immature insects. Implications for insect conservation Our results indicate more consistent effects of habitat modification on immature insect interactions, which showed more specialized networks in preserved environments. Thus, our results contribute to the understanding of how plant-insect interactions are structured in highly disturbed environments, such as Neotropical savannas.

AB  - Migratory tundra caribou are ecologically and culturally critical in the circumpolar North. However, they are declining almost everywhere in North America, probably due to natural variation exacerbated by climate change and human activities. Yet, the interconnectedness between climate, caribou and human well-being has received little attention. To address this gap, we bridged Indigenous and scientific knowledge in a single model, using as example the Porcupine caribou herd social-ecological system. Our analysis, involving 688 (fall season) and 616 (spring season) interviews conducted over 9 years with 405 (fall season) and 390 (spring season) Indigenous hunters from 9 communities, demonstrates that environmental conditions, large-scale temporal changes associated with caribou demography and cultural practices affect hunters' capacity to meet their needs in caribou. Our quantitative approach bolsters our understanding of the complex relationships between ecosystems and human welfare in environments exposed to rapid climate change, and shows the benefits of long-term participatory research methods implemented by Indigenous and scientific partners.
   How climate, caribou and human well-being are linked is not well known. Using interviews conducted over 9 years with Indigenous hunters from the Western Arctic of America, this study analyses the mechanisms linking climate, caribou and human capacity to satisfy cultural and subsistence needs in a human-caribou system.

AB  - The increasing human pressure has threatened wildlife conservation, even in protected areas. However, findings reporting the effects of human on wildlife conservation are not consistent. This study aimed to investigate the effect of human disturbance on the distribution and abundance of mammals in Abijata-Shalla Lakes National Park considering the consumptive and non-consumptive modes of human activities. The study was conducted from September 2017 to February 2018 in three selected sites, which were stratified based on human disturbance as nature conserved areas, sites engaged in consumptive livelihood, and ecotourism sites. Data were collected using a line transect method. The distribution and abundance data were analyzed using Chi-square tests and oneway ANOVA, respectively. There was a significant difference on the distribution of target wild animals in the selected sites; greater kudu (P < 0.001), warthog (P < 0.01), and bohor reedbuck (P = 0.03) were highest in the "nature conserved" site. Human disturbance also significantly affected the abundance of warthog (P = 0.028), greater kudu (P < 0.001), and bohor reedbuck (P = 0.024). Greater kudu distribution was limited in nature conserved site. However, Warthog and Bohor Reedbuck were distributed in all sampling sites; nature conserved sites hold the highest population abundance. The results indicate that consumptive local livelihood and ecotourism disturbances adversely affected the distribution and abundance of mammals relative to the nature reserved site. However, ecotourism favored some mammal species from the consumptive local people's livelihood activities. Thus, to reduce the impact of human disturbances on wildlife conservation, monitoring and controlling the level of human disturbance is urgent. Sustainable practices such as community engagement, awareness creation and alternative livelihood options should be proposed.

AB  - The possibility of maintaining forested vegetation under deer browsing depends on the success of regeneration processes. Several indices have been proposed to estimate the pressure of deer browsing based on the incidence of browsing on woody plant seedlings. The maintenance of seedling populations is critically dependent on managing deer populations under the threshold levels. For two years we monitored the survival and growth of broad-leaved seedlings and the incidence of deer browsing on these seedlings to examine the effectiveness of the browsing ratio (i.e., the ratio of browsed seedlings per year to the total number of available seedlings, regardless of browse species preferences) as an index of deer browsing pressure, along with snow depth, dwarf bamboo Sasa spp. abundance, and light availability in nineteen 100 m2 plots located in natural forests in Hokkaido, northern Japan. The abundance of deer as indicated by the number of deer observed via spotlight count surveys was associated with the abundance of Sasa spp. and the snow depth. The browsing ratio was associated with snow depth, Sasa spp. abundance, light availability, and deer abundance. This result suggests that the impact of deer on seedlings differs depending on the local environment, even under similar deer abundance. Sasa spp. abundance had a negative effect on seedling density and survival. Sasa spp. are an important food source for wintering deer and deer reduce their biomass, whereas dense Sasa cover had a protective effect on small seedlings. Thus, Sasa spp. affects seedlings in various ways. Changes in both the number and mean height growth of seedlings in each plot were explained with the browsing ratio alone. Thus, the browsing ratio directly summarizes the effect of deer on seedlings. The estimated threshold browsing ratio was 0.27 for changes in seedling density and 0.51 for height growth of seedlings.

AB  - Characterizing the population density of species is a central interest in ecology. Eastern North America is the global hotspot for biodiversity of plethodontid salamanders, an inconspicuous component of terrestrial vertebrate communities, and among the most widespread is the eastern red-backed salamander, Plethodon cinereus. Previous work suggests population densities are high with significant geographic variation, but comparisons among locations are challenged by lack of standardization of methods and failure to accommodate imperfect detection. We present results from a large-scale research network that accounts for detection uncertainty using systematic survey protocols and robust statistical models. We analysed mark-recapture data from 18 study areas across much of the species range. Estimated salamander densities ranged from 1950 to 34 300 salamanders ha-1, with a median of 9965 salamanders ha-1. We compared these results to previous estimates for P. cinereus and other abundant terrestrial vertebrates. We demonstrate that overall the biomass of P. cinereus, a secondary consumer, is of similar or greater magnitude to widespread primary consumers such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and Peromyscus mice, and two to three orders of magnitude greater than common secondary consumer species. Our results add empirical evidence that P. cinereus, and amphibians in general, are an outsized component of terrestrial vertebrate communities in temperate ecosystems.

AB  - The Natural Heritage Site of the Coast of Yellow Sea-Bohai Gulf of China plays a prominent role in the conservation of global biodiversity. However, with the increase in the number of species inhabiting here, the problem of competition in the habitat space of species within the heritage site has gradually emerged, which has become an important bottleneck restricting the sustainable development of the heritage site. Therefore, this study selected the typical wetland wildlife in this area, red crowned crane (Grus japonensis) and Chinese water deer (Hydropotes inermis), as the study objects. This study used their continuous GPS tracking data to reveal the seasonal laws of habitat selection and suitability of two typical wetland species, and analyze their spatial competition and coexistence relationship. The study results showed that the distribution of home range of the crane and the deer in spring and summer was significantly larger than that in autumn and winter. The area of the sub and most suitable area of the deer in spring was larger than that of the crane. In autumn and winter, the area of the sub and most suitable areas for the deer was small, while the area of the most suitable area for the crane was more than 50 hm2. Except in spring, the two species kept a certain distance from each other in other seasons, and their habitat selection was stable. The optimal threshold range of the crane for D_ree variable was 0-202 m in spring and 0-1200 m in summer and autumn. The deer was affected by vegetation factors in the four seasons. The threshold range of D_ree variable in spring, autumn and winter was 0-80 m, the suitable vegetation height of the deer was 2.31-2.92 m. Finally, this study proposed a refined management pattern of habitat with multiple species coexist.

AB  - Forests in northeastern North America have undergone dramatic transformations due to losses and gains of species, changes in land use and pollution. Historic stressors combined with new threats of white-tailed deer and non-native earthworms are threatening native plant diversity. We developed a transplant approach to gauge the importance of deer and earthworms in allowing understorey species recovery. This approach, instead of censusing existing individuals, avoids problems imposed by past land use, dispersal limitation or climate change. We selected 20 native species in different taxonomic and functional groups, with different palatability to herbivores, different life-history strategies and a range of plant traits (%N, specific leaf area [SLA]) and our selection included species indicative of primary or secondary forests. Using a 2 x 2 full factorial design, we planted species into fenced and unfenced plots with and without existing earthworm invasions in five secondary hardwood forests. We measured survival, plant growth and reproduction over 4-6 years. Earthworm biomass was associated with increased survival of 13 and decreased survival of five species. Surviving transplants grew taller (eight of 12 species measured) and wider (seven of nine species measured) in earthworm plots but were more likely to be attacked by insects. Excluding deer benefitted most species' survival and growth. Taxonomic class, SLA or foliar N did not affect species sensitivity to deer or earthworms. Synthesis. Secondary forests in our region continue to provide suitable habitat for native species. Earthworms and deer are major structuring forces affecting survival and growth of our transplant species, but their impacts are species-specific and change over time. We observed poorly recognized indirect negative impacts of deer on many unpalatable species. Taxonomic class and differences in plant traits offered no important insights regarding vulnerability to deer or earthworms. Transplanting native species into secondary forests can succeed in restoring understorey communities, but will require fencing or substantial deer population reductions to be successful long term.

AB  - Introduction: Seasonally dry tropical forests are subject to chronic degradation processes, which has reduced the populations of some important animal dispersers. Intensive livestock farming within the forest remnants is considered one of the main causes of these degradation processes. However, domestic ungulates could also be fulfilling the role of seed dispersal for some wild species. Objective: To evaluate the role of goats as seed dispersers of woody species and the possible consequences of their feeding behavior on the vegetation structure. Methods: Between December 2016 and June 2017, we collected goat feces from pens (N = 38) and vegetation plots (N = 42) from three locations of dry forest in the Southwestern Ecuador. All the seeds found in the feces (N = 13 326) were recorded and taxonomically identified. To evaluate the effect of gut passage on seed germination, we sowed the seeds found in the goat feces from the pens and seeds collected directly from parent plants. Results: Goats dispersed seeds from ten species, of which at least 50 % are legumes. Acacia macracantha seeds represented ca. 70 % of seeds present in goat feces. The passage of seeds through the digestive tract of goats significantly improved the percentage and speed of germination in Albizia multiflora, Piscidia carthagenensis and Ziziphus thyrsiflora, while in Choroleucon mangense and Prosopis juliflora no germination was registered. We did not find a correlation between the richness of established trees and the number of species found in the goat feces (chi(2) = -0.23, P = 0.53). The composition of dispersed seed species in the feces did not show a dependency on the locality, although the composition of the established vegetation changes between localities. The frequency of seeds in the feces did not show a relationship with the tree abundance in the established vegetation. Conclusions: Goats can play, at least partially, the role of locally extinct wild ungulates, improving the germination of legume species with hard coat. However, this positive effect can be blurred by their feeding behavior and high preference for particular species, which can modify the dominance of some species, and result in changes in the composition and structure of the vegetation.

AB  - Human activity is omnipresent in our landscapes. Animals can perceive risk from humans similar to predation risk, which could affect their fitness. We assessed the influence of the relative intensity of recreational activities on the bodyweight and pregnancy rates of red deer (Cervus elaphus) between 1985 and 2015. We hypothesized that stress, as a result of recreational activities, affects the pregnancy rates of red deer directly and indirectly via a reduction in bodyweight. Furthermore, we expected non-motorized recreational activities to have a larger negative effect on both bodyweight and fecundity, compared to motorized recreational activities. The intensity of recreational activities was recorded through visual observations. We obtained pregnancy data from female red deer that were shot during the regular hunting season. Additionally, age and bodyweight were determined through a post-mortem examination. We used two Generalized-Linear-Mixed Models (GLMM) to test the effect of different types of recreation on (1) pregnancy rates and (2) bodyweight of red deer. Recreation had a direct negative correlation with the fecundity of red deer, with bodyweight, as a mediator as expected. Besides, we found a negative effect of non-motorized recreation on fecundity and bodyweight and no significant effect of motorized recreation. Our results support the concept of humans as an important stressor affecting wild animal populations at a population level and plead to regulate recreational activities in protected areas that are sensitive. The fear humans induce in large-bodied herbivores and its consequences for fitness may have strong implications for animal populations.

AB  - Tree diversity can promote both predator abundance and diversity. However, whether this translates into increased predation and top-down control of herbivores across predator taxonomic groups and contrasting environmental conditions remains unresolved. We used a global network of tree diversity experiments (TreeDivNet) spread across three continents and three biomes to test the effects of tree species richness on predation across varying climatic conditions of temperature and precipitation. We recorded bird and arthropod predation attempts on plasticine caterpillars in monocultures and tree species mixtures. Both tree species richness and temperature increased predation by birds but not by arthropods. Furthermore, the effects of tree species richness on predation were consistent across the studied climatic gradient. Our findings provide evidence that tree diversity strengthens top-down control of insect herbivores by birds, underscoring the need to implement conservation strategies that safeguard tree diversity to sustain ecosystem services provided by natural enemies in forests.

AB  - Tropical dry woodlands provide ecosystem services to hundreds of millions of people and support high biodiversity. Despite their importance, many dry woodlands are under high and rising human pressure, including in India, where they provide essential habitat for iconic megafauna. However, there are notable gaps in our understanding of long-term changes in dry woodlands and how they relate to the present-day distribution of megafauna. Here, we reconstructed tropical dry woodland change since the 19th century, identified archetypes of change, and explored their relationship with current megafauna distributions. More specifically, we compared the reliability of existing satellite-based woodland maps and integrated them into an ensemble map of contemporary dry woodland cover in India. This allowed us to derive recent changes in dry woodlands since 1995 and, by integrating them with historical maps, long-term changes since 1880. Finally, we used non-parametric spatial clustering to detect typical patterns of long-term woodland change and compared these to the current distribution of 14 megafauna species. These analyses yielded four major insights. First, we show a massive historical loss of dry woodland cover in India since the 19th century, with over 22 Mha (equaling 65% of dry woodlands) lost, underscoring the threatened nature of these ecosystems. Second, we identified six archetypes of woodland change, three characterized by different levels of continuous woodland decline and three showing a forest transition pattern of historical decline, stability, and subsequent recovery. This highlights the regional variations in woodland dynamics across India's dry woodlands. Third, we found a strong and positive link between current megafauna distribution and high woodland cover, especially for threatened species (r = 0.43, p < 0.05), regardless of woodland histories, pointing to the importance of maintaining larger tracts of dry woodlands for safeguarding megafauna and for megafauna restoration potential where woodlands are recovering. Finally, we show that Indian dry woodlands are still undergoing widespread losses of 6.5 Mha since 1995, and pressure on them has been increasing recently. Therefore, better protection and monitoring of dry woodlands is urgently needed, and our analyses can provide a basis for context-specific land-use and conservation planning.

AB  - Context In rangelands, alterations to vegetation from grazing have potentially significant consequences for a wide variety of ecosystem structure and function.
   Objectives This study measured the herbivory effects of adaptive multi-paddock grazing (AMP) and continuous grazing (CG) practices on spatial patterns of vegetation, plant community species composition, and productivity in neighboring ranches in Mississippi, USA.
   Methods Assessments included on ground-measurements and remote sensing analyses using fine-scale aerial photographs and satellite images.
   Results The results indicated that the spatial patterns of the classified seven vegetation species groups and biomass production were different between AMP and CG. Bahiagrass dominated the plant species in both ranches, with similar to 83% and 58% of the CG and AMP ranch vegetation cover. The AMP ranch landscape was fragmented, more diverse at a fine spatial scale, and consisted of smaller, more similar patch sizes for all seven species. A patchy mosaic of all the species was found, but no species were abundant adequately to interconnect throughout the entire landscape. In contrast, patch sizes on the CG ranch were more aggregated, with one dominant species clumped into larger compact patches. Vegetation production in the AMP ranch was higher and clustered into large patches: Hot and Cold Spots with an apparent spatial trend and configuration. In contrast, in the CG ranch, relatively smaller Spots were interspersed with no apparent spatial trend.
   Conclusions The findings imply a potential change in the landscape pattern of grazing land in the Southern U.S. associated with adoption of AMP grazing.

AB  - Habitat selection and daily activity patterns of large herbivores might be affected by inter- and intra-specific interaction, changes of spatial scale, and seasonal temperature. To reveal what factors were driving the habitat selection of moose, we collected moose (Alces alces) and roe deer (Capreolus pygargus bedfordi) occurrence data, analyzed the multi-scale habitat selection and daily activity patterns of moose, and quantified the effects of spatial heterogeneity distribution of temperature, as well as the occurrence of roe deer on these habitat selection processes. Our results suggested that moose and roe deer distribution spatially overlap and that moose habitat selection is especially sensitive to landscape variables at large scales. We also found that the activity patterns of both sexes of moose had a degree of temporal separation with roe deer. In the snow-free season, temperatures drove moose habitat selection to be limited by threshold temperatures of 17 degrees C; in the snowy season, there were no similar temperature driving patterns, due to the severe cold environment. The daily activity patterns of moose showed seasonal change, and were more active at dawn and nightfall to avoid heat pressure during the snow-free season, but more active in the daytime for cold adaptation to the snow season. Consequently, this study provides new insights on how the comprehensive effects of environmental change and inter- and intra- specific relationships influence the habitat selection and daily activity patterns of moose and other heat sensitive animals with global warming.

AB  - The ocean's twilight zone is a vast area of the global ocean that lies between the sunlit surface waters and perpetually dark midnight zones, covering depths from similar to 200 to 1000 m. Recent work in the twilight (or mesopelagic) zone has revealed unexpected biomass and diversity that may not only challenge scientific understanding of marine systems but also provide a new and largely untapped resource for fisheries harvest. A key knowledge gap in our understanding of the mesopelagic is how its food webs support foraging activity by commercially valuable, highly migratory top predators. Here, we use compound-specific stable isotope analyses to trace the flow of carbon through pelagic ecosystems in the northwest Atlantic to three predators: bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), swordfish (Xiphias gladius), and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). Temperate mesopelagic-associated carbon was estimated as both a direct and an indirect source of predator carbon, alongside temperate epipelagic and mixed epi-mesopelagic tropical carbon, via Bayesian mixing models. The contribution of temperate mesopelagic carbon to individual predators ranged from 5% to 94%, with means of 62%, 46%, and 28% for bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and swordfish, respectively. We also found that carbon sources of predators shifted seasonally as they moved between temperate and tropical waters by contrasting tissues (liver, muscle) and season of sampling (summer, fall). These results inform our understanding of the adaptive value of deep diving behaviors in large marine predators and provide key estimates of food web linkages to inform multi-species fisheries management of both mesopelagic prey and migratory predators.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) overbrowsing over the past several decades has caused substantial changes to plant communities in eastern deciduous forests. Deer-preferred species have declined or become locally extirpated in many areas while deer-tolerant species have greatly increased in abundance. Moreover, the abundance of nonnative invasive species has also increased over the last few decades, outcompeting many native species. Native shrubs such as Sambucus canadensis (American elderberry) are now much less common, particularly in urban forests and forests with high deer densities. Here, we performed a short-term study in which we introduced propagations of a native shrub into a replicated field experiment in which we factorially manipulated deer presence or absence and invasive species presence or absence by using exclosures and removing invasive species. We monitored metrics of S. canadensis fitness including leaf count and plant height over two growing seasons. Browsing substantially reduced survival whereas invasive species provided a modest degree of associational resistance. Browsing significantly decreased both leaf count and plant height. By the end of the study, individuals within exclosures had over twice the number of leaves, were five times taller, and had much lower mortality versus those exposed to browsing. Removing invasive species did not change plant height, however, S. canadensis individuals experienced marginally higher leaf counts inside exclosures where we had removed invasive species. This trend was opposite in individuals outside of fences such that those growing within patches where invasive species remained had slightly higher leaf counts, especially during the first growing season. Until the final census date, elderberry growing within patches of invasive species had slightly lower mortality versus those growing in patches where invasive species had been removed. The results from our short-term study indicate that browsing is more inimical to a native shrub than competition from invasive species and we did not find evidence of associational resistance to browsing from invasive cover.

AB  - Invasive alien species play a major role in biodiversity decline. We studied the impacts of invasive alien plant species (IAPS) on bird assemblages and their habitats in Jalthal Forest, a biogeographically unique lowland remnant forest in eastern Nepal. We surveyed birds by point counts and quantified environmental variables at 89 sites. Observations of 1,373 individuals of 86 species showed that species richness was the highest in wooded grasslands and floodplains and lowest in sal forests invaded by IAPS, whereas abundance was highest in IAPS-invaded forests. Abundance and richness decreased with increasing cover of IAPS, shrub cover and distance to water. The abundance and richness of every feeding guild except omnivores were negatively correlated with IAPS cover. Our results increase our understanding of the impacts of IAPS on birds and clearly indicate the need of controlling IAPS in Jalthal Forest, and thus, are valuable for forest management and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The effects of grazing on wildlife have received considerable attention. Depending on factors such as its intensity and duration, grazing can impact higher-level species along the food chain through competition for available resources with wild herbivores. However, relatively few studies have investigated whether there are tipping points at which grazing intensity begins to seriously impact wildlife. In particular, studies that assess the impact of overgrazing on food chains that include carnivores remain scarce. We developed a time dynamic, agestructured model for the wild ungulates-Amur tiger trophic chain, including cattle grazing as a disturbance. We explored 1) the impact of cattle grazing intensity on the long-term behaviour of the wildlife population; 2) the effect of demographic parameters on wildlife population viability; and 3) the temporal dynamic impact of periods of heavy grazing on the population trajectory. Our results showed that increasing cattle density reaches a tipping point, triggering a rapid and significant shift in wildlife population size. Below the tipping point, wildlife can coexist with grazing livestock; when cattle density exceeds the tipping point, wild ungulate and tiger populations move towards extinction. In the case of heavy grazing, the dynamics of the wild ungulate population was more affected by its intensity, and the dynamics of the Amur tiger population was more affected by its duration. Our model and results suggest that theoretically wildlife conservation and cattle production can coexist but that serious regime shifts in wildlife populations may occur if grazing intensity exceeds a tipping point. These findings provide new insights useful for developing policies related to balancing livestock and wildlife conservation.

AB  - Tree species diversity generally has positive effects on forest primary productivity and resistance to natural perturbations, but diversity-function relationships can vary with site conditions. Recently, studies in forest diversity experiments have shown that tree diversity and local climate, in particular drought intensity, interactively affect insect herbivory. On the other hand, many studies focused on the response of forests to drought in terms of tree growth but without analysing the concomitant effects on susceptibility to pests. It is of particular interest to understand the combined effects of drought and tree diversity on the growth of the host tree, since host resource concentration is a determining factor of a pest's host choice.
   We used a tree diversity experiment where tree species diversity and drought conditions were both manipulated to evaluate their interactive effects on the susceptibility of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster A & iuml;t.) forests to two primary pests (i.e. infesting healthy trees): the pine stem borer (PSB) Dioryctria sylvestrella, and the pine processionary moth (PPM; a leaf chewer), Thaumetopoea pityocampa. Using structural equation models, we investigated the direct and indirect effects (i.e. mediated by host resources) of the presence of birch and drought on the total number of attacks of PPM and PSB, in the same plots and in the same year.
   We showed that pine-birch plots were more resistant to both PPM and PSB attacks than pine monocultures. Furthermore, we found that this associational resistance pattern was due to direct effects of birch trees on attacks, possibly related to disrupting non-host volatiles (NHVs), but also to indirect, resource-mediated effects whereby the presence of birch trees reduced the amount of host pine resources available to the pests. Drought conditions modulated birch mediated effects on resistance of maritime pine forests only for PSB attacks. Overall, our work improves our understanding of tree diversity-herbivory relationships and helps explain how climate might modulate such relationships.

AB  - Previous studies revealed extensive genetic introgression between Ovis species, which affects genetic adaptation and morphological traits. However, the exact evolutionary scenarios underlying the hybridization between sheep and allopatric wild relatives remain unknown. To address this problem, we here integrate the reference genomes of several ovine and caprine species: domestic sheep, argali, bighorn sheep, snow sheep, and domestic goats. Additionally, we use 856 whole genomes representing 169 domestic sheep populations and their six wild relatives: Asiatic mouflon, urial, argali, snow sheep, thinhorn sheep, and bighorn sheep. We implement a comprehensive set of analyses to test introgression among these species. We infer that the argali lineage originated similar to 3.08 to 3.35 Mya and hybridized with the ancestor of Pachyceriforms (e.g. bighorn sheep and snow sheep) at similar to 1.56 Mya. Previous studies showed apparent introgression from North American Pachyceriforms into the Bashibai sheep, a Chinese native sheep breed, despite of their wide geographic separation. We show here that, in fact, the apparent introgression from the Pachyceriforms into Bashibai can be explained by the old introgression from Pachyceriforms into argali and subsequent recent introgression from argali into Bashibai. Our results illustrate the challenges of estimating complex introgression histories and provide an example of how indirect and direct introgression can be distinguished.

AB  - In dry climates, livestock farming contributes to waterhole creation and maintenance, thereby contributing to biodiversity conservation. However, these lentic water bodies also represent a critical environmental connection between microorganisms and their vertebrate hosts since the water can facilitate pathogen persistence and transmission. Therefore, interventions for tuberculosis (TB) risk mitigation at the wildlife-livestock interface often focus on segregating host species at water points. We hypothesized that waterhole characteristics modulate their use by vertebrates and subsequent pathogen exposure risk. We visited 298 waterholes on 80 TB-positive and 40 TB-negative cattle farms in Spain to assess differences in waterhole characteristics and identify possible management implications. There was an average of 2.7 waterholes per farm. This represents 0.02 waterholes per km(2) of farmland and 3.5 m(2) of lentic waterbodies per km(2) of farmland. Among the studied waterholes, 95% were man-made. Waterholes on TB-positive farms were 42% closer to covering vegetation than waterholes located on TB-negative ones. Farms with man-made waterholes showed a higher risk of TB than those with natural ones. The density of waterholes per surface unit was negatively associated with the farm TB risk. Waterholes placed on TB-positive farms were more intensively trampled by livestock. The best model explained farm positivity to TB as a function of the distance from the waterholes to the nearest cover vegetation, the aquatic vegetation richness found in the waterhole, the intensity of livestock use (trampling), the surrounding waterhole density, and the interaction between waterhole perimeter and the total number of signs of potential wildlife TB hosts per waterhole. Identifying the key waterhole features related to infection risk might allow designing One Health-inspired biosecurity measures such as increasing the number of waterholes, placing new waterholes farther away from cover, or fencing-out cattle from wildlife-rich waterholes to balance biodiversity conservation and animal health needs in extensive grazing systems.

AB  - The introduction of artificial nighttime lighting due to human settlements and transport networks is increasingly altering the timing, intensity, and spectra of natural light regimes worldwide. Much of the research on the impacts of nighttime light pollution on organisms has focused on animal species. Little is known about the impacts of daylength extension due to outdoor lighting technologies on wild plant communities, despite the fact that plant growth and development are under photoperiodic control. In a five-year field experiment, artificial ecosystems ("mesocosms") of grassland communities both alone or in combination with invertebrate herbivores and predators were exposed to light treatments that simulated street lighting technologies (low-pressure sodium, and light-emitting diode [LED]-based white lighting), at ground-level illuminance. Most of the plant species in the mesocosms did not exhibit changes in biomass accumulation after 5 years of exposure to the light treatments. However, the white LED treatment had a significant negative effect on biomass production in the herbaceous species Lotus pedunculatus. Likewise, the interaction between the white LED treatment and the presence of herbivores significantly reduced the mean shoot/root ratio of the grass species Holcus lanatus. Artificial nighttime lighting had no effect on the foliar carbon or nitrogen in most of the grassland species. Nevertheless, the white LED treatment significantly increased the leaf nitrogen content in Lotus corniculatus in the presence of herbivores. Long-term exposure to artificial light at night had no general effects on plant biomass responses in experimental grassland communities. However, species-specific and negative effects of cool white LED lighting at ground-level illuminance on biomass production and allocation in mixed plant communities are suggested by our findings. Further studies on the impacts of light pollution on biomass accumulation in plant communities are required as these effects could be mediated by different factors, including herbivory, competition, and soil nutrient availability.

AB  - Body size and body mass are key indicators of individual phenotypic quality and predictors of important lifehistory traits such as survival and reproductive success. In wild herbivores, individual responses to changing environmental conditions influence morphometric traits over temporal scales and between populations. However, little research has assessed joint effects of weather and land use on body size/mass at finer, intra-population scale. We used data collected on female and juvenile red deer Cervus elaphus shot over a 17-year period (2001-2017) along two sides of a mountainous ridge largely differing in land cover and habitat productivity, to investigate how fine-scale land use patterns and weather influenced multiple morphometric indicators of phenotypic quality. Accounting for weather, body mass of all sex/age classes increased with increasing proportion of cultivated areas in the landscape and, for young females and calves, that increase was stronger or occurred only in the "low-quality" site. Other biometric traits such as mandible length and hind foot length showed the same pattern in young and calves, suggesting that body mass/size reflects individual responses especially in the early life-stage. Accounting for land use, body mass of adult females and calves was enhanced by increasing rainfall and decreasing temperature in spring-summer, i.e. favourable conditions for vegetation growth. This result also supports late gestation- and lactation-mediated effects of vegetation productivity on offspring quality. Additionally, in male calves, body mass and several other traits increased with decreasing severity of the previous winter, suggesting that quality of male offspring - but not that of females - could depend on winter conditions experienced in utero, likely due to higher maternal costs. Our findings emphasise how land cover and weather jointly affect indicators of phenotypic quality in a large mammal, helping to predict size responses of herbivores under the ongoing climatic- and anthropogenic land use-changes.

AB  - The majority of Africa's parks and conservation areas have a vast road network, facilitating motorized vehicle game viewing. These roads have an influence that is both road type- and species-specific, on the surrounding ecosystem. Due to their higher traffic volumes, we hypothesized that tar roads and their immediate surrounds within the Kruger National Park, South Africa, are avoided to a greater extent by medium-to-large mammals than comparable dirt roads in the park. We systematically recorded the presence of medium-to-large mammal species from our vehicle, recording data at 401 tar and 369 dirt road stops in the Kruger National Park. In addition to species presence, we also estimated the proximity of animals to the road, as well as herd sizes. Our results indicate an equal likelihood of viewing the commonly recorded medium-to-large mammal species from both road types. The likelihood of observing larger herd sizes was also similar between tar and dirt roads for the three most commonly observed species, African elephant (Loxodonta africana), impala (Aepyceros melampus), and plains zebra (Equus quagga), and the likelihood of viewing impala and zebra close to the road also did not differ between tar and dirt roads. However, elephant was observed more often close to tar roads, compared to dirt roads. We interpreted this as the result of potentially increased woody cover associated with more water runoff in close proximity to tar roads compared with dirt roads. Our results not only have ecological significance, supporting the notion that many of the park's species are habituated to human infrastructure, but also management implications, informing park officials about the influence of road traffic and road type on wildlife distributions.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Salvia pratensis L. (Meadow Clary) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Salvia pratensis is an erect, rosette-forming, perennial herb with a broad native distribution covering much of Europe-from the British Isles, Spain and Morocco in the west, across Europe into Asia, as far east as the Urals. In the British Isles, the species is nationally scarce, confined to a few south- to west-facing sites with calcareous soils in Southern England and one site in Wales. It is predominately found in unimproved pasture, hay meadows and grassy verges, but can occur on the fringes of scrub or woodland. Although the species is abundant in central Europe, changes to land management since the mid-20th century have resulted in fragmented and threatened populations in several European countries. It is cultivated as an ornamental, as is S. x sylvestris, the hybrid with S. nemorosa. Populations are typically gynodioecious, having both female (male-sterile) and hermaphrodite individuals at variable proportions. The species has a mixed mating system and is self-compatible via insect pollination, but predominantly outcrosses. Honeybees and bumblebees are abundant pollinators, but a diverse range of bee species and other insect species visit S. pratensis flowers. Inbreeding depression has been documented, presenting a conservation concern for small, fragmented populations. The species is the focus of conservation efforts and has been reintroduced to sites where it had become locally extinct in Britain. To sustain favourable habitat, site management should maintain low soil nutrient levels, and prevent scrub encroachment and the dominance of coarse grasses. The removal of sward by hay cutting or grazing after plants have flowered and set seed is advised, in addition to maintaining a degree of disturbance to provide bare patches of soil for seedling recruitment.

AB  - 1. Understanding arctic ecosystem function is key to understanding future global carbon (C) and nutrient cycling processes. However, small mammal herbivores can have effects on ecosystems as structure builders and these effects have been underrepresented in the understanding of arctic systems.
   2. We examined the impact of small mammal structures (hay piles, runways, latrines) on soils and plants in three arctic tundra regions near Utqiagvik, Toolik Lake, and Nome, Alaska. Our aims were to (1) examine how vole and lemming structures influence plant and soil nutrient pools and microbial processes, (2) determine if structure effects were similar across tundra system types, and (3) understand how changes in the abundance and cover of these structures during different phases of small mammal multi-annual population cycles might influence biogeochemical cycling.
   3. In general, small mammal structures increased nitrogen (N) availability in soils, although effects varied by study region. Across study regions, hay piles were relatively uncommon (lowest % cover) but increased multiple soil N and P pools, C-and N-acquiring enzyme activities, and leaf phosphorus (P) concentrations, with the specific nutrient variables and size of the effects varying by study region. Latrines had the second highest cover and influenced multiple C, N and P pools, but their effects were mainly observed within a single region. Lastly, runways had the highest % cover of all activity types but increased the fewest number of soil nutrient variables.
   4. We conclude that by influencing soil nutrient availability and biogeochemical cycling, small mammal structures can influence bottom-up regulation of ecosystem function, particularly during the high phase of the small mammal population cycle. Future changes in these population cycles might alter the role of small mammals in the Arctic and have lasting effects on system processes.

AB  - Soil biodiversity plays a critical role in supporting multiple ecosystem functions. As some of the most diverse and abundant metazoans on the Earth, soil nematode communities exhibit changes along environmental gradients, but the ways in which the abundance and diversity of nematode communities vary along elevational gradients remain poorly understood. Taking advantage of an investigation on Huangshan Mountain, Southeast China, with elevation ranging from 500 to 1200 m, we assessed the abundance and diversity of soil nematodes, as well as the soil physicochemical properties, across subtropical forest ecosystems. Nematode communities were analyzed at the genus level, and the alpha-diversity was calculated as the genus richness, while the beta-diversity was based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. The results showed that, among the top 20 nematode genera ranked by absolute abundance, most genera, such as Eucephalobus, Prismatolaimus, Filenchus, and Rotylenchulus, reached their peak abundance at the highest elevation (1000 m). Additionally, the abundances of Oriverutus, Tylenchus, Criconema, and Tripyla exhibited a positive correlation with the elevation. Moreover, the abundance and alpha-diversity of the total nematodes and each trophic group of nematodes increased linearly with the elevation, likely due to increased soil moisture at higher elevation. In contrast, the beta-diversity of the total nematodes, bacterivores, and herbivores decreased with increasing elevation, indicating the importance of stochastic processes in shaping community assembly at high altitudes. This pattern suggests that as the elevation increases, the nematode communities become more homogeneous in structure. Taken together, our study's findings demonstrate the divergent responses of nematodes' alpha- and beta-diversity to an elevation gradient, highlighting the importance of the soil nematode diversity in maintaining ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling and food web stability in mountainous regions. These results emphasize the need to incorporate the below-ground biodiversity into conservation strategies, particularly in the face of environmental changes driven by climate and human activities.

AB  - Mammal species globally exhibit distribution patterns conditioned by environmental conditions and human impact. The Mediterranean basin provides an ideal system to study these effects due to its diverse climate, and habitat conditions. In this work, we aim to assess the impact of landscape heterogeneity and anthropization degree on terrestrial mammal diversity in this region. Accordingly, we deployed over 300 camera traps across 28 sites for 3 months. Detected mammal species (weighing more than 1kg) were classified as domestic carnivores, domestic ungulates, wild carnivores, wild ungulates, lagomorphs, and large rodents. Alpha and beta diversity were calculated for each group and all wild mammals. Simple linear regressions and multimodal analysis were conducted between mammal diversities and climate, environmental conditions, landscape heterogeneity, and anthropization degree variables. Redundancy analyses were performed to identify variables and species determining the mammalian community composition. Indexes measuring landscape heterogeneity, anthropization degree, and its 30-year change did not correlate with mammal diversity. However, the difference in elevation within sites and domestic carnivore abundance showed a significant positive correlation with some of the diversity indexes. Nonetheless, rainfall and mean elevation factors generally showed the highest correlation with mammal diversity. Instead, a few influential species, including generalists and open-habitat specialists, highlighted the importance of conserving open areas, as well as the importance of the Pyrenees region as a key habitat for certain species. Therefore, climatic variables emerged as the key determinants of mammal diversity, highlighting climate change as a potential threat to mammal diversity in this area.
   This study investigates the impact of landscape features and human influence on terrestrial mammal diversity in the Mediterranean basin using 300 camera traps across 28 sites. Contrary to expectations, landscape heterogeneity and anthropization did not correlate with mammal diversity. Instead, elevation differences, domestic carnivore abundance, rainfall, and mean elevation emerged as key factors, emphasizing climate change as a major threat to mammal populations in the region. image

AB  - The desert steppe is an important component of arid and semiarid grassland, and plays a crucial role in livestock production. Livestock grazing is a key driver of grassland biodiversity, ecosystem functionality, and stability. However, the effects of grazing on temporal stability of the ecosystem across spatial scales in desert steppe remains unclear. Here, we conducted a five-year sheep grazing experiment encompassing three grazing intensities, namely no grazing (NG), medium grazing (MG), and heavy grazing (HG). This was undertaken at five different spatial scales of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 m2 in a desert steppe, northern China. We tested how grazing has impacted on species diversity, asynchrony, stability, and ecosystem stability across different spatial scales. We found that grazing did not alter the species diversity. However, there was a decrease in ecosystem stability and species asynchrony across spatial scales. MG increased the species stability across spatial scales, while it was reduced under HG. Species asynchrony and stability were negatively associated with diversity. They were positively related to ecosystem stability and formed a negative relationship between species diversity and ecosystem stability across spatial scales. Grazing weakened the negative influence of diversity on species asynchrony, and the insurance influence of asynchrony on ecosystem stability. This reduced the destabilizing effects of species diversity on temporal stability of the ecosystem across spatial scales. Structural equation modeling has shown that grazing indirectly decreased ecosystem stability only through reduction of species asynchrony and stability. This highlights the important regulatory functions of species asynchrony and stability with grazing across spatial scales in desert steppe. We suggest that biodiversity should be balanced against grazing intensity to achieve a high level of ecosystem function and stability with increasing spatial scales in arid grassland.

AB  - Fauna of North America's Great Plains evolved strategies to contend with the region's extreme spatiotemporal variability in weather and low annual primary productivity. The capacity for large-scale movement (migration and/or nomadism) enables many species, from bison to lark buntings, to track pulses of productivity at broad spatial scales (> 1 000 km(2)). Furthermore, even sedentary species often rely on metapopulation dynamics over extensive landscapes for long-term population viability. The current complex pattern of land ownership and use of Great Plains grasslands challenges native species conservation. Approaches to managing both public and private grasslands, frequently focused at the scale of individual pastures or ranches, limit opportunities to conserve landscape-scale processes such as fire, animal movement, and metapopulation dynamics. Using the US National Land Cover Database and Cropland Data Layers for 2011-2017, we analyzed land cover patterns for 12 historical grassland and savanna communities (regions) within the US Great Plains. On the basis of the results of these analyses, we highlight the critical contribution of restored grasslands to the future conservation of Great Plains biodiversity, such as those enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program. Managing disturbance regimes at larger spatial scales will require acknowledging that, where native large herbivores are absent, domestic livestock grazing can function as a central component of Great Plains disturbance regimes if they are able move at large spatial scales and coexist with a diverse array of native flora and fauna. Opportunities to increase the scale of grassland management include 1) spatial prioritization of grassland restoration and reintroduction of grazing and fire, 2) finding creative approaches to increase the spatial scale at which fire and grazing can be applied to address watershed to landscape-scale objectives, and 3) developing partnerships among government agencies, landowners, businesses, and conservation organizations that enhance cross-jurisdiction management and address biodiversity conservation in grassland landscapes, rather than pastures.

AB  - Kelp forests, one of the world's most productive ecosystems, have been in decline in many regions in recent years. Climate change, through steady sea warming or marine heatwaves, has led to the disappearance of entire populations, although kelp forest decline may also depend on non-climatic stressors such as grazing. Since the impacts of climate change are projected to continue to intensify for decades, marine protected areas (MPAs) have been suggested as a cost-effective strategy to boost the resilience of marine ecosystems. However, implementing an MPA does not guarantee that all components of the local community will benefit from it. In NW Spain, several stakeholders reported the decline of Laminaria ochroleuca inside the Islas Atlanticas Marine National Park in recent years, but the extent and possible drivers of this decline have not been investigated. Using a combination of quadrat-scale (abundance, biomass) and transect-scale (cover) seasonal surveys over one year, we found striking differences between L. ochroleuca reefs inside and outside the MPA. Populations outside the MPA were the typical canopy forests expected for a perennial kelp, stable year-round and composed mostly of adults. Inside the MPA, however, grazing prevented the canopy phase from being reached. Instead, only mid-sized young plants were detected in autumn, but most had disappeared by winter, and those that remained had been degraded by herbivores to mere blade-less stipes with no growth meristem that eventually perish. Further research seems warranted to monitor whether this phenomenon spreads to nearby kelp beds outside the MPA.

AB  - Desertification processes in Central Asia are largely dependent on soil degradation induced by excessive livestock grazing, besides climate changes. Desertification represents a threat to wildlife species living in arid environments, since reduced accessibility to water strongly affects their distribution and behavior. Moreover, livestock presence exacerbates competition with wildlife for scarce water resources. Given their crucial importance to wildlife persistence, water sources in arid environments are critical to the study of wildlife behavior and interspecific competition. The Small Gobi A is one such environment of Mongolia, characterized by high grazing pressure despite low human presence. Between September and October 2017, we conducted camera trapping surveys at two waterholes identified as potential drinking sources for wildlife. We aimed to explore the spatio-temporal interactions among large domestic ungulates (e.g., Bactrian camel Camelus bactrianus), and wild ungulates (e.g., Asian wild ass Equus hemionus, and goitered gazelle Gazella subgutturosa), which are among the most iconic and threatened ungulates of Mongolia. The results showed a complete spatial segregation between domestic and wild ungulates, and a high temporal segregation among wild ungulates. This study confirms spatial and temporal niche partitioning as a strategy adopted by wild species to reduce competition and allow species coexistence. We recommend enhanced management measures of free-roaming livestock to reduce the pressure on wild species at drinking sites.

AB  - The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the most rapidly warming regions on earth, and it is likely that the abundance and distribution of marine predators will change as a result. Procellariiform seabirds are highly mobile predators, which target specific habitat characteristics associated with underlying distributions of prey and areas of increased prey availability. We use ship surveys and hurdle models, to estimate the summer distribution and relative density of 11 seabird species within the northern Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem. Models differed among species; however, sea surface temperature and depth were frequently associated with seabird occurrence and had the greatest explanatory power across many species. Null models based on observation data were better at predicting seabird density than models that included environmental covariates. This suggests that the main driver of distribution patterns is the broad-scale habitat features, and fine-scale aggregations within these ranges are harder to predict. Our seabird distribution models reflect known habitat associations, species hotspots, and community organization relative to oceanic and coastal marine processes. Application of species distribution models will benefit the assessments of critical habitat and potential responses to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance, which will provide insight into how species may change in polar ecosystems.

AB  - The goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa), historically widespread across the Middle East and Central Asia, is now facing a critical threat due to habitat fragmentation and population decline, particularly in Iran. To better understand the reason for the low genetic diversity of goitered gazelle populations, we combined a genetic analysis (cytb gene) like genetic diversity and demographic history using non-invasive sampling techniques with a land use/land cover study by land use dynamic degree models (LUDD) and landscape change process analysis. The selection study area is based on several populations of goitered gazelle that are located on the southern slope of the Alborz Mountain range in Iran. The results showed an alarming paucity of nucleotide diversity (0.0019) within these populations. At the same time, analysis of land use and land cover changes in the same area showed that over the past 30 years (1990-2020) urban areas have had the most increase among other land use classes (growth rate: 171%). The knowledge acquired from this research not only contributes to our understanding of the genetic makeup of goitered gazelle populations but also underscores the importance of addressing land use changes and their consequences on biodiversity. These findings emphasize the need for targeted conservation efforts to counteract the effects of urban growth on goitered gazelle habitats. Such strategies are crucial for securing the future of these populations in the southern slopes of the Alborz Mountain range and similar regions facing similar pressures.

AB  - Understanding how resource diversification affects ecological interactions, food web structure and ecosystem functioning is essential in both fundamental and applied ecology. While plant diversification strategies (either in-field or around-field) are often proposed in agricultural landscapes as practices to improve the biological control of herbivores by natural enemies, results remain variable and unsure. Here, we studied the effect of an in-field diversification practice (the intercropping of leguminous crops within cereal fields, an increasingly common practice but with inconsistent results on biological control) on cereal aphid control and the structure of a cereal aphid-parasitoid-hyperparasitoid food web for 2 years. We report that aphid control was not increased in mixed fields, nor was cereal parasitoid diversity and food web complexity. Nevertheless, the provision of alternative hosts in mixed fields led to a functional community composition shift, favouring generalist parasitoid species over specialist ones. Moreover, we observed a higher hyperparasitism rate in mixed fields, suggesting that secondary parasitoids were favoured by alternative resources, which may have disrupted aphid control by primary parasitoids. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that parasitoid community composition shift and increased top-down control by the fourth trophic level can impact parasitoid efficiency to control herbivores. These results highlight the necessity to study fine-scale mechanisms within food webs to be able to set up efficient methods to support biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - There is little information about long-term spontaneous forest development after industrial disturbances. A field study was done along the chronosequence of unreclaimed post-mining sites (12, 25, 32, 60 and 90 years old), developing by spontaneous succession in the northwestern Czech Republic. Initial stages of forest development (12- to 60-yr-old) were dominated mainly by silver birch (Betula pendula) goat willow (Salix caprea) and aspen (Populus tremula), Norway spruce (Picea abies) also established naturally in the intermediate stages of succession. A 90-yr-old site was close to the expected climax forest with 21 woody species dominated by European oak (Quercus robus L.), supplemented by beech (Fagus sylvatica). The youngest and oldest sites were more diverse and richer sites in woody species than others, as expressed by the Shannon-Weiner and Simpson indices. Conversely, spatial heterogeneity (aggregation) increased with increasing age; however, it became lower at the age of 90 years. Woody species in the understory were more diverse than in the tree layer. Overall, our study found that spontaneous processes can lead to the development of the late-successional forest in fewer than 100 years in Central Europe.

AB  - Kelp forests are important habitats providing ecosystem functions and services in temperate zones. However, they have been declining globally at the warm edges of their range due to climate change and increased herbivory by tropical and subtropical animals. The decline and recovery of kelp forests significantly impact fish assemblages in large canopy-forming kelp forests, such as giant kelp forests in cool-temperate and subarctic regions. However, this impact is poorly understood in small stipitate-kelp forests with limited habitat for associated fishes in warm-temperate zones. This study reports the findings of a fish assemblage monitoring program in two small stipitate-kelp (Ecklonia cava) forests in warm-temperate reefs of western Japan: 1) a large-scale natural kelp forest and 2) a small-scale afforested kelp forest. The natural kelp forest substantially declined due to prolonged high water temperatures in summer of 2017, causing the kelp fish population to dwindle. However, when kelp stipe density and stipe length recovered to original levels in the following two years, average species richness and abundance of fishes returned to 95% and 47% of the original levels, respectively. For the afforested kelp forest site, when only the canopy (blade parts) was lost due to fish herbivory (the stipes remained) in 2022, the species richness and abundance of fishes decreased temporarily, suggesting that the presence of blade parts is crucial for fishes as a habitat even in small stipitate-kelp forests. Overall, these findings indicate that stipitate-kelp forests serve as living/shelter space and foraging ground for warm-temperate fishes and that full recovery of fish assemblages, particularly in terms of abundance, may lag behind kelp recovery.

AB  - The physical effects of climate warming have been well documented, but the biological responses are far less well known, especially at the ecosystem level and at large (intercontinental) scales. Global warming over the next century is generally predicted to reduce food web complexity, but this is rarely tested empirically due to the dearth of studies isolating the effects of temperature on complex natural food webs. To overcome this obstacle, we used 'natural experiments' across 14 streams in Iceland and Russia, with natural warming of up to 20 degrees C above the coldest stream in each high-latitude region, where anthropogenic warming is predicted to be especially rapid. Using biomass-weighted stable isotope data, we found that community isotopic divergence (a universal, taxon-free measure of trophic diversity) was consistently lower in warmer streams. We also found a clear shift towards greater assimilation of autochthonous carbon, which was driven by increasing dominance of herbivores but without a concomitant increase in algal stocks. Overall, our results support the prediction that higher temperatures will simplify high-latitude freshwater ecosystems and provide the first mechanistic glimpses of how warming alters energy transfer through food webs at intercontinental scales.
   Using streams spanning a local temperature gradient in both Iceland and Russia, we found that warming led to simpler food webs. We also found more herbivorous invertebrates with a diet of algae in warmer streams. These findings provide new insights into how warming can alter energy flow in freshwater ecosystems.image

AB  - Grassland insect diversity in many parts of the world is severely threatened by recent deterioration caused by global change and human activities. Insect species richness and abundance are likely sensitive to grassland degradation because of changes in vegetation structure and microclimates, and yet, our understanding of how diversity of insect community, particularly insect guilds responds to grassland degradation is still limited. Here, we conducted a field experiment to examine the responses of richness and abundance of total insects and different insect guilds along degraded levels (i.e., non-degraded, moderately, and severely degraded site) in meadow steppe at northeastern China. We found that higher species richness of total insects was detected in the moderately degraded sites, and there was no difference in abundance between the three sites. Furthermore, the responses of richness and abundance of each insect guild were significantly different. Hemiptera richness was significantly higher at moderately degraded sites, and Orthoptera richness was higher in severely degraded sites. Abundance of Hemiptera and Orthoptera increased with the increasing levels of degraded grasslands, but the abundance of Hymenoptera and Coleoptera decreased. Moreover, effect size of grassland degradation on Orthoptera abundance was larger from non-degraded to moderately degraded grassland; and larger effect size on Coleoptera abundance from moderately to severely degraded grassland. The different responses of insect guilds to grassland degradation are mainly attributed to changes in food and microclimate availability. In the light of convenience and operability, the finding from the study suggested that the abundance of an insect guild, rather than total insects and insect diversity seem to be a useful ecological indicator when assessing the levels of grassland degradation.

AB  - Studies on density and pathogen prevalence of Ixodes ricinus indicate that vegetation and local host community drive much of their variation between green spaces. Contrarily, micro-geographic variation is understudied, although its understanding could reduce disease risk. We studied the density of infectious nymphal Ixodes sp. ("DIN", proxy for disease hazard), density of questing nymphs ("DON") and nymphal infection prevalence ("NIP") near recreational forest infrastructure. Drag sampling within forest stands and at adjacent benches and trails was combined with vegetation surveys, camera trapping hosts and pathogen screening of ticks. We analysed Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. and its genospecies, with complementary analyses on Rickettsia sp., , Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Neoehrlichia mikurensis and Borrelia miyamotoi. . DIN was highest in forest interior and at trails enclosed by forest. Lower disease hazard was observed at benches and trails at forest edges. This infrastructure effect can be attributed to variation in vegetation characteristics and the habitat use of tick hosts, specifically roe deer, rodents and songbirds. DON is the main driver of DIN at micro-geographic scale and negatively affected by infrastructure and forest edges. A positive association with vegetation cover in understorey and canopy was observed, as were positive trends for local rodent and songbird abundance. NIP of different pathogens was affected by different drivers. Lower B. burgdorferi s.l. prevalence in the interior of forest stands, driven by its most prevalent genospecies B. afzelii, , points towards higher density of uninfected hosts there. . B. afzelii was positively associated with understorey containing tall species and with high canopy cover, whereas local bird community composition predicts B. garinii prevalence. A positive effect of songbird abundance and a negative effect of pigeons were observed. Our findings support amplification and inhibition mechanisms within forest stands and highlight that the effect of established drivers of DIN may differ based on the considered spatial scale.

AB  - Combining natural saltmarsh habitats with conventional barriers can provide a sustainable and cost-effective alternative for fully engineered flood protection, provided that a minimal salt marsh width can be guaranteed for a long period. Hence, it is essential to understand both the key factors and management options driving the lateral erodibility/stability of salt marshes.
   We aimed to determine how salt marsh management (i.e. grazing by large vs. small grazers vs. artificial mowing), marsh elevation and marsh age affect soil stability (i.e. soil collapse) and intrinsic lateral erodibility of salt marshes (i.e. particle-by-particle detachment). Soil cores were collected in high and low marshes (above and below 0.5 m MHWL, respectively) of different ages. At these locations, we compared cores from grazed areas to cores inside grazer exclosures, with and without artificial mowing. All cores were exposed to waves in flumes to test their stability and lateral erodibility.
   All soil cores were characterized by a stable fine-grained layer deposited on top of readily erodible sand. The thickness of the fine-grained layer was a key parameter in reducing salt marsh instability (cliff collapse). This layer thickness increased with marsh age and at lower elevations, but decreased with cattle grazing due to compaction.
   The erosion resistance of the fine-grained layer increased with (a) large grazers that compacted the soil by trampling, (b) mowing that excluded soil-bioturbating species, and (c) grazing by small grazers that promoted vegetation types with higher root density.
   Synthesis and applications. Overall, marshes with thinner cohesive and/or fine-grained top layers are more sensitive to lateral erosion than marshes with deep cohesive soils, independently of the management. Grazing and artificial mowing can reduce the erodibility of fine-grained soils, making salt marshes more resilient to lateral erosion. However, compaction by large grazers simultaneously leads to thinner fine-grained layers and lower elevation, potentially leading to more inundation under sea-level rise. Hence, to effectively manage salt marshes to enhance their contribution to coastal protection, we recommend (a) moderate/rotational livestock grazing, avoiding high intensity grazing in sediment-poor systems sensitive to sea-level rise and (b) investigating measures to preserve small grazers.

AB  - Extensive livestock production and urbanization entail modifications of natural landscapes, including installation of fences, development of agriculture, urbanization of natural areas, and construction of roads and infrastructure that, together, impact native fauna. Here, we evaluate the diversity and genetic structure of endemic guanacos (Lama guanicoe) of the Monte and Patagonian Steppe of central Argentina, which have been reduced and displaced by sheep ranching and other impacts of human activities. Analyses of genetic variation of microsatellite loci and d-loop revealed high levels of genetic variation and latitudinal segregation of mitochondrial haplotypes. There were indications of at least two historical populations in the Monte and the Patagonian Steppe based on shared haplotypes and shared demographic history among localities. Currently, guanacos are structured into three groups that were probably reconnected relatively recently, possibly facilitated by a reduction of sheep and livestock in recent decades and a recovery of the guanaco populations. These results provide evidence of the genetic effects of livestock activity and urbanization on wild herbivore populations, which were possibly exacerbated by an arid environment with limited productive areas. The results highlight the importance of enacting conservation management plans to ensure the persistence of ancestral and ecologically functional populations of guanacos.

AB  - Scientific and traditional knowledge meet: diet of the lowland tapir Tapirus terrestris in the Orinoquia region of Colombia. The lowland tapir Tapirus terrestris is the second largest mammal in South America. It occupies a wide variety of ecosystems where it fulfills key functional roles. It is mainly folivorous, supplementing its diet with fruits, insects, and aquatic invertebrates. The lowland tapir is considered fundamental in shaping forest undergrowth and in seed dispersal processes. Despite its functional importance, ecological aspects related to diet, habitat use, and food preferences are still unknown in much of its geographic range. Currently, these aspects in the Colombian Orinoquia are unknown. We wanted to develop an approximation to the diet of the lowland tapir in the Colombian Orinoquia based on analysis of fecal samples and traditional knowledge derived from citizen science monitoring. Fecal samples were collected between October 2015 and July 2018 and veg-etation monitoring and interviews with local communities were implemented. We recorded a total of 37 species of plants, 23 species of which were determined through traditional knowledge. The most representative species in fecal samples were Rudgea crassiloba, Attalea butyracea, Inga alba and Cecropia peltata. The plants most commonly recognized by local communities were Mauritia flexuosa, A. butyracea, Bellucia grossularioides and I. alba. Our results provide insight into the importance of tapirs in the consumption of large seeds such as M. flexuosa and A. butyracea that are considered of economic relevance for local communities. Incorporating citizen science monitoring allowed us to identify plant species that are taxonomically difficult to distinguish and to evaluate new information related to the natural history of cryptic species such as tapirs. This information is crucial to establish conservation strategies for the lowland tapir in the Orinoquia region of Colombia.

AB  - Dung decomposition is a key process affecting the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). However, dung decomposition and nutrients (i.e., C, N and P) cycling in relation to stocking rate are still poorly understood in the alpine meadow. In this study, we carried out a 720-days field experiment to explore the differences in composition, mass, decomposition and nutrient cycling between sheep dung collected from grazing grassland with a high stocking rate (HSRD) and a low stocking rate (LSRD). Our results demonstrate that the dung mass, and C, N and P return were significantly higher for HSRD, whereas the C and N content were significantly greater in LSRD. The time required to achieve 75 % C, N and P loss from HSRD was longer (859.06 to 2664.7 days) than that (806.6 to 2123.7 days) from LSRD. However, after 720 days of decomposition, the release rates of DM (dry matter), C and N from LSRD were lower than that from HSRD; as a result, the leaching and residual mass respectively accounted for 2.03 % and 31.95 % of the original C content in LSRD, which were lower than that in HSRD (2.45 and 36.48 %, respectively); N released into the atmosphere (37.13 %) from LSRD was greater than that (32.08 %) from HSRD. Our findings suggest that stocking rate may change dung quantity, composition and decomposition rate, affecting biogeochemical cycling processes in grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Deterrents that are designed to emulate humans or natural predators are increasingly applied to manage the behaviors and distribution of conflict-prone species, but the efficacy of these tools is frequently challenged by the process of habituation. In this study, we investigated the responses of Roosevelt elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti) and black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) to playbacks of unimodal (acoustic) and multimodal (acoustic and visual) stimuli on crop fields in the Cowichan Valley, British Columbia, Canada. We contrasted behavioral responses to acoustic recordings of (i) human voices (shouting and talking), (ii) natural predator vocalizations (wolf and cougar), (iii) dog barks, and (iv) local bird vocalizations (control) and tested the effect of flashing LED lights using alternating audio-light and audio-only treatments at the same sites over two 3-week periods. We found that multimodal stimuli increased the likelihood of fleeing by 4.7 in elk and 1.8 in deer but did not affect the time spent in alert postures. Among acoustic treatments, playbacks of human shouts tended to elicit greater flight responses than humans talking, natural predators, dogs, and bird sounds. Both species showed evidence of habituation to the deterrents as the 6-week experiment progressed, but elk responses declined more rapidly than deer, and rates of habituation for both species were slower when deterrents included flashing lights. For deer, alert responses declined more rapidly at sites surrounded by more houses and closer to highways. Together, our results indicate that recordings of humans shouting provided the most salient acoustic deterrent for these ungulates and that acoustic deterrents were enhanced with lights, but habituation to our stationary deterrents occurred rapidly, especially in proximity to human activity.

AB  - A free-fall baited camera lander was launched for the first time on the Cosmonaut Sea shelf of East Antarctica at a depth of 694 m during the 38th Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition (CHINARE) in 2022. We identified 31 unique taxa (23 were invertebrates and eight were fish) belonging to eight phyla from 2403 pictures and 40 videos. The Antarctic jonasfish (Notolepis coatsi) was the most frequently observed fish taxa. Ten species of vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) taxa were observed, accounting for 32% of all species. The maximum number (MaxN) of Natatolana meridionalis individuals per image frame was ten, and they were attracted to the bait. The macrobenthic community type were sessile suspension feeders with associated fauna (SSFA), which was shaped by the muddy substrata with scattered rocks. Rocks served as the best habitats for sessile fauna. The study reveals the megafauna community and their habitat by image survey in the Cosmonaut Sea for the first time. It helped us obtain Antarctic biodiversity baselines and monitoring data for future ecosystem health assessment and better protection.

AB  - Regulation of alien invasive species by indigenous generalist herbivores is a strong component of ecosystem biotic resistance. Globally, Australian Acacia species are highly invasive trees that are regulated by specialist invertebrate herbivores, granivorous birds and consumption by indigenous and exotic vertebrates in their native ranges. Australian Acacias have become highly invasive in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa where seeds are consumed by generalist bird, ant, and rodent species, but there is as yet no evidence that generalist herbivores consume the seedlings. Despite this, indigenous mice are common in the CFR and we consequently hypothesised that seedling herbivory by indigenous herbivores may limit survival of Acacia cyclops in relatively undisturbed indigenous ecosystems. Acacia cyclops seedlings were transplanted into indigenous CFR coastal "strandveld" vegetation at two distinct study sites and monitored for eight days in one of three caged treatments (i) no cage, (ii) partially caged excluding large mammalian herbivores or (iii) fully caged excluding all mammalian herbivores. Herbivory-induced seedling mortality without a cage and for partially caged plants was significantly greater than for fully caged plants (all contrasts P < 0.001). Rapid herbivory of A. cyclops seedlings in the uncaged and partially caged treatments was largely attributable to highly abundant striped mice, Rhabodmys pumilio. Seedling herbivory was not dependent on rodent density, which was consistently high (200-300 mice ha(-1)). However, seedling herbivory was higher in areas with dense vegetation and lower in open-canopy areas, probably because R. pumilio is known to avoid foraging in open areas. These generalist herbivores reduced A. cyclops recruitment in relatively undisturbed indigenous ecosystems, contributing to a degree of ecosystem resistance.

AB  - Savannahs are often branded by livestock grazing with resulting land degradation. Holistic management of livestock was proposed to contribute to biodiversity conservation by simulating native wildlife grazing behaviour. This study attempts the comparison of the impact of a holistic management regime to a wildlife grazing management regime on grass and ground-dwelling beetle species diversity on neighboring farms in Namibian rangeland. Results show that the response of biodiversity in species richness and composition to holistic management of livestock differs substantially from wildlife grazing with a positive impact. From a total of 39 identified species of ground-dwelling beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae, Carabidae) from 29 genera, eight species were found to be indicators for holistic management of livestock and three were found to be indicators for wildlife grazed rangeland. Observations suggest that holistic management of livestock may contribute to biodiversity conservation, but the differential effect of grazing management on species assemblages suggests that livestock grazing cannot replace native wildlife herbivory. Implications for insect conservation An adaptive management strategy such as holistic management used in this study shows the potential to support high beetle biodiversity. Holistic management of livestock thus aspects in favour for a sustainable form of grazing management for insect conservation even though it does not functionally replace grazing by native wildlife.

AB  - Spatial heterogeneity in ecological systems can result from animal-driven top-down processes, but despite some theoretical attention, the emergence of spatial heterogeneity from feedbacks caused by animals is not well understood empirically. Interactions between predators and prey influence animal movement and associated nutrient transport and release, generating spatial heterogeneity that cascades throughout ecological systems. Here, we synthesize the existing literature to evaluate the mechanisms by which terrestrial predators can generate spatial heterogeneity in biogeochemical processes through consumptive and non-consumptive effects. Overall, we propose that predators increase heterogeneity in ecosystems whenever predation is intense and spatially variable, whereas predator-prey interactions homogenize ecosystems whenever predation is weak or diffuse in space. This leads to several testable hypotheses: 1) that predation and carcass deposition at high-predation risk sites stimulate positive feedbacks between predation risk and nutrient availability; 2) that prey generate nutrient hotspots when they concentrate activity in safe habitats, but instead generate nutrient subsidies when they migrate daily between safe and risky habitats; 3) that herbivore body size mediates risk effects, such that megaherbivores are more likely to homogenize ecosystems and predator loss in general will tend to homogenize ecosystems. Testing these hypotheses will advance our understanding of whether predators amplify landscape heterogeneity in ecological systems.

AB  - Warming will likely stimulate Arctic primary production, but also soil C and N mineralization, and it remains uncertain whether the Arctic will become a sink or a source for CO2. Increasing insect herbivory may also dampen the positive response of plant production and soil C input to warming. We conducted an open-air warming experiment with Subarctic field layer vegetation in North Finland to explore the effects of warming (+3 degrees C) and reduced insect herbivory (67% reduction in leaf damage using an insecticide) on soil C and N dynamics. We found that plant root growth, soil C and N concentrations, microbial biomass C, microbial activity, and soil NH4+ availability were increased by both warming and reduced herbivory when applied alone, but not when combined. Soil NO3- availability increased by warming only and in-situ soil respiration by reduced herbivory only. Our results suggest that increasing C input from vegetation under climate warming increases soil C concentration, but also stimulates soil C turnover. On the other hand, it appears that insect herbivores can significantly reduce plant growth. If their abundance increases with warming as predicted, they may curtail the positive effect of warming on soil C concentration. Moreover, our results suggest that temperature and herbivory effects on root growth and soil variables interact strongly, which probably arises from a combination of N demand increasing under lower herbivory and soil mineral N supply increasing under higher temperature. This may further complicate the effects of rising temperatures on Subarctic soil C dynamics.

AB  - Invertebrate-derived DNA (iDNA) has been successfully utilized for surveying mammalian biodiversity in several ecosystems. Yet, as with all sampling methods, this approach suffers from potential biases, including those introduced by the choice of invertebrate sampler, as well as the stochasticity of DNA amplification during PCR. Occupancy modeling is a statistical framework that can help account for imperfect detections in sampling and can be used to improve iDNA surveys. Using a case study based on the DNA screened from the blood meals of leeches, we demonstrate how multiscale occupancy models can be applied to the molecular detection of vertebrates to reveal the nuances in iDNA detections. Leeches were collected across a habitat degradation gradient in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, in 2015 and 2016. We estimated three probabilities describing the occupancy, availability, and detection of three abundant mammals (bearded pig, muntjac and sambar deer) and compared how these values were impacted by environmental and technical covariates. For 2015, we found that null models without covariates revealed no clear differences in each of the three probabilities across taxa. However, in 2016, although the taxa have comparable occupancy, deviations occurred in the other two probabilities, with the sambar deer showing the lowest availability and muntjac with the lowest detection probability. Univariate models constructed for each taxon and year revealed differential impacts of the covariates; for example, a strong positive effect of DNA concentration on the detection of sambar deer and bearded pig was seen in 2016 only. Finally, our estimation of the minimum numbers of biological and technical replicates highlights the important trade-off between achieving high probabilities of availability and detection and realistic amounts of sampling. Our results showcase the use of occupancy models for leech-iDNA biodiversity surveys but highlight the potential effects of sample type, methodological design, and sample size.

AB  - The possible role of climate change in late Quaternary animal extinctions is hotly debated, yet few studies have investigated its direct effects on animal physiology to assess whether past climate changes might have had significant impacts on now-extinct species. Here we test whether climate change could have imposed physiological stress on the Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii during the mid-Holocene, when the species went extinct on mainland Australia. Physiological values for the devil were quantified using mechanistic niche models of energy and water requirements for thermoregulation, and soil-moisture-based indices of plant stress from drought to indirectly represent food and water availability. The spatial pervasiveness, extremity and frequency of physiological stresses were compared between a period of known climatic and presumed demographic stability (8000-6010 BP) and the extinction period (5000-3010 BP). We found no evidence of widespread negative effects of climate on physiological parameters for the devil on the mainland during its extinction window. This leaves cultural and demographic changes in the human population or competition from the dingo Canis dingo as the main contending hypotheses to explain mainland loss of the devil in the mid-Holocene.

AB  - Tree cavities are an essential resource for cavity-dwelling mammals, birds, invertebrates and fungi, and so are important for maintaining forest biodiversity. In North American forests, woodpeckers (Picidae) play a keystone role in cavity creation by excavating holes. However, in European forests many hole-nesting songbirds rely on non-excavated cavities that are formed by fungal decay and compartmentalization after tree damage. Several factors are recognised in initiating non-excavated cavities that are used by hole-nesting birds, including loss of a tree branch or stem breakage, but this topic is poorly studied. Here, we propose that bark stripping by large herbivores (e.g. Red Deer Cervus elaphus and European Bison Bison bonasus) could be another important, and previously overlooked, mechanism for initiating tree cavities that are used by hole-nesting birds. We suggest that, after the initial damage from herbivore bark-stripping, fungal decay can create specific elongated, slit-like cavities, which are particularly important as nest sites for some common forest songbirds. We outline this idea using original observations and evidence from the literature, primarily from the primeval forest in Poland's Bialowieza National Park. We also use studies from elsewhere in Europe to show a generally low usage of slit cavities by birds where large herbivores are scarce or absent. We suggest that restoring such animals in European forests could help to restore the abundance and diversity of the tree cavity resource for hole-dwelling species. We encourage future research to investigate this proposal of large herbivores being important agents of tree cavity formation that could enhance biodiversity.

AB  - Axis deer (Axis axis), an introduced invasive species of growing concern around the globe, have rapidly expanded through the southern cone countries in South America. Despite increasing culling efforts over 14 years, axis deer remained abundant at El Palmar National Park in north-eastern Argentina. We tested whether this continued abundance possibly reflected control failures as a result of adjacent plantation forests providing a safe-haven refuge for deer. We carried out a cross-sectional survey of deer faecal pellet groups and tracks in 77 matched pairs of 25 m(2) plots deployed at random over the park-plantation interface and assessed the presence of deer trails along the 14.2-km wire fence between both land-use types. The relative odds of having at least one pellet group (occupancy) were 4.5 (95% CI 1.5 to 18.3) times higher among park plots than plantation plots. Using generalized linear mixed models, the relative odds of occupancy decreased significantly with increasing distance to the main permanent water course, but it was 83% lower in plantation plots than in the park plots. Principal component analysis of shrub cover, plant structure and plant height revealed greater shelter within the park. Deer trails were spatially aggregated up to 2300 m and were directly associated with deer occupancy. These results indicate that, in El Palmar National Park interface, plantation forests do not provide a refuge or selected habitat, and suggest instead that the environmental characteristics and diversity of habitats within the protected area are relevant for the effectiveness of the exotic ungulate management program.

AB  - Toxic plants are a natural component of alpine meadow which co-evolved with Tibetan sheep for thousands of years. One challenge for indigenous herders is to know the ecological thresholds of toxic plants and maintain their vital functions in ways that are compatible with economic income and ecological conservation. To achieve this, field trials with Tibetan sheep grazing in alpine meadow were conducted to examine the ecological thresholds of toxic plants for sheep production and ecosystem functions and their trade-offs. Our results demonstrated that the changing point values of biomass proportion of toxic plants for dry matter intake and liveweight gain of sheep were 17% and 22%, respectively. The changing point value of biomass (richness) proportion of toxic plants for soil carbon accumulation index was 31% (59%), for soil nutrient cycling index was 38% (42%), and for ecosystem multifunctionality index was 28% (50%). The trade-off between liveweight gain of sheep and ecosystem multifunctionality first decreased and then increased along the gradient of biomass proportion of toxic plants (the value of changing point was 37%), and had a significant negative correlation with richness of toxic plants. In addition, structural equation modeling indicated that toxic plants can affect the trade-off between liveweight gain of sheep and ecosystem multifunctionality though increasing acid detergent fiber of plant and decreasing plant species richness, belowground biomass and soil total phosphorus. Consequently, opinions towards toxic plants should shift from the conventional view that they are serious threat to grassland ecosystem health to an inclusive understanding that they are beneficial to livestock and ecosystem functions under certain ecological thresholds.

AB  - It is unclear whether the remarkable recovery of mountain gorillas Gorilla beringei beringei in the Virunga Mountains, East Africa, that followed decades of intensive conservation efforts, is indicative of positive trends in abundance and distribution of other large mammals (meso- and megaherbivores). Positive population trends are particularly relevant for globally threatened elephants Loxodonta sp., as conservation and research efforts have predominantly focused on populations that range in lowland savanna ecosystems rather than the smaller but ecologically and genetically unique populations found in the Virunga montane ecosystems. We used marked pellet group counts in dung clearance plots to determine the density/abundance and distribution of three mesoherbivores (buffalo, black-fronted duiker, bushbuck) and one megaherbivore (elephant) in Volcanoes National Park (VNP; covering part of the Virunga Mountains), Rwanda, in July-September 2008 and 2021. We estimated that elephants and duiker populations saw a minor increase between 2008 and 2021 while densities of buffalo and bushbuck increased substantially over the course of the past decade. We also found no evidence of substantial distributional shifts for elephants but observed increases in densities of the other species in the southwestern parts of the VNP. Overall, density estimates for all species were much higher in both 2008 and 2021 than in a previous survey in 2004, which suggests that meso- and megaherbivores have largely recovered from a steep decline in numbers towards the end of the 20th century, possibly benefitting from the same protection efforts that benefitted mountain gorillas.

AB  - Increasing impacts of wildfire on arid regions of the world fuelled by climate change highlight the need to better understand how natural communities respond to fire. We took advantage of a large (1660-km(2)) wildfire that erupted in northern California during an in-progress study of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) to investigate deer use of and diets within burned and unburned habitats before and after the fire. We compared deer diet breadth to predictions of optimal foraging theory, the niche variation hypothesis, and opportunistic (i.e., generalist) foraging expectations under the assumption that overall availability and diversity of forage in burned areas declined immediately after the fire and increased as the plant community recovered in the next 3 years after the fire. We used faecal pellet counts to document space use and metabarcoding to study diet during pre-fire, post-fire, and recovery periods. Pellet counts supported predictions that deer increased use of unburned sites and reduced use of burn sites after the fire and began to return to burned sites in subsequent sampling years. Diet diversity did not differ significantly between control and burn sites before the fire, but was lower in burn than control sites post-fire (p < .001), when and where diet was dominated by oak (Quercus spp). In contrast, during subsequent years, diet diversity was higher (including more herbaceous plants) in burn than control sites (p < .05). In contrast to predictions of optimal foraging and niche variation hypotheses, individual deer foraged as generalists for which changes in dietary niche breadth paralleled fire-induced changes in diversity of the plant community.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms by which alien species become invasive can assure successful control programs and mitigate alien species' impacts. The distribution of invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) has been sharply expanding throughout all regions of Brazil in the last few years. Here we demonstrate that large monocultural plantations provide the primary resource subsidies to invasive wild pigs in Brazil. We analyzed 106 stomach contents and carbon stable isotopes (delta C-13) of 50 hair samples of wild pigs from a population inunersed in a landscape dominated by sugar cane agriculture. Stomach contents were dominated by corn (41%), sugarcane (28.5%), vegetal matter (all other vegetation besides crops, 27%), and animal matter (vertebrates and invertebrates, 4%). Bayesian mixing model analysis of delta C-13 showed that food sources from C-4 photosynthetic pathway (represented by corn and sugarcane) accounted for 94% of the long-term diet, while C-3 food sources for only 6.2%. Our results indicate that corn and sugar cane are subsidizing the diet of wild pigs and can facilitate the population growth of this invasive species. Given that Brazil is a major agricultural producer and a hotspot of biodiversity, it is extremely concerning that extensive agriculture may accelerate the expansion of this invasive species, resulting in economic losses and cascading effects on natural habitats.

AB  - Key message White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana Zimmermann) browsing reduces seedling and sapling abundance of more palatable winter woody browse such as Tsuga canadensis L. Carriere, Thuja occidentalis L., Betula alleghaniensis Britton, and Pinus strobus L. across the Lake States Region of the USA. Context White-tailed deer consume buds and twigs of tree seedlings and saplings as forage. Deer populations in the Lake States Region of the USA have increased over recent decades due to a decrease in predators and an increase in habitat fragmentation. Higher deer population densities present challenges to regeneration of tree species. Aims The objective of this work was to quantify the effects of deer browsing on tree seedling and sapling abundance and species richness of woody tree species which vary in deer browse palatability. Methods Deer browsing impact measurements from the tree regeneration indicator from the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis program were used to predict seedling and sapling abundance from overstory basal area and a deer browsing index in the Lake States Region. Results Overstory basal area was important in predicting seedling and sapling abundance for all species (p < 0.05). Deer browsing affected seedling and sapling abundance differently across species, with the most palatable species showing lower stocking or negligible effects with browse. Conclusion Results support the importance of quantifying impacts of deer browsing for use in determining the survival and abundance of palatable species in the smallest size cohorts.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitat alteration is leading to the reduction of global biodiversity. Consequently, there is an imminent need to understand the state and trend of habitat alteration across broad areas. In North America, habitat alteration has been linked to the decline of threatened woodland caribou. As such, habitat protection and restoration are critical measures to support recovery of self-sustaining caribou populations. Broad estimates of habitat change through time have set the stage for understanding the status of caribou habitat. However, the lack of updated and detailed data on post-disturbance vegetation recovery is an impediment to recovery planning and monitoring restoration effectiveness. Advances in remote sensing tools to collect high-resolution data at large spatial scales are beginning to enable ecological studies in new ways to support ecosystem-based and species-based management.We used semi-automated and manual methodologies to fuse photogrammetry point clouds (PPC) from high-resolution aerial imagery with wide-area light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to quantify vegetation structure (height, density, class) on disturbances associated with caribou declines. We also compared vegetation heights estimated from the semi-automated PPC-LiDAR fusion to heights estimated in the field, using stereoscopic interpretation, and using multi-channel TiTAN LiDAR.Vegetation regrowth was occurring on many of the disturbance types, though there was local variability in the type, height and density of vegetation. Heights estimated using PPC-LiDAR fusion were highly correlated (r & GE; 0.87 in all cases) with heights estimated using stereomodels, TiTAN multi-channel LiDAR and field measurements.We demonstrated that PPC-LiDAR fusion can be operationalized over large areas to collect comprehensive and consistent vegetation data across landscape levels, providing opportunities to link fine-resolution remote sensing to landscape-scale ecological studies. Crucially, these data can be used to estimate rates of habitat recovery at resolutions that are not feasible using more commonly used satellite-based sensors, bridging the gap between resolution and extent. Such data are needed to achieve effective and efficient habitat monitoring to support caribou recovery efforts, as well as a myriad of additional forest management needs.

AB  - Savannas in southeastern Brazil are frequently exposed to frost events, causing the death of leaves and branches in many woody and herbaceous species. Frost events are frequent in these regions, with one relatively stronger than usual event every 5 years. Our experimental site at Sa similar to o Paulo State, Southeastern Brazil, was affected by strong frost events during June-July 2021, when temperatures reached-4 degrees C, causing aboveground dieback in most ground layer species, although we observed some species were not affected and maintained a fully green canopy. We used this opportunistic frost event to study and report these damages and measured leaf traits that could explain our observations, as well as point directions to ecological understanding of frost on savanna vegetation. We measured morphological leaf traits such as leaf shape (width, length, width to length ratio), leaf area, specific leaf area and leaf thickness, and we also quantified canopy and leaf damage in 17 species (5 non-affected by frost and 12 that were visually affected). We found that species with larger and thicker leaves were more prone to leaf and canopy damage (70-100% of damage) than those with smaller and thinner leaves (0% damage). These results suggest that leaf morphology may provide resistance against frost and could ultimately act as a filter favoring species that can support extreme frost events, if those became more frequent and stronger under future climatic changes.

AB  - Climate warming creates energetic challenges for endothermic species by increasing metabolic and hydric costs of thermoregulation. Although endotherms can invoke an array of behavioural and physiological strategies for maintaining homeostasis, the relative effectiveness of those strategies in a climate that is becoming both warmer and drier is not well understood. In accordance with the heat dissipation limit theory which suggests that allocation of energy to growth and reproduction by endotherms is constrained by the ability to dissipate heat, we expected that patterns of habitat use by large, heat-sensitive mammals across multiple scales are critical for behavioural thermoregulation during periods of potential heat stress and that they must invest a large portion of time to maintain heat balance. To test our predictions, we evaluated mechanisms underpinning the effectiveness of bed sites for ameliorating daytime heat loads and potential heat stress across the landscape while accounting for other factors known to affect behaviour. We integrated detailed data on microclimate and animal attributes of moose Alces alces, into a biophysical model to quantify costs of thermoregulation at fine and coarse spatial scales. During summer, moose spent an average of 67.8% of daylight hours bedded, and selected bed sites and home ranges that reduced risk of experiencing heat stress. For most of the day, shade could effectively mitigate the risk of experiencing heat stress up to 10 degrees C, but at warmer temperatures (up to 20 degrees C) wet soil was necessary to maintain homeostasis via conductive heat loss. Consistent selection across spatial scales for locations that reduced heat load underscores the importance of the thermal environment as a driver of behaviour in this heat-sensitive mammal. Moose in North America have long been characterized as riparian-obligate species because of their dependence on woody plant species for food. Nevertheless, the importance of dissipating endogenous heat loads conductively through wet soil suggests riparian habitats also are critical thermal refuges for moose. Such refuges may be especially important in the face of a warming climate in which both high environmental temperatures and drier conditions will likely exacerbate limits to heat dissipation, especially for large, heat-sensitive animals.

AB  - Changes in forest structure and shifts in tree species composition have occurred globally due to climate change and altered disturbance regimes. With climate trending toward warmer and drier conditions, these altered forest communities may reorganize in diverse and unpredictable ways. This is especially true in mountain environments where a range of vegetation types and abiotic conditions coexist. In this study, we used long-term permanent plot data from a site spanning broad environmental gradients to assess regeneration and mortality patterns in populations of aspen ( Populus tremuloides). The study site, located on the San Francisco Peaks, Arizona, USA, is near the hot, dry edge of the species' range and has experienced compounding pressure from extreme drought, chronic ungulate browsing, and wildfire in the past two decades. Over a 20-year study period, spanning one of the most prolonged drought periods in at least 1200 years, aspen overstory mortality averaged 42 % and was most common in smaller, younger trees and at lower elevations. Aspen regeneration density increased 13 % and was found in a greater proportion of study sites. However, we observed a noticeable lack of stems in the tallest regeneration size class (>200 cm) and the smaller tree size class (2.5-15 cm in diameter), potentially indicating a demographic bottleneck whereby few trees are recruiting into the overstory. Likewise, prolific aspen suckering occurred after a 2001 wildfire, although regeneration density eventually decreased to pre-fire levels, with <1 % of individuals reaching heights >200 cm. Aspen regeneration densities showed the greatest increases in cool, wet sites and beneath open forest canopies. Disturbances function as catalysts for aspen regeneration, but persistence of aspen stands depends on recruitment of stems into overstory size classes, a process that is limited, particularly on lower and more exposed sites.

AB  - The accuracy of drive count and pellet group counts for estimating the community structure and density of wild ungulates was assessed in the Roztocze National Park (south-east Poland) from 2003 to 2021. The estimates varied greatly among methods and years. The largest errors were found for assessing ungulate density using drive counts, mainly due to insufficient blocks. Errors for the pellet group counts were small for red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and moderate for wild boar (Sus scrofa). Therefore, it is suggested that the pellet group method should be given priority in surveys of ungulate population abundance in the Roztocze National Park.

AB  - In temperate Europe, oak-dominated forests are widespread, supporting high biodiversity and providing important ecosystem services. Insufficient natural regeneration has, however, been a concern for over a century. The objective of this study was to gain insights into differences in regeneration success using artificial and natural regeneration techniques for reforestation of oak (Quercus robur L.) stands. We monitored seedlings following planting, direct seeding and natural regeneration over five years in a randomized block experiment in southern Sweden with fenced and non-fenced plots. Fencing had a strong positive effect on height growth, especially for planted seedlings that were taller than the other seedlings and more frequently browsed in non-fenced plots. In contrast, there was little effect of fencing on survival, establishment rate and recruitment rate of seedlings. Due to aboveground damage on seedlings from voles, protection of acorns did not improve establishment rate following direct seeding. Under current circumstances at the site with a sparse shelterwood of old oaks, we conclude that natural regeneration was the most cost-efficient regeneration method. It resulted in the most seedlings at the lowest cost. However, regeneration success was heavily influenced by interference from herbaceous vegetation. With a small additional investment in vegetation control, the results might have been improved for planting and direct seeding.

AB  - Grasslands support multiple ecosystem functions and services, and diverse biota, and are critical for human wellbeing. Grazing is the most pervasive land use in grasslands, but can have damaging effects when poorly managed. How grazing management and the environment interact to affect ecosystem functions globally is less well understood. Addressing this knowledge gap is important if we are to evaluate where (climate region, soil texture, and grassland type), what (livestock type), and how (grazing intensity, grazing regime, and duration) grazing might minimize grassland degradation and sustain healthy grassland functions. We used a systematic metaanalysis to explore the effects of grazing on ecosystem functions (primary production, carbon sequestration, water conservation, nutrient cycle, and decomposition) based on 3917 paired data from 148 studies across the globe. We found that grazing substantially reduced plant productivity (-26 %), followed by water conservation (-18 %) and carbon sequestration (-19 %). The value of most ecosystem functions declined with increasing grazing intensity, and more pronounced negative effects of grazing with mixed-herbivore than single species grazing. Grazing impacts also varied with environmental conditions, with light grazing increasing carbon sequestration in arid regions, but reducing it in semi-arid regions. Further, increasing aridity indirectly weakened the positive impacts of light grazing on ecosystem functions by suppressing grazing effects. Our study suggests that the interactions between grazing management and environmental conditions are critical when assessing the effects of grazing on grassland functions, and this will likely be more important as climates become hotter and drier.

KW  - EXPLANATION
AB  - Soil seed banks (SSBs) play an important role in the recovery and renewal of plant ecosystems. Numerous studies have explored the effects of grazing on the density, diversity, and composition of SSBs in grasslands. However, information on how different livestock species affect SSBs in semi-arid grasslands remains limited. Here we examined shift in species diversity, plant density, and community structure in both SSBs and aboveground vegetation in grasslands grazed by three livestock species under adaptive grazing management. We found that (i) Grazing by three livestock species increased plant density and species richness in both SSB and aboveground vegetation, with cattle grazing increased the most. (ii) Grazing leads to a notable increase in the seed density of annual and biennial plants while decreasing that of perennial plants in the upper 5 cm of soil; grazing also increases burial depth of seeds, with cattle and goat grazing significantly increasing the seed density of annual and biennial plants in the 5-10 cm soil layer, as well as that of perennial forbs in the 0-10 cm layer. (iii) The species composition of aboveground vegetation and SSB differed, but cattle grazing significantly increased the similarity between the two. Our results provide significant insights into SSB responses to three livestock species, and indicate that adaptive grazing management, which maintains grassland residual height above a certain level, may benefit the SSB and support vegetation regeneration.

AB  - Simple Summary The Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) is a protected wild ungulate. The species is known to have a low genetic variability and to occasionally suffer from local population decline as a consequence of epidemic diseases. Another, less investigated, threat for the species' long-term conservation is represented by the hybridization with feral domestic goats that may breed with ibex if abandoned in the mountain at the end of the summer pasture. Further reproduction and the spread of hybrids may jeopardize the genetic integrity of wild Alpine ibex. By means of an online survey and using a network of experts, we mapped unpublished evidence on observed hybridization events between Alpine ibex and feral domestic goats. The results of this study suggested that hybrids are currently distributed in several countries, and their presence is not a rare event, with some clusters including 4-20 probable hybrids. This calls for more studies clearly quantifying hybrids in Alpine ibex colonies, but also highlights the need for conservation actions aimed at controlling this phenomenon, such as the effective management of domestic herds grazing in Alpine ibex core areas and clear guidelines on hybrid management. The Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) is a mountain ungulate living in the European Alps. Although being currently classified as a species of Least Concern (LC) by the IUCN, a potential threat for its long-term conservation is introgression following hybridization with domestic goats (Capra hircus). Hybridization has been documented in Switzerland in captive and free ranging animals, although accurate data to assess the extent of this phenomenon in natural conditions in the Alps are lacking. Using an online survey and a network of experts, we collected and mapped unpublished evidence of hybridization events that occurred between Alpine ibex and feral domestic goats from 2000 to 2021. The results of this study showed that hybrids are distributed in most of the Alpine countries, and their presence is not a sporadic event, with some clusters including 4-20 probable hybrids. Our results illustrated the need for establishing a standardized and effective protocol to identify hybrids in the field (such as a formal description of the morphological traits characterizing hybrids), as well as clear guidelines for hybrid management. Even more importantly, this study also highlighted the need for actions aimed at avoiding hybridization, such as the effective management of domestic herds grazing in Alpine ibex core areas.

AB  - Habitat modeling across a landscape that has gradients of habitat conditions requires potential predictor data that can be quantified at biologically relevant scales. We used remotely sensed data to develop a multi-scale density model in 2018 for the golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia; warbler), a species that breeds in Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei)-oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands in central Texas, USA. We first classified Ashe juniper and broadleaf tree cover at a 1-m resolution and used this to map potential habitat across the warbler's >67,000-km(2) breeding range. We then designed a survey for estimating warbler density based on hierarchical distance sampling. We used stratified random sampling to survey for male warblers at 1,804 points across the continuum of tree canopy cover and composition and detected 810 warblers during our surveys. We developed a suite of potential predictor variables for modeling warbler density that reflected vegetation, topography, climate, and anthropogenic land use conditions across the breeding range and developed these at 3 scales representing the territory, site, and landscape. We modeled warbler density and used the best fit model to produce a spatially explicit estimate. Predicted warbler density was influenced by tree canopy cover and canopy height at the territory scale (100-m radius); tree canopy cover, percent of the canopy comprised of juniper, and an interaction between canopy cover and compound topographic index at the site scale (1-km radius); and annual temperature range at the landscape scale (5-km radius). We estimated a population size of 217,444 male warblers (95% CI = 153,917-311,965) and >3,000 males in each recovery unit. After controlling for the duration of point count surveys, our estimate of population size was similar to that reported from the only previous breeding range survey conducted in 2008-2009. Our model results indicated that management activities to increase warbler density should promote woodlands with high tree canopy cover, approximately 60-80% Ashe juniper composition, and tree heights >3 m. In contrast to a patch-based approach, our treatment of habitat variables as continuous helped to credibly map the warbler distribution across areas with broad transitions from woodlands to shrublands. By measuring these predictor variables at biologically relevant scales, we allowed the warbler survey data to define habitat relationships instead of using anthropogenically defined habitat patches. Outcomes from our study show the benefits of developing spatial products tailored to individual species of interest for conservation and management decisions.

AB  - Plant species diversity enhances community productivity, but how plant diversity impacts the metabolome of individual plants and the underlying eco-evolutionary processes remains unclear. This study investigated how plant species diversity and selection for growing in different diversity environments affect the leaf metabolome of Plantago lanceolata. We compared the metabolites of plants derived from those that had been selected in the 'Jena Experiment' for 17 yr in plant communities with differing plant diversity with the metabolites of na & iuml;ve plants not subjected to this selection. The metabolic profiles of selected P. lanceolata plants were also compared after growing in experimental environments varying in plant diversity, soil history and community plant history. Volatile compound diversity in P. lanceolata decreased with plant species richness (SR), primarily due to phenotypic plasticity rather than selection. Soil history further strengthened this relationship. Conversely, non-volatile compound diversity increased with plant SR, but only in phytometers subjected to diversity-driven selection. These effects were more pronounced when plants shared soil-plant history with their community. In summary, our study revealed that both plastic and adaptive responses shape the metabolome of P. lanceolata in relation to plant diversity, with these effects becoming stronger as plant and soil communities mature.

AB  - The decline in mammalian species diversity is increasing worldwide, with areas characterized by high human activities experiencing more prominent effects. Knowledge of spatial distributions of species and factors acting on them is necessary for effective management. We evaluated community-level occupancy of mammal species in Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve (DHR), Nepal using remote cameras during 15 March-15 June 2022. We used mammal species detections from remote cameras and multispecies hierarchical occupancy modeling to assess the effects of environmental and anthropogenic variables on community-level occupancy of detected mammal species. We identified a highly heterogeneous mammal species community at DHR with greatest detection probability (0.21) for red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and lowest (0.08) for blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur). Naive occupancy ranged from 0.31 for giant-flying squirrel (Petaurista magnificus) to 0.84 for red fox. Mammal community occupancy increased with increasing canopy cover and number of livestock detections, but overall occupancy declined close to human settlements. The findings of this study can be used for developing policy at DHR for the management of mammal species through reducing the potential increase of human settlements or livestock grazing.

AB  - Climate change is expected to disproportionately affect species occupying ecosystems with relatively hard boundaries, such as alpine ecosystems. Wildlife managers must identify actions to conserve and manage alpine species into the future, while considering other issues and uncertainties. Climate change and respiratory pathogens associated with widespread pneumonia epidemics in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) may negatively affect mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations. Mountain goat demographic and population data are challenging to collect and sparsely available, making population management decisions difficult. We developed predictive models incorporating these uncertainties and analyzed results within a structured decision making framework to make management recommendations and identify priority information needs in Montana, USA. We built resource selection models to forecast occupied mountain goat habitat and account for uncertainty in effects of climate change, and a Leslie matrix projection model to predict population trends while accounting for uncertainty in population demographics and dynamics. We predicted disease risks while accounting for uncertainty about presence of pneumonia pathogens and risk tolerance for mixing populations during translocations. Our analysis predicted that new introductions would produce more area occupied by mountain goats at mid-century, regardless of the effects of climate change. Population augmentations, carnivore management, and harvest management may improve population trends, although this was associated with considerable uncertainty. Tolerance for risk of disease transmission affected optimal management choices because translocations are expected to increase disease risks for mountain goats and sympatric bighorn sheep. Expected value of information analyses revealed that reducing uncertainty related to population dynamics would affect the optimal choice among management strategies to improve mountain goat trends. Reducing uncertainty related to the presence of pneumonia-associated pathogens and consequences of mixing microbial communities should reduce disease risks if translocations are included in future management strategies. We recommend managers determine tolerance for disease risks associated with translocations that they and constituents are willing to accept. From this, an adaptive management program can be constructed wherein a portfolio of management actions are chosen based on risk tolerance in each population range, combined with the amount that uncertainty is reduced when paired with monitoring, to ultimately improve achievement of fundamental objectives.

AB  - 1. Importance of nurse plants structuring plant communities is well-appreciated at local scales, yet the effect of a single nurse on large scales has been neglected in analyses. So far, studies only use environmental gradients within one type of ecosystem and tend to generalize the nurse effects.
   2. To assess how the effect of a single nurse species is modulated by different environmental settings, interactions between the shrub Vachellia caven and the surrounding plant communities were evaluated at 481 paired plots (outside vs. underneath the plant crown), in 39 sites across two distribution ranges, the Mediterranean west and the mostly subtropical east of the Andes Mountains (covering ca. 2x 10(6) km(2)).
   3. Cover, abundance and richness of perennial plants underneath and outside V. caven were used as response variables to estimate an index indicative of plant interactions (relative interaction index [RII]) and tested how this was affected by the rainfall gradient and distribution range.
   4. Overall, RII responses to rainfall gradients had low conditional R-2 (similar to 0.25) in this large scale of analysis, but were significantly different between ranges: the RII followed a quadratic trend across the rainfall gradient in the western range, while this relationship was positive and close to linear at the eastern range.
   5. Then, by projecting the RII models (i.e. for abundance, cover and richness) spatially through a consensus map, we show that most positive effects of V. caven are geographically found in dissimilar areas: the central part of Chile (western range) and across the Parana River (eastern range).
   6. When local fine-scale predictors (i.e. annual herbs' cover and height, and herbivores' faeces cover) were used to model each response variable at the plot level (underneath or outside V. caven), we observed similar trends as when we considered only the large-scale predictors.
   7. Synthesis. Here, we show that the effect of the same nurse species on neighbouring plant communities can be very different depending on ranges of distribution, stressing that its ecological function cannot be generalized and not only depends on local factors but also is large-scale context-dependent.

AB  - Past experiences may impart lasting effects on an individual despite temporal separation from the inciting event. Through an unmanipulated field study across 4 populations of free-living, white-tailed deer, we investigated the effect of variable summer rainfall on fecal glucocorticoid metabolites in adult females in autumn. We found evidence reduced summer rainfall imparted long-term effects on female glucocorticoid levels, but the effect of past environmental conditions depended on reproductive status.
   In the age of global climate change, extreme climatic events are expected to increase in frequency and severity. Animals will be forced to cope with these novel stressors in their environment. Glucocorticoids (i.e. 'stress' hormones) facilitate an animal's ability to cope with their environment. To date, most studies involving glucocorticoids focus on the immediate physiological effects of an environmental stressor on an individual, few studies have investigated the long-term physiological impacts of such stressors. Here, we tested the hypothesis that previous exposure to an environmental stressor will impart lasting consequences to an individual's glucocorticoid levels. In semi-arid environments, variable rainfall drives forage availability for herbivores. Reduced seasonal precipitation can present an extreme environmental stressor potentially imparting long-term impacts on an individual's glucocorticoid levels. We examined the effects of rainfall and environmental characteristics (i.e. soil and vegetation attributes) during fawn-rearing (i.e. summer) on subsequent glucocorticoid levels of female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in autumn. We captured 124 adult (>= 2.5-year-old) female deer via aerial net-gunning during autumn of 2015, 2016 and 2021 across four populations spanning a gradient of environmental characteristics and rainfall in the semi-arid environment of South Texas, USA. We found for every 1 cm decrease in summer rainfall, faecal glucocorticoid levels in autumn increased 6.9%, but only in lactating females. Glucocorticoid levels in non-lactating, female deer were relatively insensitive to environmental conditions. Our study demonstrates the long-lasting effects of environmental stressors on an individual's glucocorticoid levels. A better understanding of the long-term effects stressors impart on an individual's glucocorticoid levels will help to evaluate the totality of the cost of a stressor to an individual's welfare and predict the consequences of future climate scenarios.

AB  - Despite their importance in shaping life history tactics and population dynamics, individual growth trajectories have only been rarely explored in the wild because their analysis requires multiple measurements of individuals throughout their lifetime and some knowledge of age, a key timer of body growth. The availability of long-term longitudinal studies of two wild boar populations subjected to contrasting environments (rich vs. poor) provided an opportunity to analyze individual growth trajectories. We quantified wild boar growth trajectories at both the population and the individual levels using standard growth models (i.e., Gompertz, logistic, and monomolecular models) that encompass the expected range of growth shapes in determinate growers. Wild boar is a rather altricial species, with a polygynous mating system and is strongly sexually dimorphic in size. According to current theories of life history evolution, we thus expect wild boar to display a sex-specific Gompertz type growth trajectory and lower sexual size dimorphism in the poorer environment. While wild boar displayed the expected Gompertz type trajectory in the rich site at the population level, we found some evidence for potential differences in growth shapes between populations and individuals. Asymptotic body mass, growth rate and timing of maximum growth rate differed as well, which indicates a high flexibility of growth in wild boar. We also found a cohort effect on asymptotic body mass, which suggests that environmental conditions early in life shape body mass at adulthood in this species. Our findings demonstrate that body growth trajectories in wild boar are highly diverse in relation to differences of environmental context, sex and year of birth. Whether the intermediate ranking of wild boar along the precocial-altricial continuum of development at birth may explain the ability of this species to exhibit this high diversity of growth patterns remains to be investigated.

AB  - Pest herbivory regulation is one of the key functions provided by diverse ecosystems, especially when compared to species depauperate agro-ecosystems and in the context of increased pest outbreaks due to global change. The dilution effect of host diversity on insect herbivory suggests that mixed plantations are feasible for regulating pest herbivory in agroecosystems. Dilution effect of increased plant diversity on insect herbivory has been widely observed, yet little is known about how it may change with plant phylogenetic relatedness and herbivore specialization, especially at the community level. Here, we compared herbivore richness, abundance, and degree of herbivory (i.e., the ratio of trees damaged by pest and total trees in a given area) among the two monocultures and the four mixed plantations in Wenchang city, Hainan Province, China. We also respectively assessed the effects of phylogenetically close or distant species on generalist and specialist herbivores in monocultures and mixture. We found that increasing the number of phylogenetically closely-related tree species could dilute generalist herbivore richness, abundance, and degree of herbivory but amplify specialist herbivore richness, abundance, and degree of herbivory. In contrast, increasing the number of phylogenetically distant tree species increased generalist herbivore richness, abundance, and degree of herbivory, while reducing specialist herbivore richness, abundance, and degree of herbivory. Our results suggest that plant phylogenetic relatedness and herbivore specialization can indeed interact to influence pest control efficiency when using mixed plantations to manage pest herbivory in agroecosystems. Thus, both herbivore specialization and plant phylogenetic relatedness should be taken into account in the management of agro-ecosystems and biodiversity conservation with respect to herbivory.

AB  - Landscape of fear refers to the spatial variation in prey perception of predation risk, that under certain conditions, may lead to changes in their behavior. Behavioral responses of prey in relation to large carnivore predation risk have mainly been conducted in areas with low anthropogenic impact. We used long-term data on the distribution of moose in different habitat types in a system characterized by intensive management of all three trophic levels (silviculture, harvest of wolves and moose) to study effects on moose habitat selection resulting from the return of an apex predator, the wolf. We assumed that coursing predators such as wolves will cause an increased risk for moose in some habitat types and tested the hypotheses that moose will avoid open or young forest habitats following wolf establishment. After wolf recolonization, moose reduced their use of one type of open habitat (bog) but there was neither change in the use of the other open habitat type (clear-cut), nor in their use of young forest. Wolf establishment did not influence the use of habitat close to dense habitat when being in open habitats. Thus, the effect of wolves varied among habitat types and there was no unidirectional support for a behavioral effect of wolves' establishment on moose habitat use. Human-driven habitat heterogeneity, concentration of moose forage to certain habitat types, and the effects of a multiple predator guild on moose may all contribute to the results found. We conclude that the landscape of fear is likely to have weak ecological effects on moose in this system.

AB  - As mangrove ecosystems are rapidly being degraded worldwide, it is essential to understand how we can protect them. Defoliation of mangrove saplings can negatively affect mangrove ecosystems' health and resilience, and its effects can be further exacerbated and accelerated by habitat disturbances such as climate change and urban development. We examined the levels of defoliation across four different species of mangrove saplings-Bruguiera cylindrica, B. gymnorhiza, Rhizophora apiculata and R. mucronate across ten sites on Pulau Ubin, Singapore. We found that different species of mangrove saplings suffered different rates of defoliation, and this could be because of interaction effects from proximity to roads, river mouth and past site use for aquaculture.

AB  - Unprecedented anthropogenic changes to biodiversity and biogeography demand a greater understanding of the consequences of altered faunal composition for ecosystem functioning. Selective predation has important, yet poorly understood effects on ecosystem stability, and can be strongly influenced by the relative frequencies of different prey types in the environment. Yet, how predators adjust their selection for prey according to their environmental frequency is often overlooked. Here, we assessed frequency dependent selection of prey by dingoes and foxes in the Australian desert, biannually, across a nine-year period (2007-2016). Both predators exhibited potentially destabilizing, negative frequency dependent selection for prey. Foxes persisted to preferentially consume a threatened, native rodent (Notomys fuscus) when it was environmentally scarce. Bolstered by the observation that N.fuscus occurs at low densities in areas where foxes are common, our results suggest that N.fuscus is particularly vulnerable to predation by this predator; possibly because it is naive and/or lacks adaptations to avoid or escape predation by the relatively recently introduced fox. Dingoes tended to consume reptiles when they were scarce; potentially constituting a conservation concern if selected reptilian taxa are threatened. Foxes avoided, thus were unlikely to control populations of overabundant kangaroos, while both foxes and dingoes showed a preference for, and may therefore control populations of invasive rabbits. The integration of our results into the relative suites of (de)stabilizing influences exerted by dingoes and foxes is important to provide a more dynamic insight into how each predator impacts their naturally fluctuating ecosystems.

AB  - Within agricultural landscapes, native bees often rely on limited natural and seminatural lands to provide the majority of the food and nesting resources that sustain them. To understand better how management can affect pollinators in these seminatural areas, we compared how sheep or cattle herbivory influenced floral resources and bee communities in low-diversity, former Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) pastures managed with patch-burn grazing. We sampled bee communities and floral resources three times per season in 2017, 2018, and 2019. We used plant-pollinator line transect sampling and collected bees and counted all flowering stems within 1 m. Across all years, we found that floral abundance, floral richness, floral diversity (Simpson's) and bee richness and abundance were significantly higher in cattle pastures compared to sheep. In cattle pastures, 46 native bee species plus honey bees interacted with 25 of 68 available flowering forbs. In sheep pastures, we recorded 14 native bee species and honey bees interacted with 10 of 34 flowering species. Native bee abundance and native bee richness were best explained by models that included an interaction of floral richness and year. Overall, our results suggest that season-long sheep grazing in low-diversity grasslands greatly reduces available floral resources and correlates with much lower bee abundance and native bee diversity. Given the importance of pollinators to natural and agricultural systems, it is imperative that we take proactive actions to increase forb richness and native flower abundance in seminatural lands to maintain a more diverse and resilient bee community that can continue to support pollination services and global food security.

AB  - The Inca and their immediate predecessors provide an exceptional model of how to create high-altitude functional environments that sustainably feed people with a diversity of crops, whilst mitigating erosion, protecting forestry and maintaining soil fertility without the need for large-scale burning. A comparison is provided here of landscape practices and impacts prior to and after the Inca, derived from a unique 4200-year sedimentary record recovered from Laguna Marcacocha, a small, environmentally sensitive lake located at the heart of the Inca Empire. By examining ten selected proxies of environmental change, a rare window is opened on the past, helping to reveal how resilient watershed management and sustainable, climate-smart agriculture were achieved. We contend that, in the face of modern environmental uncertainty, a second climate-smart agricultural revolution is necessary, but one that accounts for the significant social capital of highland communities whilst still leaning heavily on native crops, trees and livestock.

AB  - Long-term monitoring along the Irish Sea coast of Britain at Formby has identified hundreds of animal and human footprints in 31 discrete sediment beds. A new programme of radiocarbon dating shows that the Formby footprints span at least 8,000 years of the Holocene Epoch from the Mesolithic period to Medieval times. In a landscape largely devoid of conventional archaeology and faunal records, we show how species data from the footprint stratigraphy document long-term change in both large mammal diversity and human behaviour. The footprint beds record shifting community structure in the native fauna through an era of profound global change. As sea levels rose rapidly in the Early Holocene, men, women and children formed part of rich Mesolithic intertidal ecosystems from similar to 9,000 to 6,000 cal BP, with aurochs, red deer, roe deer, wild boar, beaver, wolf and lynx. Doggerland was reclaimed by the sea in this period. In the agriculture-based societies that followed, after 5,500 cal BP human footprints dominate the Neolithic period and later beds, alongside a striking fall in large mammal species richness. Stacked footprint beds can form multimillennial records of ecosystem change with precise geographical context that cannot be retrieved from site-based fossil bone assemblages.
