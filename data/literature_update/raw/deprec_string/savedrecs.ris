AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of mineral supplementation, vitamin supplementation and deworming on humoral response against PPR vaccine in local goats. Group 1 and group 2 goats were given mineral supplementation and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation for 21 days. Group 3 goats were twice dewormed with Fenbendazole. Group 4 bucks were kept as controls. All bucks were vaccinated with the Pestivac vaccine. Antibodies detection was done using competitive ELISA from serum samples. Antigen shedding by vaccinated animals via nasal and fecal route was checked by the haemagglutination test and RT-PCR. All group 2 bucks, developed humoral protection against PPR within the 1st week. Only, 50 percent bucks of group 1 developed humoral protection against PPR after one week of vaccination. The mean percent inhibition value of competition-ELISA of group 2 was half the mean percent inhibition values of group 3 and group 4 after one week of vaccination. There was no antigen shedding through nasal or fecal route after vaccination in any animal included in the study.

AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) in global grasslands is a critical component of terrestrial carbon cycling and the primary source of food for herbivores. However, the size and spatial distribution of NPP across global grasslands remain unclear, especially for belowground NPP (BNPP), which limits our understanding of above- and belowground carbon cycling and the assessments of herbivore food security. Here, we compiled a comprehensive grassland NPP database with 1,467 field measurements to estimate the spatial distributions of aboveground NPP (ANPP), BNPP, total NPP (TNPP), and the fraction of BNPP (f(BNPP)) using the random forest (RF) model. The global mean grassland ANPP, BNPP, TNPP, and f(BNPP) were 433 +/- 31 g m(-2) yr(-1), 593 +/- 47 g m(-2) yr(-1), 979 +/- 78 g m(-2) yr(-1), and 0.54 +/- 0.02, respectively. The total ANPP, BNPP, and TNPP over global grasslands were 6.84 +/- 0.49, 9.36 +/- 0.74, and 15.46 +/- 1.23 Pg C yr(-1), respectively. ANPP, BNPP, and TNPP exhibited decreasing trends from low latitudes toward the poles. The spatial pattern of f(BNPP) was almost opposite to that of ANPP. Climate was a major determinant in shaping the spatial distribution of ANPP and TNPP, while soil and vegetation had significant impacts on that of BNPP and f(BNPP). Our findings suggest that field data-driven estimation of NPP using the RF model could be a useful approach for obtaining spatially explicit NPP of grasslands, particularly BNPP products, and that more attention should be paid on belowground and non-climatic factors to better assess the carbon cycle in global grasslands.

AB  - Behavioural, physiological and biochemical mechanisms constitute the adaptive capacities that allow marine ectotherms to explore the environment beyond their thermal optimal. Limitations to the efficiency of these mechanisms define the transition from moderate to severe thermal stress, and serve to characterise the thermoregulatory response in the zone of thermal tolerance. We selected a tropical population of Hippocampus erectus to describe the timing of the physiological and biochemical mechanisms in response to the following increments in water temperature: (i) 4 degrees C abrupt (26-30 degrees C in <5 min); (ii) 7 degrees C abrupt (26-33 degrees C); (iii) 4 degrees C gradual (1 degrees C every 3 h) and (iv) 7 degrees C gradual (1.5 degrees C every 3 h). The routine metabolic rate (Rrout) of juvenile H. erectus was measured immediately before and after 0.5, 12 and 28 h of being exposed to each thermal treatment. Samples of muscle and abdominal organs were taken to quantify indicators of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism and antioxidant enzymes and oxidative stress at each moment throughout exposure. Results showed a full thermoregulatory response within 0.5 h: Rrout increased in direct correspondence with both the magnitude and rate of thermal increase; peroxidised lipids rapidly accumulated before the antioxidant defence was activated and early lactate concentrations suggested an immediate, yet temporary, reduction in aerobic scope. After 12 h, Rrout had decreased in sea horses exposed to 30 degrees C, but not to 33 degrees C, where Rrout continued high until the end of trials. Within 28 h of thermal exposure, all metabolite and antioxidant defence indicators had been restored to control levels (26 degrees C). These findings testify to the outstanding thermal plasticity of H. erectus and explain their adjustment to rapid fluctuations in ambient temperature. Such features, however, do not protect this tropical population from the deleterious effects of chronic exposure to temperatures that have been predicted for the future.

AB  - Parasitoids need to find their hosts in patchy environments that differ in profitability. To maximize foraging efficiency, parasitoids use volatile information of plants on which their hosts feed. The blend of plant volatiles emitted is affected by genetic variation in plants and by the herbivore species feeding on the plant.How parasitoids deal with variation in plant volatiles induced by host or nonhost herbivores on various plant genotypes in a plant stand is unclear. In a wind tunnel, we examined foraging behaviour of the parasitoid Cotesia glomerata in mixes of white cabbage cultivars with host (Pieris brassicae) and nonhost herbivores (Mamestra brassicae or Delia radicum). We specifically studied the efficiency of parasitoids in locating a host-infested plant when having to pass three other plants that varied in volatile emission by cultivar and herbivore identity. We show that foraging decisions of C. glomerata are affected by the apparency of volatile cues from upwind host-infested plants. We found that parasitoids flew over the first three plants more often when the last plant was a host-infested attractive cultivar and the first three plants were a less attractive cultivar, regardless of the presence of host or nonhost herbivores. Furthermore, parasitoids spent more time on the first three plants if these were infested with host or nonhost larvae, and this effect was stronger when the first three plants were of the attractive cultivar. Our results suggest that parasitoids may more easily locate host herbivores on plant genotypes with more apparent volatile information. However, host location efficiency is affected by the contrast with other plumes of plant volatiles derived from genotypic variation in plants and induction of volatiles by nonhost herbivores. Apparency of information on upwind patches influences patch residence time and patch choice and is an important component of optimal foraging in parasitoids. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Pathfinding elephants are moving through human dominated landscapes, often across international boundaries, thereby playing a vital role in connecting protected areas. Their movements are a call to action to not only understand their spatial requirements but to urgently work towards innovative ways to make people's livelihoods compatible with conservation outcomes so that coexistence and connected landscapes can prevail. We discuss the first three phases of a long-term strategy to conserve elephant corridors whilst incorporating the socio-economic needs of the people that share the landscape with them. We present a comprehensive satellite-tracking history of elephants across two transfrontier conservation areas (TFCA), represented by Great Limpopo- and Lubombo TFCAs and involving four countries (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Eswatini) to flag where linking corridors exist. We use innovative cafeteria-style experiments to understand which elephant-unpalatable plants would offer lucrative alternative income streams to farmers living in human-elephant-conflict hotspots. The most suitable unpalatable plants are chosen based not only on whether they are unpalatable to elephants, but also on their life history traits and growth prerequisites. We consider a combination of potential economic values (food, essential oil, medicinal and bee fodder value) to ensure that selected plants would accommodate changing economic markets. Lastly, we highlight the importance of combining food security measures with ensuring people's safety by means of deploying rapid-response units. By implementing these three phases as part of a longer-term strategy, we draw closer to ensuring the protection of bioregions to achieve biodiversity objectives at a landscape scale.

AB  - Reef health can be assessed from the fish biomass (roving herbivorous and predatory commercial species). In this preliminary note, the biomass of fish indicators of a healthy reef of Blake Reef, Veracruz, is estimated and compared with that recorded in other systems in the southern Gulf of Mexico. The size and abundance of fish observed in Blake Reef determine a remarkable biomass that exceeds the estimates of other reefs. The health of this reef makes it an important reservoir of regional diversity.

AB  - African animal trypanosomosis (nagana) is becoming prevalent beyond its traditionally defined geographical boundaries in African tsetse belts. However, knowledge of clinically important trypanosomes and infection rate in non-tsetse hematophagous flies and domestic animals are limited. This study characterized the potential mechanical vectors, their host feeding patterns, and trypanosome infection in them and domestic animals outside the tsetse belt in northern Kenya. Field-trapped flies and blood from camels, cattle, donkeys, goats, and sheep were screened for trypanosome infection by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the internal transcribed spacer 1 region. Blood-fed specimens were analysed using PCR-HRM and/or sequencing of 16S rRNA gene to identify vertebrate blood-meal host sources. Hippobosca camelina, Stomoxys calcitrans, Tabanus spp., and Pangonia rueppellii were identified as potential vectors of trypanosomes outside the tsetse belt in Marsabit County. The trypanosome species, Trypanosoma vivax, T. evansi, T. brucei, and T. congolense were recovered in biting flies as well as in camels (Camelus dromedarius). The diversity of parasites in the biting flies was similar to that detected in the tsetse fly Glossina pallidipes collected from the tsetse-infested Shimba Hills, in coastal Kenya, suggesting a wide geographic distribution of the trypanosomes in Kenya. The biting flies fed on camels, cattle, goats, and sheep. Furthermore, we identified diverse clinical outcomes based on PCV (anemia), heamorrhagia) associated with infection with disparate Trypanosoma species. Thus, infection of flies and camels by diverse Trypanosoma species could contribute to the complex epidemiology of observed trypanosomosis in camels.

AB  - Organic phosphorus (Po) is the dominant phosphorus (P) fraction in grassland soils, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining P fertility. The mineralization of Po is mainly mediated by phoD-harboring bacteria through secreting alkaline phosphatase (ALP). However, the responses of organic P fractions and phoD community to different grazing intensities have not been well-documented. Herein, an investigation was conducted in two contrasting steppes in Inner Mongolia, four sheep grazing intensities were established: no grazing (UG), light grazing (LG), moderate grazing (MG), and heavy grazing (HG). Various Po fractions; ALP activity; and the diversity, composition, and abundance of phoD-harboring bacterial community were analyzed. In the typical steppe, compared with the UG treatment, integrated phosphorus availability index, NaOH-Po, and total Po decreased by 41.6-51.4 %, 7.6-10.4 %, and 5.0-17.7 %, respectively, under the treatments of HG and MG. Similar observations were noted in the desert steppe. Moreover, in the typical steppe, the influences of four grazing intensities on ALP activity, phoD gene copies, and alpha-diversity of phoD-harboring bacterial community followed the order: LG > UG > MG > HG. In the desert steppe, heavy grazing decreased soil ALP activity and phoD gene copies, but did not significantly influence alpha-diversity of phoD-harboring bacterial community. The network complexity of phoD community decreased with increasing grazing intensity, heavy grazing obviously weakened the interconnections between phoD species and different Po fractions in both typical and desert steppes. Additionally, Variibacter and Hartmannibacter were identified as the keystone bacteria genera involved in Po transformation. Taken together, our findings suggested that overgrazing decreased P availability, which was closely associated with the adverse effects of heavy grazing on ALP activity and the composition, abundance and co-occurrence networks of phoD-harboring bacterial community.

AB  - Long-term sustainability of breeds depends on having sufficient genetic diversity for adaptability to change, whether driven by climatic conditions or by priorities in breeding programs. Genetic diversity in Suffolk sheep in the United States was evaluated in four ways: 1) using genetic relationships from pedigree data [(n = 64 310 animals recorded in the US National Sheep Improvement Program (NSIP)]; 2) using molecular data (n = 304 Suffolk genotyped with the OvineHD BeadChip); 3) comparing Australian (n = 109) and Irish (n = 55) Suffolk sheep to those in the United States using molecular data; and 4) assessing genetic relationships (connectedness) among active Suffolk flocks (n = 18) in NSIP. By characterizing genetic diversity, a goal was to define the structure of a reference population for use for genomic selection strategies in this breed. Pedigree-based mean inbreeding level for the most recent year of available data was 5.5%. Ten animals defined 22.8% of the current gene pool. The effective population size (N-e) ranged from 27.5 to 244.2 based on pedigree and was 79.5 based on molecular data. Expected (H-E) and observed (H-O) heterozygosity were 0.317 and 0.306, respectively. Model-based population structure included 7 subpopulations. From Principal Component Analysis, countries separated into distinct populations. Within the US population, flocks formed genetically disconnected clusters. A decline in genetic diversity over time was observed from both pedigree and genomic-based derived measures with evidence of population substructure as measured by F-ST. Using these measures of genetic diversity, a framework for establishing a genomic reference population in US Suffolk sheep engaged in NSIP was proposed.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is an escalating anthropogenic stressor that can affect ecological communities over a range of spatial scales by altering key ecological processes, such as predation and herbivory. Shallow subtidal reefs are highly diverse and productive habitats that are vulnerable to ALAN. We investigated rates of consumption by fish (predation and herbivory) under different light treatments (ALAN, dark and daylight conditions) using standardised bioassay methods, i.e. squidpops and Ulva pops in situ. We also used GoPros to record predator identity, number of strikes and time to strike in ALAN and daylight treatments. Contrary to previous studies, we found that predation and herbivory rates were significantly lower in ALAN treatments than in daytime and dark treatments. The highest predation and herbivory rates were observed in daytime treatments. The identity of predator species, time to strike and number of strikes also differed between daytime and ALAN treatments. Due to low light conditions, dark treatments were not filmed. Our findings suggest that ALAN can alter predation in unexpected ways, depending on the environmental conditions and species affected. Future coastal management strategies need to account for light pollution as a major stressor to preserve valuable ecological resources.

AB  - Humans are changing the Earth's surface at an accelerating pace, with significant consequences for ecosystems and their biodiversity. Landscape transformation has far-reaching implications including reduced net primary production (NPP) available to support ecosystems, reduced energy supplies to consumers, and disruption of ecosystem services such as carbon storage. Anthropogenic activities have reduced global NPP available to terrestrial ecosystems by nearly 25%, but the loss of NPP from wetland ecosystems is unknown. We used a simple approach to estimate aquatic NPP from measured habitat areas and habitat-specific areal productivity in the largest wetland complex on the USA west coast, comparing historical and modern landscapes and a scenario of wetland restoration. Results show that a 77% loss of wetland habitats (primarily marshes) has reduced ecosystem NPP by 94%, C (energy) flow to herbivores by 89%, and detritus production by 94%. Our results also show that attainment of habitat restoration goals could recover 12% of lost NPP and measurably increase carbon flow to consumers, including at-risk species and their food resources. This case study illustrates how a simple approach for quantifying the loss of NPP from measured habitat losses can guide wetland conservation plans by establishing historical baselines, projecting functional outcomes of different restoration scenarios, and establishing performance metrics to gauge success.

AB  - ObjectiveCrevalle Jack Caranx hippos are important coastal predators and support an increasingly popular catch-and-release sport fishery. However, population declines have recently been perceived by stakeholders in parts of the species' range. Here, we aimed to provide distribution and harvest trends for Crevalle Jack in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.MethodsLong-term fishery-independent and fishery-dependent data were collected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department from 1983 to 2021. Bag seine, bay trawl, and gill-net samples were collected in conjunction with angler creel surveys. Crevalle Jack that were observed in fishery-independent sampling were used to assess patterns in both juvenile and adult relative abundance, distribution, and seasonality. In addition, boosted regression tree models were used to highlight important predictors of Crevalle Jack presence. Crevalle Jack harvest observed during angler surveys was used to describe the fishery, including differences in inshore and offshore catch patterns. Relative abundance of both juveniles and adults was variable across years but displayed no trend throughout the time series.ResultCrevalle Jack of all sizes were found within inshore waters, with subadults and large adults particularly reliant on estuarine systems. Recruitment peaked in early summer, with juveniles occupying all major estuaries along the coast. Shifts in recruitment were evident in bag seines, as the mean date of catch trended almost 2 weeks earlier over the study period. The Crevalle Jack fishery was spread across inshore and offshore waters, with significantly larger fish harvested offshore during summer. The majority of anglers who harvested Crevalle Jack stated that they were specifically targeting other species, thus supporting the notion that the targeted fishery is mainly catch and release.ConclusionAs Crevalle Jack declines have been noted elsewhere in the species' range, these results could help to inform future management decisions in Texas.
   Crevalle Jack are an important sport fish in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. However, anglers have noted population declines in parts of their range. Here, we examined seasonality, distribution, and recruitment of Crevalle Jack in Texas. Results indicate that populations are stable and provide important insights into Crevalle Jack ecology. While the fishery is largely catch and release, the reliance of large Crevalle Jacks on estuaries and nearshore waters could see them increase in popularity as an accessible sport fish. These findings will be important to inform future management decisions.Impact statement

AB  - Predation risk is perceived by prey and mesocarnivores through risk signals given by large carnivores. These signals can be manipulated without exposing mesocarnivores to real risk, creating landscapes of fear through perceptual traps, altering behavior. Olfactory signals like urine and feces have been used to deter carnivores that predate on livestock, but a more biologically meaningful cue could be more effective. Livestock guardian dogs (LGD) deter carnivores and reduce predation, so using their whole-body odor as a risk signal in a livestock system could contribute to reduce livestock-carnivore conflict. We tested LGD whole-body odor effect on Patagonian foxes (Lycalopex culpaeus and Lycalopex griseus) present in sheep production in three different habitats-forest, scrubland and pastureland-and analyzed behavioral changes. The presence of LGD whole-body odor reduce the presence of foxes in scrubland habitats and could increase fear behavior and reduced food consumption compared to non-scented places. This technique could act as a complement to LGD, amplifying its effect, but the habitat characteristics must be considered to make it effective. LGD whole-body odor, a more realistic risk signal, representing the presence of LGD without exposing mesocarnivores to a real encounter, i.e. a perceptual trap, could contribute to reduce livestock losses and carnivore threats from livestock owners, aiming to facilitate coexistence between livestock production and native carnivores.

AB  - Adaptive management is critical to maintaining resilient fisheries in our rapidly changing ocean environments. However, establishing appropriate and cost-effective monitoring programmes that adequately capture the responses of fisheries to climate change have been elusive. The coastal waters of central and northern Namibia are a global hotspot of ocean warming, with several responses by fish impacting its coastal fisheries. One documented change is a poleward distributional shift of the west coast dusky kob, Argyrosomus coronus into Namibia, where it has begun to hybridize with the congeneric A. inodorus. With considerably different life histories, it is critical that managers can differentiate between these species and the hybrids to appropriately manage the most important recreational and commercial linefish species (bycatch and biomass) in Namibia. In this paper, we used otolith shape analysis, Linear Discriminant Analyses (LDA) to show that otolith shape can be used to distinguish between species and their putative hybrids, identified based on mitochondrial DNA and nuclear microsatellite data. A total of 342 individuals from northern and central Namibia (northern Benguela) between 18.5 and 22.7 degrees S were genetically identified, with a subsample of 217 paired with otolith shape analysis. Otolith shape analyses with LDA and leave-one-out cross validation showed successful species identification at 96.3 % accuracy, and improved accuracy of hybrid identification compared to using body morphology by 50 %. The Fourier descriptors provided excellent classification accuracy for separating A. coronus from A. inodorus (and putative hybrids, but poorer classification accuracy for separating the hybrids from A. inodorus (4/8). We thus recommend using otolith shape analysis for distinguishing the two species but suggest that genetic identification is still required to monitor hybridization. Monitoring for adaptive management should therefore include routine otolith collection and species classification to improve stock assessment and promote the development of appropriate management strategies for this important fishery in the northern Benguela.

AB  - Copepods provide a rich organic microenvironment allowing the settlement and proliferation of microorganisms, forming dynamic microbial hotspots in the oceans. Such symbiotic associations in the plankton were previously hypothesized to be especially developed in warm oligotrophic seas, as they may serve as alternative sources of nutrients in biologically poor waters. Aiming to better understand how copepod microbiomes are shaped in an oligotrophic sea, we characterized microbiota associated with three dominant coastal epipelagic copepod species in the ultra-oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean Sea using amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Our results show that copepod-associated microbial communities were host-specific rather than determined by seasonal environmental changes. In the filter-feeding copepod with a tendency to herbivory, Temora stylifera, microbial diversity was low and relatively stable throughout the year. In contrast, omnivorous copepods, the ambush-feeding Oithona nana, and the mixed-feeding Centropages ponticus harbored more diverse microbiomes dominated by transient taxa. We suggest that filter-feeding strategy and narrow food spectrum can limit copepod-microbe interactions, while the ambush and mixed feeding strategies combined with omnivory confer higher microbial diversity. Filter feeders may reduce the recruitment of opportunistic microbes by maintaining high fidelity associations, as indicated by the large number of core taxa in T. stylifera. We underline the importance of the copepod-microbe associations in nutrient-impoverished ecosystems, based on predicted enrichment of nitrogen metabolism in the core microbiome, mostly during summer when the shallow coastal waters are nitrogen-depleted.
   Copepods provide a rich organic microenvironment allowing the settlement and proliferation of microorganisms. Such symbiotic associations were previously hypothesized to be especially developed in warm oligotrophic seas. In the ultraoligotrophic Levantine Sea, we found that copepod-associated microbial communities were host-specific, suggesting that the filter-feeding strategy and narrow food spectrum can limit copepod-microbe interactions, while the ambush and mixed feeding strategies combined with omnivory confer higher microbial diversity.image

AB  - The burgeoning illegal trade in succulents in southern Africa presents a critical conservation and social development challenge. Drawing parallels with the trajectory of the response to rhinoceros poaching, we considered the consequences of conservation law enforcement measures, particularly the militarization of antipoaching efforts. The response to rhinoceros poaching not only resulted in so-called green militarization, but also led to extrajudicial killings, human rights abuses, and the disproportionate targeting of low-level poachers. The nature of wildlife trade prohibition is complex and often contested, and many actors operating in illegal wildlife trades dispute the label of illegal for socioeconomic, cultural, historical, or political reasons. This contestation is crucial when considering Indigenous cultural and medicinal values of succulents, with Indigenous Peoples and local communities questioning the criminalization of traditional plant harvesting practices. As the illegal trade in succulents continues to grow, it is imperative for conservationists to consider a nuanced approach. We call for a socioecological harm reduction approach that emphasizes community engagement, sustainable use, and codesigned interventions. Such an approach could help balance the scales of ecological conservation and human dignity in the face of growing wildlife trade challenges.

AB  - In the context of today's rapid economic development and increasingly strict ecological protection, interactions between humans and wildlife will intensify. Therefore, we need to identify the spatial distribution of such interactions and to take measures to mitigate possible negative interactions. Using the Three-Rivers Source Region as a case study, we combined species habitat suitability, species feeding habits, species conservation levels and human impact intensity to construct a "human-wildlife spatial interaction index" (HWSII) to evaluate the intensity of human-wildlife spatial interactions. The overall level of HWSII was relatively low in the Three-River Source Region. Higher potential human-wildlife interactions occurred in areas with roads and railways. Areas of relatively high interactions between carnivores and livestock were mainly located in the southern part of the study area, and those with relatively high interactions between herbivores and livestock appeared in the western and eastern parts. Managers in these areas should consider mitigation measures. Although developed for a specific region of China, the 'human-wildlife spatial interaction index' could have application in other areas of the world for setting a baseline reference to identify areas with the potential for high levels of human-wildlife interactions and pinpoint places where potential negative interactions can be mitigated.

AB  - Tree endophytic fungi play an important role in reducing insect herbivory, either by repelling them or killing them directly. Identifying which fungi show such activity could lead to new environmentally friendly pesticides. In this study, the Mediterranean basin climate conditions are projected to harshen in the next decades, will increase vulnerability of tree species to pest invasions. Endophytic fungi were isolated from wood and leaves of Quercus pyrenaica, Q. ilex and Q. suber and tested for virulence against adults of the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor L. using a direct contact method. Only 3 of 111 sporulating isolates had entomopathogenic activity, all identified as Lecanicillium lecanii. The pathogenicity of L. lecanii on T. molitor resulted in a median lethal time (TL50) of 14-16 d. Compared with commercial products, L. lecanii caused faster insect death than the nematode Steinernema carpocapsae and nuclear polyhedrosis virus (no effect on T. molitor survival), and slower than Beauveria bassiana (TL50 = 5), Beauveria pseudobassiana (TL50 = 8d) and Bacillus thuriengensis (80% mortality first day after inoculation). Mortality was also accelerated under water stress, reducing TL50 by an additional 33%. Remarkably, water stress alone had a comparable effect on mortality to that of L. lecanii isolates. This study confirms T. molitor as a good model insect for pathogenicity testing and agrees with management policies proposed in the EU Green Deal.

AB  - Some plant traits may be legacies of coevolution with extinct megafauna. One example is the convergent evolution of 'divaricate' cage architectures in many New Zealand lineages, interpreted as a response to recently extinct flightless avian browsers whose ancestors arrived during the Paleogene period. Although experiments have confirmed that divaricate habit deters extant browsers, its abundance on frosty, droughty sites appears consistent with an earlier interpretation as a response to cold, dry Plio-Pleistocene climates. We used 45 protein-coding sequences from plastid genomes to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the divaricate habit in extant New Zealand lineages. Our dated phylogeny of 215 species included 91% of New Zealand eudicot divaricate species. We show that 86% of extant divaricate plants diverged from non-divaricate sisters within the last 5 Ma, implicating Plio-Pleistocene climates in the proliferation of cage architectures in New Zealand. Our results, combined with other recent findings, are consistent with the synthetic hypothesis that the browser-deterrent effect of cage architectures was strongly selected only when Plio-Pleistocene climatic constraints prevented woody plants from growing quickly out of reach of browsers. This is consistent with the abundance of cage architectures in other regions where plant growth is restricted by aridity or short frost-free periods.

AB  - Diatomite (DE) has been used for nitrogen conservation during the composting of feces but its effects on antibiotic resistance genes (ARG5) and the associated mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, DE was added at three different proportions (0%, 4%, and 8%) to swine manure during composting. The results showed that adding DE helped to reduce the abundances of ARGs and the maximum decrease (88.99%) occurred with the highest dose. DE amendment promoted the transformation of reducible copper into a more stable form, i.e., the residual fraction, which reduced the selective pressure imposed by copper and further decreased the abundances of ARGs. Tn916/1545 and int! 1 were critical genetic components related to ARGs, and thus the reductions in the abundances of ARGs may be attributed to the suppression of horizontal transfer due to the decreased abundances of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). The microbial community structure (bacterial abundance and diversity) played key role in the evolution of ARG5. DE could enhance the competition between hosts and non-hosts of ARGs by increasing the bacterial community diversity. Compared with CK, DE amendment optimized the bacterial community by reducing the abundances of the potential hosts of ARGs and pathogens such as Corynebacterium, thereby improving the safety of the compost product. In addition, KEGG function predictions revealed that adding DE inhibited the metabolic pathway and genes related to ARGs. Thus, composting with 8% DE can reduce the risk of ARG transmission and improve the practical value for agronomic applications.

AB  - Understanding the occupancy and density estimate of Northern Red Muntjac (Muntiacus vaginalis) at a landscape scale is crucial due to their significant ecological impact on ecosystems, particularly as prey for large predators. This study employed a single-season site occupancy model to assess the occupancy and density of Northern Red Muntjac using camera traps in the east Sikkim and Darjeeling hills Central Himalayan landscape from 2018 to 2020. A total of 513 photo captures of Northern Red Muntjac were obtained from 3150 trap nights with a naive occupancy estimate of 0.64 for the Central Himalayan landscape. The top model revealed positive influences of broadleaved forest (beta = 0.93 +/- 0.26), mixed forest (beta = 0.6 +/- 0.47), and slope (beta = 0.2 +/- 0.24) on the occupancy probability, while elevation (beta = -0.08 +/- 0.24) and ruggedness (beta = -0.53 +/- 0.23) had negative influences. Similarly, broadleaved forest (beta = 1.3 +/- 0.24), mixed forest (beta = 0.74 +/- 0.39), and ruggedness (beta = 0.62 +/- 0.25) positively influenced the detection probability, whereas elevation (beta = -0.3 +/- 0.22) and slope (beta = -1.13 +/- 1.21) had negative effects. The study estimated a total abundance of 169.23 +/- 20.77 individuals with a density of 0.33 per square kilometre in the landscape. This study is a pioneering effort and provides a foundation for future investigations into the occupancy and density estimate of Northern Red Muntjac in the Central Himalayas.

AB  - The present study provides the first results of the exploratory research campaign to Gloria seamount (summit at 45.03 degrees N, 15.54 degrees W), a newly identified seamount in the NE Atlantic. New multibeam bathymetry and an 8 h remote operated vehicle footage and photography data were compiled and analyzed to give the first insights on the geological nature and benthic megafauna assemblages of Gloria seamount. Footage evidenced three distinct seafloor coverage areas, ranging from unconsolidated fine sediment with ripple marks, to increasingly coarser-grain sediment with large blocks, to outcrops with steep slopes along successive ridges, locally exhibiting vol-canic structures. The deep-sea benthic assemblages differed with depth (2700-2450 m) and seafloor substrate type. In sediment habitats, pink holothurians (Elpidiidae) and brittle stars (Ophiuroidea) were recorded, whereas in hard substrates, sponges (Hexactinellida and Demospongiae) and stalked crinoids (Crinoidea) were mixed with distinct coral specimens, such as bamboo corals (Isidiidae) and Coralliidae (Scleralcyonacea). The integration of these data contribute to the geo-habitats knowledge of an unexplored seamount.

AB  - Simple Summary In the non-growing season, beavers fell woody plants that they primarily use as a food source. It is well known that parameters such as woody plant availability, trunk diameter, and distance of woody plants from water influence food selection. Less information is available on the felling of specific species in different stand types where different forest management takes place. This makes the beaver a conflict species that causes damage to commercial forests, and information on foraging behavior in relation to environmental factors is very important. Especially as beaver populations continue to increase. In the three types of forest stands (monoculture, mixed forest, and natural forest), species selection, the intensity of felling, the distance of felled woody plants, and trunk diameter vary. The beaver, which generally prefers non-commercial tree species (willow, poplar, etc.), also adapts to and uses commercial oaks in commercial forests. These are most preferred at stand ages up to twenty years, i.e., smaller diameters but greater stand densities. The results suggest that by using knowledge of foraging behavior, economically profitable species can be protected by encouraging the non-commercial species most preferred by beaver (predominantly willow) near the shoreline. In addition, the natural tree composition around rivers or lakes will be promoted. Native ecosystems have been transformed by humans into cultural landscapes, resulting in the disruption of natural interactions, with some species unable to adapt and disappearing from such landscapes. Other species were able to adapt their behavior to current environmental conditions. In some places, forest management has gradually transformed native diversified forests into stands converted for the greatest profit in the wood matter, thereby affecting the food availability for herbivores, among them the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber Linnaeus, 1758). This study summarizes knowledge on non-vegetation diet selection by beavers in commercial and natural forests in the Czech Republic. A sample size of 25,723 woody plant specimens checked in 288 forest stands showed that beavers prefer willow, poplar, or hazel, but where these are less available, commercial tree species such as oak may dominate the diet and cause economic losses in forestry. Significant differences were also observed in a preference for different trunk diameters and distances from water in different types of stands. In terms of stand types, commercial monocultures are the most felled, while the probability of felling decreases with the age of stands. Based on these results and discussion, it is suggested that commercial forest stands including economically valuable woody plant species (e.g., oak, ash) could be protected through appropriate management measures, such as increasing the proportion of deciduous softwood stands along the riverbanks, which would distract the beavers from commercial woody plant species.

AB  - The carpsuckers, which include Quillback Carpiodes cyprinus, river carpsucker Carpiodes carpio, and highfin carpsucker Carpiodes velifer, are ictiobine catostomids (Catostomidae) native to North America. At present, the Carpiodes are classified for management purposes in a multi-species group (derogatorily labeled "rough fish") by state agencies throughout most of their USA range. This non-specific fisheries management persists despite widespread declines among Catostomidae in North America, and as additional fishing pressures have recently evolved. Carpiodes are increasingly targeted by bowfishing with virtually no regulation, monitoring, or management. From 2018 to 2021, we analyzed the otoliths of 81 Quillback from a Minnesota population to quantify size at age, onset of sexual maturity, accrual of age spots, and recruitment dynamics. Allometric analysis revealed that otolith size increases with body mass and age at rates greater than rates for total length, scale length, and operculum length in Quillback. Our findings also indicate Quillback can possibly live at least 44 years, reach sexual maturity around ages 8-9 years, accrue black spots on epidermal tissue, similar to age-spot pigmentation in bigmouth buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus, after 30 years, and exhibit more variable recruitment than previously documented. The life history traits of Carpiodes warrant further study for three primary reasons: the "rough fish" label has perpetuated systemic neglect, there are rising rates of exploitation, and the majority of catostomids are already classified as imperiled. Management requires updated life history data in the face of these challenges.

AB  - Simple Summary In surveillance studies conducted in industrialized EU nations, a rise has been noted in hepatitis E infections that are unrelated to travel. According to previous research studies, eating undercooked or uncooked meat and organs, as well as products from pigs or other wild animals (wild boars and deer), was predominantly linked to human hepatitis caused by the hepatitis E virus genotype 3. Furthermore, domestic pigs and wild boars represent nature's primary reservoirs of this virus, and the liver is the main organ for hosting this virus.Abstract The goal of this study conducted in Serbia was to detect HEV in pig liver samples from slaughterhouses, retail outlets, and environmental swabs over the course of a year. All positive HEV samples were measured and expressed as HEV gene copy numbers per gram of sample, and a representative number of samples were sequenced using the Sanger approach. A total of 45 HEV-positive samples were re-amplified using nested RT-PCR employing CODEHOP primers targeting ORF2 (493 nucleotides). The average prevalence of the HEV genotype 3 in all pig liver samples from the slaughterhouses was 29%, while HEV prevalence was 44% in liver samples from animals younger than 3 months. HEV RNA was found in thirteen out of sixty (22%) environmental swab samples that were taken from different surfaces along the slaughter line. Our findings confirmed seasonal patterns in HEV prevalence, with two picks (summer and winter periods) during the one-year examination. Among HEV-positive samples, the average viral particles for all positive liver samples was 4.41 +/- 1.69 log10 genome copies per gram. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the majority of HEV strains (43/45) from Serbia were grouped in the HEV-3a subtype, while two strains were classified into the HEV-3c subtype, and one strain could not be classified into any of the HEV-3 subtypes.

AB  - Based on the historical background of the changes made to the grassland property rights system, the first part of this study restores the changes in property rights systems in six major autonomous counties of grassland animal husbandry production in Qinghai region, while the second part qualitatively analyzes the changes in grassland animal husbandry operations and herdsmen's life under the changes in property rights. The results show that, with the reform of the property rights system, the range of livestock grazing has changed from large-scale nomadic grazing to regional rotational grazing. The herds are mainly yaks and Tibetan sheep, accounting for more than 90%, with the proportion of Tibetan sheep being higher than that of yaks. The numbers of total livestock and those on the market first rose and then declined, showing a dynamic balance in recent 10 years, while the number of breeding female animals has increased year by year. Artificial grass planting has gradually become popularized in pastoral areas. The time span of livestock supplementary feeding has increased and is more scientific, and the output value of animal husbandry has increased year by year, showing a strong peak associated with intensification. The proportion of the population engaged in animal husbandry has decreased gradually with increasing population in the region. The income sources of herdsmen have become more and more diversified and are increasing year by year, and the Engel coefficient presents a downward trend. The human environment in pastoral areas has improved. Based on the above analysis, suggestions for the sustainable and high-quality production of animal husbandry under the current grassland property rights system are put forward, as well as for the construction of green organic agricultural and livestock product export land in Qinghai Province.

AB  - The residues of glyphosate are found to remain in soils longer than previously reported, affecting rhizosphere microbes. This may adversely affect crop and other non-target plants because the plant's resilience and resistance largely rely on plant-associated microbes. Ubiquitous glyphosate residues in soil and how they impact mutualistic microbes inhabiting the aboveground plant parts are largely unexplored.We studied the effects of herbicide residues in soil on Epichloe sp., which are common endophytic symbionts inhabiting aerial parts of cool-season grasses. In this symbiosis, the obligate symbiont subsists entirely on its host plant, and in exchange, it provides alkaloids conferring resistance to herbivores for the host grass that invests little in its own chemical defence.We first show decreased growth of Epichloe endophytes in vitro when directly exposed to two concentrations of glyphosate or glyphosate-based herbicides. Second, we provide evidence for a reduction of Epichloe-derived, insect-toxic loline alkaloids in endophyte-symbiotic meadow fescue (F. pratensis) plants growing in soil with a glyphosate history. Plants were grown for 2 years in an open field site, and natural herbivore infestation was correlated with the glyphosate-mediated reduction of loline alkaloid concentrations.Our findings indicate that herbicides residing in soil not only affect rhizosphere microbiota but also aerial plant endophyte functionality, which emphasizes the destructive effects of glyphosate on plant symbiotic microbes, here with cascading effects on plant-pest insect interactions.

AB  - During the late Miocene, the development of topography of the eastern margin of the Puna Plateau of the Central Andes, was related to the onset of the eastward migration and foreland fragmentation. The Guanaco and Piquete formations (late Miocene-early Pleistocene, Jujuy Subgroup) represent a thick succession of the adjacent foreland. These units outcrop in the Rio Chico (=Xibi Xibi) locality (Jujuy in north-west Argentina), a transition zone between the Eastern Cordillera (EC) and the Subandean Ranges (SR). We combine a detailed stratigraphic section, paleocurrent measurements, provenance and facies analyses, as well as a new absolute age near to the top of the Guanaco Formation (5.7 +/- 0.8 Ma), and new data on the Neogene environmental changes in this region to characterize these units in the context of the regional tectono-sedimentary evolution. Our analyses suggest a progradation of an alluvial-fan system over a braided-fluvial system, linked to an increase in relief due to rapid shortening pulses and associated to the regional climatic changes in this part of the Central Andes. In the studied area, the earliest uplift of the eastern margin of the Puna Plateau and other areas of the EC generated higher topographic relief to the north and north-west, which increased the relevance of local sources and caused the deflection of paleo-rivers toward the south. The limit between the Guanaco and Piquete formations was reinterpreted to be located 1000 m higher in the stratigraphic section compared to previous proposals, in agreement with the age of the newly dated tuff. Our analysis improves the temporal and spatial characteristics of tectonic processes in the southern Central Andes and provides a framework for the study of landscape as well as biotic, and environmental changes during the late Miocene within the context of the eastward migration of the orogenic front and coeval foreland evolution in the Central Andes.

AB  - Intraspecific conflict can be costly; therefore, many species engage in ritualized contests composed of several stages. Each stage is typically characterized by different levels of aggression, arousal, and physical conflict. During these different levels of "intensity," animals benefit from communicating potential information related to features such as resource holding potential, relative fighting ability, level of aggression, intent (i.e., fight or flight), and whether or not the competitor currently holds the resource (e.g., a receptive female). This information may be conveyed using both visual displays and a complex acoustic repertoire containing fixed (e.g., age, sex, and body size) and flexible information (e.g., motivation or arousal). Calls that contain fixed information are generally considered "discrete" or stereotyped, while calls that convey flexible information are more "graded," existing along an acoustic continuum. The use of displays and calls, and the potential information they convey, is likely dependent on factors like intensity level. The breeding system of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) involves intense male competition for access to a relatively limited number of breeding females (the resource). Here, we investigated the behavior and acoustic repertoire of competitive groups of humpback whales to determine if an increase in intensity level of the group was correlated with an increase in the complexity of the vocal repertoire. We categorized the behavior of humpback whales in competitive groups into three mutually exclusive stages from low to high intensity. While discrete calls were infrequent compared to graded calls overall, their use was highest in "low" and "moderate" intensity groups, which may indicate that this stage of contest is important for assessing the relative resource holding potential of competitors. In contrast, visual displays, call rates, and the use of graded call types, were highest during "high intensity" competitive groups. This suggests that flexible information may be more important in "high intensity" levels as males continue to assess the motivation and intent of competitors while actively engaged in costly conflict. We have shown that the relatively complex social call repertoire and visual displays of humpback whales in competitive groups likely functions to mediate frequently changing within-group relationships.

AB  - Flower colour variation is ubiquitous within and between populations, which is why it has long been a focal point for studies of natural selection. This body of work has uncovered a wide range of selective agents, including pollinators, herbivores and various abiotic factors. Nevertheless, we lack an integrative framework for predicting the phenotypic outcome in terms of floral pigmentation when these forces act collectively and often in opposition. We here present such a framework through a model that incorporates selection on pigmentation at the vegetative phase (i.e. through survival to reproduction) and at the flowering phase (i.e. on pollinator attraction). We focus on anthocyanins as common class of pigments although the model is equally applicable to any compounds that can be jointly expressed in vegetative tissue and in flowers. We explore the dynamics of our model in a theoretical context and in four scenarios based on classic systems for studying selection on flower colour. Our model predicts that pollinators are the main driver for flower colour evolution, but selection on seedling survival plays a major role in the absence of pollen limitation, that is, if pollinator abundance is sufficiently high, or if pollinator preference is absent or weak (high variance in colour preference). In each of the case studies, our model recovered the predicted patterns of fitness for each floral morph given the strength and nature of selection. This work suggests that selection at the vegetative phase must act alone or be exceptionally strong to negate pollinator preference for particular colours. Nevertheless, the influence of differential survival associated with anthocyanin production leaves a clear signature on the fitness curves, suggesting that nonpollinator agents of selection can often be detected from empirical data. Synthesis: Overall, the application of this model to empirical systems will be key for understanding how flower colour diversity evolves and for predicting how changes in climate and pollinator communities may jointly alter evolutionary trajectories.

AB  - Wild boars inhabit diverse climates, including frigid regions like Siberia, but their migration history and cold adaptation mechanisms into high latitudes remain poorly understood. We constructed the most comprehensive wild boar whole-genome variant dataset to date, comprising 124 samples from tropical to frigid zones, among which 47 Russian, 8 South Chinese and 3 Vietnamese wild boars were newly supplemented. We also gathered 75 high-quality RNA-seq datasets from 10 tissues of 6 wild boars from Russia and 6 from southern China. Demographic analysis revealed the appearance of Russian wild boars in Far East of Asia (RUA) and Europe (RUE) after the last glacial maximum till similar to 10 thousand years ago. Recent gene flow (<100 years) from RUA to RUE reflects human-mediated introductions. Cold-region wild boars exhibit strong selection signatures indicative of genetic adaptation to cold climates. Further pathway and transcriptomic analyses reveal a novel cold resistance mechanism centered on enhanced vitamin A metabolism and catalysis, involving the reuse of UGT2B31 and rhythm regulation by ANGPTL8, RLN3 and ZBTB20. This may compensate for the pig's lack of brown fat/UCP1 thermogenesis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of cold adaptation and improve our understanding of Eurasian wild boar migration history.

AB  - Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides are bottom-dwelling flatfish that support commercial and community fisheries in Baffin Bay, Canada. Recently, exploratory inshore summer fisheries have raised concerns surrounding the bycatch of Greenland sharks Somniosus microcephalus and Arctic skate Amblyraja hyperborea, which are susceptible to overfishing due to their conservative life history traits. To explore fisheries selectivity and opportunities for bycatch mitigation, we combined pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) and fisheries data to assess habitat overlap and catch trends across these 3 species. PSAT data showed variable inter-specific overlap, with Greenland sharks primarily inhabiting depths <1000 m (725 +/- 193 m), Greenland halibut inhabiting a narrower depth range (1030 +/- 113 m), and Arctic skates overlapping depths (950 +/- 225 m) of both species. However, fisheries data suggested high inter-specific overlap at deepest depths, with peak catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of all species at depths 800-1000 m. A marked decline in Greenland shark CPUE was observed throughout the fishing season which was best explained by cumulative fishing pressure. Combined tagging and fisheries data suggest that targeting specific seasonal habitat will not decrease bycatch, and inshore summer longline fisheries should be evaluated in the context of potentially high elasmobranch mortality, with enforced bycatch handling practices and alternative mitigation measures (e.g. gear modification or reduced soak times) required.

AB  - Suitable habitat fragment size, isolation, and distance from a source are important variables influencing community composition of plants and animals, but the role of these environmental factors in determining composition and variation of host-associated microbial communities is poorly known. In parasite-associated microbial communities, it is hypothesized that evolution and ecology of an arthropod parasite will influence its microbiome more than broader environmental factors, but this hypothesis has not been extensively tested. To examine the influence of the broader environment on the parasite microbiome, we applied high-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of 16S rRNA to characterize the microbiome of 222 obligate ectoparasitic bat flies (Streblidae and Nycteribiidae) collected from 155 bats (representing six species) from ten habitat fragments in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Parasite species identity is the strongest driver of microbiome composition. To a lesser extent, reduction in habitat fragment area, but not isolation, is associated with an increase in connectance and betweenness centrality of bacterial association networks driven by changes in the diversity of the parasite community. Controlling for the parasite community, bacterial network topology covaries with habitat patch area and exhibits parasite-species specific responses to environmental change. Taken together, habitat loss may have cascading consequences for communities of interacting macro- and microorgansims.

AB  - The wild boar, an impactful invasive species in Brazil, is subject to population control activities, which often include the use of hunting dogs. Hunters commonly consume wild boar meat, which is also used to feed their dogs, posing a risk of Toxoplasma gondii infection for humans and both T. gondii and Neospora caninum for dogs. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of infection in wild boars (n = 127) and hunting dogs (n = 73) from Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Paran<acute accent>a states. We employed histopathological, serological (indirect fluorescent antibody test), and molecular techniques (endpoint polymerase chain reaction). Histopathology slides of wild boar tissue (central nervous system, heart, skeletal muscle, liver, spleen, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, lymph nodes, and thyroid) sections revealed no T. gondii or N. caninum cysts (0/47). Antibodies anti-T. gondii were detected in 35/108 (32.4%) and anti-N. caninum in 45/108 (41.7%) wild boars. Only 2/18 (11.1%) wild boar tissue homogenate samples tested positive for T. gondii on endpoint PCR. Hunting dogs showed antibodies against T. gondii in 62/73 (85%) and against N. caninum in 31/73 (42%). The presence of antibodies against T. gondii and N. caninum in wild boars and hunting dogs, along with T. gondii DNA detection in wild boars, indicates the circulation of these parasites. Educating hunters on preventing these foodborne diseases, including zoonotic risks, is crucial.

AB  - The species composition and distribution of the genus Nematodirus have not been studied in Uzbekistan for a long time, even though nematodes are widespread in the digestive tract of domestic and wild ruminants and are one of the main components of the Molineidae fauna.The article presents the results of a study on the morphometric and molecular analysis of the genus Nematodirus Ransom, 1907, nematodes of the digestive system of ruminant ungulates living in the territory of Uzbekistan. In the study, the species of Nematodirus identified from domestic sheep and goats can mainly be distinguished by the shape of the male spicules and the structure of the bursa. Nematodirus abnormalis can be distinguished from other species because the tip of the spicule is slightly curved and covered with an asymmetrical lanceolate membrane, N. oiratianus has a fused tip and a thin tube-like shape, and N. spathiger has a slightly curved distal tip of the spicule. Furthermore, based on the nucleotide sequence results of the rDNA ITS-2 region, the N. abnormalis samples studied were found to match Nematodirus sp. in the GenBank database, while the N. oiratianus and N. spathiger samples were 98-99% similar to the respective species. Phylogenetic analysis using ITS-2 nucleotide sequences revealed that N. oiratianus and N. abnormalis are closely related and sister species and N. spathiger and N. helvetianus are also phylogenetically close. The species N. abnormalis was deposited for the first time in the GenBank database.

AB  - A trade-off between structural and chemical defences against herbivory in woody plants is alleged to depend on edaphic factors in African savannas. We studied anti-herbivory traits, in an edaphic mosaic of fertile and infertile soils within a savanna landscape in East Africa, towards elucidating herbivory defence traits expressions in woody plants of African savannas. We used data of 81 plants for 8 species from 8 sites - four sites from fertile soils (42 plants) and another four sites from infertile soils (39 plants). We did not find a general divide between structural and chemical strategies in our data. Instead, we found a range of defence traits combinations. Our results highlight that in woody plants of African savannas, chemical and structural defences can augment each other, and not necessarily trade-off. The diversity of herbivores, ranging from insects to mesobrowsers, may have driven the evolution of multiple defence strategies within the African savannas.

AB  - Simple Summary Adaptation strategies developed by sheep breeders against climate change are essential for sustainable production. This study was designed to determine the effects of climate change on perception, the risks of sheep farmers and the actions taken to mitigate these impacts. Nearly all farmers in both production systems agreed on the increased use of drugs and chemicals in their farming activities due to the increase in unknown and known disease outbreaks. The current study showed that transhumance farmers focused mainly on selling livestock as an adaptive strategy. In contrast, semi-intensive farmers concentrated on modifying their farm management and feed operations. Our findings show that semi-intensive farmers do not take deliberated and consistent action against climate change but adapt spontaneously. Sheep farmers' perceptions of climate change and its impacts and the adaptation strategies they consider to address these risks are of great importance in ensuring the resilience of farming practice. This study focused on sheep farmers' perception of climate change and the risks and actions taken to mitigate these impacts. A total of 68 surveys were carried out among sheep farmers (39 transhumance and 29 semi-intensive farmers) by two different representative production systems in Turkiye. Variables regarding the socio-economic profile, climate change impacts, and adaptation strategies were identified and analyzed. Principal component analysis and a Pearson Chi-square test were used to evaluate the data. Both farmers' groups accepted and perceived climate change, showing good awareness and perception. The farmers' attitudes towards adaptation to climate change were associated with production systems. Transhumance farmers had limited adaptation and coping strategies compared to semi-intensive farmers. Transhumance farmers focused mainly on selling livestock (mostly to cope with degraded natural grassland/feed deficiency) as an adaptive strategy. In contrast, semi-intensive farmers focused on modifying their farm management and feed operations, such as changing the feed ratio and supplement use, improving water and feed storage, and considering crop feed production. The knowledge obtained from this study could be helpful for farmers and policymakers who develop long-term small ruminant production strategies that consider the effects of climate change and adapt them to different farming systems in the Turkiye.

AB  - Plants host an array of microbial symbionts, including both bacterial and fungal endophytes located within their roots. While bacterial and fungal endophytes independently alter host plant growth, response to stress and susceptibility to disease, their combined effects on host plants are poorly studied. To tease apart interactions between co-occurring endophytes on plant growth, morphology, physiology, and survival we conducted a greenhouse experiment. Different genotypes of Spartina alterniflora, a foundational salt marsh species, were inoculated with one bacterial endophyte, Kosakonia oryzae, one fungal endophyte, Magnaporthales sp., or co-inoculated. Within the greenhouse, an unplanned herbivory event occurred which allowed insight into the ways bacteria, fungi, and co-inoculation of both endophytic microbes alters plant defense chemicals and changes herbivory. Broadly, the individual inoculation of the bacterial endophyte increased survival, whereas the fungal endophyte increased plant growth traits. Following the herbivory event, the proportion of stems grazed was reduced when plants were inoculated with the individual endophytes and further reduced when both endophytes were present. Across genotypes, anti-herbivore defense chemicals varied by individual and co-inoculation of endophytes. Bacterial inoculation and genotype interactively affected above:below-ground biomass and S. alterniflora survival of ungrazed plants. Overall, our results highlight the variable outcomes of endophyte inoculation on Spartina growth, morphology, phenolics, and survival. This study furthers our understanding of the combined effects of symbionts and plant multitrophic interactions. Further, exploring intra and inter specific effects of plant--microbe symbiosis may be key in better predicting ecosystem level outcomes, particularly in response to global change.

AB  - Various factors such as species, breeds, lactation stage and location affect milk composition. We evaluated the composition of Kilis goat milk in two different seasons on the basis of alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, indoles, carboxylic acids, aromatic hydrocarbons and terpenes. Milk samples were collected at the early and late lactation periods from Hatay and Kilis, Turkey. During both periods, the goats consumed a diversity of plant species. Milk collected from Kilis had 15.27-16.10% total solids,5.70-6.50% fat and 4.80-5.10% protein. The lactose content did not differ significantly between milk samples from the two locations (3.90-4.20%). Total unsaturated fatty acid levels were significantly higher than total saturated fatty acid contents, irrespective of the lactation period (p<0.05). Milk from Hatay was high in saturated fatty acids, aromatic hydrocarbons and benzaldehydes, i.e. 4.50 g 100 g(-1), 6.80-4.65 mg 100 g(-1) and 0.28-0.70 mg 100 g(-1), respectively. Throughout the lactation period, the levels of total solids, fat, protein, saturated and unsaturated fat, alcohol, ketones, esters and carboxylic acid increased, while indole, terpene, aromatic hydrocarbon and aldehyde contents decreased.

AB  - Conserving marine megafauna is a complex task, particularly due to the gaps in our knowledge regarding their distribution and susceptibility to human pressures. While the Ionian Sea, eastern Mediterranean, is renowned for hosting nesting sites for sea turtles and supporting diverse cetacean populations, identifying key marine habitats for elusive species remains a significant challenge in the region. This study offers insights drawn from 15 years of stranding data collected in the Ionian Sea, shedding light on the utilization of marine habitats by marine megafauna. Stranding records of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), reported even beyond the breeding season, highlight the ecological significance of the area as a year-round foraging and developmental habitat. Stranding records have consistently revealed the presence of green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) in the region, emphasizing the need for further research on their habitat utilization. The higher stranding frequencies observed during the spring/summer months can be attributed to factors such as increased individual abundance, heightened reporting rates, or intensified human activities at sea. While human-induced disturbances are evident in the reporting of stranded cetaceans in the region, the annual records of stranded Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) raise questions about the viability of the local population of this endangered species. This study provides substantial evidence suggesting the significance of the Ionian Sea as a potential hotspot for marine megafauna in the Mediterranean. Results highlight the need for policy measures aimed at safeguarding the marine habitats of these charismatic creatures.

AB  - The Morro Bay kangaroo rat Dipodomys heermanni morroensis is a small, nocturnal, burrowing rodent endemic to the vicinity of Morro Bay in San Luis Obispo County, California. It was listed as endangered pursuant to the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1973. Despite many searches over three decades, the Morro Bay kangaroo rat has not been captured or sighted in the wild since 1986. While recognizing that the Morro Bay kangaroo rat may be extinct, two of us in a previous paper also speculated it may be persisting at extremely low density in isolated colonies and recommended surveying with wildlife scent-detection dogs and baited camera traps. We searched with a wildlife scent-detection dog and baited camera traps in four historically occupied areas and detected no Morro Bay kangaroo rats. Unfortunately, our data combined with all other existing data do not allow us to conclude whether the Morro Bay kangaroo rat is extinct or extant. Essentially, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature international standard has not been met to make a definitive determination of extinction. That is, a species should be considered extinct only when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died. We acknowledge that because of resource limitation we surveyed only a small sample of the numerous patches of habitat in the expansive landscape. Further, we now consider the Morro Bay sand spit (total area 4.35 km(2), foredunes 3.75 km(2)), a peripheral area, as potentially part of the geographic range with suitable habitat, and it has never been searched. Therefore, considering all available information, we conclude that the Morro Bay kangaroo rat must be considered as possibly extant. We recommend that search efforts continue in several specific areas, including the Morro Bay sand spit. If the Morro Bay kangaroo rat still exists, it will be challenging and difficult to rediscover because of its likely low density and patchy distribution in the expansive landscape, combined with its small size, nocturnal nature, and secretive lifestyle.

AB  - Bats harbor diverse intracellular Bartonella bacteria, but there is limited understanding of the factors that influence transmission over time. Investigation of Bartonella dynamics in bats could reveal general factors that control transmission of multiple bat-borne pathogens, including viruses. We used molecular methods to detect Bartonella DNA in paired bat (Pteropus medius) blood and bat flies in the family Nycteribiidae collected from a roost in Faridpur, Bangladesh between September 2020 and January 2021. We detected high prevalence of Bartonella DNA in bat blood (35/55, 64%) and bat flies (59/60, 98%), with sequences grouping into three phylogenetic clades. Prevalence in bat blood increased over the study period (33% to 90%), reflecting an influx of juvenile bats in the population and an increase in the prevalence of bat flies. Discordance between infection status and the clade/genotype of detected Bartonella was also observed in pairs of bats and their flies, providing evidence that bat flies take blood meals from multiple bat hosts. This evidence of bat fly transfer between hosts and the changes in Bartonella prevalence during a period of increasing nycteribiid density support the role of bat flies as vectors of bartonellae. The study provides novel information on comparative prevalence and genetic diversity of Bartonella in pteropodid bats and their ectoparasites, as well as demographic factors that affect Bartonella transmission and potentially other bat-borne pathogens.

AB  - Climate variability in the tropics is partly associated with reduced and erratic precipitation, heat waves, and cold snaps thereby exerting abiotic environmental stressors to various arthropod species. For herbivorous insects, such extreme weather events may affect host plant quality and availability resulting in additional stressors such as desiccation and starvation. Neolema abbreviata Larcordaire (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is a key biocontrol agent of Tradescantia fluminensis Vell. (Commelinaceae) and has recently been introduced in South Africa for management of its invasive host plant. However, it remains unknown how environmental stressors may influence its performance under anthropogenic climate change. Here, we investigated the effects of desiccation and starvation on performance of N. abbreviata larvae and adults and implications on biological control. Specifically, we measured desiccation and starvation resistance and critical thermal minima (CTmin) and maxima (CTmax) following stress. Desiccation and starvation pre-treatment reduced both low (CTmin) and high (CTmax) temperature tolerance in both life stages albeit larvae were less cold tolerant and more heat tolerant than adults. In addition, resistance decreased with duration of exposure with desiccation resistance being higher in larvae than in adults, whereas the converse was true for starvation resistance. This indicates the challenges N. abbreviata may encounter when it faces environmental stressors in nature. Therefore, with projected climate change, this may potentially impact on its field establishment, spread, and effectiveness, thereby negatively influencing future classical biocontrol programs. Overall, the results provide valuable information in modelling potential distribution of N. abbreviata and developing sustainable management options of T. fluminensis under rapidly changing environments.

TI  - Midge Larvae Metriocnemus knabi Can Emigrate to New Pitchers Within Sarracenia purpurea After Pitcher Drainage
T2  - NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST
LA  - English
AB  - Many experimental aquatic ecologists are familiar with the commonly used model system Sarracenia purpurea (Purple Pitcher Plant), as this plant contains an entire aquatic ecosystem with obligate invertebrates in its pitcher-shaped leaves. An obligate herbivore of the Purple Pitcher Plant, Exyra fax (Pitcher Mining Moth), consumes plant tissue and chews a hole at the base of the pitcher, draining the pitcher of fluid and thereby creating unsuitable habitat for obligate aquatic invertebrates. Historically, it has been noted that the obligate aquatic invertebrate larvae within the Purple Pitcher Plant are incapable of leaving the pitcher they were initially deposited in as eggs. The objective of this experiment was to determine if larvae of the obligate invertebrate Metriocnemus knabi (Pitcher Plant Midge) is capable of emigrating to new pitchers when faced with pitcher drainage as a result of damage from the Pitcher Mining Moth. We placed midge larvae of varying abundances in experimental pitchers that were drained in a way similar to the work of Pitcher Mining Moth larvae. After drainage, larval midges were allowed 2 weeks to emigrate. At the end of 2 weeks, as much as 38.2% of the initial abundance of M. knabi larvae had emigrated out of drained pitchers to new, viable, fluid-filled pitchers and survived. We present here the first evidence that the obligate Pitcher Plant Midge larvae are capable of emigration when faced with unsuitable habitat.

AB  - Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is involved in the breakdown of triacylglycerols in adipose tissue, which influences muscle tenderness and juiciness by affecting the intramuscular fat content (IMF). This study analyzed the association between different genotypes and haplotypes of the yak HSL gene and carcass and meat quality traits. We used hybridization pool sequencing to detect exon 2, exon 8, and intron 3 variants of the yak HSL gene and genotyped 525 Gannan yaks via KASP to analyze the effects of the HSL gene variants on the carcass and meat quality traits in yaks. According to the results, the HSL gene is highly expressed in yak adipose tissue. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, with 2 of them located in the coding region and one in the intron region. Variants in the 2 coding regions resulted in amino acid changes. The population had 3 genotypes of GG, AG, and AA, and individuals with the AA genotype had lower WBSF values (p < 0.05). The H3H3 haplotype combinations could improve meat tenderness by reducing the WBSF values and the cooking loss rate (CLR) (p < 0.05). H1H1 haplotype combinations were associated with the increased drip loss rate (DLR) (p < 0.05). The presence of the H1 haplotype was associated the increased CLR in yaks, while that of the H2 haplotype was associated with the decreased DLR in yaks (p < 0.05). These results demonstrated that the HSL gene may influence the meat quality traits in yaks by affecting the IMF content in muscle tissues. Consequently, the HSL gene can possibly be used as a biomarker for improving the meat quality traits in yaks in the future.

AB  - Evidence-based interventions designed to reduce wildlife-caused losses are essential for human-wildlife coexistence. The lack of systematic summarization of research effort and evidence makes it challenging for researchers, managers and policymakers to prioritize interventions for evaluation and implementation. Here, we compiled experimental case studies of nonlethal technical interventions designed to reduce the losses of crops, livestock and fishery catches caused by terrestrial carnivores, elephants, farmland birds and marine fauna worldwide. Then, we summarized the research effort and the performance of interventions by their sensory stimuli and target animals. We found that: (i) 54 of 88 interventions included in this study had statistically effective evidence, where only 39% (21/54) were evaluated with more than three experiments; (ii) physical-, sound-, chemical- and light (or visual) -based interventions were the most in numbers and their performance varied greatly; (iii) farmland birds, seabirds and cetaceans were the most studied animal groups while there are only a few experiments for elephants; and (iv) the interventions for marine fauna generally had no impact on the target catch of fisheries. Syntheses and applications: Our results indicated that collective effort is needed to further evaluate interventions using various sensory stimuli and launch incentive programs to motivate the implementation of interventions, particularly related to marine fauna conservation. Our synthesis could be helpful for stakeholders to tackle the negative human-wildlife interactions outlined as Target 4 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.

AB  - While telemetry technology has undoubtedly revolutionized ecological research, the impacts to conservation remain in question. Conservation is, after all, an applied discipline with research that is intentionally designed to inform policies and practices that can demonstrably protect biodiversity. Though telemetry is a tool that is commonly used to raise conservation funding, the technology itself cannot generate these policies and practices. Rather, it is the outputs of the analytical processes interrogating the data deriving from telemetry systems that can do so. This distinction is not semantic but rather fundamental to creating more actionable research. We developed conceptual frameworks to delineate the pathways by which telemetry research can be structured to inform conservation policies, practices, and the decisions of funders motivated to support conservation. We demonstrate how the application of these frameworks can reduce the research-implementation gap so as to make biodiversity conservation more effective. While our assessment uses collaring as a case study, our conceptual frameworks are applicable to all research using animal-borne technology seeking to promote the recovery of species of conservation concern.

AB  - Attacks on humans by Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) is an extreme form of human-elephant conflict. It is a serious issue in southern lowland Nepal where elephant-related human fatalities are higher than other wildlife. Detailed understanding of elephant attacks on humans in Nepal is still lacking, hindering to devising appropriate strategies for human-elephant conflict mitigation. This study documented spatiotemporal pattern of elephant attacks on humans, factors associated with the attacks, and human/elephant behavior contributing to deaths of victims when attacked. We compiled all the documented incidences of elephant attacks on humans in Nepal for last 20 years across Terai and Chure region of Nepal. We also visited and interviewed 412 victim families (274 fatalities and 138 injuries) on elephant attacks. Majority of the victims were males (87.86%) and had low level of education. One fourth of the elephant attacks occurred while chasing the elephants. Solitary bulls or group of subadult males were involved in most of the attack. We found higher number of attacks outside the protected area. People who were drunk and chasing elephants using firecrackers were more vulnerable to the fatalities. In contrast, chasing elephants using fire was negatively associated with the fatalities. Elephant attacks were concentrated in proximity of forests primarily affecting the socioeconomically marginalized communities. Integrated settlement, safe housing for marginalized community, and community grain house in the settlement should be promoted to reduce the confrontation between elephants and humans in entire landscape for their long-term survival.

AB  - Purpose The treatment and management of gentamicin mycelial residue (GMR) is challenging due to the high residual antibiotic content in GMR. The objectives of this study were to investigate the viability of recycling GMR by co-composting with rice chaff, describe the dynamics of the physicochemical and biological parameters and the microbial community, and evaluate the maturity of the composting products.
   Methods The treatment and management of gentamicin mycelial residue (GMR) is challenging due to the high residual antibiotic content in GMR. Three 1-tonne piles of fresh GMR were composted with each treatment; the test treatments contained rice chaff, and the control treatment did not contain rice chaff. Dried GMR was prepared by drying fresh GMR. Composting was performed in cones with a diameter of 2 m and a height of 1.5 m using different ratios of fresh GMR to rice chaff (8:1 and 4:1) or in the absence of rice chaff (control).
   Results The optimal fresh GMR: rice chaff ratio (w/w) was 4:1. Characteristic temperature profiles consisting of a very brief mesophilic phase, a 4-57-day thermophilic phase (maximum of 50-70 degrees C) and a cooling phase (45-35 degrees C) after 58-73 days were observed. After 73 days of co-composting, 99.66% of gentamicin was degraded. All key parameters of the final products, such as the pH (8.12), EC (2.43 mS/cm), carbon/nitrogen ratio (8.6), germination index (96.06%) and crop growth indexes, met the national standards for compost maturity indicators. Compared with those of fungi, the number of OTUs, Chaol index and Shannon index of the bacteria in the T2 treatment clearly increased from 78, 105.14 and 0.97 to 149, 161 and 3.30, respectively, during the whole co-composting. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) revealed that the bacterial community dynamics were closely correlated with the amount of residual gentamicin. Micromonospora and Enterococcus may have been the key microorganisms responsible for the degradation of gentamicin.
   Conclusion The addition of rice chaff improved the decomposition of gentamicin residue in the GMR and made the GMR usable in fertilizer; this result could help antibiotic production factories recycle more of their waste products. The results provide new insight into the potential of applying co-composting with rice chaff to achieve sustainable GMR management.

AB  - Soil contamination by heavy metals is widespread as an inevitable consequence of every-increasing industrial and mining activities. In contaminated habitats, many sensitive plant species may extinct, and a few species, specifically the invasive plants with higher metal tolerance, can survive or colonize in such empty niche. The accumulation of heavy metals in plant tissues is one of the defense strategies against pathogens and herbivores. However, little is known regarding whether increased metal content is beneficial to the defense of invasive plants when competing with native plants. In this study, we explored the foliar chemistry of invasive alligator weed, Alternanthera philoxeroides, and its native congener sessile joyweed, A. sessilis, in response to cadmium (Cd) stress, and further examined how Cd amendment affected the performance and host selection of common cutworm Spodoptera litura (generalist), and alligator weed flea beetle Agasicles hygrophila (specialist). We found that the overall defense ability of invasive A. philoxeroides was higher than its native congener, but the defense mecha-nisms against specialist and generalist herbivores differed under Cd stress. Agasicles hygrophila was susceptible to high Cd stress, and the Cd amendment caused the beetle to shift hosts from A. philoxeroides to A. sessilis. For S. litura, organic rather than inorganic elemental defenses reduced its fitness on invasive plant, and the larvae prefer native plant against invasive plant in most scenarios. Native plant will be more vulnerable to herbivores when competing with invasive plant, especially in metal-polluted habitats. Our study provides a richer view of invasive mechanism in natural systems and appeals for paying more attention to soil contamination in assessing the potential ecological risk of plant invasion.

AB  - The indirect effect of seminatural habitats on pest suppression has been widely studied in agricultural landscapes. By contrast, the role of crop diversity on pest suppression by predators has seldom been explored, particularly using molecular gut-content analysis (MGCA). In addition, differences between early- and late-season effects of landscape complexity on pest control, crucial to ensure season-long control, have received little attention. During 2014 and 2015, we investigated the effect of agricultural landscape complexity and crop diversity on cereal leaf beetle (CLB, Oulema melanoplus) predation early in the season using sentinel egg cards and late in the season by assessing larval predation using MGCA. Early-season CLB egg predation and late-season abundance of Nabis americoferus and coccinellids in wheat fields were positively correlated with amount of woodland habitat in these landscapes. Contrary to our predictions, crop diversity had negative associations with the late-season frequency of larval predation and the abundance of N. americoferus. Predator diversity and the abundance of Hippodamia lady beetles had negative associations with CLB abundance, highlighting the significant contribution of some generalist predators to CLB suppression. Our results suggest that the proportion of woodland and a few major crops (e.g., canola and non-cereal crops), rather than crop diversity, are associated with higher predation at different temporal scales. Overall, our results suggest that a habitat management strategy could be implemented to adjust the crop rotation regime to add the right kind of crop diversity in the landscape to support the natural control of CLB.

AB  - IntroductionThroughout their range, bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations have seen significant disease-associated declines. Unfortunately, understanding of the underlying epidemiological processes driving the disease dynamics in this species has hindered conservation efforts aimed at improving the health and long-term viability of these populations. Individual response to pathogen exposure emerges from dynamic interactions between competing evolutionary processes within the host and pathogen. The host's adaptive immune system recognizes pathogens and mounts a defensive response. Pathogens have evolved strategies to overcome adaptive immune defenses including maintaining high genetic diversity through rapid evolution. The outcomes of this evolutionary warfare determine the success of pathogen invasion of the host and ultimately the success of conservation efforts. MethodsDuring an epizootic dominated by a single strain, we explore these host-pathogen dynamics by examining the variation in effects of pathogen invasion on captive bighorn sheep with differing histories of exposure to genetically diverse strains of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae (Movi). We monitored clinical signs of disease and sampled animals and their environment to detect spread of Movi among 37 bighorn sheep separated into nine pens based on known exposure histories. ResultsWe documented Movi transmission within and across pens and we detected Movi DNA in air, water, and invertebrate samples. Higher levels of antibody to Movi prior to the epizootic were associated with a lower likelihood of presenting clinical signs of pneumonia. Nonetheless, higher antibody levels in symptomatic individuals were associated with more severe progressive disease, increased probability and speed of pneumonia-induced mortality, and reduced likelihood of returning to a healthy state. Bighorn sheep with previous exposure to a strain other than the predominant epizootic strain were more likely to recover. DiscussionOur results indicate that Movi-strain variability was sufficient to overwhelm the adaptive host immunological defenses. This outcome indicates, in free-ranging herds, past exposure is likely insufficient to protect bighorn sheep from infection by new Movi strains, although it influences the progression of disease and recovery within the herd. Therefore, given Movi-strain variability and the lack of immunological protection from past exposure, focusing management efforts on minimizing the introduction of Movi into bighorn herds, through separation of domestic and bighorn sheep and avoidance of management activities that create commingling of bighorn sheep carrying differing Movi strains, will likely be the most effective approach for reducing the effects of disease and achieving bighorn sheep conservation goals.

AB  - Abiotic factors play an important role in species localisation, but biotic and anthropogenic predictors must also be considered in distribution modelling for models to be biologically meaningful. In this study, we formalised the biotic predictors of nesting sites for four threatened Caucasian vultures by including species distribution models (wild ungulates, nesting tree species) as biotic layers in the vulture Maxent models. Maxent was applied in the R dismo package and the best set of the model parameters were defined in the R ENMeval package. Performance metrics were continuous Boyce index, Akaike's information criterion, the area under receiver operating curve and true skill statistics. We also calculated and evaluated the null models. Kernel density estimation method was applied to assess the overlap of vulture ecological niches in the environmental space. The accessibility of anthropogenic food resources was estimated using the Path Distance measure that considers elevation gradient. The availability of pine forests (Scots Pine) and wild ungulates (Alpine Chamois and Caucasian Goat) contributed the most (29.6% and 34.3%) to Cinereous Vulture (Aegypius monachus) nesting site model. Wild ungulate distribution also contributed significantly (about 46%) to the Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) model. This scavenger nests in the highlands of the Caucasus at a minimum distance of 5-10 km from anthropogenic facilities. In contrast, livestock as a food source was most important in colony distribution of Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus). The contribution of distances to settlements and agricultural facilities to the model was 45%. The optimal distance from Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus) nesting sites to settlements was only 3-10 km, to livestock facilities no more than 15 km with the factor contribution of about 57%. Excluding the wild ungulate availability, the ecological niches of studied vultures overlapped significantly. Despite similar foraging and nesting requirements, Caucasian vultures are not pronounced nesting and trophic competitors due to the abundance of nesting sites, anthropogenic food sources and successful niche sharing.

AB  - The center-periphery hypothesis predicts that species are most abundant at the center of their distribution range. Differential herbivory rates between center and periphery populations can explain this variation in species abundance. However, if the geographic center of a species distribution coincides with its ecological optimum, the resource availability hypothesis predicts higher herbivory rates and tolerances at the center compared to the periphery. Biogeographical studies on herbivory have treated these two mechanisms separately, limiting our mechanistic understanding of the role of herbivory in shaping species range limits. We analyzed the role of resource availability on herbivory variation from center to periphery using data collected across the distribution of Thunberbia atacorensis, a range-limited species of West Africa. We used two types of distances: geographic distance (the distance from each plot to the geographic center of all populations) and climatic distance (the distance from each plot to the preferendum of the species). We found no increase in herbivory toward the periphery of the climatic and geographic ranges. However, herbivory rates increased with soil nitrogen. Soil nitrogen decreased from the center to the periphery of the climatic range. Phylogenetic diversity and competition from surrounding plants did not affect herbivory rates. Our study provides insights into how nutrient limitation can shape species center-periphery distribution by altering spatial variation in herbivory rates.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities impacted the ecological health of rivers by altering the physical habitat and water flow as well as by pollution. Monitoring of biotic groups for gauging the river health is a prerequisite for assessing the extent of degradation and formulating management guidelines for river restoration. An assessment using fish-based index of biotic integrity (IBI) was carried out in the Central Indian river, Tapti, for probing its health status. For the multimetric index, twelve metrics were adopted under five categories: taxonomic richness, habitat composition, tolerance indicators, species resilience, and trophic composition. Among the studied sites, Betul in the upper stretch was selected as the reference site for River Tapti, which almost meets the upper expectation of the metrics explored. Continuous scoring method was applied to evaluate the biotic integrity in the selected sites of the river. The IBI score based on the pooled fish abundance data in River Tapti ranged from 33 to 60. Assessment of the ecological health revealed that three-fourth of the river stretch was moderately impaired (25-50% of impairment) and the most deteriorated site was Kamrej with 45% of impairment which might be due to its location in the urban area with high influx of domestic sewage and industrial effluents. The IBI scores were plotted and compared with an independent estimate of water quality. The CCA with environmental and IBI variables revealed higher correlation with each other and the functional groups such as carnivores, herbivores, and fishes with high population doubling time (PDT) were found in close association with nitrate-N, total alkalinity, and specific conductivity. The study urges the need for the adoption of proper management and mitigation measures to restore the health and wealth of aquatic ecosystem.

AB  - Pathogen-mediated selection (PMS) is thought to maintain the high level of allelic diversity observed in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. A comprehensive way to demonstrate contemporary selection is to examine associations between MHC variation and individual fitness. As individual fitness is hard to measure, many studies examine associations between MHC variation and phenotypic traits, including direct or indirect measures of adaptive immunity thought to contribute to fitness. Here, we tested associations between MHC class II variation and five phenotypic traits measured in free-living sheep captured in August: weight, strongyle faecal egg count, and plasma IgA, IgE and IgG immunoglobulin titres against the gastrointestinal nematode parasite Teladorsagia circumcincta. We found no association between MHC class II variation and weight or strongyle faecal egg count. We did, however, find associations between MHC class II variation and immunoglobulin levels which varied with isotype, age and sex. Our results suggest associations between MHC and phenotypic traits are more likely to be found for traits more closely associated with pathogen defence than integrative traits such as bodyweight and highlight the association between MHC variation and antibodies in wild populations.

AB  - Mammalian carnivore diversity within the Reserva Natural del Bosque Mbaracayu in eastern Paraguay is represented by five families (Canidae, Mephitidae, Mustelidae, Procyonidae, and Felidae) and includes large-bodied, apex predators, several omnivores, and numerous mesocarnivores. The competitive exclusion principle argues that sustained spatial and temporal coexistence of two or more species with identical ecological requirements is unsustainable. The Reserve is a mosaic of habitats that has become isolated due to extensive deforestation of the surrounding Upper Parana Atlantic Forest. Nevertheless, it is remarkable in that 16 mammalian carnivore species are documented as coexisting within the Reserve. We sought to determine the extent to which this diverse community is mitigating competition through the partitioning of available niche space by assessing dietary ecology of mammalian carnivores present, including diet breadths and dietary overlap, and by examining spatial patterns within the reserve. Feces were collected from all 16 mammalian carnivore species from seven areas within the reserve and specific identifications were confirmed by molecular analyses. Diet breadth, (B) over cap, standardized diet breadth, (B) over cap (A), and Pianka's Index for dietary overlap, (O) over cap, were calculated. A Chi-square goodness-of-fit test was performed to test for randomness of samples associated with survey areas. Diet analyses indicated a spectrum from dietary generalists to specialists. Species segregated into six dietary guilds, defined as groups of species with (O) over cap > 0.5. Four guilds included only one species each (Neotropical otter, crab-eating fox, jaguar, and puma). The low dietary overlap between jaguar and puma contrasts with studies conducted elsewhere. One guild consisted of four highly omnivorous species (maned wolf, Molina's hog-nosed skunk, crab-eating raccoon, and South American coati). The sixth guild included eight species which mostly consumed small vertebrates, primarily mammals as well as birds and reptiles (bush dog, two mustelines, five small felids). The mustelines (tayra and lesser grison) had extremely high dietary overlap. Although they did not segregate spatially, they are known to occupy distinct niches in vertically stratified forests. The five small felids also showed extremely high dietary overlap. Three of them were found to segregate spatially within the Reserve and two did not, although one (jaguarundi) is known to segregate temporally, being more active diurnally. The exceptionally rich community of mammalian carnivore species at the Reserva Natural del Bosque Mbaracayu appeared to avoid unsustainable competition by a variety of mechanisms, some utilizing different food items, or, in the case of high dietary overlap, utilizing spatial or temporal resources differently.

AB  - Habitat suitability analysis using species distribution models (SDMs) presents a valuable approach for determining appropriate land utilization strategies and crop planting decisions, which are vital to achieve optimal agricultural productivity and ensure environmental sustainability in the context of rapid global change. Aside abiotic conditions, pests emerge as the most important biological factor affecting crop growth. It can be an effective avenue to comprehensively assess land use suitability by building and integrating SDMs for both crops and their pests. Using the MaxEnt model and a bivariate map, we predicted and integrated the habitat suitability of tea (Camellia sinensis) and its primary insect herbivore (Empoasca onukii) in China. Our study explicitly revealed spatial heterogeneity in suitability between the two species, despite finding that they shared common environmental predictors (i.e., temperature, elevation, and soil pH). Results support South China and Southwest China as the most favorable areas for tea cultivation, while highlighting the adverse climatic challenges on tea growth in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and in the northern regions of the Yangtze River. Meanwhile, analyses emphasize the necessity of sustainable leafhopper management strategies in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and in regions along the southeast coast. These findings demonstrate the significance of comparative analysis on the habitat suitability of both crops and insect herbivores, providing valuable insights for agricultural production planning and sustainable pest management. Furthermore, the methods employed in this study hold potential for the application in diverse context, ranging from the control of invasive species to the conservation of endangered biodiversity.

AB  - An increase of nocturnal activity of ungulate species may represent a compensatory opportunity for energy intake, when activity in daylight is hindered by some disturbance events (e.g. hunting or predation). Therefore, mostly-diurnal and crepuscular species may be active in bright moonlight nights whereas others may shift their diurnal activity towards darkest nights to limit their exposure to predators. In natural and undisturbed conditions, the wild boar may be active both during the day and the night, with alternating periods of activity and resting. In this work, we tested whether activity patterns of wild boar, a species with poor visive abilities, were dependent on moon phases and environmental lightening. We aimed to assess if nocturnal activity could be better explained by variations of the lunar cycle or by the variations of environmental lightening conditions, evaluated by means of different measures of night brightness. Data were collected through camera-trapping in Central Italy in 2019-2020. Despite the poor visive abilities of the wild boar, we observed that this ungulate significantly reduced their activity by avoiding the brightest nights. In our study area, the wild boar has to cope with both human pressure (i.e. mostly hunters and poachers) and predation by the grey wolf. Furthermore, the nocturnal activity of wild boar peaked in mid-Autumn, i.e. when hunting pressure is the highest and when leaf fall may bring wild boar to range for long distances to find suitable resting sites for diurnal hours.

AB  - Secondary sexual traits (e.g., horns and antlers) have ecological and evolutionary importance and are of management interest for game species. Yet, how these traits respond to emerging threats like infectious disease remains underexplored. Infectious pneumonia threatens bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations across North America and we hypothesized it may also reduce horn growth in male sheep. We assess the effect of pneumonia on horn size in male bighorn sheep using 12 herd datasets from across the western United States that had horn growth and disease data. Disease resulted in 12-35% reduction in increment (yearly) length and 3-13% reduction in total horn length in exposed individuals. The disease effect was prolonged when pathogens continued to circulate in sheep populations. Further, disease likely delays the age at which horns reach 3/4-curl and prevents achievement of full-curl. This is further evidenced with 6 of the 12 herds experiencing an increase in average age at harvest following die-off events.

AB  - Bats spend more than half of their life in roosts, where key life events transpire. Therefore the availability and selection of roosts are important to bats everywhere, and may limit their ability to exploit every habitat, including agricultural landscapes such as paddy fields, orchards and tea plantations. This study aimed to investigate the day roosts used by insectivorous bat species in tea plantations of Sri Lanka. We surveyed 18 tea plantations where we recorded a total of 44 roosts involving five families and nine species of bats (Hipposideros galeritus, Hipposideros lankadiva, Hipposideros speoris, Rhinolophus beddomei, Rhinolophus rouxii, Megaderma spasma, Pipistrellus ceylonicus, Pipistrellus coromandra and Miniopterus cf. fuliginosus). Most (26) of the recorded roosts were geomorphic, (11) were anthropogenic, and (7) were in vegetation. H. lankadiva and M. cf. fuliginosus are the only species known to roost exclusively in geomorphic roosts; all others were opportunistic. Although protecting bat roosts is crucial for their conservation, it is challenging in view of existing tea management practices. Therefore, natural roosts should be maintained and protected. The introduction of artificial roosts might increase the number of bats able to forage over tea plantations and maximize their consumption of agricultural pests, thereby increasing tea production.

AB  - Inter-specifically, mammalian species with larger brains built of numerous neurons have higher cognitive abilities (CA) but at the expense of higher metabolic costs. It is unclear, however, how this pattern emerged since evolutionary mechanisms act intra-specifically, not inter-specifically. Here, we tested the existence of the above pattern at the species level in the hippocampus-the brain structure underlying CA. We used an artificial selection experiment consisting of lines of laboratory mice divergently selected for basal metabolic rate (BMR)-a trait implicated in brain size evolution, its metabolic costs and CA. Selection on BMR did not affect hippocampus size as a correlated response to this selection. However, the high BMR mice had superior CA and manifested increased neuronal density, higher cytochrome c oxidase density (indexing metabolic costs of neuronal activity) and dendritic spine density (indexing connectivity between neurons). Thus, our study calls into question the generality of patterns of the evolution of CA apparent interspecifically. At the species level, increased CA may arise through the rearrangement of the architecture and function of neurons without a conspicuous increase in their size but increase metabolism.

AB  - Phenotypic traits partly determine expected survival and reproduction, and so have been used as the basis for demographic models of population dynamics. Within a population, the distribution of phenotypic traits depends upon their transmission from parents to offspring, yet we still have a limited understanding of the factors shaping phenotypic transmission in wild populations. Phenotypic transmission can be measured using the phenotypic parent-offspring correlation (C), defined as the slope of the regression of offspring phenotypic trait on parental phenotypic trait, both traits measured at the same age, often at birth. This correlation reflects phenotypic variation due to both additive genetic effects and parental effects. Researchers seldom account for the possible influence of selection on estimates of the phenotypic parent-offspring correlation. However, because individuals must grow, survive, and reproduce before giving birth to offspring, these ,aphic processes might influence the phenotypic parent-offspring correlation in addition to the inheritance process, the latter being the direct relationship between parental and offspring phenotypic traits when the parental trait is measured at age of reproduction and the offspring trait is measured at birth. Here we used a female-based population model to study the relative effects of fertility and viability selections, trait ontogeny and inheritance on C. The relative influence of each demographic process is estimated by deriving the exact formulas for the proportional changes in C to changes in the parameters of integral projection models structured by age and phenotypic traits. We illustrate our method for two long-lived species. We find that C can be strongly affected by both viability and fertility selections, mediated by growth and inheritance. Generally, demographic processes that result in mothers reproducing at similar phenotypic traits regardless of their birth traits, such as high fertility selection or converging developmental trajectories, lead to a decreased C. More generally, our models show how the age and phenotypic dependence of fertility and viability selections can influence phenotypic mother-offspring correlation to a much larger extent than ontogeny and inheritance. Our results suggest that accounting for such dependence is needed to model the distribution of offspring phenotypic traits and the ecoevolutionary dynamics of phenotypic traits reliably.

AB  - Evaluation of stable carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen (delta 15N) isotopes in marine organisms over time addresses how environmental variability (e.g., El Ni & ntilde;o or The Blob) affects habitat use and food resources, respectively. This work focuses on the impact of warm events in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean on the foraging strategies of adult female northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris; NES) from the San Benito Archipelago in Mexico during their post-molting migration, through isotopic variability in pups as maternal indicators. Analysis of delta 15N and delta 13C was carried out on lanugo samples (n = 311) of weaned pups from the 2013-2017, 2019, and 2022-2023 breeding seasons and correlations with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies of the potential foraging areas of female NES from the San Benito Archipelago were investigated. Isotopic niches showed high overlap throughout most of the study period, suggesting a limited impact of SST anomalies on their foraging strategies. However, values of delta 15N and delta 13C differed in 2014, 2018, and 2021 relative to other years, suggesting shifts to distant regions in latitude and longitude, and increased foraging effort during the post-molting migrations of these warm years. Findings demonstrate the flexibility and adaptive capacity of female NES relative to the warm events of the last decade.

AB  - Climate warming has been found to increase forest insect herbivory with potentially important consequences for the performance and distribution of plant species. Dioecious species often show sex-specific responses to abiotic drivers leading to spatial segregation of the sexes. However, little is known about sexual differences in defense against herbivorous insects in response to warming. We used a field survey and glasshouse experiment to test how sex-specific defenses of Populus cathayana against insect herbivory respond to warming. Consumed leaf area in females was greater than in males at +4 celcius experimental warming or lower altitude. The warming treatment did not strongly affect differences in constitutive levels of leaf salicortin, condensed tannins (CT), salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) between the two sexes. However, warming decreased herbivore-induced responses in salicortin, CT, SA, JA and defensive-related enzyme activities (e.g., superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase and lipoxygenase) more in females than in males. Moreover, consumed leaf area in females showed more negative relationships with feeding-induced chemical defense traits than in males. These results show that sex-specific leaf defense against insect herbivory can be mediated by climate warming, and that higher leaf herbivory in females under warming is mainly influenced by decreases in induced defense responses rather than constitutive defense responses.

AB  - Distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic controls on the proportions of naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORMs) in the environment is important for water resource management. In this study, the dynamics of uranium (U) and thorium (Th), two of the most prominent NORM elements, were investigated in the Red Deer River basin using monitoring data collected from 2015 to 2018. More than twofold increases in median proportions of total U (from 0.73 to 1.53 mu g/L) and Th (from 0.008 to 0.104 mu g/L) were observed for sites located downstream of the Steveville badlands, an area of highly erodible bedrock that a similar to 300 km section of the river flows through. Input is highly variable, coinciding mainly with increases in total suspended solids during intense rainstorms in the late summer In-depth examination of monitoring data through factor analysis, multiple linear regression, mass balance calculations, and land use analysis highlights the importance of erosion and subsequent particle transport along river banks in the badlands area on the distribution of total U and Th, while also revealing that groundwater-surface water interaction affects proportions of dissolved U throughout the river. No significant influence from industry or land use on U and Th export was found, and proportions of U and Th in water and suspended sediment are within the natural ranges expected for surface waters and sediments/soils. Methodology employed in this study provides a basic framework for analysis of environmental monitoring datasets, which can be employed in the absence of radiochemical data to study the fate, transport, and sources of NORMs.

AB  - Background and aims: Different ethnobotanical studies carried out in livestock systems in Argentina have highlighted the importance of the knowledge that Criollo goat farmers have about the plants in their environment. The aim of this study was to document the knowledge that goat farmers have about the plants used in the supplementation of goats under extensive management in the Arid Chaco of Catamarca and to analyse the traditional practices involved in the management of these forage resources.
   M&M: Open and semi-structured interviews to 17 key informants of both sex were held in 12 localities distributed in different environments that make up the Arid Chaco. In addition, guided walks with local goat farmers, dedicated to the extensive breeding of Criollo goats, took place.
   Results: Twenty-eight vascular plant species used in five different supplementation strategies were identified. Ethnobotanical data are provided about the name of the plants, parts used in goat supplementation, place and form of collection, mode of transport and conditioning, time of use and category of supplemented animals.
   Conclusions: It is expected that the rich ethnobotanical knowledge provided by goat farmers will contribute to refine future feeding of goats strategies in times of scarcity and the conservation of native forages used in these traditional practices.

AB  - In the Qinba mountainous area of Central China, pig farming has a significant impact on the growth of the rural economy and has substantially increased farmer incomes. Traditional knowledge plays an important role in the selection of forage plant species for pig farming by local people. This study aimed to identify the forage plants used for pig feeding and to catalog indigenous knowledge regarding their use. During 2016 and 2017, ethnobotanical surveys and inventories were conducted in Zhuxi County, Hubei Province, China. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews, key informant reports, free listings, guided field walks, and participatory observations with 77 households in 16 villages in 13 towns/townships. The obtained data were analyzed using a relative frequency citation (RFC) index. Overall, 145 wild forage plants from 91 genera and 31 families were recorded. The most cited families were Asteraceae, Polygonaceae, Urticaceae, Amaranthaceae, Fabaceae, Cruciferae, Caryophyllaceae, and Lamiaceae. Whole plants (75.9%) and tender leaves (12.4%) were the most frequently used parts of the plants. Most of the forage plants were herbaceous (88.9%). Almost all forage plants could be collected throughout the year (62.7%). Raw and cooked were the two main preparation methods. The most frequently cited species were Taraxacum mongolicum, Bidens pilosa, Sonchus oleraceus, Pilea verrucosa, and Pilea pumila var. obtusifolia. A total of 14 species were identified as the top forage plants in Zhuxi County based on their RFC values (RFC value greater than 0.5). Local people possess rich traditional knowledge about the utilization and management of forage plants for pig feeding. However, the maintenance of this traditional knowledge may be seriously threatened by changes in pig feeding modes and the lack of successors. Appropriate strategies and action plans have been suggested for the conservation of traditional knowledge associated with biodiversity and the sustainable use of forage species resources. These include 1) taking targeted measures to protect forage resources and associated traditional knowledge; 2) strengthening research on the forage plants with the highest RFC values for nutritional value, digestibility, other functions, and ecological status; and 3) enhancing the identification of poisonous forage plants.

AB  - Higher heating value (HHV) is one of the most important parameters in determining the quality of the fuels. In this study, comparatively large datasets of ultimate and proximate analysis are constructed to be used in HHV estimation of several classes of fuels, including char & fossil fuels, agricultural wastes, manure (chicken, cow, horse, sheep, llama, and pig), sludge (like paper, paper-mil, sewage, and pulp), micro/macro-algae's, wastes (RDF and MSW), treated woods, untreated woods, and others (non-fossil pyrolysis oils) between the HHV range of 4.22-55.55 MJ/kg. The relationships of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atomic ratios for fuel classes are illustrated by using ternary plots, and the effects of elemental composition on HHV was analyzed with the extensive dataset. Then, the ultimate (U) and ultimate & proximate (UP) datasets were utilized separately to estimate the HHV by using artificial neural networks (ANN). Hyperparameter optimization was carried out and the best performing ANNs were determined for each dataset, which yielded R2 values of 0.9719 and 0.9715, respectively. The results indicated that while ANNs trained by both datasets perform remarkably well, utilization of U dataset is sufficient for HHV estimation. Finally, the best performing ANN models for both U and UP datasets are given in a directly utilizable format enabling the accurate estimation of HHV of any fuel for optimization of fuel processing and waste management operations.

AB  - Comprehensive understanding of the microbiome and resistome evolution in compost is crucial for guaranteeing the safety of organic fertilizers. Current studies using different composting systems and sequencing technologies have yielded varying conclusions on the efficacy of exogenous additives (EAs) in reducing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in compost. This study employed metagenomics to investigate the impact of various EAs on microbial communities, ARGs, their coexistence with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and ARG hosts in co- composting. Our results demonstrated that EAs significantly reshaped the microbial communities and facilitated a notable reduction in total ARG abundance and diversity, primarily by decreasing core ARGs. Cooperative rather than antagonistic relationships among bacteria. The RA changes in total ARGs are mainly caused by a decrease in the prevalence of core ARGs. Furthermore, EAs showed significant efficacy in reducing clinical ARGs, including cfxA, tetX1, cfxA6, vanA, and aac (6 ')-Ib', with diatomite (5 %) and zeolite (5 %) being the most effective. The effect of EAs on ARGs and microbial community assembly were stochastic processes. Composting stage and EAs jointly reduced the association between ARGs and MGEs in the composting system. The reduction of ARGs attributed to a decreased abundance of potential pathogenic ARG-associated hosts and diminished associations with MGEs. In conclusion, EAs present a straightforward and effective approach for promoting ARGs reduction in compost, offering crucial insights for assessing the environmental risks associated with the release of agricultural ARGs.

AB  - The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the world, affecting the natural environment ecosystem and society. Because human society utilizes coastal areas and relies on marine resources for living, research is needed to study human impacts on the coastal marine ecosystem as well as the influence of the changing ecosystem on society. To better understand the changing coastal environments and the impact on society, we performed multidisciplinary research in Qaanaaq, northwestern Greenland. To share and discuss our research results, we organized workshops with residents in Qaanaaq from 2016 to 2019, and in 2022 and 2023. One workshop topic of intense discussion was the summer distribution of Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), because of its socioeconomic importance in the region. Another point of interest for the residents was the potential presence of pollution on the beach, as a result of the nearby village. Residents voiced concern about the accumulation of heavy metals in Mytilus spp. (blue mussel) because residents catch mussels near the dump site. Close collaboration with residents as well as co-design and direction of the research is increasingly important for researchers to contribute to a sustainable future for populations living in the Arctic.

AB  - Simple Summary: The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, is one of the most important citrus pests because it transmits the bacterium that causes citrus Huanglongbing during feeding. The saliva of herbivorous insects can modulate plant defenses and, in turn, impact insect fitness, which is mostly studied in insects feeding on herbaceous plants. The role of saliva in the relationship between the Asian citrus psyllid and its woody host plant citrus, on the other hand, is unknown. Because two citrus aphid species, Aphis spiraecola Patch and Aphis (Toxoptera) citricidus (Kirkaldy), have a contrasting impact on the performance of subsequently infested D. citri, we explored the role of their saliva on D. citri feeding behavior and host plant defenses. We found that the infiltrating saliva of A. spiraecola into the host citrus leaves of the psyllid disrupted the subsequent feeding behavior of D. citri and also activated the expression of genes involved in plant salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) defense pathways. By contrast, saliva infiltrations of A. citricidus (Kirkaldy) promoted D. citri feeding, activated the expression of one gene involved in the SA pathway, and repressed several genes involved in the JA pathway. We demonstrate that the saliva of aphids can affect D. citri performance, possibly by modulating plant defenses. This is the first study to show that insect saliva can influence D. citri feeding behavior by changing plant defenses.
   While herbivorous insect saliva plays a crucial role in the interaction between plants and insects, its role in the inter-specific interactions between herbivorous insects has received little attention. Pre-infestation of citrus plants with Aphis spiraecola Patch and Aphis (Toxoptera) citricidus (Kirkaldy) exhibited positive and negative effects on the performance (feeding and reproduction) of Diaphorina citri Kuwayama. We explored the role of saliva in this plant-mediated interaction by infiltrating fresh and boiled aphid saliva into plants and detecting D. citri feeding behavior and citrus plant defense response. Leaf infiltration of A. spiraecola saliva disrupted the subsequent feeding of D. citri, indicated by prolonged extracellular stylet pathway duration and decreased phloem sap ingestion duration. By contrast, infiltration of A. citricidus saliva decreased the duration of the extracellular stylet pathway and phloem sap ingestion of D. citri. Furthermore, gene expression analysis showed that several salicylic acid (SA)- and jasmonic acid (JA)-pathway-related genes were activated by A. spiraecola saliva infiltration. However, two SA-pathway-related genes were activated and three JA-pathway-related genes were suppressed following A. citricidus saliva infiltration. Treatment with boiled saliva did not similarly impact D. citri feeding behavior or plant defense response. This study suggests that salivary components (those that can be inactivated by heating) from two citrus aphid species differently affect plant defenses and that they were responsible for the contrasting plant-mediated effects of two citrus aphids on the feeding behavior of D. citri.

AB  - Beginning in 2008 the poaching rate of elephants and rhinos began to rise noticeably in eastern and southern Africa. The poaching intensified considerably 2010-2014. Along with the poaching increase, illegal exports of ivory and rhino horn also surged. Pangolin scales and parts of predator cats were often included with ivory and/or rhino horn exports. The great majority of these products were smuggled to Southeast Asia and China. To extract in the field or acquire illegally from government stockpiles and transport increasingly large quantities of ivory and rhino horn to exit ports in all four subregions of sub-Saharan Africa required considerable organization and logistical capabilities on the part of the traffickers. The transnational organized crime (TOC) networks became more organized and larger from about 2009 to late 2014, when significant arrests began of key actors. This review describes five of the main networks, key actors in each and their disruption.
   These arrests and sometimes prosecutions disrupted the operations of the networks and even caused shifts in some cases of home bases and export ports. These disruptions have resulted in significant declines in poaching rates of both elephants and rhinos and product prices in recent years from the 2011-2015 peak years, although other factors were also at play. There is evidence that some members of the networks cooperated with more than one network in supplying products and enabling export and transport to destinations in eastern Asia, indicating that the networks are fluid and adaptable.
   A new TOC network is emerging that operates in southern, Central and West Africa. Investigations are urgently needed to identify key members and disrupt it in order to avoid a renewed pachyderm holocaust.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) and its socioeconomic impacts are a pressing global issue. Accurately quantifying HWCs and their interaction with residential development is crucial for rural revitalization and biodiversity conservation efforts. This study investigates the interplay between rural residential expansion (RRE) with human- elephant conflict (HEC) in southern Yunnan Province using high-accuracy yearly land use/land cover data and Asian elephant accident data. A piecewise regression along with several metrics, including expansion intensity, rate of rural residential land, and residential density, were employed to analyze the spatial-temporal change characteristics of RRE. Then, a geographical detector and a bivariate spatial autocorrelation model were used to reveal the driving mechanisms of RRE, with particular emphasis on the spatial relations between RRE and HECs. The results indicate that HECs had a significant negative impact on RRE, exhibiting higher expansion intensity and rate of rural residential land in non-HEC areas than in HEC areas. High spatiotemporal consistency between accelerated RRE and intensified HECs occurred from 2010 onwards, which aligns with the year when the trend of settlement area expansion changed. RRE activities and ensuing land use conversions led to increased occurrences of HECs, which negatively affected the RRE. Compared to HECs, topography and locational factors exhibited a secondary effect on RRE activities. The findings underscore reciprocal feedback mechanisms between RRE and HECs and the elevated risk of adverse interactions between humans and elephants within the range of China's wild elephants, providing theoretical support for coordinating conservation initiatives for Asian elephants with rural revitalization in the border areas of Southwest China.

KW  - PERFORMANCE
AB  - Animal production aims to reconcile sustainability and efficiency. In this context, silvopastoral systems emerge as a promising and little explored alternative. This exploratory study evaluated the behaviour of Moura pigs, raised in a silvopastoral system, in the middle of the Araucaria forest and native fields. Behaviour was assessed using an ethogram, to quantify the animals' habits in the forest. This made it possible to analyze the animals' activities, providing information about their social, feeding and general behaviour. As a result, the behavioural evaluation showed that the pigs were able to consume pasture and pine nuts in open areas under the araucaria trees. Furthermore, no anomalous behaviours or stereotypies were detected in animals raised in the silvopastoral system, indicating a better quality of life and well-being of animals raised in a free-range environment. Finally, the silvopastoral system proved to be an alternative for pig farming providing a more natural environment, with greater dietary diversity, a lower rate of negative behaviours and, consequently, improved well-being for the animals.

AB  - Nitrogen is the second limited factor in arid regions. Little information is available on soil N cycling and availability under grazing in arid regions, which is required to evaluate land-use management with respect to soil N availability and dynamics. In 2011, we established a rotational grazing field experiment in arid grassland. We conducted experiments to explore the effects of herbivores grazing on soil net N mineralization and N processes via changes in soil temperature, moisture, pH, and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) in 2016 and 2017. Our results showed that grazing did not alter soil N mineralization because higher soil moisture and soil MBN under grazing had positive and negative effects on soil N mineralization, thereby balancing soil N mineralization. Plant N uptake at the grazing plots was, nevertheless, 23% higher than that at the non-grazing plots. These demonstrated that grazing potentially improved soil inorganic N availability and alleviated soil N limitation in arid regions. Soil nitrification was main pathway of N transformation in arid regions. Grazing improved soil accumulation of NO3- content, resulting in environmental problems (such as N2O emission and N leaching); however, grazing had a little effect (similar to 15% increase) on soil N leaching and (similar to 7% decrease) on N2O emission. These N processes reflect important mechanisms of resilience and ecosystem stability under grazing in an N-limited environment. Our results provide an important perspective for grassland management, aiming to maintain soil N supplying capacity in annual pasture sustainably. Overall, our study suggests that grazing is an effective management practice for the sustainable usage of local grasslands, as it improves soil physicochemical and biological properties, which, in turn, increases N supply.

AB  - In agroecosystems, arthropod communities may be influenced by bottom-up forces induced by environmental variations (e.g., fertilization) through the modification of plant traits. The way bottom-up forces affect the second trophic level is well documented, but how these effects cascade to the third trophic level is less understood. We aimed to understand: 1) how bottom-up effects vary between natural enemies with contrasted ecology, i.e., parasitoids and predators; and 2) how the diet regime of the predators affected the intensity of bottom-up effects. We set-up a lab experiment measuring the effects of reduced fertilization (from standard rates to no fertilization) on tri-trophic systems in tomato. The selected herbivores are frequent pests on tomato systems (Macrosiphum euphorbiae, Bemisia tabaci and Tuta absoluta). The respective parasitoids were Aphidius ervi and Encarsia formosa, and the respective predators Adalia bipunctata (carnivorous), Macrolophus pygmaeus (omnivorous), Dicyphus errans (omnivorous) and Chrysoperla carnea (carnivorous). We recorded plant growth and leaf carbon and nitrogen content, herbivore fecundity as well as various parasitoid/predator traits including development, longevity, reproduction and biocontrol efficacy. We found evidence of diluted bottom-up forces through trophic levels depending on the herbivore types, with variable but overall marginally positive effects of reducing fertilization from high to intermediate levels on host quality and biocontrol efficacy. Parasitoids were overall less affected than predators. This work offers perspectives in the framework of Integrated Pest Management where reduced fertilization may help better control pest populations without significant impacts on plant growth and thus yield.

AB  - Coastal hypoxia has become an increasingly acknowledged threat to coral reefs that is potentially intensifying because of increased input of anthropogenic nutrients. Almirante Bay (Caribbean Panama) is a semi-enclosed system that experiences hypoxia in deeper waters which occasionally shoals onto shallow coral reefs, suffocating most aerobic benthic life. To explore the long-term history of reefs in the bay we extracted reef matrix cores from two reefs that today experience contrasting patterns of oxygenation. We constructed a 1800-year-long record of gastropod assemblages and isotope compositions from six U-Th chronologically-constrained reef matrix cores. We extracted two cores from each reef at 3 m water depth and two additional cores from a deeper part (4.8 m) of the hypoxia-exposed reef. Results show that the deeper part of the hypoxic reef slowed in growth and stopped accreting approximately 1500 years BP while the shallow part of the reef continued to accrete to the present day, in agreement with a model of expanding hypoxia at this time. Our proxy-based approach suggests that the patterns of increasing herbivores and decreasing carbon isotope values in the deeper part of the hypoxic reef may have been driven by an increase in hypoxia via eutrophication caused by either natural changes or human impacts. Similar patterns in these paleoindicators occurred in the shallow part of the hypoxic reef during the last few decades. This suggests that the deep water hypoxia may be expanding to depths as shallow as 3 m and that shallow reefs are at greater risk due to increased human activity.

AB  - Simple Summary Whole-genome SNP data from 613 Chinese indigenous pigs were collected to comprehensively estimate the genetic diversity, genetic relationship, and population genetic structure of the indigenous pig meta-populations. These Chinese meta-populations were characterized by genetic distance, genetic difference index, and runs of homozygosity (ROH). The contribution of genetic diversity of each meta-population was scaled based on genetic and allelic diversity, which provides a basis for improving the conservation project. Further, a selective sweep analysis revealed that genes related to fat deposition and heat stress may contribute to the adaptability of the indigenous pigs to cold and heat. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the improvement of conservation strategies and insights into the environmental adaptability of Chinese indigenous pigs. The diversification of indigenous pig breeds in China has resulted from multiple climate, topographic, and human cultural influences. The numerous indigenous pig breeds can be geographically divided into six meta-populations; however, their genetic relationships, contributions to genetic diversity, and genetic signatures remain unclear. Whole-genome SNP data for 613 indigenous pigs from the six Chinese meta-populations were obtained and analyzed. Population genetic analyses confirmed significant genetic differentiation and a moderate mixture among the Chinese indigenous pig meta-populations. The North China (NC) meta-population had the largest contribution to genetic and allelic diversity. Evidence from selective sweep signatures revealed that genes related to fat deposition and heat stress response (EPAS1, NFE2L2, VPS13A, SPRY1, PLA2G4A, and UBE3D) were potentially involved in adaptations to cold and heat. These findings from population genetic analyses provide a better understanding of indigenous pig characteristics in different environments and a theoretical basis for future work on the conservation and breeding of Chinese indigenous pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary Rumen microorganisms and their hosts have co-evolved over a long period of time, adapting to their environment. This co-evolution not only impacts the host phenotype but also establishes a sophisticated regulatory network with the host to uphold organismal homeostasis. This study's findings indicated that the process of three-way hybridization had a notable impact on the taxonomic characteristics, functions, and metabolites of rumen microbes. Moreover, significant interactions were observed between rumen microbes and metabolites in sheep, with biomarkers playing a significant role in influencing the variation in rumen metabolites. Meanwhile, rumen microbial markers in Hu sheep exhibited a predominantly positive correlation with down-regulated metabolites and a negative correlation with up-regulated metabolites. In contrast, rumen microbial markers in CAH lambs showed an overall negative correlation with down-regulated metabolites and a positive correlation with up-regulated metabolites. The data obtained in this study provide a basis for understanding hybridization advantages from microbial metabolic pathways.Abstract The objective of this experiment was to explore the effects of three-way hybridization on rumen microbes and metabolites in sheep using rumen metagenomics and metabolomics. Healthy Hu and CAH (Charolais x Australian White x Hu) male lambs of similar birth weight and age were selected for short-term fattening after intensive weaning to collect rumen fluid for sequencing. Rumen metagenomics diversity showed that Hu and CAH sheep were significantly segregated at the species, KEGG-enzyme, and CAZy-family levels. Moreover, the CAH significantly increased the ACE and Chao1 indices. Further, correlation analysis of the abundance of the top 80 revealed that the microorganisms were interrelated at the species, KEGG-enzyme, and CAZy-family levels. Overall, the microbiome significantly affected metabolites of the top five pathways, with the strongest correlation found with succinic acid. Meanwhile, species-level microbial markers significantly affected rumen differential metabolites. In addition, rumen microbial markers in Hu sheep were overall positively correlated with down-regulated metabolites and negatively correlated with up-regulated metabolites. In contrast, rumen microbial markers in CAH lambs were overall negatively correlated with down-regulated metabolites and positively correlated with up-regulated metabolites. These results suggest that three-way crossbreeding significantly affects rumen microbial community and metabolite composition, and that significant interactions exist between rumen microbes and metabolites.

AB  - Despite the abundance of rock hyrax Procavia capensis within South Africa's urban areas, there is not much information available about the effect of anthropogenic activities on rock hyrax wellbeing. To determine the potential impact of anthropogenic disturbance on adrenocortical activity, we conducted an ACTH challenge to identify a suitable enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) for measuring faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations in the rock hyrax. This study identified an 11 beta-hydroxyaetiocholanolone EIA as the most suitable assay in this regard. The fGCM levels measured, indicate the physiological stress response in different rock hyrax populations, living in an area with varying degrees of anthropogenic activity (low, medium, high) within the National Botanical Garden of Pretoria, South Africa. The species' habituation to human numbers (weekly mean number of people) was examined by determining individual flight initiation distance (FID). Seasonally, there were overall higher fGCM concentrations in late spring compared to winter. The fGCM concentrations, although not significantly different but possibly biologically relevant, in the section with the lowest anthropogenic disturbance were similar to 10% higher compared to those in the section with medium disturbance, and similar to 20% higher compared to those in the section with the highest disturbance. Animal FID did not differ significantly between seasons but they did differ significantly between sections, and decreased in accordance with fGCM concentrations. The non-invasive approach established in this study provides a foundation for assessing rock hyrax wellbeing, and can help better understand how anthropogenic presence is perceived as a stressor in this species.

AB  - The scarcity of paleoclimate records in the western Tibetan Plateau (TP) hinders our understanding of how environmental evolution affects past human population, agriculture, and animal husbandry. Here, we utilized a range of materials to investigate the impact of climate change on human activities in the Xiada Co basin on the western TP during the Late-Holocene. We presented a continuous compound-specific hydrogen isotope record of sedimentary leaf waxes (delta 2Hwax) from a sediment core of Xiada Co, and compared it to XRF core-scanning elements, brGDGT-based mean annual air temperature (MAAT) record, and fecal stanol-based human population proxy record from the same sediment core, as well as archeological evidence from the TP. The delta 2Hwax exhibited a sustained increasing trend during the period from 4700 to 900 cal yr BP, followed by a generalized decrease in delta 2Hwax values during 900-0 cal yr BP. The multi-proxy analysis of Xiada Co sediments revealed that the delta 2Hwax values mainly reflect changes in the ISM precipitation, and are also influenced to some extent by glacier meltwater. Furthermore, a warm and humid climate condition was conducive to human habitation. Appropriate adaptation strategies, such as the herding of cold-tolerant and dry-tolerant sheep and the cultivation of barley in the western TP, led to a surge in population density during 3400-2900 cal yr BP, despite the slightly deteriorated climate background. This study confirmed the importance of choosing the right adaptive strategies to cope with climate change for human survival and development on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Understanding the genetic characteristics of indigenous goat breeds is vital for their conservation and breeding. Haimen goats, native to China's Yangtze River Delta, possess distinctive traits such as white hair, moderate growth rate, high-quality meat, and small body size. However, knowledge regarding the genetic structure and germplasm characteristics of Haimen goats remains limited. In this study, we performed 20x whole-genome resequencing of 90 goats (60 Haimen goats and 30 Boer goats) to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (Indels) associated with growth traits. Here, we analyzed population genetic structure and genome-wide selection signatures between the Haimen and Boer goats based on whole-genome resequencing data. The principal component analysis (PCA) and neighbor-joining (N-J) tree results demonstrated significant genetic differentiation between the Haimen and Boer goats. The nucleotide diversity (Pi) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay results indicated higher genomic diversity in the Haimen goat population. Furthermore, selective sweep analysis identified candidate genes associated with growth traits. These genes exhibited strong selection signatures and were related to body size (DONSON, BMPR1B, and EPHA5), muscle development (GART, VGLL3, MYH15), and fat metabolism (ADAMTS5, LRP6, XDH, CPT1A, and GPD1). We also identified growth-related candidate genes (NCOR1, DPP6, NOTCH2, and FGGY) specific to Haimen goats. Among these genes, pancreatic lipase-related protein 1 (PNLIPRP1) emerged as the primary candidate gene influencing growth phenotypes. Further analysis revealed that a 26 bp Indel in PNLIPRP1 increased its gene expression, suggesting that this Indel could serve as a molecular marker for early marker-assisted selection, potentially enhancing early growth in goats. These findings provide valuable molecular markers and candidate genes for improving growth traits in Haimen goat breeding.

AB  - The current biogeographic knowledge of Streblidae remains poor. We report a species inventory, host association, ranges, and probable relevance as vectors of pathogens in bats from a botanical garden in a region of northeastern Puebla, Mexico. Additionally, we report new streblids for Puebla including: Aspidoptera phyllostomatis, Aspidoptera delatorrei, Metelasmus pseudopterus, Megistopoda proxima, Paratrichobius longicrus, Speiseria ambigua, Strebla curvata, Strebla guajiro, Trichobius dugesii, and Trichobius joblingi. Highly diverse urban botanical gardens such as this help to maintain biodiversity where natural vegetation and domestic plants are mixed with different animal communities. Mixed vegetation provides a refuge and food for a wide range of wildlife, including bats.

AB  - Food supply stands out as one of the most critical drivers of population demographics by limiting reproductive rates. In this study, we assessed fluctuations in diet composition and monitored various reproductive parameters over a nine-year period in a Golden Eagle population in an Eastern European peatland. The identification of 2439 prey specimens from 84 species revealed that the studied eagles primarily preyed upon birds (constituting 78.3% of prey numbers and 67.2% of prey biomass) and less on mammals (21.6% and 32.8%, respectively). Grouse emerged as the most important prey group (31% and 27%), followed by waterfowl (17%) and hares (8% and 14%). The most significant prey species, both in terms of numbers and weight, were the Black Grouse, Mountain Hare, Common Crane, and Capercaillie. The share of the Black Grouse decreased, while those of the White-fronted Goose, Roe Deer, and hares increased. The food niche, as measured by the Levins' index, was broad (6.6), and it expanded during the study. On average, 58.3% of Golden Eagle pairs initiated breeding annually, with 69.1% successfully completing it, and 0.41 young per occupied territory were produced annually; there was pronounced interannual variation in reproductive performance. These fluctuations were associated with the shares of White-fronted Goose, Capercaillie, Mountain Hare and Roe Deer in the diet, suggesting that these species may be gaining increasing importance for the Golden Eagle, particularly following the decline of the Black Grouse.

AB  - Context. Use of camera trap data in wildlife research is reliant on accurate classification of animals at the species, sex-age category or individual level. One such example is white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) camera surveys, which are often conducted to produce demographic estimates used by managers to establish harvest goals for a population. Previous research suggests that misclassification of deer by sex-age category (e.g. adult male, adult female, fawn) is common in these surveys, and represents a source of bias that could misinform important management decisions. Aim. To examine whether training material has an effect on classification accuracy of white-tailed deer and explore other observer-based, experiential factors as they relate to classification accuracy. Methods. We developed and tested the efficacy of species-specific training material designed to reduce sex-age misclassifications associated with white-tailed deer images. Key results. Exposure to training material resulted in the greatest improvement in classification accuracy of deer images compared with any other respondent-based factors we investigated. Other factors, such as professional experience as a wildlife biologist, field experience viewing white-tailed deer and experience viewing deer images from camera traps, were positively associated with classification accuracy of deer images. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that training material has the ability to reduce misclassifications, leading to more accurate demographic estimates for white-tailed deer populations. We also found that prior experience using camera traps and familiarity with target species was positively related to classification accuracy. Implications. Species-specific training material would provide a valuable resource to wildlife managers tasked with classifying animals at the species, sex-age category or individual level.

AB  - This study was conducted to assess microplastic (MP) pollution in some aquatic animals inhabiting planted and natural mangrove swamps in the northern Gulf of Oman. The KOH-NaI solution was used to retrieve MPs from the gastrointestinal tracts of animals. The highest MP prevalence was recorded in crabs (41.65 %) followed by fish (33.89 %) and oysters (20.8 %). The abundance of MPs in examined animals varied from zero in Sphyraena putnamae to 11 particles in a Rhinoptera javanica specimen. When polluted-only animals were considered, the mean abundance of MPs significantly varied among species and between locations. The mean density of ingested MPs was higher in the planted mangrove animals (1.79 +/- 2.89 vs. 1.21 +/- 2.25 n/individual; mean +/- SD). Among the examined fish species, R. javanica ingested the highest number of MPs (3.83 +/- 3.93 n/individual; mean +/- SD). The polyethylene/ polypropylene fragments or fibers of average 1900 mu m size were recorded as predominant (>50 % occurrence) MP particles.

AB  - Marine organisms are currently, and will continue to be, exposed to the simultaneous effects of multiple environmental changes. Plankton organisms form the base of pelagic marine food webs and are particularly sensitive to ecosystem changes. Thus, warming, acidification, and changes in dissolved nutrient concentrations have the potential to alter these assemblages, with consequences for the entire ecosystem. Despite the growing number of studies addressing the potential influence of multiple drivers on plankton, global change may also cause less obvious alterations to the networks of interactions among species. Using inverse analyses applied to data collected during a mesocosm experiment, we aimed to compare the ecological functioning of coastal plankton assemblages and the interactions within their food web under different global change scenarios. The experimental treatments were based on the RCP 6.0 and 8.5 scenarios developed by the IPCC, which were extended (ERCP) to integrate the future predicted changes in coastal water nutrient concentrations. Overall, we identified that the functioning of the plankton food web was rather similar in the Ambient and ERCP 6.0 scenarios, but substantially altered in the ERCP 8.5 scenario. Using food web modelling and ecological network analysis, we identified that global change strengthens the microbial loop, with a decrease of energy transfer efficiency to higher trophic levels. Microzooplankton responded as well by an increased degree of herbivory in their diet and represented, compared to mesozooplankton, by far the main top-down pressure on primary producers. We also observed that the organisation of the food web and its capacity to recycle carbon was higher under the ERCP 8.5 scenario, but flow diversity and carbon path length were significantly reduced, illustrating an increased food web stability at the expense of diversity. Here, we provide evidence that if global change goes beyond the ERCP 6.0 scenario, coastal ecosystem functioning will be subjected to dramatic changes.

AB  - Scavenging fauna plays an integral role in ecosystem functioning, nutrient cycling and circulating organic matter. Thus, baseline data of scavenger assemblages on the NW coast of the Iberian Peninsula that provides information on the abundance of species in different habitats is crucial to understanding the distribution of this understudied group. Two different types of baited traps, to capture scavenging megafaunal and scavenging benthopelagic macrofaunal assemblages, were deployed to compare them among rocky, pebbled and sandy bottoms at shallow subtidal on the northern coast of Portugal. Results showed significant differences in the structure of scavenger assemblages. Scavenging megafaunal assemblages differed between sandy and the other two studied habitats, whereas benthopelagic macrofaunal assemblages differed between pebbles and rocky habitats. This suggests that different drivers seem to shape the structure of benthopelagic macrofauna and megafauna. Regarding megafauna, the dominance of Tritia gastropods in sand habitats in comparison with its absence in rock and its very low abundance in pebbles was mainly responsible for the differences. However, in benthopelagic macrofauna, differences in assemblages between pebbles and rock were more related to changes in the relative abundance of crustacean species (Cirolana cranchii and Socarnes erythrophthalmus) that were less abundant in pebbles.

AB  - We tested for dietary choices of foods varying in nutrient composition by cottontail rabbits on two college campuses in midwestern USA. We quantified choices among pellets of varying nutritional quality at artificial food patches. Dietary choices differed between seasons and locations. Spring giving-up densities (GUDs: food left behind) did not show differences in food choices and were lower than summer GUDs. In Appleton, the cottontails favoured both high protein and fibre pellets, whereas the medium protein and fibre pellets were favoured in Chicago. The cottontails maintained their choice of high protein, high fibre pellets at three spatial scales. The cottontails varied food intake to balance their protein, salt and fibre needs at different times and locations. Studying dietary choices and the effect of resource quality on foraging responses by urban wildlife provides a useful tool to study ecological interactions and can help minimize damage in urban environments such as parks.

AB  - North American bison (Bovidae: Bison bison) ) incur blunt impacts to the interparietal and frontal bones when they engage in head-to-head fights. To investigate the impact mitigation of these bones, a finite element analysis (FEA) of the skull under loading conditions was performed. Based on anatomical and histological studies, the interparietal and frontal bones are both comprised of a combination of haversian and plexiform bone and are both underlain by bony septa. Additionally, the interparietal bone is thicker than the frontal bone. Data regarding the mechanical properties of bison bone are scarce, but the results of a phylogenetic analysis infer that the material properties of the closely related domestic cow bone are a suitable proxy for use in the FEA. Results of the FEA suggest that the thickness of the interparietal bone in conjunction with the bony septa may prevent fracture stresses by helping to absorb and disperse the blunt impact energy throughout the skull. Monotonic stress levels of 294 MPa, which are below the compressive strength of bone were exhibited in the simulated bison head impacts indicating no fracture of the bones.

AB  - Carnivores tend to exhibit a lack of (or less pronounced) genetic structure at continental scales in both a geographic and temporal sense and this can confound the identification of post-glacial colonization patterns in this group. In this study we used genome-wide data (using genotyping by sequencing [GBS]) to reconstruct the phylogeographic history of a widespread carnivore, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), by investigating broad-scale patterns of genomic variation, differentiation and admixture amongst contemporary populations in Europe. Using 15,003 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 524 individuals allowed us to identify the importance of refugial regions for the red fox in terms of endemism (e.g., Iberia). In addition, we tested multiple post-glacial recolonization scenarios of previously glaciated regions during the Last Glacial Maximum using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach that were unresolved from previous studies. This allowed us to identify the role of admixture from multiple source population post-Younger Dryas in the case of Scandinavia and ancient land-bridges in the colonization of the British Isles. A natural colonization of Ireland was deemed more likely than an ancient human-mediated introduction as has previously been proposed and potentially points to a larger mammalian community on the island in the early post-glacial period. Using genome-wide data has allowed us to tease apart broad-scale patterns of structure and diversity in a widespread carnivore in Europe that was not evident from using more limited marker sets and provides a foundation for next-generation phylogeographic studies in other non-model species.

AB  - Milk and dairy products are an important part of the human diet for numerous reasons. Goat milk is higher in the content of elements such as K and Ca. Nowadays, consumption of goat milk and goat dairy products increases because of better digestion and therapeutic value. However, goat milk can contain heavy metals and trace elements as well which can harm human health. The content of 22 elements in sixty-nine samples of goat milk, whey, three types of cheese, and yogurt from the ecological farm in region Orava and conventional farm in region Stredne Pova2ie in Slovakia was measured in this study. The highest concentration of four elements Ca, K, Mg, and Na in samples of goat products was found. In our study, significant statistical differences (P < 0.05) were found only in levels of K, Ca, Li and Na when comparing milk samples from organic and conventional farm. Concentrations of K (1260.50 mg/kg), Li (0.02 mg/kg) and Na (293.46 mg/kg) were higher in samples from ecological farm, while concentration of Ca (1344.65 mg/kg) was higher in samples from conventional farm. Toxic elements were present in trace amounts or under the limit of detection. The consumption of goat milk and goat dairy products from monitored farms can be considered as safe and beneficial for human health regardless of the way of farming. According to the highest level of strontium in hard ripening cheese, frequent regular consumption should be considered for children as a preventive measure for development of bone health.

AB  - Highland animals have unique hair growth mechanisms to allow them to adapt to harsh living environments. Compared with other species, their hair cycle growth is affected by more environmental factors. Yaks, as highland animals, have obvious periodic hair growth characteristics in a year; this biological process is regulated by numerous proteins, but the specific molecular regulatory mechanism is still unclear. Here we analyzed the histological characteristics of yak hair follicles (HFs) at each stage and conducted TMT proteomics research. The protein expression network of yak hair at each stage and the mechanism of the yak HF growth cycle were systematically explored, and the candidate proteins Sfrp1 and Ppard were verified. A total of 3176 proteins were quantifiable and 1142 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were obtained at five stages of the yak hair cycle. DEPs enriched in complement activation change, tissue development, lipid metabolism, WNT pathway, VEGF pathway, JAK-STAT pathway, and PPAR pathway may promote the growth of yak hair follicles, such as Serpinf1, Ppard, and Stat3. DEPs enriched in complement system, coagulation, cell adhesion, lipid metabolic process, proliferation of epidermal cells, and estrogen pathway may promote the degeneration of yak hair, such as Sfrp1, Eppk1, and Egfr. Using Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis, we found that core nodes of DEP networks in yak skin are significantly different at three critical time points in hair follicle development, and lipid metabolism proteins are common core DEP nodes during yak HF growth and degeneration. The expression of Sfrp1 and Ppard in yak hair follicles at different periods showed they are related to yak hair cycle control. This study showed that the protein regulatory network of the yak HF growth cycle is complex and dynamically changing and revealed key candidate proteins that may affect yak hair follicle development. These findings provided detailed data for further understanding of the plateau adaptation mechanism of the yak, which is of great significance to make better use of the yak livestock resources and enhance their economic value.

AB  - Animal carcasses in natural environments are a food source for various organisms, such as fungi, bacteria, and insects. Insects also utilize this ephemeral resource for oviposition and development of their offspring, with the immatures being responsible for the greatest consumption of the resource. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the fauna of necrophagous insects associated with a cow carcass Bos taurus Linnaeus found in the municipality of S & atilde;o Raimundo das Mangabeiras, Maranh & atilde;o, Brazil. Insects were sampled using forceps and entomological nets for eight days, with the immatures being taken to the Laboratory of Entomology and Vectors (LEV) and subsequently reared at room temperature. A total of 1,149 specimens were sampled, comprising 141 adults and 1,017 immatures. Among the adults, the species Chrysomya albiceps (Widemann), Necrobia rufipes (Fabricius), and Dermestes maculatus (De Geer) were prominent. Regarding immatures, all insects that emerged were of the species C. albiceps. Additionally, we report the first record of Chrysomya putoria (Widemann), Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel), and Hemertia illucens (Linnaeus) visiting bovine carcasses in the Neotropical region. The results reveal a late colonization of C. albiceps in advanced stages, confirming the importance of research with carcasses in the context of forensic entomology.

AB  - In the early autumn of 2018, a virus as contagious as it is deadly, carried by wild boars (Sus scrofa Linnaeus, 1758) with the probable involvement of humans, crossed the Belgian border. African swine fever, which only affects suidae, is rapidly spreading in the forests of Gauma. The boar, whose status has gradually shifted from a regional emblem to a symbol of hunting abuses, finds itself abruptly transformed into a sanitary threat needing to be eliminated. The wild swine can contaminate its domestic cousin, the farmed pig (Sus domesticus Erxleben, 1777). Therefore, the spread of the virus would jeopardise the fragile Belgian pig farming sector concentrated in the north of the country. This is the start of a crisis that will last for more than 24 months; the infected forest is zoned and then isolated for the purpose of sanitisation, while "biosecurity" and "white zone" become the only watchwords. Mass destruction measures for wild boars are imposed by the administration and its experts through new so-called "sanitary rituals". To achieve a rapid "return to normal", hunters - mostly local ones - are enlisted in the name of their hunting skills, which, although they are usually contested by a part of Belgian society and media, are considered essential in this case. This event brings us to an exploration of the practices actors are attached to and forced to renounce to in the name of good crisis management. On-the-ground realities as related by field men bear witness to the unease felt in the face of the "dirty work" asked of them, while the upheaval of coexistence reveals ethical, tradition-and identity-related questions already existing before the crisis.

AB  - National parks (NP) are the last refugia of forests dominated by the Nothofagus species in Chile. However, frequent, careless human-caused fires are destroying these forests even within the national parks. After large-scale fires, N pumilio stands are unable to recover naturally neither in generative nor in vegetative ways and artificial regeneration must be resorted to in order to maintain their extent. However, even artificial regeneration is not successful without protection against browsing. Therefore, the aim of this study was to experimentally test a range of repellents and other methods of mechanical protection of seedlings against browsing. Five replicates of plots were placed in Torres del Paine NP, in different habitat conditions and with different methods of protection against browsing (11 repellents, wire mesh, plastic tube and control). In each plot, 12 seedlings were treated with each type of protection. In our experiment, only 8% of the seedlings were damaged by browsing, while the mortality rate was 38%. The results indicate a more significant effect of abiotic factors (mainly frost, drought or wind) on seedling mortality than browsing. In parallel, however, it is clear that, compared with the control, six of the eleven repellents used in the experiment showed a significantly positive effect. We suggest the use of plastic tubes as the best option to protect seedlings, which, in addition to providing 100% protection against browsing, are likely to provide more favourable microclimatic conditions for seedlings, similar to leaving the burned snags.

AB  - The gut microbial communities of mammals provide numerous benefits to their hosts. However, given the recent development of the microbiome field, we still lack a thorough understanding of the variety of ecological and evolutionary factors that structure these communities across species. Metabarcoding is a powerful technique that allows for multiple microbial ecology questions to be investigated simultaneously. Here, we employed DNA metabarcoding techniques, predictive metagenomics, and culture-dependent techniques to inventory the gut microbial communities of several species of rodent collected from the same environment that employ different natural feeding strategies [granivorous pocket mice (Chaetodipus penicillatus); granivorous kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami); herbivorous woodrats (Neotoma albigula); omnivorous cactus mice (Peromyscus eremicus); and insectivorous grasshopper mice (Onychomys torridus)]. Of particular interest were shifts in gut microbial communities in rodent species with herbivorous and insectivorous diets, given the high amounts of indigestible fibers and chitinous exoskeleton in these diets, respectively. We found that herbivorous woodrats harbored the greatest microbial diversity. Granivorous pocket mice and kangaroo rats had the highest abundances of the genus Ruminococcus and highest predicted abundances of genes related to the digestion of fiber, representing potential adaptations in these species to the fiber content of seeds and the limitations to digestion given their small body size. Insectivorous grasshopper mice exhibited the greatest inter-individual variation in the membership of their microbiomes, and also exhibited the highest predicted abundances of chitin-degrading genes. Culture-based approaches identified 178 microbial isolates (primarily Bacillus and Enterococcus), with some capable of degrading cellulose and chitin. We observed several instances of strain-level diversity in these metabolic capabilities across isolates, somewhat highlighting the limitations and hidden diversity underlying DNA metabarcoding techniques. However, these methods offer power in allowing the investigation of several questions concurrently, thus enhancing our understanding of gut microbial ecology.

AB  - Assessing the potential ecological risks of chemical pollutants like heavy metals is a key tool of a sustainable environment. With this goal, ecotoxicological significant metal (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) levels of the water (n = 32) and sediment (n = 32) samples of streams [rural (8 points) and urban (8 points) sides] on Amanos Mountains were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and ecotoxicological risk assessment was performed through the potential ecological risk index (RI). The study region with intense urban activities has also ecological importance with regards to wildlife. It is located on the migration route of birds, hosts loggerhead and green sea turtles, Mediterranean seals, and some terrestrial species like mountain gazelle and striped hyena. All calculated RI values were below the potential risk limits and the ecotoxicological risk was observed to be very low. Metal levels should be monitored periodically, and necessary measures should be taken before the reflection of the increase to be determined by the risk assessment on the ecosystem.

AB  - The processes driving defense trait correlations may vary within and between species based on ecological or environmental contexts. However, most studies of plant defense theory fail to address this potential for shifts in trait correlations across scales. In this work, we tested for correlations between multiple defensive traits (secondary chemistry, carbon to nitrogen ratio, domatia, leaf toughness, trichomes, and pearl bodies) across a common garden of 21 Vitis species and eighteen genotypes of the species Vitis riparia to identify when and where patterns of defense trait evolution persist or break down across biological scales. Additionally, we asked whether Vitis defense trait investment correlates with environmental variables as predicted by plant defense theory, using environmental metrics for each Vitis species and V. riparia genotype from the GBIF and WorldClim databases. We tested for correlations between defense trait investment, herbivore palatability, and environmental variables using phylogenetically informed models. Beyond a few likely physiological exceptions, we observed a lack of significant correlations between defense traits at both intra- and interspecific scales, indicating that these traits evolve independently of each other in Vitis rather than forming predictable defense syndromes. We did find that investment in carbon:nitrogen (at both scales) and pearl bodies increases with proximity to the equator, demonstrating support for plant defense theory's prediction of higher investment in defenses at more equatorial environments for some, but not all, defense traits. Overall, our results challenge commonly held hypotheses about plant defense evolution, namely the concept of syndromes, by demonstrating that strong correlations between defense traits are not the prevailing pattern both across and within Vitis species. Our work also provides the first comprehensive evaluation of the evolutionary divergence in approaches that Vitis, a genus with significant agricultural value, have evolved to defend themselves against herbivores.

AB  - Animal movements are realizations of complex spatiotemporal processes. Central to these processes are the varied environmental contexts in which animals move, which fundamentally impact the movement trajectories of individuals at fine spatial and temporal scales. An emerging perspective in time geography is the direct examination of the influence that varying contexts may have on observed movements. An approach that considers environmental context can yield actionable information for wildlife management, planning, and conservation; for instance, identifying areas of probable occupancy by an animal may improve the efficiency of fieldwork. This research develops the first known practical application of a new cost-distance-based, probabilistic voxel space-time prism (CDBPSTP) in efforts to more realistically characterize the unobserved habitat occupancies of animals occurring between known positions provided by location-aware technologies. The CDBPSTP method is applied to trajectory data collected for a group of red deer (Cervus elaphus) tracked near Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. As a demonstration of the added value from examining how context influences movement, CDBPSTP habitat occupancy results are compared to the earlier PSTP method in context with empirical and theoretical understandings of red deer habitat preference and space-use behaviors. This comparison reveals that with CDBPSTP, variation present in the mover's environment is explicitly considered as an influence on the mover's probable path and occupancies between observations of its location. With the increasing availability of high-resolution geolocational and associated environmental data, this study highlights the potential for CDBPSTP to be leveraged as a broadly applicable tool in animal movement analysis.

AB  - Adequate methods to evaluate the extension of global and local damage on coral reefs, and to minimize it, are urgent. The Tropical Southwestern Atlantic reefs are partially protected by Marine Protected Areas (MPA) that apply spatial zoning as a management strategy. A resilience-based management approach was used to evaluate the effectiveness of no-take areas in improving reef resilience, inside the largest coastal MPA of Brazil. Ecological indicators were used to calculate resilience scores, to test the hypothesis that no-take reefs present higher resilience than tourism reefs. Score values indicated medium-high resilience for both. Despite the similar values, the contribution of the indicators to the score varied between reefs. Herbivorous fish biomass was the main indicator influencing higher scores. Management through spatial zoning and the compliance of this regulation raised the resilience of coral reefs. The main management actions recommended are the creation of no-take areas in coastal habitats such as mangroves and seagrass beds.

AB  - Simple Summary To improve the treatment of patients with kidney disease, new therapies are being developed. Before being used on humans, such therapies need to be tested on animals with kidney disease because reduced kidney function may influence the safety and efficacy of the treatment. Using large animals for this purpose is important because they tolerate frequent blood sampling, which allows for repeated monitoring. Goats seem particularly suitable for the evaluation of novel hemodialysis therapies since they are docile, have easily accessible neck veins to obtain blood access and body weights comparable with humans. Currently, no simple method is available to measure kidney function in goats (with or without impaired kidney function). Therefore, we developed a simple method to measure the kidney function in goats and pigs, which is based on a single injection of iohexol and requires three blood samples. Subsequently, kidney function can be calculated using a formula derived from pharmacokinetic modelling. The measurement of kidney function using our simplified method is relatively easy to perform, reduces total blood sampling and eliminates the need for an indwelling bladder catheter as compared to existing methods that require continuous infusion of a substance and timed urine collection. The preclinical evaluation of novel therapies for chronic kidney disease requires a simple method for the assessment of kidney function in a uremic large animal model. An intravenous bolus of iohexol was administered to goats (13 measurements in n = 3 goats) and pigs (23 measurements in n = 5 pigs) before and after induction of kidney failure, followed by frequent blood sampling up to 1440 min. Plasma clearance (CL) was estimated by a nonlinear mixed-effects model (CLNLME) and by a one-compartmental pharmacokinetic disposition model using iohexol plasma concentrations during the terminal elimination phase (CL1CMT). A simple method (CLSM) for the calculation of plasma clearance was developed based on the most appropriate relationship between CLNLME and CL1CMT. CLSM and CLNLME showed good agreement (CLNLME/CLSM ratio: 1.00 +/- 0.07; bias: 0.03 +/- 1.64 mL/min; precision CLSM and CLNLME: 80.9% and 80.7%, respectively; the percentage of CLSM estimates falling within +/- 30% (P30) or +/- 10% (P10) of CLNLME: 53% and 12%, respectively). For mGFR(NLME) vs. mGFR(SM), bias was -0.25 +/- 2.24 and precision was 49.2% and 53.6%, respectively, P30 and P10 for mGFR based on CLSM were 71% and 24%, respectively. A simple method for measurement of GFR in healthy and uremic goats and pigs was successfully developed, which eliminates the need for continuous infusion of an exogenous marker, urine collection and frequent blood sampling.

AB  - Human-elephant conflicts (HECs) threaten both elephants and humans globally. Many modern techniques have been adopted to mitigate HECs, including remote sensing with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Based on the UAV monitoring data of wild Asian elephants in China, we mapped the potential HEC hotspots and identified the possible related environmental factors. Our results indicated that there were six clusters of UAV-monitored elephant positions, and these corresponded to the previously known elephant subpopulations. According to the local Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, the potential HEC hotspots were mainly distributed around Mangao subreserve, Jingne Town, Mengman Town and near Mengwang Town. Physical barriers, including large rivers and highways, separated elephant position clusters and potential HEC hotspot areas. Generally, the potential HECs were near human settlements when the loss of human and elephant lives were emphasized more than the loss of economic plants. In addition, the potential HEC hotspots were distributed in regions with both lower slopes and lower river cover but higher food-rich covers. There have been few reports on HEC mapping based on UAV monitoring data, and our study may help widen and deepen the application of UAVs in mitigating HECs in China and elsewhere in the future.

AB  - In this study, we investigate the immediate and short-term consequences of defoliation by the spongy moth Lymantria dispar on secondary growth of oaks (Quercus robur L. and Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.), including the interplay between defoliation and water availability during the defoliation period within a large-scale field experiment in south-eastern Germany. Furthermore, the impact of defoliation on oak secondary growth is explored retrospectively based on tree core measurements.Within the large-scale filed experiment, secondary growth of 880 oaks in 44 oak-dominated stands was monitored using permanent girth tapes over a three-year period following a spongy moth outbreak. Insecticide treatments were applied to half of the plots to obtain trees without defoliation, and canopy cover dynamics were subsequently monitored ground based and from satellites in all plots.We found that moth defoliation significantly reduced oak secondary growth by 10-60% during the outbreak year, with the impact on secondary growth being directly proportional to defoliation intensity. The negative impact of defoliation on secondary growth was aggravated by increased water availability during the outbreak year. In the post-outbreak year, secondary growth of oaks that had endured mild defoliation was no longer different from that of non-defoliated oaks. In contrast, oaks that had experienced substantial defoliation still exhibited a significant 10-30% reduction in secondary growth. Regardless of defoliation intensity, no further reduction in secondary growth was detected two years after the event compared to control trees. Our complementary retrospective analysis, utilizing core samples from oaks previously subjected to a defoliation event under distinct weather conditions, disclosed a strikingly analogous recovery of secondary growth from defoliation instigated by the spongy moth. Thus, validating that our experimental findings possess broad temporal transferability.

AB  - During the Cretaceous, large herbivorous dinosaurs (megaherbivores) acted as keystone species-just as large mammals do today (e.g., elephants)-yet despite their significance in Cretaceous ecosystems, what plant taxa these dinosaurs ate is unclear. The Albian armoured dinosaur Borealopelta markmitchelli (Ornithischia; Nodo-sauridae) was discovered in northern Alberta, Canada and has well-preserved stomach contents dominated by fern leaf tissues, with low amounts of gymnosperm material, implying selective feeding. The lower Albian Gates Formation (Grande Cache Member) macroflora of central Alberta is contemporaneous and spatially proximal with B. markmitchelli and therefore provides information on local vegetation available to this nodosaurid and other megaherbivores in this area. In this study we provide census-sampled abundance data for the Gates For-mation macroflora. These data also provide the means to further investigate the feeding ecology of Borealopelta by summarizing the vegetation and local food options available. Census collections at five sites within the Grande Cache Member exposed in the Grande Cache Coal Mine reveal that the local vegetation there was dominated by conifers (44-70%) across all sites. Athrotaxites, Elatides, and Pityocladus were the most common conifers. Other gymnosperms present were ginkgophytes (e.g., Ginkgoites; 11%) and Taeniopteris (9%). Caytoniales (Sagenopteris) were found at one study site but uncommon (2%). Ferns (e.g., Cladophlebis, Coniopteris, Gleichenites) accounted for 14% of the total site counts while cycadophytes (Bennettitales; 4%) and Equisetites (1%) were less common. When comparing the Gates Formation macroflora to the stomach contents of Borealopelta, these data suggest that B. markmitchelli was selectively feeding on ferns, or in a recently disturbed fern-dense area within the local landscape.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is becoming increasingly prevalent as human activity expands, and monitoring the impact of habitat quality on wildlife mortality related to HWC is critical for the well-being of wildlife and people. Using ten years of necropsies from free-ranging Asian elephants in the Northwestern Wildlife Region (NWR) of Sri Lanka, we quantified the effect of habitat quality on human-elephant conflict (HEC) (i.e., human-caused elephant mortality), hypothesizing that both artificial (e.g., forest cover loss) and natural (e.g., water availability, temperature) changes would be associated with elephant mortality. We collated necropsies from 348 elephants that died due to human activity from 2009 to 2018, comparing the results with data on forest cover loss, perennial water, rainfall, temperature, and human population sizes. Over the study period, we found that forest cover loss was significantly correlated with human-caused mortality in a district-specific manner. Similarly, access to perennial water and precipitation levels appeared to influence mortality, but not temperature, human population density, or percent land cover used for agriculture. We conducted emerging hot spot analyses to identify areas within the NWR that should be prioritized for protection, which included landscapes that are not currently protected (approximately 43% of the hot spots we identified). Similarly, areas that we identified as cold spots included many areas with minimal forest cover loss. Together, our results emphasize the impact that human activity can have on the measurable outcomes of HEC. We suggest that adaptive HWC management strategies that use retrospective analyses should inform any potential changes to the protection of vital wildlife habitats, such as the north central dry zone of Sri Lanka.

AB  - Diseases spread and persist according to complex interactions among hosts, pathogens, and their shared environments. In actively managed wildlife diseases, unanticipated disease spread and persistence can challenge mitigation efforts, necessitating modeling approaches that elucidate and integrate multiple mechanisms. Dynamic occupancy models (DOMs) can predict and forecast species occurrence patterns; however, they have not been extended to explain the complex spread and persistence patterns of chronic wasting disease (CWD). We used a DOM to predict and forecast the persistence, and localized and long-distance spread of CWD in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) according to distinct ecological relationships that we hypothesized were important. We estimated large differences between the probabilities of disease persistence and localized and long-distance CWD spread in Wisconsin, USA. Chronic wasting disease was more likely to persist in areas with low clay content in soils, to spread locally as the amount of localized disease increased, and to occur in areas far removed from prior positives in places with a higher proportion of agriculture. Across all landscape compositions, the probability of occurrence decayed by distance from prior positives in a manner consistent with transient movement distances of white-tailed deer. Finally, a multi-mechanism DOM was able to produce spatially accurate predictions and forecasts of disease occurrence using only data collected during the first 2 days of the firearm harvest season. Thus, our multi-mechanism DOM offers advantages over simple linear models that can improve our understanding of the complex ecology driving CWD dynamics and lead to better surveillance and management strategies moving forward.

AB  - Plant-plant signalling via volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has been widely documented, but its contingency on herbivory amount and its within-plant distribution variability (i.e., how dispersed vs. aggregated it is throughout the canopy) remains poorly understood. Here we tease apart these factors by investigating whether signalling between wild cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) plants in response to herbivory by the specialist caterpillar Alabama argillacea was affected by different levels of herbivore density (proxy for herbivory intensity or amount) and patterns of within-plant herbivore distribution (proxy of within-plant damage variability). We conducted a greenhouse experiment for which we placed plant triplets in mesh cages, where in each case one plant acted as a VOC emitter and the other two as receivers. We subjected emitters to one of the following treatments: control (no larvae), low density (one larva on one leaf), high concentrated density (four larvae, two on each of two leaves) and high dispersed density (four larvae, one on each of four leaves). After 2 days of herbivory, we collected emitter VOCs to test for treatment effects on volatile emissions and placed A. argillacea larvae on receivers and measured the amount of damage to test for signalling effects on leaf resistance. Both high caterpillar density treatments similarly increased total VOC emissions, although the difference relative to controls was only significant under high concentrated density. Low density had virtually the same amount of emissions as controls. In addition, high dispersed density was the only treatment that caused a significant change in VOC composition relative to controls. In turn, our test of signalling effects indicated that only receivers exposed to highly dispersed density emitters showed a significantly lower amount of herbivory (i.e., greater resistance) than controls. These results suggest that the amount of herbivory primarily drives quantitative changes in VOC emissions, whereas within-plant variability mainly causes qualitative changes. Further, the impact of these VOC induction patterns on inter-plant signalling appears to be most pronounced when within-plant herbivory variability is high.

AB  - The livestock industry has a harmful effect on the environment and contributes to climate change by producing significant amounts of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and ammonia (NH3). In line with this, the production and composting of manure is an important issue in livestock farming. During composting, the manure undergoes physical and nutritional profile changes, which can affect the environment. In this context, in the present study, we have investigated the dynamics of the chemical parameters such as pH, humidity (U%), organic matter (MO%), ammonium nitrogen N-NH4+(g/kg), nitrogen in the form of nitrite N-NO2-(g/kg), nitrate nitrogen N-NO3- (g/kg) and phosphorus phosphate P-PO4 3- (g/kg) of organic manure from cattle and swine farms during composting. The results revealed a pH variation between 6.9 and 8.23 during composting, which is normal for compost, as mentioned in the literature. A high water content of over 90% was preserved in organic manure and compost because the samples were very liquid. Nutrient values showed increased ammonium and total inorganic nitrogen in cattle farms and one pig farm during composting. This study highlights a rise in nutrient values, especially of ammonium and total inorganic nitrogen in both cattle and pig farms, an aspect that reinforces the need to evaluate intervention strategies and develop a set of recommendations leading to the reduction of exposure risks and a subsequent reduction in human health impacts.

AB  - Terpenes are a major class of secondary metabolites present in all plants, and long hypothesized to have diversified in response to specific plant-herbivore interactions. Herbivory is a major biotic interaction that plays out across broad temporal and spatial scales that vary dramatically in temperature regimes, both due to climatic variation across geographic locations as well as the effect of seasonality. In addition, there is an emerging understanding that global climate change will continue to alter the temperature regimes of nearly every habitat on Earth over the coming centuries. Regardless of source, variation in temperature may influence herbivory, in particular via changes in the efficacy and impacts of plant defensive chemistry. This study aims to characterize temperature-driven variation in toxicological effects across several structural classes of terpenes in the model herbivore Vanessa cardui, the painted lady butterfly. We observed a general increase in monoterpene toxicity to larvae, pupa, and adults at higher temperatures, as well as an increase in development time as terpene concentration increased. Results obtained from this study yield insights into possible drivers of seasonal variation in plant terpene production as well as inform effects of rising global temperatures on plant-insect interactions. In the context of other known effects of climate change on plant-herbivore interactions like carbon fertilization and compensatory feeding, temperature-driven changes in plant chemical defense efficacy may further complicate the prediction of climate change impacts on the fundamental ecological process of herbivory.

AB  - Simple Summary Biting midges are small blood-sucking insects that are pests and vectors of several pathogens transmitted to humans and other animals. Understanding the factors that are associated with species diversity, distribution, and abundance, as well as host preference, is crucial for the control and management of these insects. In this study, we examined species diversity, abundance, and identification of the host blood source of the biting midge genus Culicoides Latreille collected from cattle pens located in three different land use areas. We found that cattle pens located in villages and agricultural lands had greater abundance but were less diverse than those located close to the forest. The identification of the host blood source revealed that biting midge species in the cattle pens preferred buffalos rather than cows or chickens, although the latter two were much more abundant. Information gathered from this study will be useful for monitoring and understanding vectorial capacity as well as disease epidemiology involving the biting midge species found in cattle pens. Biting midges of the genus Culicoides Latreille are significant pests and vectors that transmit pathogens to humans and other animals. Cattle are among the important livestock that can potentially be severely affected by Culicoides. In this study, we examined the species diversity, abundance, and host blood meal identification of biting midges in cattle pens located in three different land use types: villages, agricultural areas, and the forest edge. A total of 12,916 biting midges were collected, and most of these were from cattle pens located in villages (34%) and agricultural land (52%). Morphological identification revealed 29 Culicoides species. The most common species were C. oxystoma, C. mahasarakhamense, C. peregrinus, and C. shortti; taken together, these species represented >80% of all specimens collected. Despite midges being less numerous (14% of the total collection), cattle pens located near the forest showed greater diversity (23) than those from villages and agricultural areas. More diverse immature habitats and host blood sources from wildlife in nearby forests possibly explain the greater diversity in the cattle pens near the forest edge. Host blood meal analysis revealed that most (65%) biting midges had fed on buffalo despite the fact that this animal was much less numerous than cows or chickens. Relatively larger size and black-colored skin could be factors that make buffalo more attractive to biting midges than other host species. In this study, we also provided 67 DNA barcoding sequences of 13 species, three of which (C. flaviscutatus, C. geminus, and C. suzukii) were first reported from Thai specimens. DNA barcode analysis indicated cryptic diversity within C. hegneri and C. flavescens in Thailand, and thus, further investigation is required to resolve their species status.

AB  - The marine biotoxin domoic acid (DA) is an analog of the neurotransmitter glutamate that exerts potent excitatory activity in the brain, heart, and other tissues. Produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia spp., DA accumulates in marine invertebrates, fish, and sediment. Southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) feed primarily on invertebrates, including crabs and bivalves, that concentrate and slowly depurate DA. Due to their high prey consumption (25% of body weight/day), sea otters are commonly exposed to DA. A total of 823 necropsied southern sea otters were examined to complete this study; first we assessed 560 subadult, adult, and aged adult southern sea otters sampled from 1998 through 2012 for DA-associated pathology, focusing mainly on the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular system. We applied what was learned to an additional cohort of necropsied sea otters of all demographics (including fetuses, pups, juveniles, and otters examined after 2012: n = 263 additional animals). Key findings derived from our initial efforts were consistently observed in this more demographically diverse cohort. Finally, we assessed the chronicity of DA-associated pathology in the CNS and heart independently for 54 adult and aged adult sea otters. Our goals were to compare the temporal consistency of DA-associated CNS and cardiovascular lesions and determine whether multiple episodes of DA toxicosis could be detected on histopathology. Sea otters with acute, fatal DA toxicosis typically presented with neurological signs and severe, diffuse congestion and multifocal microscopic hemorrhages (microhemorrhages) in the brain, spinal cord, cardiovascular system, and eyes. The congestion and microhemorrhages were associated with detection of high concentrations of DA in postmortem urine or gastrointestinal content and preceded histological detection of cellular necrosis or apoptosis. Cases of chronic DA toxicosis often presented with cardiovascular pathology that was more severe than the CNS pathology; however, the lesions at both sites were relatively quiescent, reflecting previous damage. Sea otters with fatal subacute DA toxicosis exhibited concurrent CNS and cardiovascular pathology that was characterized by progressive lesion expansion and host response to DA-associated tissue damage. Acute, subacute, and chronic cases had the same lesion distribution in the CNS and heart. CNS pathology was common in the hippocampus, olfactory, entorhinal and parahippocampal cortex, periventricular neuropil, and ventricles. The circumventricular organs were identified as important DA targets; microscopic examination of the pituitary gland, area postrema, other circumventricular organs, and both eyes facilitated confirmation of acute DA toxicosis in sea otters. DA-associated histopathology was also common in cardiomyocytes and coronary arterioles, especially in the left ventricular free wall, papillary muscles, cardiac apex, and atrial free walls. Progressive cardiomyocyte loss and arteriosclerosis occurred in the same areas, suggesting a common underlying mechanism. The temporal stage of DA-associated CNS pathology matched the DA associated cardiac pathology in 87% (n = 47/54) of cases assessed for chronicity, suggesting that the same underlying process (e.g., DA toxicosis) was the cause of these lesions. This temporally matched pattern is also indicative of a single episode of DA toxicosis. The other 13% of examined otters (n = 7/54) exhibited overlapping acute, subacute, or chronic DA pathology in the CNS and heart, suggestive of recurrent DA toxicosis.
   This is the first rigorous case definition to facilitate diagnosis of DA toxicosis in sea otters. Diagnosing this common but often occult condition is important for improving clinical care and assessing population-level impacts of DA exposure in this federally listed threatened subspecies. Because the most likely source of toxin is through prey consumption, and because humans, sea otters, and other animals consume the same marine foods, our efforts to characterize health effects of DA exposure in southern sea otters can provide strong collateral benefits.

AB  - Monitoring physiological indicators including heart rate (HR) is crucial for managing animal welfare across diverse settings, from precision livestock farming to wildlife conservation. HR is a reliable indicator of energy expenditure and stress, yet the invasive nature of HR loggers limits their application in wild and free-ranging species. This study explores whether overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), measured with an external accelerometer, can serve as a less invasive proxy for HR. Using free-ranging cattle as a model species in Norway, we examined the relationship between ODBA and HR to assess how external accelerometry might indirectly reflect physiological states in settings that resemble wild conditions. Cattle provide an ideal model because they share some characteristics with wild herbivores, including exposure to diverse terrain and potential predation, whilst offering advantages for handling and sensor retrieval. Our findings showed that low ODBA values corresponded to static behaviours (e.g. standing, ruminating), where small movements caused HR spikes, whilst higher ODBA reflected dynamic activities (e.g. walking, foraging), with HR plateauing. This relationship suggests that ODBA can be used to approximate HR in environments where direct HR measurement is challenging. By using accelerometry to infer HR changes in free-ranging cattle, this study offers insights that could extend to wild species, offering a tool for conservationists to monitor and manage animal health and well-being less invasively.
   Heart rate is indicative of energy expenditure and stress but is costly to monitor in free-ranging cattle. Motion sensor collars are a cheaper alternative. We found that motion data are a good proxy for heart rate for static behaviours but are less accurate for active behaviours.

AB  - Beneficial bacteria interact with plants using signalling molecules, such as N-acyl homoserine-lactones (AHLs). Although there is evidence that these molecules affect plant responses to pathogens, few studies have examined their effect on plant-insect and microbiome interactions, especially under variable soil conditions. We investigated the effect of the AHL-producing rhizobacterium Acidovorax radicis and its AHL-negative mutant (does not produce AHLs) on modulating barley (Hordeum vulgare) plant interactions with cereal aphids (Sitobion avenae) and earthworms (Dendrobaena veneta) across variable nutrient soils. Acidovorax radicis inoculation increased plant growth and suppressed aphids, with stronger effects by the AHL-negative mutant. However, effects varied between barley cultivars and the presence of earthworms altered interaction outcomes. Bacteria-induced plant defences differed between cultivars, and aphid exposure, with pathogenesis-related and WRKY pathways partly explaining the ecological effects in the more resistant cultivars. Additionally, we observed few but specific indirect effects via the wider root microbiome where the AHL-mutant strain influenced rare OTU abundances. We conclude that bacterial AHL-signalling disruption affects plant-microbial interactions by inducing different plant pathways, leading to increased insect resistance, also mediated by the surrounding biotic and abiotic environment. Understanding the mechanisms by which beneficial bacteria can reduce insect pests is a key research area for developing effective insect pest management strategies in sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Our previous studies suggested that the short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs), as a new type of molecular marker developed very recently, are ideal molecular markers and have the potential to be used for population genetic analysis and molecular breeding in pigs and possibly it can be extended to other livestock animals as well. However, no report is available for the application of SINE RIPs in population genetic analysis in livestock, including pigs. Here, we evaluated 30 SINE RIPs in several indigenous Chinese miniature pig breeds, including three subpopulations of Bama pigs (BM-cov, BM-clo, and BM-inb). BM-cov is a subpopulation conserved in the national conservation farm, and BM-clo is a closed population maintained over 30 years with only 2 boars and 14 sows imported from its original area, while BM-inb herd is an 18 generation continuous inbreeding line based on the BM-clo population. To our knowledge, it is the first time to report the genetic diversity, breed differentiation, and population structures for these populations by using SINE RIPs, and which suggests the feasibility of SINE RIPs in pig genetic analysis.
   RIPs have been developed as effective genetic markers and popularly applied for genetic analysis in plants, but few reports are available for domestic animals. Here, we established 30 new molecular markers based on the SINE RIPs, and applied them for population genetic analysis in seven Chinese miniature pigs. The data revealed that the closed herd (BM-clo), inbreeding herd (BM-inb) of Bama miniature pigs were distinctly different from the BM-cov herds in the conservation farm, and other miniature pigs (Wuzhishan, Congjiang Xiang, Tibetan, and Mingguang small ear). These later five miniature pig breeds can further be classified into two clades based on a phylogenetic tree: one included BM-cov and Wuzhishan, the other included Congjiang Xiang, Tibetan, and Mingguang small ear, which was well-supported by structure analysis. The polymorphic information contents estimated by using SINE RIPs are lower than the predictions based on microsatellites. Overall, the genetic distances and breed-relationships between these populations revealed by 30 SINE RIPs generally agree with their evolutions and geographic distributions. We demonstrated the potential of SINE RIPs as new genetic markers for genetic monitoring and population structure analysis in pigs, which can even be extended to other livestock animals.

AB  - Creole breeds are an invaluable genetic reservoir due to their adaptation to the environments where they are exploited. In particular, Creole goats in Latin America and the Caribbean play a preponderant role in the development and economic growth of rural communities. They represent a strategic option for these communities to migrate from poverty to prosperity, taking advantage of the adaptability and rusticity of these goats, given that they survive, reproduce, and produce acceptable levels of meat and milk in adverse conditions and environments. For this reason, they are a key species for generating foods of high biological and nutritional value, in the face of changing environmental and climatic conditions. Therefore, public policies should consider local or Creole goats as a priority species in productive support programmes, as well as in research programmes seeking to improve productivity in a sustainable manner in all environments where they are raised.

AB  - Protected areas are essential tools for reducing loss of global biodiversity. To fulfill their ecological functions, protected areas must be connected to their surroundings, a requirement that is difficult to meet in landscapes intensively disturbed by anthropogenic activities. Therefore, protecting movement corridors at the edges of protected areas is crucial, especially for species with broad habitat needs, such as the American marten (Martes americana). However, habitat selection and space use patterns are dynamic processes, so we could expect that functional connectivity would vary temporally in response to changing environmental conditions and levels of human activities. In this study, we aimed at predicting the location of movement corridors for the American marten in Forillon National Park and its periphery during two contrasted periods (snow-free: May-November; snow-covered: December-April). We used "seasonal" resource selection functions to identify core areas (interpreted as circuit "nodes") and CircuitScape to delineate movement corridors between them based on the electrical circuit theory. Habitat selection patterns differed between periods, with martens avoiding open areas, high elevations and road proximity during the snow-free period, while avoiding areas closer to secondary roads but selecting areas closer to primary roads and housing structures during the snow-covered period. Consequently, the location of movement corridors differed partially between periods. Functional connectivity was favored by the presence of forest patches for both periods, while being constrained by open environments, especially during the snow-free period. Our study highlights the importance of modeling functional connectivity at fine temporal scales in order to provide movement corridors that fulfill the requirements of a species at each period of its annual cycle.

AB  - The Napoleon or humphead wrasse Cheilinus undulatus is a large, globally threatened coral reef fish. In recognition of suspected declines and considering its ecotourism importance, the Maldives was the first country to ban its export in 1995. The present study, a quarter-century after the ban, documents the species around Laamu Atoll, southern Maldives, using dive guides and researchers to conduct surveys during commercial dive tourism trips. Data were collected on abundance, body size, and potential spawning sites in 4 habitat types: channels (reef passes to open ocean), inner reefs (reef slopes inside the atoll), outer reefs (reef slopes outside the atoll), and faros (isolated submerged reefs inside the atoll). Abundance was recorded in number of fish per hectare, and fish length was classified as <100 cm, >= 100 cm, or unknown size. Possible spawning aggregation sites were identified based on multiple occasions of temporarily increased fish density associated with large male presence. Mean densities ranged from 6.02 fish ha-1 in channels, 2.65 and 2.29 fish ha-1 in outer and inner reefs, respectively, and 0.73 fish ha-1 in faros. These densities are consistent with those found in unexploited areas in similar habitats elsewhere and indicate successful protection of the species on Laamu Atoll. The data highlight the significance of reef channel habitat for this species as important megafauna and the need for management to conserve both species and channel habitats. The value of non-specialist observers for conducting labour-intensive surveys on large, wide-ranging species is demonstrated.

AB  - Temperature and relative humidity are important environmental factors that greatly affect sound-mediated activities in animals. However, little is known about how changes in temperature and hu-midity affect animal vocal systems. Echolocating bats perceive their surroundings through acoustic signals. In this study, we investigated the effects of temperature and humidity changes on the audiovocal control system, Doppler shift compensation (DSC), in echolocating bats, Hipposideros armiger. Results revealed that the DSC system was more precise under higher temperature and humidity conditions, while the frequency of calls and echoes decreased under higher temperatures. Atmospheric attenuation and body temperature increased with increasing experimental temperature and humidity conditions. Our results suggest that atmospheric attenuation and body temperature significantly affect DSC precision (DSCP) and the specialized narrow-frequency band of the auditory system (reference frequency). Owing to the small differences in sound attenuation between experimental groups, we speculate that the changes in attenuation were not sufficient to induce changes in DSCP. We propose that DSC performance may change concomitantly with frequency adjustment and may be passively affected by body temper -ature regulation. Our study shows how changes in the weather can affect animal vocal control systems and fitness.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Globally, the proliferation of shrubs within grasslands stimulates soil phosphorus (P) cycling and increases topsoil P storage beneath their canopies. However, little is known regarding the impact of shrub encroachment on subsoil P storage, and whether shrubs mediate changes in soil stoichiometry, like increasing P cycling. In grazed meadows on the Tibetan Plateau, soil and roots were sampled to 1 m depth in shrubby Hippophae rhamnoides ssp. sinensis groves and the surrounding grassy areas. Shrubs had higher P content than grasses, but lower C:P ratios in their leaves, litter, and roots. Similarly, shrubs had higher microbial P content than grasses, but lower microbial biomass C:P and N:P ratios in the soil. The larger microbial P stock in the 1 m of soil beneath shrubs responded to the larger root P stock there as well. Thus, both the plants and microbes acquired more P in shrubby areas than in grassy areas by accelerating P mineralization. The greater net production of available P in the topsoil and the synthesis of microbial P throughout the profile under shrubs increased the P solubility. Total P, inorganic P, and organic P stocks were lower under shrubs than under grasses in the top 1 m of soil. This decrease in soil P storage beneath shrubs is most likely attributable to P leaching due to higher P solubility, heavy rainfall, and larger soil gaps. Moreover, shrubs also had larger plant biomass P stock compared to grasses, and thus the depletion of P from the top 1 m of soil was further magnified via plant biomass removal. We concluded that shrubs increase P cycling to overcome the stoichiometric imbalance between their P requirement and the supply in the soil, and the fast P cycling under shrubs magnify P depletion within the rooted soil depth in alpine meadows.

AB  - Pop-off satellite archival tags (PSATs) have been increasingly deployed on marine megafauna to remotely monitor their movements, behavior, and environmental preferences. These tags have also allowed the occasional novel documentation of ecological interactions, such as predation on tagged animals. A PSAT deployed on a pregnant porbeagle Lamna nasus in the Northwest Atlantic suggests the shark was predated upon in mesopelagic waters near Bermuda. Predation was evident approximately 5 months after tagging based on depth and temperature data transmitted by the PSAT. Four days prior to PSAT pop-off, depth data indicated that the tag continued to descend and ascend in the water column while the temperature remained approximately 5 degrees C above ambient levels, even at several hundred meters in depth, indicating ingestion. Given the location of predation and elevated temperature at depth recorded by the pregnant porbeagle's tag, potential predators include endothermic shark species such as the white shark Carcharodon carcharias and shortfin mako Isurus oxyrhinchus. This is the first evidence of predation on a porbeagle globally and provides novel insight into inter-specific interactions for this large, threatened shark species.

TI  - A simple method for restraint of small mammals for sampling blood or tissue in the field
T2  - WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST
LA  - English
AB  - Because wild rodents often harbor zoonotic pathogens that can be transmitted via saliva, urine, or feces (e.g., hantaviruses), researchers can be at risk when collecting rodent blood or tissue samples that are required for innumerable assays (e.g., infection status, hormone assays, etc.). I describe how inexpensive, readily available 50-mL centrifuge tubes can be easily modified to create a handling tube for the safe restraint of small rodents while a blood and/or tissue sample is collected from the tail. This approach has been used to successfully sample thousands of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), the primary host for Sin Nombre virus, a zoonotic disease that is pathogenic for humans.

AB  - The conservation of endangered and rare mammal populations requires accurate inventorying. Traditional live-trapping methods can be labor-intensive, time-consuming and prone to errors, while camera trapping (CT) offers an effective alternative, enabling conservation efforts to focus on what is needed most. The current study utilized CT to understand the species richness and relative abundance of mammals in Kali Tiger Reserve, India. The sampling period was from March to May 2021, divided into three phases, each lasting 25 days and covering three different regions of the study area. The Rarefaction technique proved that 364 out of 462 camera stations was adequate effort for accurately estimating the composition of 22 mammal species comprising of eight herbivores, two omnivores, and six carnivores. The eastern region had a higher concentration of mammal species with the highest captures occurring at elevation ranging from 400 to 800 m. The study also noted the extensive presence of domestic animals and human activities, including hunting and poaching of wildlife within the reserve. The findings serve as a baseline for future assessments of conservation management interventions in Kali Tiger Reserve.

AB  - Pig production not only consumes large water and land, but also emits substantial greenhouse gases. Scholars have used environmental footprint, including water, land, and carbon footprints, to assess the environmental impacts of pig production. However, there is a lack of simultaneous analysis of water, land, and carbon footprints for pig production, particularly in China, the leading pig breeding and consumption country in the world. In this study, we used environmental footprint analysis to develop a water-land-carbon footprint model for pig production system from the life cycle perspective. We also examined virtual water, land and carbon flows embedded in trade. The life cycle of pig production mainly involves feed crop cultivation, feed production, and pig breeding. Then we analyzed the water, land, and carbon footprints of the pig production in China from 1990 to 2018. The findings indicated that both the total water footprint and the total land footprint increased, whereas the total carbon footprints fluctuated over the years. All the unit footprints generally decreased. Feed crop cultivation had a significant impact on the footprints. Regarding the spatial characteristics in China, all the three total footprints were generally higher in the southeast compared to the northwest. While the unit footprints in different provinces exhibited spatial heterogeneity, primarily attributed to the different feed consumptions. Overall, the trade of feed crop shifted virtual water, land and carbon flows from the north to the south, reducing the three total footprints on the whole. To achieve a resource-saving and eco-friendly pig production in China, we proposed some potential recommendations, including improving feed crop cultivation techniques, reducing feed conversion ratio, implementing precision feeding, and managing manure. We hope not only mitigate the environmental impacts of China's pig production, but also provide references for achieving agricultural sustainability in other regions of the world.

AB  - The use of poison against predators is pervasive and negatively impacts biodiversity and ecosystem health globally. Little is known about the correlates of poison use as a lethal control method on small-livestock farmland. We used a mixed-methods approach to investigate commercial farmers' experience with and perceived effectiveness of predation control methods, reported poison use and its correlates in the Central Karoo. Farmers perceived lethal methods to be cheaper and more effective than non-lethal methods in protecting their livestock from predation. They reported more experience with lethal methods, and over half reported having used poison. This is higher than other estimates in southern Africa and consistent with other survey-based evidence from the Karoo. Reported poison use was positively related to perceived efficacy, declining on-farm employment and perceived threats of predators. It was negatively related to terrain ruggedness. Our findings provide an understanding of the context and motivations shaping this illegal behavior.

AB  - Invasive macrofauna influence the biophysical state and function of soil, helping to drive ecological changes over time. Many soil -dwelling invertebrates affect soil stability by facilitating or hindering the soil aggregation process, changing the availability of plant and soil organic matter (SOM) for aggregate incorporation, and shifting the predominant mechanisms by which carbon is incorporated into soil aggregates. Using mass fractionation and stable carbon isotope techniques, this 17 -month experimental study examined silt -clay -loam mesocosms either infested or not infested with soil -dwelling larvae of the invasive Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman (JB). We hypothesized that larval root-herbivory would promote a pathway of large aggregate formation that features the mixing of digested root tissue with mineral soil and subsequent fecal deposition. These newly deposited, large soil aggregates will then grow by agglomeration of particles, thereby occluding a larger pool of fresh organic carbon, or be broken apart, exposing fresh organic inputs to microbial activity and mineralization processes, depending on soil conditions. Findings show a proportional increase of larger soil size fractions (2- 8 mm) in the rhizosphere of infested soil after 11/2 life cycles of the beetle, but a decrease in the smaller soil size fractions (0.053-2 mm). In infested bulk surface soil (0-2.5 cm) carbon increased, primarily due to greater carbon content in the largest size fractions. Carbon also increased in all size fractions, although the proportion of total carbon in fractions was greater only in the largest fractions due to their greater relative abundance. There may also be an increase of microbially derived carbon in the largest size fractions, possibly indicating significant priming effects associated with JB larval herbivory. The implications of these findings for relative stabilization of the bulk surface soil carbon pool in JB-infested soil likely depends on the residence time of, and stable microaggregate formation within these large size fractions.

AB  - Population stability depends on environmental conditions and their changes, as well as the availability of energy resources. Animals allocate their energy to maintenance, growth, reproduction, and energy storage; therefore, trade-offs are expected between life history traits. Access to abundant resources is expected to manifest itself in the investment of male individuals in sexually selected traits, such as carcass mass and antler size. The study aimed to analyze environmental climate conditions on the carcass and antler mass, as well as on antler form in red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) populations. We analyzed the carcasses and the antler masses and forms of 550 red deer stags from three populations in Central-Western Europe that differ in climate conditions that were hunter-harvested between the 2017 and 2021 hunting seasons. Our data indicated that carcass mass was shaped by the location of the population, stag age, precipitation, and temperature, as well as the number of frost days from January to the harvest date. Antler mass and antler investment depended on stag age but not climatic factors. Regular antler forms were more often observed in the harsh environmental conditions. Our observation confirms that resource trade-off is related to carcass mass of red deer.

AB  - Western redcedar (WRC; Thuja plicata) is a conifer of the Pacific Northwest of North America prized for its durable and rot-resistant wood. WRC has naturally low outcrossing rates and readily self-fertilizes in nature. Challenges faced in WRC breeding and propagation involve selecting trees for accelerated growth while also ensuring enhanced heartwood rot resistance and resistance to ungulate browsing, as well as mitigating potential effects of inbreeding depression. Terpenes, a large and diverse class of specialized metabolites, confer both rot and browse resistance in the wood and foliage of WRC, respectively. Using a Bayesian modelling approach, we isolated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers estimated to be associated with three different foliar terpene traits and four different heartwood terpene traits, as well as two growth traits. We found that all traits were complex, being associated with between 1700 and 3600 SNPs linked with putatively causal loci, with significant polygenic components. Growth traits tended to have a larger polygenic component while terpene traits had larger major gene components; SNPs with small or polygenic effect were spread across the genome, while larger-effect SNPs tended to be localized to specific linkage groups. To determine whether there was inbreeding depression for terpene chemistry or growth traits, we used mixed linear models for a genomic selection training population to estimate the effect of the inbreeding coefficient F on foliar terpenes, heartwood terpenes and several growth and dendrochronological traits. We did not find significant inbreeding depression for any assessed trait. We further assessed inbreeding depression across four generations of complete selfing and found that not only was inbreeding depression not significant but that selection for height growth was the only significant predictor for growth during selfing, suggesting that inbreeding depression due to selfing during operational breeding can be mitigated by increased selection intensity.

AB  - Exclusion cages can quantitatively demonstrate the value of natural enemies and the biological control services they provide. Currently, in Washington State, enclosing orchards in netting is being evaluated as a pest control method, but these enclosures may also serve as an exclusion cage to natural enemies, thereby disrupting biological control. To test the effects of net enclosures on apple arthropod communities, we conducted a two-year study comparing apple herbivore, predator, and parasitoid densities in caged and uncaged plots (both receiving insecticides) to an untreated check. Effects on the various groups were influenced by size and motility. Densities of larger motile arthropods, including codling moth (Cydia pomonella (L.)), chrysopids, and syrphids, were lower in the caged plots, demonstrating exclusion. Woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausmann)) and its parasitoid Aphelinus mali (Haldeman) densities in the caged plots were over 100-fold greater and 5-fold greater, respectively, than the other treatments. European earwig (Forficula auricularia (L.)), a generalist predator, was more abundant in the caged plots in 2016 but not in 2017. Spider mites were more abundant in the cage treatments for both years, while predatory mites had higher densities in the cages in 2017 only. These outcomes show that net enclosures change the composition of apple arthropod communities through exclusion of certain herbivores and natural enemies. In the case of some pest herbivores (e.g., codling moth), this exclusion is beneficial, but in the case of predators, it is detrimental. This study further demonstrated that exclusion of only part of the natural enemy complex may be sufficient to cause herbivore outbreaks.

AB  - The conversion of monocultural to mixed plantations is an increasing and widespread practice worldwide to improve forest productivity and soil fertility. Although tree species identity can affect soil ecological processes, there is still limited research on how it affects soil aggregate stability and nutrient variability. Here, we inves-tigated the variation of 0-100 cm aggregate stability index (percent of aggregate destruction, PAD; fractal dimension, D; geometric mean diameter, GMD; mean weight diameter, MWD), associated carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and stoichiometry in mixed plantations from coniferous trees (Pinus massoniana Lamb.) and a variety of individual broadleaved trees (Camellia oleifera Abel, Manglietia chingii Dandy, Cercidiphyllum japo-nicum Sieb. et Zucc., Michelia maudiae Dunn, and Bretschneidera sinensis Hemsl.). We discovered that compared to coniferous plantations, most mixed plantations significantly improved the mechanical and water stability of topsoil aggregates. Deep-rooted tree species (e.g., Michelia maudiae Dunn) favored the development of subsoil macro-aggregates to improve aggregate water stability (e.g., PAD = 46.10, MWD = 1.23, GMD = 0.49, D = 2.81). Mixed planting led to the enrichment of soil C, N, and P in microaggregate, which increased by at least 37.14, 20.24, and 61.11 %, respectively. The reduced C:P and N:P in soil aggregates indicate that soil P limitation may be alleviated. Furthermore, tree species and soil depth indirectly affected aggregate stability to regulate the accumulation of C, N, and P. Overall, we emphasize the necessity of selecting tree species combinations with complementary ecological niches in mixed plantations to improve soil stability and support forest productivity.

AB  - PremiseHerbivores directly influence plant reproduction by damaging reproductive tissue which reduces seed production in consumed plants. Consumption of reproductive tissue may also indirectly depress reproduction in unconsumed plants by isolating unconsumed individuals from prospective mates and reducing pollination. However, empirical support for such hypothesized indirect effects remains limited.MethodsTo investigate potential indirect effects of herbivory on mating opportunities and pollination, we quantified spatial patterns of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) herbivory and reproductive outcomes in Lilium philadelphicum (Liliaceae). We mapped 708 flowering plants, monitored deer herbivory, and examined how distance to prospective mates influenced rates of ovule fertilization, a proxy for pollen receipt.ResultsMost flowering L. philadelphicum plants (83%) failed to produce seed. Deer consumption of flowers prevented seed production in 35% of individuals. The probability of deer herbivory declined with distance to flowering conspecifics. Sixty-five percent of the remaining, unconsumed plants failed to produce seed due to apparent pollen limitation. While ovule fertilization rates declined with multiple predictors quantifying distances to flowering conspecifics, isolation metrics that excluded plants consumed by deer significantly improved predictions of ovule fertilization.ConclusionsOur results offer empirical support for the hypothesis that herbivory reduces pollination and seed production in unconsumed plants by altering spatial mating opportunities. This feedback between deer herbivory and distance-dependent pollination contributes to widespread reproductive failure in L. philadelphicum, though the extent to which deer reduce seed production varies with plant isolation. Herbivory may exacerbate pollen limitation in other species by isolating unconsumed plants from prospective mates.

AB  - Revealing the variation in soil aggregate-associated organic carbon (C-org) in tea plantations of various planting ages is crucial to shed more light on the accumulation and decomposition of soil C-org in the tea-planting period. This study measured the concentrations of soil C-org, active carbon (C-act), and recalcitrant carbon (C-rec) in different-sized aggregates obtained from tea plantations of various planting ages (8, 17, 25, and 43 years old) at the soil depths of 0-20 and 20-40 cm in southern Guangxi, China. According to the wet-sieving approach, soil aggregates were classified as macro- (> 0.25 mm) and micro- (< 0.25 mm) aggregates, and the former were further divided into coarse (> 2 mm), medium (2-1 mm), and fine (1-0.25 mm) fractions. Based on the mean weight diameter (MWD), the stability of soil aggregates was the highest in the 17-year-old tea plantations, and it was closely related to the concentration of soil C-act (0-20 cm: R-2 = 0.9744, p < 0.05; 20-40 cm: R-2 = 0.8951, p < 0.05), but not C-org (0-20 cm: R-2 = 0.1532, p > 0.05; 20-40 cm: R-2 = 0.4538, p > 0.05), during the tea-planting process. In the 0-20 and 20-40 cm soil layers, the coarse and medium macro-aggregates had higher concentrations of C-org, C-act, and C-rec, regardless of the tea-planting age; meanwhile, the soil C-act/C-rec ratio, indicating the C-org availability, increased as aggregate size increased, implying that the soil C-org was younger and more labile in coarse macro-aggregates relative to finer aggregates. Moreover, the tea-planting age significantly affected the C-org, C-act, and C-rec reserves in both soil layers. To be specific, continuous tea planting facilitated the accumulation of soil C-org and C-rec, but their reserves' increase rates decreased over time; meanwhile, the soil C-act reserve increased during the early (from 8 to 17 years) tea-planting stage and later decreased. Therefore, during the middle (from 17 to 25 years) and late (from 25 to 43 years) tea-planting stages, maintaining the soil as an C-act pool plays a vital role in facilitating the formation and stabilization of soil aggregates in southern Guangxi, China.

AB  - In biogeography the competitive exclusion principle (CEP) has been confirmed in some cases but not in others. This has fueled an unresolved debate between those advocating niche theory or the neutral theory in biodiversity and biogeography. We suggest that this situation mainly arises from the use of crisp logic, where the CEP is defined as either completely true or false. We propose the application of the fuzzy concepts of favorability (the degree to which environmental conditions are propitious for the occurrence of individual species) and favorableness (the degree to which environmental conditions are simultaneously favorable for competing species) to operationalize a fuzzy version of the CEP. Favorability was obtained by performing species distribution models applying favorability functions, while favorableness was derived from the application of the fuzzy intersection between the favorability for competing species. Then we plotted individual favorability values along the gradient of favorableness. Two potentially competing species would coexist in high-favorableness locations, as the demands of both species would be well fulfilled. In locations of low favorableness, the result would be either autecological exclusion of both species or autecological segregation, as abiotic conditions are unfavorable for at least one of the species. Competitive exclusion would occur at the intermediate stretch of the favorableness gradient, as the conditions would be good enough for persistence of each species separately but not enough for permanent coexistence. According to this theoretical framework, the observed probability that a location belongs to the intermediate favorableness area given that the two species co-occur in this location should be lower than expected according to the environmental probability models for the two species. We tested this prediction on published data about the distribution of pairs of native and introduced deer species in Great Britain, using a Bayesian approach. In two thirds of comparisons between a native and an introduced deer species the predictions of the fuzzy CEP were corroborated, which suggests that these are the pairs of species and the specific geographical areas affected by competitive exclusion. This is important both theoretically and for biodiversity conservation planning.

AB  - Preserving natural resources while addressing global food demand is a critical responsibility of the agricultural sector. In light of this, strategically integrating domestic herbivores into crop monocultures is seen as a promising opportunity to generate additional income and improve the efficiency of food production. Our study presents long-term results from experimentation on Integrated Crop-Livestock Systems (ICLS), revealing its productive and environmental benefits. We assessed carbon and nitrogen stocks and their temporal trend over 22 years, linking them to resource use efficiency and food provision in soybean systems with winter cover crops grazed at high, moderate, and low intensities, as well as ungrazed cover crops. Our results indicate an initial increase in carbon and nitrogen stocks across all treatments, stabilizing over time without significant differences among grazing intensities. High grazing intensity reduced the efficiency of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and water use, as well as soybean and pasture production. In contrast, energy production increased by 32% under moderate and low grazing intensities, and protein production by 24% under moderate grazing intensity, without compromising soil carbon and nitrogen stocks. The ICLS proved to be a key strategy for increasing food production while preserving soil carbon stock, with correct pasture management being paramount for gathering these outcomes.

AB  - In Nigeria, Chromolaena odorata poses significant threats to agriculture by disrupting ecosystem structure and function, thereby altering ecosystem services. However, our understanding of its impact, potential uses, and control measures, particularly from the perspective of local communities who interact directly with the plant, presents opportunities for a balanced approach to sustainable management. The aim of this study was to document the knowledge and perceptions of the introduction and spread of C. odorata, its ethnopharmacological applications, and its effects on crops, livestock, and wildlife, as well as discuss control strategies. Using participatory rural appraisal techniques, we administered semi-structured questionnaires to 150 respondents across six villages in Edo State, Nigeria. The findings reveal that C. odorata is a well-recognized invasive species that has been present for several decades and is commonly referred to by its local name, "Awolowo weed". Although many respondents were unsure of the reasons behind its introduction, most were familiar with its mode of dispersal. A significant proportion of respondents view the weed as a serious threat to agriculture and a major hindrance to human movement by foot to and from their farmlands where C odorata is dominant. However, many also reported its relative ease of management. Interestingly, 92.7% acknowledged the medicinal value of C. odorata, citing its use in treating fever, wounds, and stomach aches, while 84% reported its ability to enhance soil fertility. Most respondents did not perceive the plant as harmful to livestock or wildlife. Though many believe that the plant has continued to spread, 83.8% oppose its complete eradication. Instead, they highlighted Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach) as a more problematic weed that requires immediate intervention. In summary, exploring the local benefits of C. odorata highlights the importance of leveraging local knowledge and practices to develop a robust, integrated approach for its sustainable long-term management.

AB  - Nickel, a heavy metal with industrial applications and as a feed additive for livestock, can adversely impact reproductive function and gamete quality when present in excessive amounts in the animal feed environment. In this study, the results indicate that nickel exposure hampers polar body extrusion and cumulus cell expansion, thereby diminishing oocyte quality and developmental competence. Furthermore, nickel exposure reduces glutathione (GSH) levels in oocytes, leading to excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), provoking oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment. This cascade initiates mitochondrial autophagy, upregulates the expression of autophagy-related proteins Parkin and PINK1, promotes LC3 binding to autophagosomes. Nickel exposure disrupts calcium homeostasis and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Inhibiting ERS effectively alleviates the deterioration of oocytes quality caused by nickel exposure and inhibits mitochondrial autophagy. Proteomics further confirms nickel's exposure detrimental effects on mitochondria and ER, impacting cellular processes. Employing bovine oocytes as a model, consistent phenotypes were observed. These results indicate that nickel exposure disrupts intracellular calcium homeostasis, elicits ERS, disrupts cellular calcium homeostasis, diminishes the quality of pig oocytes, impairs oocyte maturation and developmental potential, and instigates mitochondrial autophagy.

AB  - Animal genetic resources (AnGR), which are a component of biodiversity in agriculture, has an essential role in sustainable agricultural development. Given the significance of AnGR for each nation, all communities need to maintain genetic diversity by preserving indigenous livestock and poultry populations as well as implementing the national plans and policies. This study aims at developing a web-based GIS to & BULL; collect and monitor information on livestock and poultry genetic resources across the country for typical decision-making activities in the organizational and managerial sectors, where resource managers and & BULL; policymakers with various ideas can put their conservation best practices into action. The suggested system integrates and organizes the concepts and tools from three distinct study areas, including AnGR, GIS, and web technologies into a unified framework. Data on the different breeds of six species including cattle, sheep, poultry, goat, horse and camel are currently being entered into the system. System implementation consists a four-step process that includes identification and data collection, data entry, querying, and planning and decision-making. The system as a whole contributes towards increased efficiency in the managing and monitoring the farm AnGR (FAnGR) by allowing users to query, visualize, manage, reuse, map and store FAnGR-related data.

AB  - Simple Summary Contagious ecthyma (orf) is a highly contagious eruptive skin infection of sheep and goats caused by the orf virus of the genus Parapoxvirus. Orf mainly affects young animals in their first year of life, although infection has occurred in other animals and in humans, so it is considered a zoonosis. The disease has high economic repercussions on sheep and goat farms worldwide and can compromise small ruminant value chains, so effective control and therapy are required. As treatment of orf lesions with topical antibiotics is a common practice, non-antimicrobial alternatives are indicated to promote antimicrobial stewardship and avoid increased antimicrobial resistance. A study with the wound formulation Tri-Solfen (R), a topically applied product containing two local anaesthetics (lignocaine and bupivacaine), adrenaline and an antiseptic (cetrimide) in a gel matrix, was conducted. This product was developed for surgical husbandry procedures in Australian livestock and more recently shown to be efficacious for the treatment of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in large ruminants, providing almost instant pain relief and faster healing of wounds with a likely viricidal impact. Results of therapy in lambs experimentally infected with orf appeared less encouraging, likely reflecting the relatively milder clinical signs than bovine FMD and deep basal epithelial location of orf lesions.Abstract Contagious ecthyma is a highly transmissible eruptive viral disease of the skin and mucosa of sheep and goats distributed worldwide. The treatment of orf lesions is usually based on the use of antiseptics and antibiotics for the management of presumptive secondary infections, increasing risks of antimicrobial resistance. The wound dressing formulation Tri-Solfen (R) (TS) containing two local anaesthetics (lignocaine and bupivacaine), adrenaline and an antiseptic (cetrimide) in a gel formulation has been demonstrated to reduce suffering and enhance recovery in cattle and buffalo with oral and skin lesions due to foot-and-mouth disease virus infection and reduced the orf viral load in lambs. In the present study, experimental infection with the orf virus was conducted in 50 newborn lambs and 25 animals were treated after the presence of the first lesions with TS and repeated three days later. Daily clinical examination, haematological, serological, biomolecular and post-mortem analyses were conducted during 34 days after treatment. Results indicated that treatment had no effect on weight gain and clinical progression of the lesions. It was determined that seroconversion after experimental infection occurs 34 days after infection and suggested that the deep basal epithelial location of the orf lesions may have prevented the therapy from having altered the clinical course.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are leading contributors to the endangered status of species. In 2006, the Nakai Plateau contained the largest known Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) population in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and the population was among those with the highest genetic diversity reported for Asian elephants. In 2008, completion of the Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric dam inundated much of the Plateau, resulting in the loss of 40% of elephant habitat. We studied elephant presence, movements, and the incidence of human-elephant conflict (HEC) on the Nakai Plateau and surrounding areas from 2004 to 2020, before and for 12 years after dam completion. To examine contemporary population dynamics in the Nakai elephants, we used genetic sampling to compare minimum population numbers, demography, and levels of genetic diversity from the wet and dry seasons in 2018/2019, 10 years after dam completion, with those reported in a pre-dam-completion genetic survey. After dam completion, we found a major increase in HEC locally and the creation of new, serious, and persistent HEC problems as far as 100 km away. While we were unable to compare estimated population sizes before and after dam completion, our data revealed a decrease in genetic diversity, a male-biased sex ratio, and evidence of dispersal from the Plateau by breeding-age females. Our results raise concerns about the long-term viability of this important population as well as that of other species in this region. Given that hydropower projects are of economic importance throughout Laos and elsewhere in southeast Asia, this study has important implications for understanding and mitigating their impact.

AB  - Pig production system has significant impacts on global climate and environment; the greenhouse gas (GHG) annual emission from China's pig production system accounts for more than 4% of which from world's animal husbandry. This study applied DEA and LCA methods with statistics of China's pig production, compared the environmental impact in each stage before and after optimization, aimed to calculate the resource input and energy consumption in pig production system, and realize lower investment and higher efficiency. The results showed that the optimized method could reduce 55.69 MJ energy consumption from each pig; the environmental impact potential of global warming, environmental acidification and eutrophication decreased by 1.56%, 0.6% and 0. 072%. Considering the Chinese pig breeding market in 2018 as an example, with a total of 693.824 million pigs sold, the optimized GHG emission reduction would be equivalent to the GHG emitted by producing 1.92812 x 10(5) vehicles.

AB  - Simple Summary Little is known about the distribution of rumen and liver flukes in sheep and goats in Germany or about the occurring rumen fluke species. These fluke infections can be detected by the parasite's eggs in the host animal's feces. Therefore, fecal samples from 223 sheep farms and 143 goat farms from northern and southern Germany were examined. The eggs of rumen flukes were detected on 2.2% of the samples, the eggs of common liver flukes on 2.7%, and the eggs of small liver flukes on 21.1% of the examined sheep farms. The rumen flukes were identified as the emerging species Calicophoron daubneyi. No rumen fluke eggs were detected on any of the goat farm samples, but common and small liver fluke eggs were detected in 5.6% and 7.0% of the goat herds, respectively. Differences in the geographical distribution of rumen and liver flukes between and within the two regions were identified. Rumen flukes were more frequently found in the north, while the two liver fluke species were more frequently found in the south of Germany. Sheep sharing the pasture with other ruminants were more likely to be infected with rumen flukes. Paramphistomidosis has recently been identified as an emerging parasitosis in Europe. This study estimated the prevalence of rumen flukes, Fasciola hepatica and Dicrocoelium dendriticum, in small ruminants in Germany and identified occurring rumen fluke species and potential predictors for fluke infections. Pooled fecal samples from 223 sheep farms and 143 goat farms in northern and southern Germany were examined by the sedimentation technique, and molecular species identification was performed on rumen-fluke-positive samples. In sheep, a flock prevalence of 2.2% was detected for rumen flukes. Calicophoron daubneyi was identified on four of five positive farms, while species identification failed in one flock. No rumen fluke eggs were detected in the examined goat herds. F. hepatica eggs were detected in 2.7% of the sheep flocks, while the herd prevalence was 5.6% in goats. Higher prevalence values of 21.1% (sheep) and 7.0% (goats) were observed for D. dendriticum. Mixed grazing with other ruminants and previously identified infections with rumen flukes and/or F. hepatica were identified as predictors for paramphistomidosis. The distribution of the three trematode species followed a geographical pattern associated with conditions favoring the relevant intermediate hosts. C. daubneyi is an established parasite in German sheep at a currently low prevalence.

AB  - Plants exchange a variety of information intra- and interspecifically by using various mediating cues. For example, plant individuals that are injured by herbivores release volatile chemicals, which induce receiver plants to express anti-herbivore resistance. Remarkably, some plant species were known to represent kin specificity in the response, where cues from a damaged individual induce a higher level of resistance in a kin receiver than in a non-kin receiver. Such higher sensitivity to warning cues from kin could be advantageous via two mechanisms. If each herbivore tends to attack plants with a certain genotype, plants should be more sensitive to warning cues from kin that share genetic properties. In addition, if herbivores successively attack the neighboring plant with a high probability, and if related plants tend to grow in close proximity, plants may be more sensitive to warning cues from neighboring kin under the presence of a trade-off between sensitivity to kin and non-kin. In the present study, we constructed a mathematical model including those mechanisms to investigate the evolutionary process of the higher sensitivity to warning cues from kin than sensitivities to cues from non-kin. According to the analysis of evolutionary dynamics, we revealed that both mechanisms could contribute, although higher sensitivity to cues from kin is more likely to evolve when the spatial range of competition is greater than the range of effective alarm cues. This result highlights the importance of the competition regime in the evolution of signaling among kin.
   Plant individuals that are injured by herbivores release volatile chemicals, which induce receiver plants to express anti-herbivore resistance. Some plant species were known to represent kin specificity in the response, where the warning cues induce a higher level of resistance in a kin receiver than in a non-kin receiver. Why does the receiver become more sensitive to the cues sent by kin? To answer this question, we theoretically investigated mechanisms that drive the evolution of higher sensitivity to warning cues from kin.image

AB  - Herbivorous fishes play an important role in preventing the overabundance of macroalgae on coral reefs. Understanding the feeding selectivity and consumption of macroalgae by herbivorous fishes can be challenging in studies of their ecological role in the preservation and recovery of coral reefs. Coral reef decline, macroalgal overgrowth and overfishing are clearly visible in the Xisha Islands, China. However, there are seldom studies on the feeding behaviors of herbivorous fishes in this area. We used microscopy, 18S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, and stable isotope analyses to comprehensively examine the diet of eight herbivorous reef fish species common in the Xisha Islands, including one parrotfish, two chub, two unicorn fish, and three rabbitfish. Based on microscopic examination, Siganus argenteus fed on the highest number of macroalgae species (five species), followed by Naso unicornis (four species). Kyphosus cinerascens, K. vaigiensis, N. unicornis and S. punctatissimus fed on the entire macroalgal thallus, indicating their greater ecological importance compared with species that only consume algal fronds. According to the 18S rRNA high-throughput sequencing of fish intestinal contents, cluster analysis revealed that consumed macroalgae composition from the eight fishes always grouped together based on the fish species, but with low similarity. K. vaigiensis removed the highest diversity of macroalgae species as well as the greatest quantity of macroalgae. Calotomus carolinus can consume the red alga Pneophyllum conicum, which is widely distributed on Indo-Pacific coral reefs and can overgrow and kill live corals. N. unicornis was found to occupy the lowest trophic position based on stable isotope analysis. Multi-technique analyses revealed that K. vaigiensis, N. unicornis and S. argenteus showed a high consumption potential of macroalgae, suggesting that they are the key browsers that should receive priority protection in the Xisha Islands. A diverse herbivorous fish fauna is also very important in the Xisha coral reefs. These results not only demonstrated the various functions of different herbivorous fish species in macroalgal removal, but also provided insights into the management of herbivorous fishes on the coral reefs of the South China Sea.

AB  - Tall fescue [Schedonorus arundinaceous (Schreb.) Dumort. nom. cons. Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh.] is the dominant pasture grass across much of the southeast of the USA. The species is productive, but grows slowly in summer. Plants also harbor an endophytic fungus (Epichloe coenophiala), which produces alkaloids that are toxic to cattle. Adding summer-productive forages to fescue-based systems may benefit animal production by providing extra herbage and diluting fescue toxins. A three-year study was conducted in Virginia, USA to determine animal and vegetation responses when alfalfa (Medicago sativa) or Sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata (Dum. Cours.) G. Don) swards were established into tall fescue pastures. Average daily gain (ADG) of steers and seasonal herbage mass dynamics were monitored from 2016 to 2018. Forage and weed species composition measurements were collected to address a secondary objective that sericea might suppress weeds through allelopathy. Steer performance was acceptable (0.73 kg d(-1) ADG), but interseeded legumes did not improve weight gain. Steers avoided sericea plants, and this resulted in greater herbage mass accumulation in summer compared with other treatments. Alfalfa was selectively grazed and cover decreased to almost zero by year 3, while sericea cover increased to over 82%. We found little evidence that sericea was allelopathic against weeds. Neither summer-productive legume species proved to be satisfactory in improving summer animal performance in this tall fescue-based grazing system.

AB  - Prescribed burning and pyric herbivory play pivotal roles in mitigating wildfire risks, underscoring the imperative of consistent biomass monitoring for assessing fuel load reductions. Drone-derived surface models promise uninterrupted biomass surveillance but require complex photogrammetric processing. In a Mediterranean mountain shrubland burning experiment, we refined a Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereopsis (MVS) workflow to diminish biases in 3D modeling and RGB drone imagery-based surface reconstructions. Given the multitude of SfM-MVS processing alternatives, stringent quality oversight becomes paramount. We executed the following steps: (i) calculated Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) checkpoints to assess SfM sparse cloud optimization during georeferencing; (ii) evaluated elevation accuracy by comparing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of six surface and thirty terrain clouds against GNSS readings and known box dimensions; and (iii) complemented a dense cloud quality assessment with density metrics. Balancing overall accuracy and density, we selected surface and terrain cloud versions for high-resolution (2 cm pixel size) and accurate (DSM, MAE = 57 mm; DTM, MAE = 48 mm) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generation. These DEMs, along with exceptional height and volume models (height, MAE = 12 mm; volume, MAE = 909.20 cm(3)) segmented by reference box true surface area, substantially contribute to burn impact assessment and vegetation monitoring in fire management systems.

   Mediterranean forest rangelands constitute essential feed resources for grazing goats. The objective of this study was to evaluate the temporal variations in chemical composition, in vitro digestibility, and metabolizable energy of browsed plant species by goats on forest rangelands of the Southern Mediterranean of northern Morocco. Overall, the nutritive value of the selected plant species was highest in spring and then steadily decreased through the summer and autumn. Most of the selected plant species present high levels of crude protein than the minimum required level for maintenance. This study provides a valuable and useful database to elaborate the seasonal grazing and feeding management plan for goat herds.
   Forest rangelands contribute largely to goat diets in the Mediterranean area. Information about browsed plant quality is essential for adequate feeding management. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the temporal changes in chemical composition and in vitro digestibility of the main plant species selected by goats in the Southern Mediterranean forest rangeland during two consecutive years; these were very contrasted (dry and wet). The browsed species were composed of herbaceous, eleven shrubs, and four tree species. Overall, large variability in chemical composition, in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), and metabolizable energy (ME) was observed among species, grazing season (spring, summer, and autumn), and years within each species. Crude protein (CP) content varied from 60 to 240 g/kg dry matter (DM). The fiber fractions, except for Quercus suber, increased significantly by advancing maturity. Due to the water stress, the lignin level presented a higher value during the spring of the dry year. Condensed tannin (CT) content varied from 2 to 184 g/kg DM. CP, IVOMD, and ME showed a negative correlation with lignin and CT. Based on the results presented herein, it is concluded that the nutritive value of the browsed plant species was highest in the spring and lowest during the summer and autumn of both studied years. With a good grazing management strategy, the selected plant species by goats could guarantee high-quality feeding resources throughout the year.

AB  - Overfishing, as well as habitat loss and degradation, has led to major population declines and local extinctions of sawfishes (Pristidae) globally. Four sawfish species reportedly occur in India; however, records have been limited to opportunistic commercial catch and landing reports. Here, we provide the first comprehensive review of published and grey literature on sawfish records from India, including opportunistic observations of sawfish rostra offerings to religious places, highlighting the cultural significance of these species locally. In total, 223 recorded capture events were compiled between 1794 and 2022, with largetooth sawfish Pristis pristis (n = 82), followed by narrow sawfish Anoxypristis cuspidata (n = 32), being the dominant species reported. In addition to marine fisheries, 8 reports of sawfish were reported from freshwater systems. The wide range of rostra sizes and total lengths recorded also suggests that India's waters harbour various life history stages of sawfish. When caught, sawfish livers were utilised to produce oil, meat was locally consumed, and fins were exported. Despite being legally protected in India since 2001, 63 incidental captures were recorded from landings, suggesting various levels of awareness and enforcement of catch bans across the country. To avoid extinction of these species in India, we emphasise the need to conduct culturally associated awareness programs with coastal communities, encourage safe release and improve handling practices with fishers, identify critical habitats, and strengthen enforcement for mandatory live release.

AB  - Simple Summary Weaning causes gut microbiota disruption that results in dysbiosis and post-weaning diarrhea. The recent ban on pharmacological doses of in-feed zinc oxide in the weaned pig diet has made exploration of alternative dietary supplements to improve the post-weaning condition of pigs imperative. Plants (e.g., red beetroot) containing bioactive compounds have shown great potential in this regard, favorably abating gut microbiota dysbiosis and promoting gut metabolite production and health. Red beetroot is a well-recognized and established source of bioactive compounds (e.g., betalains and polyphenols) with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. It is proposed as a potential alternative to zinc oxide with a focus on gut microbiota modulation and metabolite production. In this study, weaned pigs aged 28 days were fed either a control diet, a diet supplemented with zinc oxide (3000 mg/kg), or 2% and 4% pulverized whole red beetroot (CON, ZNO, RB2, and RB4; respectively) for 14 days. After pigs were euthanized, blood and digesta samples were collected for microbial composition and metabolite analyses. The results showed that the diet supplemented with red beetroot at 2% improved the gut microbial richness relative to other diets but marginally influenced the cecal microbial diversity compared to a zinc-oxide-supplemented diet. A further increase in red beetroot levels (4%-RB4) led to loss in cecal diversity and decreased short chain fatty acids and secondary bile acid concentrations. Also, an increased Proteobacteria abundance, presumably due to increased lactate/lactic-acid-producing bacteria was observed. In summary, red beetroot contains several components conceived to improve the gut microbiota and metabolite output of weaned pigs. Future studies investigating individual components of red beetroot will better elucidate their contributions to gut microbiota modulation and pig health.

AB  - Although pig meat accounts for nearly half of total meat production in Europe, less attention has been focused on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of pig farming. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the impact of pig livestock on GHG emissions during the period 2015-2020 in major European countries, including Greece, using different computational approaches (Tier 1, Tier 2, Gleam-i software v. 2.0 developed by FAO, Rome, Italy). A semi-extensive pig farm was also used as a small-scale scenario. The ranking of the countries related to GHG emissions was not affected by the applied methodology. Spain had the highest emissions due to the higher number of farming animals. The noted numeric differences in the estimations can be attributed to the elaborated and different equational approach that Tier 2 methodology and Gleam-i followed, considering many livestock parameters. Additionally, the semi-extensive farm had lower emissions/fewer animal compared to the average intensive pig farm in the Greek territory. The Tier 1 approach revealed that breeding animals produces more to the emissions, contrary to Tier 2, which showed that fattening pigs is responsible for the majority of GHG emissions. Therefore, specific animal categories could be targeted (i.e., fattening gilts) in a more specialized manner apart from general strategies (i.e., animal improvement).

The holotype was obtained from a larva that abandoned the pig carcass to pupate, whereas the paratype was collected with a trap placed above the cage containing the carcass. This is the first record of a Helicobia species reared from a vertebrate carcass.

AB  - This paper introduces and comments on the animals and plants listed in a manuscript dated 1599 (the 'Berry-Pomeroy Manuscript'), the 'Synopsis chorographical of Devonshire' by John Hooker of Exeter (1527-1601). Two hundred and seventy eight animals and plants were named, which is an unprecedented number for a local natural history text from sixteenth-century Britain. The animals mentioned include some of considerable interest like the wolf, bear, roe deer and red deer, polecat, black rat, white stork, Cornish chough and numerous freshwater fishes. Several cultivated varieties of domesticated fruit trees, in particular apples and pears, and other local specialities that are no longer known were also in Hooker's list.

FX  - I would like to gratefully acknowledge a grant from the Society for the History of Natural History's Small Research Fund in 2020 which enabled me to consult a copy of John Hooker's 'Synopsis chorographical of Devonshire', supplied by the Devon Archives and Local Studies Service. At that time I requested a copy of the Harleian manuscript, which, as mentioned, does not include the lists of animals and plants discussed here. My research into this text was stymied for some time, until Dr Quentin Deakin kindly appraised me of the fact that the 'Berry-Pomeroy Manuscript' version of the 'Synopsis' contains much more complete lists of the flora and fauna of Devon. Devon Archives and Local Studies Service was able to supply me with this alternative manuscript, and they have also generously granted me permission to publish the transcription in the Appendix. I would also like to acknowledge the energetic and knowledgeable assistance of my Westcountry family members, S. Hobbs, A. L. Raye and M. P. Allen in identifying the species of plants and varieties of fruit. M. J. Gentile once again rode to the rescue with his statistical analysis skills.

AB  - Over the last two decades, satellite tagging of adult and sub-adult white sharks Carcharodon carcharias off the west coast of North America has revealed a predictable onshore-offshore migratory cycle. Our current understanding of the vertical movements exhibited by white sharks while in their coastal foraging phase in the California Current, however, remains limited. Here, we used recovered datasets from 31 archival satellite tags to quantify vertical habitat use. Tags were deployed on individuals between 2000 and 2018 and recorded depth and temperature data at continuous 1-120 s intervals before being recovered up to a year after deployments. Four satellite-tagged individuals were concurrently tagged with acoustic tags, providing precise location data when detected by acoustic receivers that allowed us to explore how reported vertical habitat use varied spatially. While in the coastal shelf waters, white sharks moved at a mean depth +/- SD of 14.3 +/- 4.0 m and occupied significantly deeper depths during the day than the night. High individual, temporal and spatial variation was evident in vertical movements, while consistent diel and lunar effects emphasized the importance of light-level driving vertical behavior around hunting sites. The vertical movement behaviors reported here provide knowledge of how white sharks may directly and indirectly interact with their mammalian prey in a dynamic three-dimensional system during their capital foraging phase. Temporal patterns in vertical behavior, for instance, indicated that surface waters during early morning hours are the riskiest place for prey. Combining these novel findings with higher-resolution biologging techniques in future studies will allow us to further contextualize fine-scale vertical movement behaviors of white sharks and examine the specific foraging events that could not yet be isolated in the tagging data.

AB  - Leaf phenology of trees responds to temperature and photoperiod cues, mediated by underlying genes and plasticity. However, uncertainties remain regarding how smaller-scale phenological variation in cold-limited regions has been affected by modified selection pressures from herbivores, pathogens, and climate conditions, and whether this leaves genetic signatures allowing for projections of future responses. We investigated environmental correlates and genetic variation putatively associated with spring and autumn leaf phenology in northern range margin oak (Quercus robur L.) populations in Sweden (55.6 degrees N-60.8 degrees N). Results suggested that budburst occurred later at higher latitudes and in locations with colder spring (April) temperatures, whereas leaf senescence occurred earlier at higher latitudes. Several candidate loci associated with phenology were identified (n = 40 for budburst and 47 for leaf senescence), and significant associations between these loci and latitude were detected. Functions associated with some of the candidate loci, as identified in previous studies, included host defence and heat stress tolerance. The proportion of polymorphic candidate loci associated with budburst decreased with increasing latitude, towards the range margin. Overall, the Swedish oak population seems to comprise genetic diversity in phenology-related traits that may provide resilience to a rapidly changing climate.

AB  - Deep-water sharks are among the most vulnerable deep-water taxa because of their extremely conservative life-history strategies (i.e., late maturation, slow growth, and reproductive rates), yet little is known about their biology and ecology. Thus, this study aimed at investigating the trophic ecology of five deep-water shark species, the birdbeak dogfish (Deania calcea), the arrowhead (D. profundorum), the smooth lanternshark (Etmopterus pusillus), the blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus) and the knifetooth dogfish (Scymnodon ringens) sampled onboard a crustacean bottom-trawler off the south-west coast of Portugal. We combined carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes with RNA and DNA (RD) ratios to investigate the main groups of prey assimilated by these species and their nutritional condition, respectively. Stable isotopes revealed overall small interspecific variability in the contribution of different taxonomic groups to sharks' tissues, as well as in the origin of their prey. S. ringens presented higher delta N-15 and delta C-13 values than the other species, suggesting reliance on bathyal cephalopods, crustaceans and teleosts; the remaining species likely assimilated bathy-mesopelagic prey. The RD ratios indicated that most of the individuals had an overall adequate nutritional condition and had recently eaten. This information, combined with the fact that stable isotopes indicate that sharks assimilated prey from the local or nearby food webs (including commercially important shrimps), suggests a potential overlap between this fishing area and their foraging grounds, which requires further attention.

AB  - Ecological speciation, driven by divergent selection across varying environments, is crucial for the evolution of biodiversity. To comprehend this phenomenon fully, investigating ongoing speciation events is imperative. Telmatochromis temporalis, a herbivorous cichlid endemic to Lake Tanganyika, recently revealed the existence of a slender morph inhabiting deep waters. Despite genetic similarity, it is reproductively isolated from the parapatric population of the normal morph inhabiting shallow waters. This study examined substrate features and life history traits to propose a mechanism that maintains the parapatric distribution, which likely contributes to reproductive isolation. The normal morph displayed a preference for natural shelters between rocks and invested significant energy on reproduction, likely well-adapted to shallow waters abundant in natural shelters and food resources. In contrast, the slender morph seemed to construct nests beneath rocks tailored to its body size and exhibited energy-saving reproduction, likely suited to deep waters with scarce natural shelters and food resources. These adaptive differences are likely responsible for parapatric distribution. Additionally, I discussed the potential for the slender morph and another morph, the dwarf morph, to have evolved in parallel from the normal morph through divergent natural selection, depending on the environmental challenges faced by the normal morph.

AB  - Disease modelling at the livestock-wildlife interface is an important topic for which discrete-space models are used for the wildlife component. One prominent example is African Swine Fever, where wild boar play an influential role as reservoirs of disease spillover into domestic pig farms. In this paper, we present a simulation study that demonstrates the impact of seemingly arbitrary choices of landscape discretisation method on the inferred rate of spread within the model. We use an ordinary differential equation model to implement a simplified model of disease transmission between discrete groups of wild boar with spillover into domestic pig farms contained within a homogeneous landscape. We examine a range of scenarios whereby the landscape is discretised into wild boar patches of varying size and shape, and compare the rate of spread between domestic pig farms placed at fixed points on the landscape. Our results demonstrate a non-monotonic relationship between patch size and rate of spread, which is particularly unstable and unpredictable for square and triangular shaped patches. Discretisation of the landscape into hexagons appears to produce amore stable relationship between patch size and rate of spread for the three types of transmission kernel we investigated. Although the rate of disease spread does converge to a stable value, this occurs at patch sizes that are much smaller than would be used in practice for wild boar. We conclude that outputs of disease models containing a wildlife component should not be considered to be robust to arbitrary choices for patch size and placement, but rather as a source of uncertainty to be examined using sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, we strongly recommend the use of hexagons rather than squares or right triangles for landscape discretisation.

AB  - An important yet largely overlooked aspect of behavioral variation is that some individuals are consistently less "predictable" than others. Predictability is the level of variance that corresponds to (unexplained) variation among successive measurements on a given individual. Predictability can be assessed both over multiple assays and within an assay to look at short-term variation in expression of behaviors. Here, we recorded locomotor activity in a large number of wild white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) exposed to a 10-minute novel environment test. We considered short-term (seconds, minutes) variation in distance moved within a test to estimate among-individual (co)variation in intercept (personality), slope (short-term temporal plasticity), and variance within a test (predictability) at different temporal scales. Combining a multilevel reaction norm with a double hierarchical generalized linear mixed modeling approach, we found that repeatability in within-test predictability was significant, but repeatability estimates varied across the temporal scales, with estimates of R=0.36 at the shortest and longest time bins (i.e., 15 and 200 seconds) and a low estimate of R=0.11 at the 100-second time bin. The relationship between the intercept and variance of the reaction norms went from strongly positive to strongly negative from the shortest to the longest time bins. These results clearly show how the temporal scale at which predictability is studied can affect its repeatability and relationship with personality. By contrast, within-test predictability was positively correlated with plasticity across the entire range of temporal scales examined. Hence, when introduced into a novel environment, unpredictable individuals are less plastic than predictable individuals. To the extent that this correlation reflects the underlying genetic architecture of behavior, our results suggest potential constraints on the evolution of behavior across multiple levels of variation.Significance statementSome individuals are consistently less predictable than others in their behavior. Whether these individual differences in "predictability" are linked with personality and plasticity represents an important question regarding the evolution of behavior. Yet, studies considering all three levels of variance (predictability, personality, and plasticity) simultaneously remain rare. Here, we measured locomotor activity upon introduction into a novel environment in a large number of wild mice. We show that "unpredictable" mice display lower levels of phenotypic plasticity (i.e., shallower slope). The relationship between predictability and personality (i.e., individual mean differences in activity), however, depended on the temporal scale at which behavior was measured. This study represents a first step toward a better understanding of architecture of behavior across levels of variation and raises awareness to the importance of the temporal scale at which predictability is studied.

AB  - Human expansion and anthropogenic activities are causing the conversion of forests to other land uses in the Himalayas, which is threatening species with extinction. To address this issue, we used an ensemble model to simulate the future landscape and assess its impact on the Kashmir Musk Deer (KMD) distribution in the context of land use change. Our simulation suggests a decline in croplands and shrublands and increase of mixed forests in the future scenario. Evergreen broad-leaf and needle-leaf forests are likely to convert to mixed forests, while croplands and barren areas transform into savannas. Precipitation, elevation, and mixed forests were found to be the most significant factors influencing KMD distribution. Only 20,690 km2 out of the total area of 324,666 km2 is currently suitable for KMD, but this is projected to increase to 22,701.47 km2 in the future. We predict a habitat gain of about 2,722 km2 in new areas and a loss of 711 km2 in existing habitats for KMD by 2030, with Uttarakhand state losing much of the suitable habitat. However, new habitats in future will become available for the species in Jammu and Kashmir. Our landscape configuration investigation indicates a decline in the number of patches and aggregation index in the future scenario. Most of the suitable KMD habitats are outside the current protected areas (PA), making the current PA network insufficient for long-term conservation. Therefore, we suggest forest managers to rationalize the boundary of the PAs to include suitable habitats that are currently not protected for the long-term survival of the KMD.

AB  - East African ecosystems have been shaped by long-term socio-ecological-environmental interactions. Although much previous work on human-environment interrelationships have emphasised the negative impacts of human interventions, a growing body of work shows that there have also often been strong beneficial connections between people and ecosystems, especially in savanna environments. However, limited information and understanding of past interactions between humans and ecosystems of periods longer than a century hampers effective management of contemporary environments. Here, we present a late Holocene study of pollen, fern spore, fungal spore, and charcoal analyses from radiocarbon-dated sediment sequences and assess this record against archaeological and historical data to describe socio-ecological changes on the Laikipia Plateau in Rift Valley Province, Kenya. The results suggest a landscape characterised by closed forests between 2268 years before present (cal year BP) and 1615 cal year BP when there was a significant change to a more open woodland/grassland mosaic that continues to prevail across the study area. Increased amounts of charcoal in the sediment are observed for this same period, becoming particularly common from around 900 cal year BP associated with fungal spores commonly linked to the presence of herbivores. It is likely these trends reflect changes in land use management as pastoral populations improved and extended pasture, using fire to eradicate disease-prone habitats. Implications for contemporary land use management are discussed in the light of these findings.

AB  - We examined town-level frequencies of orchid species in the southern New England states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island and their changes over time. Our analyses were based on detailed floristic studies of two Massachusetts counties, specimens in New England herbaria, and data from state Natural Heritage Programs and iNaturalist. Recent herbarium collections and data from iNaturalist proved inadequate to represent town-level occurrences in the absence of other data sources. The town-level frequencies of nearly all native orchid species have declined, and these declines were significantly greater than those of a matched group of non-orchid species of comparable historical frequency. We examined associations between orchid decline and several variables related to historical frequency, habitat affiliation, floral morphology, pollination, and geographical range. The only significant pattern was a tendency for greater declines in northern species among the state-listed species in southern New England. There was some evidence of greater declines among large-leaved orchids than small-leaved orchids and among insect-pollinated species compared to primarily autogamous species. We conclude that orchid declines are real and widespread in southern New England but that causes are unlikely to reflect a single variable. Rather, we believe that causation involves multiple factors whose effects vary among species and perhaps in different regions.

Surface water unavailability reduce elephant home range to around peripheries of water bodies and this is intensifying the destruction of wood species around these water bodies. The study adopted a mixed methods research design which combined qualitative and quantitative methods. Field data were collected between 10 January 2017 and 14 February 2019. Questionnaires, interviews and field observations were the major tools used to collect data in Mana Pools National Park. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20.0. Inferential statistics were employed to determine the relationship between elephant activity and damage of woody species. Chi square test results revealed that there is a significant relationship (P < 0.05; P = 0.001) between elephant activity and woody species damage. This means that woody species damage in the Mana Pools National Park Zambezi Valley flood plain can be attributed to elephant activity. This study recommends that Government and Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authourity (ZPWMA) should formulate effective elephant population analysis through periodic surveys in order to continuously update the national data base of elephant population trends in areas such as Mana Pools National Park.

AB  - Subtropical and temperate rainforests of Central Eastern Australia are some of the largest remaining fragments of their kind globally. The biota of these rainforests appears to comprise two broad biogeographical elements: a more ancient (Miocene or older) and typically upland temperate ('Gondwanan') element and a younger (PlioPleistocene) lowland tropical element. We present the first phylogenetic synthesis of the spatiotemporal origins for the eight bird taxa endemic to Central Eastern Australian Rainforests. At least five of these eight focal taxa show Plio-Pleistocene divergences from their respective northern sister taxa, consistent with origins driven by recent expansion and contraction of lowland rainforest. In contrast, two more strictly upland species, the rufous scrub-bird (Atrichornis rufescens) and the logrunner (Orthonyx temminckii), diverged from their nearest living relatives during the Miocene, suggesting potentially longer histories of persistence and more temperate origins. Finally, we did not recover reciprocal monophyly in mitogenomes from the two extant lyrebirds, Albert's lyrebird (Menura alberti) and the superb lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae). The disparate divergence ages recovered among all eight taxa are consistent with the biota of the Central Eastern Australian Rainforests comprising isolates either of younger age and tropical lowland origins or of older age and temperate upland origins.

AB  - The performance, system stability, and microbial community response in anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) of corn stover (CS) and chicken manure (CM) were investigated by running completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) under controlled organic loading rate (OLR). Prior to anaerobic digestion (AD), potassium hydroxide (KOH) or liquid fraction of digestate (LED) was applied to pretreat CS, respectively. The results showed that the daily biogas production (DBP) in co-digestion showed a gradual increasing trend with an increase in the OLR from 65 g TS.L-1 to 100 g TS.L-1. The daily methane production per g volatile solids (DMP-VS) in co-digestion increased by 23.0%-27.1%,18.7%-18.8%, and 17.5%-18.0% at the OLRs of 65, 80, and 100 g TS.L-1, respectively, upon pretreatment with KOH or LED, as compared to that in co-digestion CSTR without any pretreatment. In addition, all co-digestion CSTRs were operated in stable state. Approximately half of the total carbon in the substrates was recovered in the form of a biogas product, with the carbon mass balance being impacted by the OLR as well as pretreatment. The diversity as well as function of the microbial community varied in response to different OLRs and pretreatment methods. The majority of bacterial genera were strongly correlated with operational parameters. The study indicates that management of OLR and selection of proper pretreatment method could enhance the efficiency and productivity of CS and CM co-digestion in CSTR.

AB  - A central goal of ecology is to understand how environmental variation affects populations. Long-term studies of marked individuals can quantify the effects of environmental variation on key life-history traits. We monitored the survival and growth of 336 individually marked juvenile eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), a large herbivore living in a seasonal but unpredictable environment. During our 12-year study, the population experienced substantial variation in rainfall, forage biomass, and density. We used structural equation modeling to determine how variation in temperature and rainfall affected juvenile survival and growth through its effect on forage biomass and population density. Independently of population density, forage biomass had strong positive effects on survival from 10 to 21 months. At low population density, forage biomass also had a positive effect on skeletal growth to 26 months. Increasing maternal body condition improved rearing success for daughters but not for sons. High population density reduced skeletal growth to 26 months for both sexes. Rainfall had an increasingly positive effect on forage biomass at high temperatures, indicating a seasonal effect on food availability. Our study reveals interacting effects of environmental variation on juvenile survival and growth for a large mammal with a conservative reproductive strategy that experiences substantial stochasticity in food availability.

AB  - Nutrient-rich waters along the Pacific coast of North America support diverse fish communities that have helped sustain coastal peoples for millennia. Five Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations on the west coast of what is now known as Vancouver Island, Canada, hold constitutional Indigenous rights to conduct a multispecies community fishery, which includes Pacific Halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis). A 2009 court decision defined the extent of these Indigenous rights to be within 9 nm of the coast, thereby not fully recognizing the knowledge and authority of the traditional leadership and raising concerns about the potential for an increase in rockfish bycatch. Yelloweye Rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) are a potential 'choke' species for this fishery because the two species occupy similar depth ranges. A choke species is one that is caught incidentally while targeting other species and, if caught in excess of its quota limits, can trigger a halt to fishing on the target species. Guided by the insights of local Indigenous peoples and using both fishery-independent survey and commercial longline catch data, we investigated the effects of fishing depth and spatial restriction on the relative catch weights of these two species using spatiotemporal models. We find evidence that a confined fishing area can limit opportunities for avoiding choke species. Specifically, fishing at depths deeper than 175 m, which occur outside the court defined area (CDA), would provide more opportunities for catching halibut while avoiding Yelloweye Rockfish than are currently available within the CDA. This Indigenous-informed, analytical approach to a management problem is just one example of how Western scientists can engage in coproduction of knowledge with Indigenous peoples to transition from the 'status quo' towards a practice of 'Two-Eyed Seeing' that more effectively balances Indigenous rights and species conservation. Policy implications: Our study highlights (1) the importance of considering choke species distributions and opportunities for their avoidance when implementing spatial harvest restrictions and (2) how related analytical and management decisions can benefit from being guided by the advice of Indigenous knowledge holders.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) are apex predators that spend several months at sea feeding over vast areas. Their population trends are related to food availability during winter, which in turn is influenced by environmental conditions; thus, fluctuations in their populations reflect changes in the ecosystems. Although population trends for this species are available for large populations, there are still small colonies for which information is scarce, as is the case for the colony located at Peninsula Potter, South Shetland Islands. At this colony, field censuses of the number of breeding females conducted from 1995 to 2018 revealed an overall decline of 11.9% at an annual rate of 0.6%. However, contrasting trends before and after 2008 were observed. A decrease of 46.5% at an annual rate of 4.6% was registered before 2008, while for the subsequent period (2008-2018) the number of females increased by 64.5% at an annual rate of 5%. A positive association was observed between the extent of sea ice in winter foraging areas and population numbers between 1995 and 2008. The females of this colony feed on the edge of the sea ice, so in years of low sea ice extension the effort required to reach these areas is greater. This could lead individuals to choose to breed in areas closer to their feeding grounds in order to avoid the energetic expenditure of body reserves acquired during winter that would sustain the return trip to their natal colony.

AB  - Evaluating the impact of climate change on grassland productivity using grassland ecological models is of great significance for the sustainable use of grasslands. Based on meteorological, soil, and grassland data, this study employed the Grassland Ecosystem Model (CENTURY) to scrutinize the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of above-ground biomass (AGB) of grasslands in the northwest Sichuan Plateau (NWSP) and established a spatial distribution pattern of grassland vulnerability levels in the NWSP. Utilizing five on-site verification points, the CENTURY model worked well in simulating the AGB of grasslands in the NWSP and was suitable for investigating the impact of climate change on grassland productivity in the NWSP. Simulation outcomes revealed a zonal distribution pattern of the annual average AGB in grasslands across the NWSP, with the central region exhibiting higher levels surpassing 800 g m- 2. From 1961 to 2020, the AGB of grasslands showed a significant increase trend, with growth rates ranging from 14.2 to 25.9 g m- 2 & sdot;(10a)- 1. Overall, the northern and central regions of the NWSP experienced substantial climate impacts, coinciding with a marked increase in biomass. From 1961 to 2020, the overall vulnerability of grasslands in the NWSP was relatively low, with areas exhibiting moderate or lower vulnerability levels accounting for 83.8 %. The overall spatial distribution pattern showed low vulnerability in the north and central regions, and high vulnerability in the eastern and southwestern edges.

AB  - The spatial distribution of animals has consequences for nutrition, predator-prey dynamics, spread of diseases, and population dynamics in general. Animals must establish a home range to secure adequate resources to fuel their energy needs. Home ranges, therefore, are temporally and spatially dynamic, given the changing requirements of an animal and the availability of resources on the landscape. We used data from two populations of bighorn sheep with contrasting population dynamics following pneumonia epizootics and different habitat quality on their summer range to test the hypothesis that the distribution and size of home ranges are influenced by environmental conditions and reproductive status. We used a combination of data from 768 vegetation transects and remotely sensed metrics to index forage quality of consecutive biweekly home ranges for 27 bighorn sheep, June-August 2019-2021. There were population differences in home range dynamics that were consistent with resource limitations in the population declining in abundance. Animals in both populations increased the size of their home range through the summer in association with declining forage quality indexed by plant phenology. Furthermore, animals in the Whiskey Mountain population without offspring had home ranges more than twice the size of animals with offspring, whereas there were no differences in the home range size between animals with and without offspring in Jackson. We demonstrated that limitations young offspring impose on space use of a mother may have consequences for animals living where larger home ranges are needed to secure adequate resources-sheep on Whiskey Mountain had to travel 1000 m from escape terrain to access the same amount of biomass that the Jackson sheep could access directly adjacent to escape terrain. Forage quality and availability influence movement and space use. In the presence of disease, movement and space use may influence pathogen transmission and persistence. Thus, forage availability may play an indirect role in population dynamics in the presence of disease, which is another line of evidence for how environmental and nutritional conditions may influence population dynamics when coping with disease.

AB  - Spatial environmental heterogeneity in the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) is always mentioned but rarely quantified and included in the evaluation process. This study introduced the habitat suitability index evaluation model based on the Gini index (HSIgini) to evaluate the optimal ranges of suitable environmental factors for three typical estuarine gobies, i.e., Rhinogobius giurinus, Acentrogobius pflaumii, Odontamblyopus rubicundus, and their habitat quality. The evaluation was carried out based on field surveys conducted in the spring and summer of 2018-2020. The Lorentz curve and Gini index were used to evaluate the spatial environmental heterogeneities in the YRE. The spatial heterogeneity of environmental factors in the Yangtze Estuary ranged from 0.62 to 0.05, with the highest Gini index for salinity and the lowest for temperature. The combination of environmental factors had significant spatial effects on habitat, with temperature showing mainly seasonal effects. The study indicated that the YRE is a good habitat for gobies and that there is spatial and seasonal differentiation in the habitats of different species, greatly reducing interspecific competition. Environmental heterogeneity is important for biological processes and should be incorporated into the modeling of bio-environmental relationships in future research to provide a basis for environmental and biological conservation and management.

AB  - The La Venta fauna of Colombia (similar to 13.5-11.5 Ma) represents the most diverse Tertiary locality in the neotropics, with 75 mammal species and a highly non-analogue reptile assemblage containing at least seven testudines and six crocodyliforms. It has been widely hypothesized that the carnivore guilds of South American mammals throughout the Cenozoic were depauperate, potentially due to the continent's isolated history, and that, as a result, non-mammals acted as its dominant predators. Here we test this hypothesis using novel community composition analysis and a model of prey meat availability and competition between carnivorous taxa for prey in different size classes. We find that the carnivorous reptiles account for a very large proportion of demanded biomass, but that, even including reptiles, there was minimal competition for resources among the carnivore guild, relative to competition within modern communities. Further, we evaluate one possible impact of low predation pressure on the herbivores of La Venta through a population analysis of enamel hypoplasia in the notoungulate Pericotoxodon platignathus. At La Venta, mammalian carnivores alone exerted very little predation pressure on the terrestrial community, and our community composition analysis supports the filling of macro-predatory niches by crocodyliforms, including both the terrestrial sebecid Langstonia huilensis and semi-aquatic giant crocodylians.

AB  - Climate warming can influence interactions between plants and associated organisms by altering levels of plant secondary metabolites. In contrast to studies of elevated temperature on aboveground phytochemistry, the consequences of warming on root chemistry have received little attention. Herein, we investigated the effects of elevated temperature, defoliation, and genotype on root biomass and phenolic compounds in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides). We grew saplings of three aspen genotypes under ambient or elevated temperatures (+4-6 degrees C), and defoliated (by 75%) half of the trees in each treatment. After 4 months, we harvested roots and determined their condensed tannin and salicinoid (phenolic glycoside) concentrations. Defoliation reduced root biomass, with a slightly larger impact under elevated, relative to ambient, temperature. Elevated temperature decreased condensed tannin concentrations by 21-43% across the various treatment combinations. Warming alone did not alter salicinoid concentrations but eliminated a small negative impact of defoliation on those compounds. Graphical vector analysis suggests that effects of warming and defoliation on condensed tannins and salicinoids were predominantly due to reduced biosynthesis of these metabolites in roots, rather than to changes in root biomass. In general, genotypes did not differ in their responses to temperature or temperature by defoliation interactions. Collectively, our results suggest that future climate warming will alter root phytochemistry, and that effects will vary among different classes of secondary metabolites and be influenced by concurrent ecological interactions such as herbivory. Temperature- and herbivory-mediated changes in root chemistry have the potential to influence belowground trophic interactions and soil nutrient dynamics.

AB  - Adaptive management has emerged as the prevailing approach for combining environmental research and management to advance science and policy. Adaptive management, as originally formulated by Carl Walters in 1986, depends on the use of Bayesian models to provide a framework to accumulate knowledge. The emergence of ecological forecasting using the Bayesian framework has provided robust tools and supports a new approach to informing adaptive management, which can be particularly useful in developing policy for managing infectious disease in wildlife. We used the potential infection of elk populations with chronic wasting disease in the Jackson Valley of Wyoming and the National Elk Refuge as a model system to show how Bayesian forecasting can support adaptive management in anticipation of management challenges. The core of our approach resembles the sex- and age-structured, discrete time models used to support management decisions on elk harvest throughout western North America. Our model differs by including stages for CWD-infected and unaffected animals. We used data on population counts, sex and age classification, and CWD testing, as well as results from prior research, in a Bayesian statistical framework to predict model parameters and the number of animals in each age, sex, and disease stage over time. Initial forecasts suggested CWD may reach a mean prevalence in the population of 12%, but uncertainty in this forecast is large and we cannot rule out a mean forecasted prevalence as high as 20%. Using recruitment rates observed during the last two decades, the model predicted that a CWD prevalence of 7% in females would cause the population growth rate (lambda) to drop below 1, resulting in population declines even when female harvest was zero. The primary value of this ecological forecasting approach is to provide a framework to assimilate data with understanding of disease processes to enable continuous improvement in understanding the ecology of CWD and its management.

AB  - Inland salt marshes are recognized as habitats of unique and valuable vegetation at the European scale. There is still a lack of generalization regarding its vegetation syntaxonomy and environmental requirements, which is needed for its effective protection. To falsify our hypothesis about vegetation dependence on environmental requirements we aimed at descrip-tion of the syntaxonomical units present in temperate European inland salt marshes and identification of their main envi-ronmental drivers. In our work we focused on the vegetation from the northern part of temperate salt marshes to limit confusion related to the geographical ranges of species. We collected the database of 968 vegetation plots from different European countries and applied the Cocktail method to analyze the data. Based on results, expert knowledge, existing syntaxonomical classifications and information from the literature, we identified diagnostic, constant and dominant spe-cies for individual syntaxonomical units. Then, we compiled maps of the vegetation unit distribution, and identified the most important environmental factors for the analyzed vegetation using statistical and multivariate methods, including canonical variate analysis. We classified the analyzed vegetation into nine classes, including two typical for salt-marsh veg-etation - the Therosalicornietea and Festuco-Puccinellietea. Within these two classes, we distinguished two alliances and a total of five associations. The classes differ the most in terms of species preferences to salinity, soil moisture, light availabil-ity and soil nitrogen content. In addition salt marsh associations differ also by soil reaction and soil organic matter content. This provides direct implications for salt marsh sustainable management.

AB  - As an indigenous species on the Tibetan Plateau, the yak is well adapted to the plateau hypoxic environment. The high-altitude hypoxia adaptation of the yak requires the adaptive reshaping of multiple tissues and organs, especially the lungs. To reveal the adaptive development of yak lungs under hypoxic stress at the tissue and molecular levels, we conducted histomorphological observations as well as transcriptomic and metabolomic studies of yak lungs at three ages (0.5, 2.5, and 4.5 years). The results showed that the lung tissue developed significantly with age. The mean alveolar area was higher (p < 0.01) in 4.5 and 2.5-year-old yaks than in 0.5-year-old yaks. The percentage of elastic fibers, micro-arterial wall thickness, and micro-arterial area showed an increasing trend (p < 0.01) from 0.5-year-old yaks to 2.5-year-old yaks and then to 4.5-year-old yaks. In addition, some critical differentially expressed genes related to angiogenesis (MYC, EPHA2, TNF), fiber formation (EREG), smooth muscle proliferation (HBEGF), erythropoiesis (SOCS3), and hypoxia response (ZFP36) were identified. Some metabolites associated with these genes were also found simultaneously. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the molecular strategies underlying this species' extraordinary ability to survive normally in low-oxygen environments. In conclusion, the lungs of yaks undergo continuous adaptive development under hypoxic stress, and these findings are crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which native species of the Tibetan Plateau survive in harsh environments.

AB  - Complex ecological and human-influenced factors that are characteristic of chronic wasting disease (CWD) have created substantial and unique challenges for effective management in free-ranging cervids. We sought to summarize and characterize management experiences and actions from 30 U.S. states, 4 Canadian provinces, and 3 European countries that have direct experience with CWD. We surveyed wildlife agencies that had detected CWD in their free-ranging cervid population and collected information from journal articles, published reports, and agency webpages. We report management approaches and their apparent impacts by state, provincial, or national jurisdiction during 3 stages of response to CWD: 1) pre-detection, 2) initial response, and 3) altered response. Agencies took a proactive approach to CWD during the pre-detection phase; 12 of the 24 responding agencies had a weighted-surveillance program in place and 17 had regulations aimed at disease prevention. There was no apparent difference in initial apparent prevalence of CWD among agencies with weighted surveillance in place and those without, but complicating factors, such as differing sampling methods and sample size, were present. Agencies reported 5 common surveillance strategies, and first detections were primarily from sampling hunter-harvested deer. Bans or restrictions on interstate movement of carcasses or live animals and increased bag limits were common responses to the detection of CWD and were used by 83% and 78% of the 24 responding agencies, respectively. Similarly, adapted surveillance was a common response to CWD detection; 14 of the 24 agencies either initiated or adjusted their weighted surveillance program following detection. However, of the 20 U.S. states and 6 Canadian provinces that have not yet detected CWD, only 3 are currently applying weighted surveillance approaches to their CWD sampling efforts. As demonstrated by New York and Minnesota, localized eradication of CWD may be possible if it is detected in its emergent stage when there are few infected deer in an area. We found that 4 of the 20 U.S. states and 2 of the 6 Canadian provinces that have yet to detect CWD had a response plan available online. Further analyses to assess the impacts of various management approaches on the spatial and temporal trajectory of CWD prevalence requires more data collection and reporting, such as consistent and fine-scale surveillance in management and control areas. We recommend that agencies be proactive in public messaging of CWD response plans well before initial detection and that cervid managers dealing with CWD collaborate regularly with one another to share their variable and collective experiences. We also recommend that agencies provide detailed public reports on CWD responses, disease progression, and management outcomes.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat stress is a major factor in causing substantial losses to the livestock industry, due to its negative effects on milk production, fertility, health and welfare. As the second largest diary producing species, buffalo face challenges from heat stress. To explore the nutritional metabolic mechanism of rumen bacteria in buffalo under hot enviroments, this study used 16S rDNA technology and metabolome analysis to identify heat stress-related bacteria, metabolites and their pathways. Our findings showed that heat stress increased respiratory rate and skin temperature, and decreased rumen volatile fatty acids. The structures of rumen bacterial communities at different levels significantly changed and a total of 32 metabolites mainly involved in gluconeogenesis were altered due to heat stress. Overall, this study improves our understanding of ruminal bacterial and metabolic alterations of buffalo exposed to heat stress. Exposure to the stress (HS) negatively affects physiology, performance, reproduction and welfare of buffalo. However, the mechanisms by which HS negatively affects rumen bacteria and its associated metabolism in buffalo are not well known yet. This study aimed to gain insight into the adaption of bacteria and the complexity of the metabolome in the rumen of six buffalo during HS using 16S rDNA and gas chromatography metabolomics analyses. HS increased respiratory rate (p < 0.05) and skin temperature (p < 0.01), and it decreased the content of acetic acid (p < 0.05) and butyric acid (p < 0.05) in the rumen. Omics sequencing revealed that the relative abundances of Lachnospirales, Lachnospiraceae, Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group and Clostridia_UCG-014 were significantly (p < 0.01) higher under HS than non-heat stress conditions. Several bacteria at different levels, such as Lactobacillales, Streptococcus, Leuconostocaceae and Leissella, were significantly (p < 0.05) more abundant in the rumen of the non-heat stress than HS condition. Thirty-two significantly different metabolites closely related to HS were identified (p < 0.05). Metabolic pathway analysis revealed four key pathways: D-Alanine metabolism; Lysine degradation, Tropane; piperidine and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis; and Galactose metabolism. In summary, HS may negatively affected rumen fermentation efficiency and changed the composition of rumen community and metabolic function.

AB  - Invasive mammals represent a critical threat to island biodiversity; eradications can result in ecological restoration yet may fail in the absence of key population parameters. Over-browsing by invasive Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) is causing severe ecological and cultural impacts across the Haida Gwaii archipelago (Canada). Previous eradication attempts demonstrate forest regeneration upon deer removal, but reinvasion reverses conservation gains. Here we use restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (12,947 SNPs) to investigate connectivity and gene flow of invasive deer (n = 181) across 15 islands, revealing little structure throughout Haida Gwaii and identifying the large, central island of Moresby (>2600 km(2)) as the greatest source of migrants. As a result, the archipelago itself should be considered the primary eradication unit, with the exception of geographically isolated islands like SGang Gwaay. Thus, limiting eradications to isolated islands combined with controlled culling and enhanced biosecurity may be the most effective strategies for achieving ecological restoration goals.
   Genomic data presented in this study provide clues about why previous attempts to eradicate the invasive Sitka black-tailed deer from the Haida Gwaii archipelago in Canada have been incomplete. The authors find substantial gene flow between islands, with the exception of the remote island of SGang Gwaay, which they argue is a viable option for near-term eradication efforts.

AB  - 'Mushy halibut syndrome' (MHS) is associated with inferior fillet quality in Greenland halibut and is reported to occur in commercial catches across the North Atlantic. MHS constitutes a quality issue in fisheries and leads to economic losses and food wastage. Despite the known challenges associated with MHS, quantitative data on product properties are lacking, and yet they are crucial to assess actual losses and value-adding processing potential. As part of a larger effort to document and characterize MHS in Greenland halibut, we investigated how thaw drip loss (TDL), cooked drip loss (CDL), cooked yield, and tissue compressibility and elasticity differ between normal and 'mushy' halibut fillets. The fillets were sorted into three categories: normal, intermediate MHS, and severe MHS. The mean TDL and CDL increased more than three-fold in both MHS categories compared to normal fillets, while cooked yield decreased by approximately 20%. Fillets severely affected by MHS demonstrated high tissue compressibility (56%) and poor elasticity (46%), while the elasticity of the fillets belonging to the intermediate MHS category did not differ significantly from that of normal ones. These findings provide new insights into the product attributes of fillets affected by MHS, which are important for developing utilization and valorization strategies.

AB  - Evaluating temporal trends in habitat and behavioral responses is critical for conservation, yet long-term monitoring studies are rare. We used a 35-year dataset (1982-2017) to assess multiscale habitat use and selection by an endangered carnivore, the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), in South Texas, USA. We used a time series of remotely sensed imagery to map changes in availability of woody cover, habitat critical to ocelots that has diminished due to anthropogenic development and increased road infrastructure. Our objectives were to characterize habitat relationships, predict high-quality habitat, and assess behavior with changing environmental conditions. We fit functional response (third order) and individual-specific resource selection (second order) functions to assess multiscale habitat use of vegetation cover and roads. Within home ranges, ocelots used woody cover greater than availability. Ocelots used areas near roads in proportion to availability, with minor exceptions. We observed changes in habitat use by ocelots across time with higher proportions of woody and non-woody cover used in later time periods. Average availability of woody cover decreased in the study area between the 1980s and 2010s (0.44 in 1985 to 0.39 in 2015, p < 0.001), and ocelots used areas with a higher proportion of woody cover (>= 0.48) farther from high-traffic roads compared to availability. High-quality ocelot habitat was consistently predicted in areas with high proportions of woody cover, while areas closer to high-traffic roads were consistently predicted as non-habitat. The extent of predicted habitat never exceeded 47% (1515 km(2)) of the study area, illustrating the confined nature of ocelot habitat. Our assessment of multiscale habitat use demonstrated that higher order selection processes likely truncate resource gradients within home ranges. Ocelots did not avoid roads as expected within home ranges, which is a likely mechanism for vehicle-induced mortality. Private lands contained >= 79% of predicted high-quality habitat over time. Therefore, the future of ocelots in the United States relies on private land stewardship. Insights gained from these analyses can advance habitat conservation and mitigation of road mortality for ocelot populations.

AB  - Simple Summary Commercial orchards are amongst the most intensively sprayed crops, and alternative methods have to be found to replace pesticides. Limiting water and nitrogen (N) supply has shown to be effective in reducing aphid infestations under controlled conditions. To evaluate how far these techniques could be transferred to orchards subject to production constraints, an experiment was performed in a commercial orchard planted with two varieties differing in precocity and vigour. Limiting supplies of both water and N to trees was shown to reduce the severity of aphid infestation (green peach aphid, mealy plum aphid, and leaf curl aphid), although reducing only water supply was less effective. At shoot level, the composition and development of the infested shoots were only slightly affected by treatment, thereby indicating that aphids colonize shoots of similar condition, whose numbers are modulated by nutrition treatments. These results were consistent with variety and year. Limiting water and N supplies contributes not only to the control of aphid infestations, but also reduces nitrate leaching and the use of water, the consumption of which will inevitably need to a decrease due to climate change. However, the efficiency of aphid control could be enhanced by complementing these practices by other techniques such as adapted pruning or changes to ground cover. Peach orchards are intensively sprayed crops, and alternative methods must be found to replace pesticides. We intend here to evaluate if limiting water and nitrogen (N) supply could be effective in controlling aphid infestation in commercial orchards. N and water supply were therefore either unrestricted or restricted by 30% only for water, or for both water and N, in 2018 and 2019 on trees of two contrasting varieties. Natural infestations (green peach aphid, mealy plum aphid, leaf curl aphid) were monitored regularly at tree and shoot level. Infested and control shoots were compared for their development during the infestation period, their apex concentrations of total N, amino acids, non-structural carbohydrates, and polyphenols at infestation peak. At tree level, limiting both water and N supplies decreased the proportion of infested shoots by 30%, and the number of trees hosting the most harmful specie by 20 to 50%. Limiting only N supplies had almost no effect on infestation severity. At shoot level, the apex N concentration of infested shoots was stable (around 3.2% dry weight) and was found to be independent of treatment, variety, and year. The remaining biochemical variables were not affected by infestation status but by variety and year. Shoot development was only slightly affected by treatment. Aphids colonized the most vigorous shoots, being those with longer apical ramifications in 2018 and higher growth rates in 2019, in comparison with the controls. The differences were, respectively, 40 and 55%. It was concluded that a double restriction in water and N could limit, but not control, aphid infestations in commercial orchards.

AB  - Monitoring the local abundance of wild species is a priority for policy and management. The Living Planet Index (LPI) tracks global trends in the relative abundance of monitored wild vertebrates. However, barring a few exceptions, the LPI's uptake at the national level has been limited. Prominent critiques have not helped the perception that the LPI and its underlying database are inadequate for national application. After developing a national LPI for South Africa, we assert that the process of developing the index is valuable and information-rich, even if the resulting indicator itself is likely of limited accuracy. Specifically, we first calculated three versions of the LPI by applying different weightings to account for taxonomic biases. This demonstrated how incomplete and biased data clouded our ability to determine abundance trends accurately. Next, we recalculated the LPI after supplementing the global database with high-quality information from a long-term aerial census of mammal herbivores. Adding these high-quality time-series had little effect on the LPI, suggesting that the index is less sensitive to the quality of time-series for well-studied taxa than to additional information from poorly studied taxonomic groups. The uncertainties around the South African LPI preclude any confident statements about the average trends in abundance, yet they shine a bright spotlight on knowledge gaps that should be the focus of prioritized monitoring. Therefore, we advocate for other countries to develop their own national LPIs, which are valuable indicators of the state of knowledge (or ignorance) on the abundance of wild species.

AB  - Acoustic individuality is present in diverse taxa of mammals and birds, becoming especially prominent in those age groups for which discriminating conspecifics by voice is critically important. This study compares, for the first time, the ontogenetic changes of acoustic individuality of ultrasonic and audible calls (USVs and AUDs) across 12 age-classes (from neonates to adults) in captive yellow steppe lemmings Eolagurus luteus. We found that, in this rodent species, the isolation-induced USVs and AUDs are not individually distinct at any age. We discuss that this result is unusual, because discriminating individuals by individualistic vocal traits may be important for such a social species as yellow steppe lemming. We also discuss the potential role of acoustic individuality in studies including rodent models.

AB  - Outside of Rancho La Brea, southern California, United States, knowledge of the life history, ecology, and extinction of large, late Pleistocene carnivores in North America is frustrated by a scarcity of skeletal material and trustworthy radiocarbon dates. A complete Smilodon fatalis (sabertooth cat) cranium from southwestern Iowa, directly AMS radiocarbon dated to 11,685 +/- 40 B.P. (13,605-13,455 cal B.P.), repre-sents an important addition to the inventory of evidence for the taxon in the Midcontinent. Assessment of tooth eruption and wear combined with metric and nonmetric comparisons with coeval crania from Pit 61/67 at Rancho La Brea indicates the specimen belongs to a subadult male 2-3 years of age at death. Craniodental morphology falls within the range of variation in the Pit 61/67 males. Predicted live weight is 251 kg. One C1 has an antemortem bend fracture, and the absence of use-wear on the proximal remnant suggests death ensued within days of the injury. The radiocarbon date centers the animal in the Bolling-Allerod Chronozone (14,640-12,845 cal B.P.). Whereas regional conditions were generally warmer and wetter during this period, southwestern Iowa was a cool, dry non-analog boreal grassland/ parkland that supported a diverse, large herbivore community, including Megalonyx jeffersonii (Jeffer-son's ground sloth), the taxon tentatively identified in this study as the focal prey. Bayesian modeling of 72 direct radiocarbon dates for the taxon suggests extinction of the late Quaternary Smilodon was a hemispheric and geologically synchronic phenomenon that occurred after 13,285 cal B.P.

AB  - The change in species richness along elevational gradients is a well-known pattern in nature. Niche theory predicts that increasing species richness in assemblages can either lead to denser packing of niche space ('niche packing') or an expansion into its novel regions ('niche expansion'). Traditionally, these scenarios have been studied using functional traits but stable isotopes provide advantages such as identifying the degree of resource specialisation, or niche partitioning among functionally similar species. In this study, we evaluate the relevance of niche packing versus niche expansion by investigating stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic niche width and overlap among 23 bat species from six functional groups across a 1500 m elevational gradient in the Himalaya. Our results suggest that an increase in species richness in the low elevation is accompanied by small niche width with high overlap, whereas the high elevation assemblage shows large niche width with low overlap among functional group members. At the functional group level, edge-space foraging, trawling, and active gleaning bats have the highest niche width while passive gleaning bats that are only found in high elevations are isotopic specialists showing low overlap with other groups. Edge and open-space foraging bats showed idiosyncratic changes in niche width across elevations. We also find that the niches of rhinolophid bats overlap with edge-space and open-space foraging bats despite their unique functional traits. These results support the idea that at low elevations high species richness is associated with niche packing while at high elevations strong niche partitioning prevails in dynamic and resource-poor environments. We conclude that although high elevation animal assemblages are often 'functionally underdispersed', that is show homogenous functional traits, our approach based on stable isotopes demonstrates niche partitioning among such functionally similar species.

AB  - Simple Summary The inbreeding coefficient is relevant for managing livestock and safeguarding biodiversity, especially in small populations. Small ruminant breeders mainly rely on pedigree information, but genomics is increasingly gaining ground as a tool to face possible pedigree inaccuracies. This study investigates pedigree-based (F-PED) and genomic (F-ROH and F-GRM) inbreeding in a representative number of Italian sheep and goat populations. Indeed, even though it has been widely studied in cattle, there is still little knowledge about the relationship between these coefficients in small ruminants, which are characterized by a different population structure, often with unconnected farms. Mean inbreeding values were low, F-ROH being the highest, with breed differences due to different managements; the correlation between F-PED and F-ROH was the strongest and directly related to pedigree depth. Moreover, we estimated F-PED from F-ROH using a linear regression model. Since massive genotyping is not affordable to small ruminant breeders, it is important to understand the distinction and relationship between differently calculated inbreeding coefficients, also in view of the introduction of genomic enhanced breeding values. Our study highlights the importance of accurate pedigree information and, especially if not obtainable, of genotyping animals. Correct data contribute to mitigate inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability. The inbreeding coefficient is an important parameter for livestock management. Small ruminant breeders and associations mainly rely on pedigree information, but genomic tools are gaining relevance, overcoming possible pedigree inconsistencies. This study investigates the relationship between pedigree-based and genomic inbreeding in two goat and four sheep dairy breeds. Pedigree and genomic data (medium-density SNPchip) were obtained for 3107 goats and 2511 sheep. We estimated pedigree depth (number of fully traced generations, FullGen) and inbreeding (F-PED), as well as two genomic inbreeding indexes, using runs of the homozygosity (F-ROH) and genomic relationship matrix (F-GRM). The correlation between the inbreeding coefficients was assessed. A linear regression model (LRM) was fitted for estimating F-PED from F-ROH. After quality control on genomic data, we retained 5085 animals. Mean inbreeding values were low, with higher F-ROH than F-PED and F-GRM. Breed differences can partially depend on different managements. The correlation between F-PED and F-ROH was the highest and directly related to pedigree depth. The best LRM was chosen for FullGen >= 4 and >= 6 for goats and sheep, respectively; after excluding animals with extreme residuals, a new refined regression equation was calculated. Since massive genotyping is not affordable to small ruminant breeders, it is important to understand the distinction and relationship between differently calculated inbreeding coefficients, also in view of the introduction of genomic enhanced breeding values. Our study highlights the importance of accurate pedigree information and, especially if not obtainable, of calculating genomic-based inbreeding coefficients. A better estimation of animals' relatedness contributes to improve animal breeding and conservation.

AB  - The objective of the study was to examine the effect of rumen protected methionine supplementation on milk production and its composition in lactating Nili-Ravi buffaloes. Sixteen early lactating nili-ravi buffaloes were divided into four groups according to Randomized Complete Block Design for this study. Four experimental diets were formulated supplementing 0, 15, 25 and 35g of methionine/ animal/ day. The experimental period was of 56 days out of which 10 days were as adaptation period. Daily feed intake and morning-evening milk yield of each animal was recorded. Body weight of the animals was recorded at the start of experiment and fortnightly thereafter. Total collection of urine and feces were performed fortnightly to determine nutrient digestion and nitrogen balance. Blood samples were collected through jugular vein two hours post feeding and were analysed for blood triglycerides concentration, total proteins and blood urea nitrogen according to standard procedures. Nutrient intake, nutrient digestion, nitrogen balance, milk production, milk fat, total solids in milk and solid not fat did not show any treatment effect. However, milk protein percentage was the highest (3.42% and 3.41%) in buffaloes fed diets containing 35 and 25 g/d methionine followed by (3.26% and 3.17%) those fed 15 g of methionine and control diets, respectively. Milk protein percentage was found to be sensitive to methionine supplementation, because increase in milk protein percentage was observed just after first week of supplementation. Similarly, blood urea nitrogen, triglycerides and total proteins were significantly affected by methionine supplementation. Blood urea nitrogen was lower in buffaloes fed ration containing higher level of methionine. The highest triglycerides (15.40 mg/dl) were observed in buffaloes fed ration containing higher amount of methionine as compared to those fed rations containing lower amount of methionine. Total protein was also higher (8.27 g/dl) in animals fed ration containing higher level of methionine while it was similar in supplementation groups. Although the results were comparatively better when buffaloes were raised on supplemented ratios but due to shorter study period and use of well-fed and healthy animals (not deficient in methionine) the results of the lactation performance were not very obvious as were expected.

AB  - Recreational hunting can have positive consequences on biodiversity conservation, but in many countries the number of hunters is declining. This downward trend threatens the sustainability of an important human activity that can be used as a tool for wildlife management and biodiversity conservation. On the other hand, in developed countries there is an upward trend in the number of female hunters. In this study, we analyzed women and men's hunting preferences in Spain, focusing our attention on the game species they were interested in. We found that female hunters were more interested than male hunters in hunting big game species. We discussed potential consequences of our results on the sustainability of hunting and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The study was aimed to investigate the effects of soil contamination and root herbivory on root surface area and stem anatomical properties that affect water conductivity in young common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) plants. Beech seedlings were planted for one growing season into pots filled with contaminated (Pb, Zn, and Cd) and uncontaminated soil in a free-air mesocosm experiment. In autumn, root herbivores summer chafer larvae (Amphimallon solstitialis L.) were added into half of pots with contaminated and uncontaminated soil and left for 3 months. After destructive sampling, roots were measured for root surface area and stem sections were prepared and observed under the microscope. Ring width, vessel density, conductive area, potential conductivity, vessel grouping indexes, and vessel diameters were measured. In contaminated soil, root surface area, mean ring width, vessel radial diameter, and potential stem conductivity were significantly reduced compared to uncontaminated soil (by - 61.7, - 75.9, - 20.5, and - 78.8%, respectively), while vessel density, vessel grouping index, and mean group size of grouped cells were significantly increased (by + 38.7, + 15.8, and + 21.2%, respectively). Soil contamination induced stem anatomical changes similar to drought stress. Late exposure to root herbivory was insufficient to induce significant changes in root surface area or stem anatomy.

AB  - The fate of carbon while passing through the rocky subseafloor of the ocean has direct implications on the global carbon cycle now and over geologic time, as well as the abundance and distribution of subseafloor life. Many organic geochemical studies require larger volumes of fluids than traditional hydrothermal samplers can provide, and also require rigorous steps to be taken to prevent contamination. The Hydrothermal Organic Geochemistry (HOG) sampler is designed to collect large volume (2-9 L) fluid samples with minimal introduction of organic or microbial contamination, and to be powered and deployed in real time from a submersible. Additional design constraints include utilizing materials appropriate for sampling fluids with elevated temperatures, fitting the sampler into the space available on the submersible, and minimizing the time needed to remove samples and prepare the sampler for re-deployment between dives. It utilizes two inlets, one devoted to natural abundance geochemistry and one that can be used for samples pre-dosed with isotopic labels or preservatives. Temperature probes providing real-time data are incorporated into each inlet to facilitate positioning the intake in areas of the hottest fluid flow, thereby minimizing entrainment of ambient bottom seawater while sampling. Fluids are shunted through two main conduits by a large volume pump. Smaller ports stemming off the main conduit connect to positive displacement fluid sample chambers and in situ filters. The outlets of these chambers and filter holders are connected to a 24-port valve, which in turn is connected to a small volume pump. The HOG sampler has successfully collected over 100 high purity fluid samples and 50 in situ filters during two expeditions to deep sea hydrothermal fields.

AB  - Due to vast area comprising multiple ecological zones, rippling and tough topography and climatic conditions, presence-only methods cannot contrast wildlife forecasts with the environmental settings of high mountain national parks in the Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalayan region of northern Pakistan. This study develops GIS maps by incorporating eight environmental and anthropogenic factors, GIS-based AHP and overlay weight analysis techniques to estimate habitat suitability of seven high-altitude national parks' territories (similar to 20,000 km(2)) and the likelihood of presence of the wildlife species. The map shows that within the range of all seven national park territories, 59% or 12,016 km(2), 3% similar to 700 km(2), 30% or similar to 7000 km(2) and 7% or similar to 1456 km(2) lie in suitability zone 'unsuitable', 'marginal suitable', 'Suitable' and 'Optimal', respectively. Relatively 'suitable' or 'optimal' territories are concentrated in four parks occupying (7255 km(2)) within the Karakoram Range. Habitat suitability of territories occupied by the highly glaciered Khunjerab and Central Karakoram national parks is exceptionally high while smaller parks like Chitral Gol and Broghil lie in the Hindu Kush region and Deosai plains in the Himalayan region have lower suitable habitat and higher level of exposure to human disturbances. This study opined that distribution of suitable and unsuitable territories of national parks is not uniform but differs and is dependent on the each park's environmental and anthropogenic settings. The uneven distribution itself is suitable for different types of wildlife species as they do not typically use identical habitat features in the northern mountains.

AB  - Sexually selected traits show large variation and rapid evolution across the animal kingdom, yet genetic variation often persists within populations despite apparent directional selection. A key step in solving this long-standing paradox is to determine the genetic architecture of sexually selected traits to understand evolutionary drivers and constraints at the genomic level. Antlers are a form of sexual weaponry in male red deer (Cervus elaphus). On the island of Rum, Scotland, males with larger antlers have increased breeding success, yet there has been no evidence of any response to selection at the genetic level. To try and understand the mechanisms underlying this observation, we investigate the genetic architecture of ten antler traits and their principal components using genomic data from >38,000 SNPs. We estimate the heritabilities and genetic correlations of the antler traits using a genomic relatedness approach. We then use genome-wide association and haplotype-based regional heritability to identify regions of the genome underlying antler morphology, and an empirical Bayes approach to estimate the underlying distributions of allele effect sizes. We show that antler morphology is highly repeatable over an individual's lifetime, heritable and has a polygenic architecture and that almost all antler traits are positively genetically correlated with some loci identified as having pleiotropic effects. Our findings suggest that a large mutational target and genetic covariances among antler traits, in part maintained by pleiotropy, are likely to contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in antler morphology in this population.

AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides subsp. turkestanica is mainly distributed in the mountains, valleys, and desert edges of Central Asia. It plays a vital role in maintaining ecological stability in arid and semiarid areas. In this study, the MaxEnt model was used to simulate the habitat suitability of H. rhamnoides subsp. turkestanica, and the key environmental factors affecting its distribution were identified. Additionally, we explored habitat sensitivity to climate change, and provided essential information for the conservation and management of this important subspecies in arid and semiarid regions. Under four different climate scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585) in 2040, 2060, 2080, and 2100, the prediction of habitat suitability and changes in species distribution centroids in the future were simulated. The results revealed that suitable habitats for H. rhamnoides subsp. turkestanica are primarily located in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Altitude (Alt), isothermality (bio3), and slope (Slo) emerged as the main environmental factors. Projections suggest a significant expansion in the total area of suitable habitat under future climate scenarios. By 2100, the suitable habitat areas under the SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585 scenarios will reach 10,526,800 km2, 12,930,200 km2, 15,449,900 km2 and 14,504,800 km2, respectively. In addition, a slight northwestward shift was observed in the distribution centroid. These findings provide important insights for conservation efforts aimed at protecting H. rhamnoides subsp. turkestanica and supporting its biodiversity. By understanding the factors affecting habitat suitability and predicting changes in climate scenarios, this study provides valuable guidance for developing long-term conservation strategies.

AB  - In arid regions, the use of ridge cover as a traditional agricultural strategy has been effective in mitigating soil wind erosion. However, few studies have focused on the sand transport characteristics of different micro-ridge spacings and heights. This study aimed to identify the mechanism by which ridges change the near-surface sand transport. In a controlled wind tunnel environment, the aeolian sand flux structure and sand transport flux (qz) at heights from 0 to 0.7 m were measured. The results showed that, compared with no ridges, ridge covering could significantly modify the structure of aeolian sand flux near the surface, yielding a substantial reduction in the proportion of sand transport to the total sand transport in the 0- to 0.1-m height layer. In the absence of ridges, blown sand was mainly concentrated in the 0- to 0.1-m height layer, and qz decreased exponentially as the height increased. With various micro-ridge spacings and heights, when H was less than 0.1 m and L was more than 15H, the blown sand also remained concentrated in the 0- to 0.1-m height layer, and qz decreased exponentially as the height increased. When H increased to 0.15 m from 0.1 m and L decreased from 15H to 5H, the height of the blown sand was concentrated in the 0.3- to 0.4-m layer. The blown sand layer of most ridge structures was concentrated at a height of 0.1-0.4 m, and the structure of the aeolian sand flux resembled an 'elephant nose effect'. The total sand transport rate of all ridge structures was significantly lower than that with no ridges, indicating that a reasonable ridge structure can effectively prevent wind erosion.
   The results confirmed that the variation of sand transport flux with height could be divided into two cases: one shows that sand transport flux decreases exponentially with increase of height; whereas, the other shows that sand transport flux increases with increase of height below critical height and decreases exponentially with the increasing of height above critical height, known as 'elephant nose effect'. These results help to further recognizing the process and mechanism of wind erosion in ridge farmland. image

AB  - Ecological communities globally are shifting to degraded states, motivating research into attributes supporting resilience or leading to alternative stable states. Coral reef communities are particularly vulnerable as they are facing myriad anthropogenic impacts that contribute to shifts away from coral dominance, motivating much research on whether these shifts are gradual and reversible transitions versus alternative stable states. Empirical studies demonstrate functionally-diverse herbivorous fish communities support coral reef resilience to anthropogenic impacts. However, few coral reef models incorporate herbivore and algal functional groups and quantify their effects on reef resilience and alternative stable states. We built a coral reef model that includes herbivorous fish functional groups and their algal targets and explored how this expansion affects predictions of resilience and alternative stable states under different scenarios of human impacts. We found evenness across the functional groups of herbivores is increasingly important for reef recovery as fishing pressure increases, and recovery is promoted when algal communities begin with more turf than macroalgae. Our findings also highlight that models omitting functional groups that comprise real communities will miss crucial phenomena, such as loss of alternative stable states for browser-dominated communities, or continued presence of alternative stable states in grazer-dominated communities even when fishing pressure is removed entirely. This work advances our ability to understand and predict coral reef resilience and alternative stable states in the Anthropocene, and provides guidance for conservation policy on fishing practices.

AB  - The increasing interest in agroecological practices and the current consideration of agrarian soils as a sustainable resource are driving the development of new strategies to manage soil parasites and diseases. The application of organic matter from different sources to reduce plant parasites contributes to circular economy by applying by-products as soil organic amendments that reduce wastes. Wine vinasse (WV) is a by-product generated to obtain alcohol from wine by physical methods in distilleries. The aim of this study was to determine the potential of WV and its combination with animal manure (WV+M) as soil biodisinfestation products. For this, it was compared with a plastic-covered control to distinguish the biodisinfestation from solarisation effect. The crops tested consisted of a tomato-Swiss chard rotation under glasshouse conditions. Their effects on Meloidogyne incognita, soil fertility. nematode community and crop yield were assessed. The results obtained after two seasons showed a reduction of M. incognita galling in the root system of both crops. The immediate effect after the treatment application was a reduction in the abundance of nematodes and changes in the nematode-based indices that affected all plots, including the control, most likely related to the tillage effect for the treatments application and the plastic cover. Soil fertility was improved by the application of WV (NO3-, Bioay. P) and WVA-M (C, N-total, K), which reduced herbivore nematode metabolic footprints and enhanced bacterivore footprints. Our results indicate that the combination WV+M was effective reducing M. incognita infection, and improved crop yield. Use of by-products such as WV is a helpful tool for managing horticultural soils.

AB  - Several studies have analyzed perceptions of adults regarding human-elephant conflict, but only a few have considered children as stakeholders. This research note attempted to understand young stakeholder perspectives about elephants for the purpose of proposing appropriate and contextual tools of conservation education and favorable human-elephant interactions. The study employed a draw-and-write method with 47 teenaged children from villages near a migratory corridor in the Balasore district of Odisha state in India. Through content analysis of the artworks, several references to negative interactions between humans and elephants (e.g., elephants raiding crops, damaging houses, and breaking trees; elephants and humans inflicting injuries on each other), vulnerability indicators, and community responses were noticed. The gender of participants also emerged as a significant factor in the production of different perceptions. Elephant tuskers engaging in hostile activities and people chasing elephants were mostly depicted by boys, whereas girls illustrated people watching helplessly or guarding property.

AB  - Background Manures and synthetic fertilisers can affect soil pH and plant-microbe processes and thus influence P forms and composition. Aims The objective of this study was to examine the effects of the 40-year application of synthetic fertilisers or pig manure combined with synthetic fertilisers on the P forms and composition and the response of corn growth and yield to changes in P availability. Methods A long-term field experiment with unfertilised, urea, urea+superphosphate, pig manure+urea and pig manure+urea+superphosphate fertilised soils was studied. P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to quantify P compounds. Results The maximum corn yield was found when adding pig manure+urea, despite Olsen-P was lower than on adding manure+superphosphate. Other monoester P compounds, typically related to microbial biomass and processes were highest on adding pig manure+urea. When adding superphosphate+urea+pig manure a reduction of these P compounds was observed as well as the highest accumulation of inositol hexakisphosphate (IHP). Synthetic fertilisers increased Olsen-P, orthophosphate and other monoester and total IHP and largely decreased soil pH. The addition of pig manure greatly increased the stereoisomers of IHP (myo-IHP, scyllo-IHP, neo-IHP, and D-chiro-IHP) and the concentration of orthophosphate diesters. D-chiro-IHP was not found in unfertilised soils while neo-IHP was not detected in synthetically fertilised soils. Conclusions P compounds related to microbial processes, such as other monoester, increased when adding pig manure. Additions of superphosphate on top of manures reduced other monoester, while they increased on adding synthetic fertilisers alone. Unfertilised soils were virtually free of P compounds related to microbial processes.

AB  - Simple Summary Alpacas are a species of great importance in the Andean Plateau, however, there are not enough studies evaluating their energy metabolism and greenhouse gas emissions. Considering this, an indirect calorimetry system (head hood) was developed to measure these components. Overall, the proposed respiration system performed well in terms of both accuracy and reliability of measurements. Results from the validation study confirmed that alpacas have a lower metabolic basal rate and therefore lower energy requirements for maintenance than other small ruminants. Peru has the largest inventory of alpacas worldwide. Despite their importance as a source of net income for rural communities living at the Andean Plateau, data on energy requirements and methane (CH4) emissions for alpacas are particularly lacking. In 2019, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; 2006, and Refinement 2019) outlined methods for estimating CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation and no methane (CH4) conversion factors were reported for camelids. IPCC has since updated its guidelines for estimating CH4 emissions from the enteric fermentation of livestock at a national scale. For greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory purposes, conversion factors were developed for ruminants but not for domestic South American camelids (SAC), with this category including alpacas. A mobile open-circuit respirometry system (head hood) for the rapid determination of CH4 and CO2 production, O-2 consumption, and thereafter, heat production (HP) for camelids was built and validated. In addition, an experimental test with eight alpacas was conducted for validation purposes. The average HP measured by indirect calorimetry (respiratory quotient (RQ) method) was close to the average HP determined from the carbon-nitrogen balance (CN method); 402 kJ/kg BW0.75 and 398 kJ/kg BW0.75, respectively. Fasting HP was determined by the RQ method and 250 kJ/kg BW0.75 was obtained. The metabolizable energy requirement for maintenance (MEm) was calculated to be 323 kJ/kg BW0.75 with an efficiency of energy utilization of 77%. When intake was adjusted to zero energy retention by linear regression, the MEm requirement increased to 369 kJ/kg BW0.75 and the efficiency decreased up to 68%. The CH4 conversion factor (Y-m) was 5.5% on average. Further research is required to gain a better understanding of the energy requirements and CH4 emissions of alpacas in conditions of the Andean Plateau and to quantify them with greater accuracy.

AB  - Negative density dependence (NDD) in biotic interactions of interference such as plant-plant competition, granivory and herbivory are well-documented mechanisms that promote species' coexistence in diverse plant communities worldwide. Here, we investigated the generality of a novel type of NDD mechanism that operates through the mutualistic interactions of frugivory and seed dispersal among fruit-eating birds and plants. By sampling community-wide frugivory interactions at high spatial and temporal resolution in Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Peru, Brazil and Argentina, we evaluated whether interaction frequencies between birds and fruit resources occurred more often (selection), as expected, or below expectations (under-utilization) set by the relative fruit abundance of the fruit resources of each plant species. Our models considered the influence of temporal scales of fruit availability and bird phylogeny and diets, revealing that NDD characterizes frugivory across communities. Irrespective of taxa or dietary guild, birds tended to select fruits of plant species that were proportionally rare in their communities, or that became rare following phenological fluctuations, while they mostly under-utilized abundant fruit resources. Our results demonstrate that negative density-dependence in frugivore-plant interactions provides a strong equalizing mechanism for the dispersal processes of fleshy-fruited plant species in temperate and tropical communities, likely contributing to building and sustaining plant diversity.This article is part of the theme issue 'Diversitydependence of dispersal: interspecific interactions determine spatial dynamics'.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to establish whether the addition of L-carnitine (LC), which ex-hibits antioxidant activity, to the freezing extender improves the quality of cryopreserved Okinawan native Agu pig sperm. Ejaculated sperm frozen in an extender supplemented with 0, 1, 2.5, or 5 mM LC was thawed, and the integrities of mitochondria and the plasmalemma and other sperm characteristics were evaluated. The treatment with different concentrations of LC effectively improved sperm motility, mitochondrial and plasmalemmal integrities, and the proteolytic activity of acrosomal contents after freeze-thawing (P < 0.05). The proportion of post-thaw sperm possessing intact mitochondria and plasmalemma and higher proteolytic activity of acrosomal contents was markedly higher among sperm frozen in the presence of 2.5 mM LC than among sperm frozen in the extender without LC (P < 0.05). Furthermore, although the addition of LC to the freezing extender had no effect on disturbance of DNA damage and caspase activity, sperm treated with 2.5 mM LC during freezing exhibited significantly higher penetrability into matured oocytes in vitro than untreated sperm. Collectively, these results indicate that the addition of LC to the freezing extender effectively improved the post-thaw quality of Agu pig sperm by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction caused by oxidative stress during cryopreservation.(c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Generalist herbivores are thought to prefer consuming combinations of plant toxins over singular toxins. This might not always be the case. In this study, we show that, when making foraging decisions, African elephants did not consistently prefer the odors of combinations of plant toxins compared to single toxins (i.e., monoterpenes). This suggests that the composition and diversity of volatile toxins in plants likely determine the effectiveness of odor-based chemical defenses against generalist herbivores.
   The detoxification limitation hypothesis posits that, unless plant defense compounds interact synergistically or additively to increase their harmful effects, generalist herbivores will prefer consuming combinations of these compounds more than singular compounds. Monoterpenes are odoriferous defense compounds that may be toxic to mammalian herbivores when ingested in sufficient quantities. Previous research has shown that the addition of individual monoterpenes to food sources reduces consumption by generalist mammalian herbivores. By using African elephants as a case study, we aimed to determine whether odors from monoterpene combinations (i.e., two or more monoterpenes) also deter generalist mammalian herbivory, and whether generalist herbivores prefer the odors of monoterpene combinations more than individual monoterpenes. First, we tested whether the odor of monoterpene combinations that resemble the monoterpene profiles of a high-acceptability, intermediate-acceptability, and low-acceptability plant deter herbivory. We found that elephants preferred plants without the added odors of the monoterpene combinations. Second, we explored how elephants responded to individual monoterpenes found within the combinations compared with the combinations at the same set concentration, and found that the elephants did not always prefer the combinations more than the individual monoterpenes. Moreover, the more diverse the combination, the less frequently it was preferred when compared with the individual monoterpene odors. Our results imply that generalist herbivores do not necessarily prefer combinations of plant chemical defenses at comparatively lower concentrations and that, consequently, the composition and diversity of monoterpene profiles in plants likely determine the efficacy of these compounds as an olfactory defense against mammalian herbivory.

AB  - India hosts multiple global biodiversity hotspots while being one of the most populous countries in the world. Here, we examine how well India has protected its avifauna, based on the fraction of their ranges falling within "protected areas." India has protected 5% of its land this way. The issue is whether India has done better than expected in protecting its threatened species. To this end, we assessed 99 Near Threatened, Threatened, and small-ranged species by estimating their Area of Habitat (AOH). We refined published species ranges using secondary information on elevation limits and habitat preferences. More than half (52) of the species assessed have their AOH <30% of their published ranges, while 31 have <10%. India has protected 87 threatened species' AOH more than expected (>5%), and for 33 species, the proportion protected exceeds the Aichi target (>17%). When we consider the top 10% richest regions as hotspots, only 9.2% of their total area falls under India's protected area network, inadequately covering areas with most threatened birds. We also discuss the conservation concerns for grassland and open habitat species across India, since we find that substantial proportions of their AOHs fall outside protected areas. This result highlights the significance of alternative conservation models, including other effective area-based conservation measures. We show that species' AOH provides a more realistic well-informed range that can aid in assessing their protection status.

KW  - HISTORY
AB  - Ondatra zibethicus (Common Muskrat) are often considered herbivores; however, they also eat animal matter, especially mussels, which comprise a considerable part of their diet in some populations. Common Muskrats also feed on crayfish (Astacoidea), although such behavior is poorly documented. On 21 April 2022, we observed a Common Muskrat repeatedly catching crayfish (Cambaridae) and carrying them to its den. The site in the Coldwater River National Wildlife Refuge, Quitman County, MS, consisted of a ditch with a water-control structure on the edge of a waterfowl impoundment being dewatered. The consumption of crayfish by a Common Muskrat during a time when vegetation was presumably less available has important ramifications for the management of both species.

AB  - Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are pervasive in diploid genomes and expose the effects of deleterious recessive mutations, but how exactly these regions contribute to variation in fitness remains unclear. Here, we combined empirical analyses and simulations to explore the deleterious effects of ROH with varying genetic map lengths in wild Soay sheep. Using a long-term dataset of 4879 individuals genotyped at 417K SNPs, we found that inbreeding depression increases with ROH length. A 1% genomic increase in long ROH (>12.5 cM) reduced the odds of first-year survival by 12.4% compared to only 7.7% for medium ROH (1.56-12.5 cM), whereas short ROH (<1.56 cM) had no effect on survival. We show by forward genetic simulations that this is predicted: compared to shorter ROH, long ROH will have higher densities of deleterious alleles, with larger average effects on fitness and lower population frequencies. Taken together, our results are consistent with the idea that the mutation load decreases in older haplotypes underlying shorter ROH, where purifying selection has had more time to purge deleterious mutations. Finally, our study demonstrates that strong inbreeding depression can persist despite ongoing purging in a historically small population.

AB  - The currently circulating high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the subtype H5 causes variable illness and death in wild and domestic birds and mammals, as well as in humans. This virus evolved from the Goose/Guangdong lineage of the HPAI H5 virus, which emerged in commercial poultry in China in 1996, spilled over into wild birds, and spread through Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America by 2021. Our objective was to summarize the spread and impact of the HPAI H5 virus in wild birds and mammals in South America, evaluate the risk of its spread and potential impact on Antarctic wildlife, and consider actions to manage the current and future HPAI outbreaks in wildlife. We obtained data on HPAI H5 virus detection and reported wildlife deaths from websites, newspaper articles, and scientific publications. The virus arrived in South America in October 2022. Thereafter, it spread widely and rapidly throughout the continent, where it infected at least 83 wild bird species and 11 wild mammal species and is estimated to have killed at least 667,000 wild birds and 52,000 wild mammals. The HPAI H5 virus spread to the Antarctic region by October 2023 and to mainland Antarctica by December 2023. This spread was associated with multiple mortality events in seabirds and marine mammals. The high spatial density of colonies of various Antarctic species of birds and mammals provides conditions for potentially devastating outbreaks with severe conservation implications. Ecosystem-level impacts may follow, and affected populations may take decades to recover. Although little can be done to stop the virus spread in wildlife, it is important to continue targeted surveillance of wildlife populations for HPAI H5 virus incursion and assessment of the spread and impact of disease to inform adaptation of conservation plans and to help policy makers mitigate and prevent future HPAI outbreaks.

AB  - Establishing and managing nature reserves to mitigate wildlife habitat loss and fragmentation is challenging, particularly in the face of increasing human activity. To understand how wildlife coexists in environments affected by anthropogenic disturbances, we conducted a 19-month survey examining the Reeves's pheasant (Syrmaticus reevesii) and Koklass pheasant (Pucrasia macrolopha) in the Anhui Tianma National Nature Reserve, China. Previous studies of large terrestrial birds focused primarily on livestock impacts, with less attention given to other human activities. We used occupancy models and performed daytime activity rhythm analysis based on camera trap data to examine the spatiotemporal responses of these species to human activities, livestock, and domestic dogs. The results showed that human disturbance activities within the reserve impact the distribution patterns of Reeves's pheasant and Koklass pheasant, but the effect was not significant. In high-disturbance environments, both species adjusted their activity times to avoid direct or indirect interactions with humans, livestock, and dogs. These findings provide insights for replanning core and creation of buffer zones within the reserve and have broader implications for conservation strategies in similar habitats. Our study suggests that well-designed conservation objectives can balance species protection with sustainable human presence.

AB  - The return of grey wolves to multi-use landscapes in North America and Europe raises concerns over accompanying risks of livestock predation. While local-level risk factors have received attention, it is difficult to explore the role that landscape-scale variables, such as landscape connectivity, play in driving livestock losses. Furthermore, it is unclear how changes in landscape structure might interact with livestock management practices. As wolf populations continue to grow, it is critical to understand how management of both land and livestock might be approached to reduce instances of livestock loss. We developed a spatially explicit, agent-based model designed to emulate hunting by a wolf pack within an agricultural-wildland landscape matrix. We investigated the effects of three different livestock grazing practices-free-roaming, pasture-limited and seasonal grazing-on interactions between livestock, wolves and wild ungulates. For each grazing practice, we explored how varying connectivity and availability of managed wildlands affected these interactions. Livestock predation rates were influenced by the size of wildlands and the degree to which these parcels were connected: increased wildland availability and connectivity led to reduced livestock losses, primarily due to greater wolf access to wild ungulates. Trends in livestock losses in relation to herd management and landscape composition were consistent and predictable on highly connected landscapes but broke down on landscapes experiencing a high degree of fragmentation. The different grazing practices employed in our model had minimal impact on overall levels of livestock loss, but did shape where livestock predation occurred. In particular, most livestock deaths occurring under the seasonal grazing treatment occurred on wildlands, indicating the heightened risk involved in seasonal use of these spaces. Synthesis and applications: Reducing risks of livestock predation on multi-use landscapes is crucial to the economic persistence of livestock producers and continued grey wolf recovery across Europe and North America. Our analysis shows that livestock loss to wolf predation is influenced more by the size and connectivity of wildland habitat than by grazing practice, suggesting that landscape restoration and preservation may benefit livestock producers and recovering large predator populations alike by ensuring continued access to wild prey.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Research focus on the phenology of plants has accompanied current trends in climate warming, because the two are inextricably linked. Warmer temperatures have led to advanced plant phenology in a range of systems, although some responses are species specific. However, other stressors, such as herbivory, can delay or advance plant phenology, and few studies have addressed the combined impact of these drivers. We experimentally warmed plots with open top chambers (OTCs) and simulated herbivory resistance to insect outbreaks with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), along an elevational climatic gradient. We then recorded vegetative and reproductive phenology in two functionally important dwarf shrubs, the deciduous Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry) and the evergreen V. vitis-idaea (lingonberry), to test the responses to the combined treatments. Based on earlier findings, we expected larger phenological responses at higher elevations and for bilberry. We found that in the year after MeJA application, both bilberry and lingonberry delayed vegetative and reproductive phenology, although responses were stronger in bilberry. Warming with OTCs weakly advanced phenology in both species, but combined effects were not consistent. We further examined the consequences of this altered phenology on reproductive output with multigroup piecewise structural equation modelling and found that herbivory resistance driven changes to phenology had a strong mediating effect on berry numbers, particularly under warmed conditions and mainly in the year after MeJA application. Synthesis. These results demonstrate the need to consider combined pressures in understanding the impacts of global change on plants and highlight that multiple drivers may have unidentified synergetic effects on species phenology and reproduction.

AB  - Space use by animals is affected by multiple factors; previous researchers have examined the effects of influences, such as sex, body condition, and population density on home range area. However, evaluating the simultaneous influences of multiple factors on animal space use has been relatively intractable due to sample size limitations. We capitalize on National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) data to ask what factors determine space use by deer mice (genus Peromyscus). We examined data from 10 years of repeated captures of individually-identified mice at 36 sites across North America. We confirmed previous findings that males have larger home ranges than females and that home range area decreases with increasing animal density. In addition, our large sample size (N = 2,420 individuals) enabled us to examine the interacting influences of these, and other, phenotypic and extrinsic factors using a robust statistical framework. We found that the relationship between body condition and home range area differs between male and female mice, and that habitat type, latitude, and animal density all interact to influence space use. We conclude that data from large ecological networks can be used to examine important behavioral questions that have long eluded investigators.

AB  - The sustainability of endangered Asian elephants in human care is threatened in part by low breeding success and concerns over individual animal wellbeing. Male elephants have received less research attention compared to females, yet males deserve special consideration due to their unique reproductive biology (particularly the sexual state of "musth") and the complex interaction of physiological, environmental, and social pressures they face. We measured fecal androgen metabolites (FAMs), fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs), and fecal triiodothyronine metabolites (FT3s) collected weekly over approximately 12 months from 26 male Asian elephants housed in zoos across the US, hypothesizing that FAM, FGM, and FT3 concentrations would be associated with temporal correlates of musth and would vary further with intrinsic (musth status, age, body condition) and extrinsic (social environment) factors. The duration of each musth episode was positively associated with exposure to male conspecifics and negatively associated with body condition. Further, elevated FAM concentrations were associated with social exposure, age, and body condition, and FGM concentrations also varied with age and body condition. FT3 concentrations were not associated with any factor we measured. We also identified periods of lower FAM concentration than confirmed musth episodes (but still higher than baseline FAM concentrations) that we termed "elevated FAM episodes." The durations of these episodes were negatively correlated with exposure to other male elephants. Together, these results provide evidence that hormone profiles (including those that are predicted to change around musth) vary significantly between male Asian elephants in a way that may be attributed to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Studies like these serve to enhance the sustainability of ex-situ populations by providing wildlife managers with information to enhance the health, welfare, and reproduction of threatened species like Asian elephants.

AB  - Crop raiding and livestock predation significantly influence the perception of the local community regarding wildlife conservation. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the scope, characteristics and origin of human-wildlife conflict, as well as the local community 's attitudes towards wildlife conservation within the vicinity of Kafta-Sheraro National Park, northern Ethiopia. The study was conducted in 2020 between April and October. A multi-stage sampling design was adopted to select 260 households to examine respondents ' opinions on the extent and underlying cause of human-wildlife conflict, communities ' perception towards wildlife conservation, the damage that wild animal species cause and traditional human-wildlife conflict mitigation measures applied. Our results showed that the spotted hyena ( Crocuta crocuta ), leopard ( Panthera pardus ) and African elephant ( Loxodonta africana ) were the top three species involved in conflicts as reported by the respondents. Both livestock depredation and crop raiding were the most serious human-wildlife conflict types in and around Kafta-Sheraro National Park. About 48 % of the respondents confirmed that illegal subsistence farming expansion and prohibited grazing were the main causes of human-wildlife conflict. The results of the multiple linear regression model indicated that education and the distance of villages to the park boundary are significant predictors of local community perceptions towards wildlife conservation. In the study area, the perception of the local community is greatly influenced by the benefit received from the park. To alleviate human-wildlife conflicts in and around Kafta-Sheraro National Park, residents used a combination of lethal and non-lethal mitigation measures. Therefore, environmental conservation education and managing the human-wildlife conflict are needed to improve the local community 's perception towards wildlife conservation and to design wildlife conservation strategies in Kafta-Sheraro National Park.

AB  - Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that temperate herbivores surf the green wave of emerging plants during spring migration. Despite the importance of autumn migration, few studies have conceptualized resource tracking of temperate herbivores during this critical season. We adapted the frost wave hypothesis (FWH), which posits that animals pace their autumn migration to reduce exposure to snow but increase acquisition of forage. We tested the FWH in a population of mule deer in Wyoming, USA by tracking the autumn migrations of n = 163 mule deer that moved 15-288 km from summer to winter range. Migrating deer experienced similar amounts of snow but 1.4-2.1 times more residual forage than if they had na & iuml;ve knowledge of when or how fast to migrate. Importantly, deer balanced exposure to snow and forage in a spatial manner. At the fine scale, deer avoided snow near their mountainous summer ranges and became more risk prone to snow near winter range. Aligning with their higher tolerance of snow and lingering behavior to acquire residual forage, deer increased stopover use by 1 +/- 1 day (95% CI) day for every 10% of their migration completed. Our findings support the prediction that mule deer pace their autumn migration with the onset of snow and residual forage, but refine the FWH to include movement behavior en route that is spatially dynamic.

AB  - Plant-herbivore relationships involve a significant amount of global biodiversity within complex interaction networks. Buprestidae (Coleoptera) are highly specialized herbivores, and several species have important economic and ecological impacts. We used tools derived from network theory to evaluate the structure of a plant-buprestid metaweb at three different organizational levels (network, subnetwork, and species-levels) and test whether trophic guilds and taxa differ in their patterns within the network. We also tested whether taxonomically closely related buprestid species are more likely to share the same host plant species. We found that the plant-buprestid metaweb exhibits a non-nested and significantly highly modular pattern, and most buprestid and host plant species have specialized interactions. Florivorous buprestids showed the highest diversity of host preferences and, together with Fabaceae, were the most important for the network structure as they are highly connected species. Leaf-mining buprestids had the most extreme interaction pattern among trophic guilds, with high modularity and specialized interactions. We also found a low probability to share the same group of host plants among buprestids, which decreased with taxonomic distance. Our findings uncover patterns within a plant-herbivore network at large spatial scales and at different taxonomic levels, which are shaped by the diversity of host and resources preferences, more than taxonomic relatedness. Those network patterns might reflect different ecological roles for each trophic guild and taxa. We highlight the relevance of considering the diversity of feeding habits within networks of a single type of interaction and emphasize the importance of analyze network patterns at high levels of organization.

AB  - Plant -ant interaction in savanna ecosystems is an iconic example of species mutualism. In Cerrado, Brazilian savanna, it is common to find this type of interaction mediated by the offer of extrafloral rewards. This study described a new plant -ant interaction for the tree Alibertia edulis (Rubiaceae) and the ant species Camponotus rufipes and elucidated the main structure involved in the interaction. To do so, (i) we monitored the phenology of A. edulis, (ii) recorded the ant species visitation, and, (iii) collected fruits in different stages of development to perform anatomical and histochemical trials to characterize the structures and chemical components related to the secreted substances - which could be responsible for attracting the ants. Ants' visitation starts at the beginning of fruit development and stops when they are completely ripe. An extrafloral nectary - pericarpical nectary - on the top of the fruits was identified and described for the first time in the Alibertia edulis, derived from the flower structure, which remains to exude (sugar components) during the fruit development. Based on these results, C. rufipes, known for being an aggressive ant, may play a role in protecting fruits against predation until they are completely ripe and the seeds are ready to be dispersed. During seed dispersal, the fruits reduce the production of nectar, signaling the end of the partnership with the ants until the next reproductive season. Here, we shed light and bring new insights into a new plant -ant interaction for a widely spread tree and ant species. (c) 2024 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many animals communicate using seismic vibrations. Signaller morphology, signal production method and environmental factors impose interacting constraints that may be impossible to replicate in the laboratory, making it essential to study seismic communication in situ. Here, we focused on the constraints on percussive seismic signals in European fiddler crabs (Afruca tangeri), recording a large dataset of percussive seismic signals in situ, and testing for waveform differences as a function of signaller morphology and behaviour. In addition, we aimed to characterise signal degradation and interference by seismic noise from wind and vibrated vegetation in the natural environment. We obtained over 8000 percussive seismic signal recordings, and found that although the length, rhythm and loudness of the signals all varied as a function of behaviour, their frequency content did not. Consequently, behaviours could be discriminated based on seismic recordings alone. Larger claws were only associated with louder signals in the case of claw drumming behaviours, but morphology did not affect percussive signal features otherwise. Environmental effects on percussive signals were substantial as signals attenuated significantly over distance, and wind speed was positively correlated with seismic noise, albeit independently of distance to vegetation. We conclude that percussive seismic signals are limited in their ability to convey information through frequency, but that their broadband nature is advantageous in the face of noise and frequency filtering by the substrate. In contrast, changing the amplitude and repetition rate of a percussive signal offers a simple but effective means for small animals to communicate seismically in noisy environments.

AB  - Plant performance in any one generation is affected not only by the prevailing environmental conditions, but also by the conditions experienced by the parental generation of those plants. These maternal effects have been recorded in a many plant species, but the influence of external biotic (as opposed to abiotic) factors on shaping maternal effects have been rarely examined. Furthermore, almost all previous studies have taken place over one plant generation, rather than across multiple generations. Here, we studied the influence of insect herbivory and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal colonisation on the shaping of maternal effects in the annual forb Senecio vulgaris. We grew plants with and without aphids (Myzus persicae) and AM fungi (hereafter termed 'induction events') over four successive generations, wherein seeds from plants in any one treatment were used to grow plants of the same treatment in the next generation, all in identical environmental conditions. We found strong evidence of maternal effects in the second plant generation, i.e., after one induction event. These plants took longer to germinate, flowered in a shorter time, produced lighter seeds and were shorter and of lower biomass than their parents. Aphid attack tended to enhance these effects, whereas AM fungi had little influence. However, thereafter there was a gradual recovery in these parameters, so that plants experiencing three inductions showed similar life history parameters to those in the original generation. We conclude that experiments investigating maternal effects need to be performed over multiple plant generations and that biotic factors such as insects and mycorrhizas must also be taken into account, along with abiotic factors, such as nutrient and water availability.

AB  - The Mongolian economy is supported by rich deposits of natural resources, such as copper, coal, and gold. However, the risk of heavy metal pollution to livestock and human have been recently discussed. This research collected various samples from soil and animal (sheep, goat, horse, cow, and camel), blood and organs (kidney and liver) in the Mongolian countryside. These samples were processed, and the concentration of metals was quantified using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP/MS). As previously reported, arsenic was found at high levels of accumulation in soil. Selenium is another concern, as median concentration in one area exceeded the maximum allowable level. Cadmium and selenium were found to be highly accumulated in animal kidney. This research revealed the current pollution level in Mongolia based on evaluation of soil and animals. The concentration in animals could not indicate that animals had severe effects because of heavy metal exposure. However, kidney is eaten in Mongolia, and so there is a direct connection to human health, and this research suggested the possible risks posed by each edible animal. In particular, evaluation of metals in livestock is rare in Mongolia. This result can contribute to animal and human health in Mongolian communities.

AB  - Human-induced antibiotic pollution in the world's large rivers poses significant risk to riverine ecosystems, water quality, and human health. This study identified geophysical and socioeconomic factors driving antibiotic pollution in the Yangtze River by quantifying 83 target antibiotics in water and sediment samples collected in its 6300-km-long reach, followed by source apportionment and statistical modeling. Total antibiotic concentrations ranged between 2.05-111 ng/L in water samples and 0.57-57.9 ng/g in sediment samples, contributed predominantly by veterinary antibiotics, sulfonamides and tetracyclines, respectively. Antibiotic compositions were clustered according to three landform regions (plateau, mountain-basin-foothill, and plains), resulting from varying animal production practices (cattle, sheep, pig, poultry, and aquaculture) in the sub-basins. Population density, animal production, total nitrogen concentration, and river water temperature are directly associated with antibiotic concentrations in the water samples. This study revealed that the species and production of food animals are key determinants of the geographic distribution pattern of antibiotics in the Yangtze River. Therefore, effective strategies to mitigate antibiotic pollution in the Yangtze River should include proper management of antibiotic use and waste treatment in animal production.

AB  - Simple Summary Dairy goats face a set of stressful challenges during lactation. In our study, we aimed to understand how daily stressors can impact milk production and also how Saanen goats respond to these stressors. Our results showed that acute stress imposed sequentially caused cumulative stress and decreased the milk yield of a stressed goat. The data obtained may help in milk yields, especially in tropical regions where the use of goats is widely disseminated as a source of income and food. The information from this study can also be extrapolated to research in other production animals.Abstract This study addresses the hypothesis that different acute stressors can cumulatively decrease milk yield. In fact, in a time of global warming, the impact of environmental stress and farm management practices on milk production remains unclear. In this context, our objective was to investigate the effect of acute and cumulative stress on gene expression in mammary tissue and their interactions with physiological responses and milk yield in Saanen goats. Thirty lactating goats were subjected to two treatments: (1) control (CT), in which goats were maintained following a habitual routine under comfort conditions; (2) stress (ST), in which the goats were subjected to different types of environmental stress: heat stress, adrenocorticotropic hormone administration, hoof care management, and exposure to rain. These stressors were performed sequentially, with one stress per day on four consecutive lactation days, to evaluate their effect on milk quality and milk yield. Our results showed that compared to CT goats, cumulative stress increased the gene expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in mammary tissue, which are indicators of cortisol action, inflammatory response, and antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, the acute challenges imposed on ST goats changed their rectal temperature and respiratory frequency and increased cortisol, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein release in plasma when compared to CT goats. Although these physiological and metabolic responses restore homeostasis, ST goats showed lower milk yield and higher somatic cell count in milk than CT goats. In conclusion, the results confirmed our initial hypothesis that different acute stressors cumulatively decrease the milk yield in Saanen goats.

AB  - Since the first occurrence of African swine fever (ASF) in wild boar in Germany in 2020, the disease has primarily affected the wild boar population in the eastern part of the country close to the border with Poland. Local hunters play a crucial role in implementing surveillance and control. To evaluate their perceptions of existing control measures and analyze regional differences between hunters from ASF-affected and non-affected regions, a questionnaire study was conducted among the German hunting community. Hunters from non-affected areas held a more optimistic view regarding the effectiveness of control measures compared to hunters from affected areas. However, control measures that hinder hunting were generally perceived as ineffective. Measures that collided with hunters' understanding of fair hunting practices were regarded as controversial. Financial incentives and reducing bureaucracy were the most favored approaches to increase hunters' participation. Moreover, the possibility of eating or selling the meat of hunted wild boar and the provision of infrastructure for implementing ASF control were considered motivating. Thus, this study highlights the importance of compensating hunters and addressing their concerns to maintain their engagement in ASF control. To enhance compliance with controversial measures, thoughtful communication and raising awareness are essential.

AB  - Salinization stands out as a harsh environmental stress element that hinders the productivity of crops. Climatic changes, alterations in land utilization, and changes in the salinity levels of irrigation water are the main reasons of rising salinization of soil. Enhanced soil salinity modifies the plant quality, potentially leading to cascading impacts on phytophagous insects. On the other hand, virus infection of host plants can have notable effects on the demographic characteristics of the herbivorous insects including virus vectors. So, in our study we investigated how salinity stress affects the demographic characteristics of Frankliniella occidentalis (WFT) through cherry tomato plant infected with tomato yellow ring virus (TYRV). Despite significant enhancement of adult longevity, oviposition period, and fecundity of WFT on virus-infected plants under no-stress conditions, these parameters were adversely affected by salinity stress, leading to a decline in overall fitness of the WFT. The salinity interfered the development duration of nymphs, adult longevity, and oviposition of WFT. Remarkable differences detected in the intrinsic and finite increase rates as well as the net reproduction rate of WFT under high level of salinity. Salinity had a negative impact on WFT development; nonetheless, population projection forecasted a clear but slower growth trend in WFT population particularly under moderate level of salinity (2.8 dS/m of NaCl), while high level of salinity (4.7 dS/m) led to notable fitness costs in WFT populations. The results imply that WFT may pose a growing threat in both virus-free and virus-infected environments characterized by low to moderate salinity levels, potentially exacerbating the negative impacts of salinity on tomato yields. This study will provide insights into the life table characteristics of WFT in tomato fields infected with tomato yellow ring orthotospovirus, aiding in environmentally friendly management strategies.Graphical AbstractSalinity stress affects western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), by affecting food sources, physiology, and behavior, leading to reduced fitness and increased mortality rates.

AB  - Ecological interactions among plants, insect herbivores, and parasitoids are pervasive in nature and play important roles in community assembling, but the codiversification of tri-trophic interactions has received less attention. Here we compare pairwise codiversification patterns between a set of 22 fig species, their herbivorous pollinating and galling wasps, and their parasitoids. The parasitoid phylogeny showed significant congruence and more cospeciation events with host insects phylogeny than with host plants. These results suggest that parasitoid phylogeny and speciation is more closely related to their host insects than to their host plants. The pollinating wasps hosted more parasitoid species than gallers and indicated a more intense interspecific competition among parasitoids associated with pollinators. Closer matching and fewer evolutionary host shifts were found between parasitoids and galler hosts than between parasitoids and pollinator hosts. These results suggest that interspecific competition among parasitoids, rather than resource availability of host wasps, is the main driver of the codiversification pattern in this community. Therefore, our study highlights the important role of interspecific competition among high trophic level insects in plant-insect tri-trophic community assembling.

AB  - Simple Summary Many viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus 1, influenza virus, or Rift Valley fever virus, cause cell damage by generating reactive oxygen species and altering redox homeostasis. However, cells have developed various antioxidant mechanisms. We assumed that small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV), which has been found to infect sheep and goats worldwide can also disrupt the homeostasis of animals. SRLV target organs are the joints, lungs, brain, and the udder. To our knowledge, no information exists on the influence of SRLV infection on the oxidative processes occurring in goats. Understanding the influence of viral infection on oxidative stress may help develop novel antiviral treatments. Our study aimed to examine the effects of SRLV infection on oxidative stress biomarkers in the serum of dairy goats during lactation. No differences in any studied parameter at any stage of lactation were found between infected and uninfected goats. On the other hand, significant differences in almost all investigated parameters were found between stages of lactation, regardless of the infection status of goats. In conclusion, asymptomatic SRLV-infected goats do not reveal any apparent dysfunctions in serum oxidative stress biomarkers compared to their uninfected counterparts. The only changes in oxidative stress biomarkers observed during lactation appear to reflect the metabolic effort associated with milk production and developing pregnancy. The present study examines the effects of natural infection by small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) in the two most common goat breeds in Poland, i.e., Polish white improved and polish fawn improved. It focuses on biomarkers of oxidative stress, oxidatively modified proteins and antioxidant defenses, ceruloplasmin level as an acute phase protein, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes in the goat serum. It was conducted on 24 goats divided into two equal groups: one SRLV-seropositive (SRLV-SP) and another SRLV-seronegative (SRLV-SN). Both groups were identical in terms of breed and parity. Despite infection, the SRLV-SP goats demonstrated no symptoms of caprine arthritis-encephalitis. In addition, the SRLV-SP goats did not reveal pronounced dysfunctions in oxidative stress biomarkers in the serum compared to the SRLV-SN animals. However, both groups demonstrated elevated levels of the aldehydic and ketonic derivatives of oxidatively modified proteins during the lactation period. In addition, both groups retained a high total antioxidant capacity in serum despite the decrease of enzyme antioxidant defenses throughout the 200-day lactation period.

AB  - Smaller grazers consistently show greater preference for recently burned patches than larger species. Energy optimization theory posits that this pattern is driven by small- versus large-bodied herbivores seeking to maximize energy intake by choosing high-quality recently burned grasses, or high-quantity unburned grasses, respectively. We propose that if burn preference is driven by an energy-maximization mechanism, then preference should change over time as grass regrows and progresses across the optimal feeding heights of herbivores of increasing body size. To test this, we used a camera trap array in the Serengeti National Park to quantify changes in the relative preference for burned patches of seven ruminant herbivore species. We compared observed patterns to simulation results from a grass production-herbivore patch selection model. Burn preference and herbivore body size scaled negatively for 6 months after fire, but this relationship disappeared after 7 months when smaller species stopped selecting burns, and larger herbivores selected burns after 10 months, in a reversal of classic grazer succession. Simulations recreated the former but not the latter relationship, suggesting that an energy-maximization mechanism can drive allometric scaling of burn preference immediately after fire, but over longer periods, grazer-driven feedbacks are required to explain large herbivore burn preferences.

AB  - Soil surface electrochemistry is a science that studies the interaction and chemical behavior of charged particles (colloidal particles, ions, protons and electrons) in soil. Surface electrochemical properties (SEP) of soil have significant influences on soil fertility, aggregate stability, and contaminant migration. However, the impacts of long-term fertilization on SEP of purple soil (Eutric Regosol, FAO soil classification) have received little attention, and the factors affecting SEP also remain unclear. This study examined the effects of long-term fertilization on SEP. A field fertilization trial was established in 1991 with four treatments: no fertilization (CK), chemical fertilizer (NPK), chemical fertilizer plus pig manure (NPKM), and chemical fertilizer plus rice straw (NPKS). Soil SEP (surface potential, phi(0); surface charge density, sigma(0); surface electric field strength, E; specific surface area, SSA; surface charges number, SCN) and mineralogy properties was determined. Compared with CK, NPK, NPKM, and NPKS significantly increased phi(0) by 5.21% to 20.4%, and SSA by 16.5% to 31.6% (P < 0.05). NPKM and NPKS increased sigma(0) by 8.69% to 17.4%, E by 9.48% to 15.9%, and SCN by 5.21% to 20.4% (P < 0.05). In addition, NPKM and NPKS increases soil organic matter (SOM) and amorphous oxides. Redundancy analysis indicated that SOM, amorphous manganese oxides (Mno), amorphous aluminum oxides (Alo) and amorphous iron oxides (Feo) could explain 80.6%, 5.2%, 3.9% and 2.7% of the variation in SEP, respectively. Therefore, long-term inorganic and organic fertilization primarily affected purple soil SEP by regulating SOM and amorphous oxides (Mno, Alo, and Feo). The increasing of SOM content it is the key point to improving soil quality.

AB  - Nutrients regulate herbivore growth from the 'bottom-up' via improved plant vigour and food quality. Nitrogen also affects 'top-down' control of herbivores by moderating attraction of predators and the rates at which they consume herbivorous prey. Tri-trophic consequences of nitrogen availability are more challenging to predict among omnivorous natural enemies who feed on both plants and herbivores, limiting our ability to predict net outcomes of nutrient availability in food webs. In a two-year field survey of insects on zucchini host plants at 48 sites, I predicted that both herbivores and foliar-feeding omnivores would increase with nutrient availability, while predators would not. My results revealed positive relationships between omnivores and foliar nitrogen concentrations, while predators had neutral responses to foliar N. Surprisingly, herbivores declined with increasing foliar N across the field sites. Greenhouse experiments re-enforced these patterns, as herbivore growth inversely correlated with soil N concentrations in communities that included foliar-feeding omnivores. Conversely, herbivore growth was uncorrelated with soil N on plants with predators, nor on predator-free plants. These results suggest that omnivores mount strong and consistent responses to nitrogen in plant tissues in a variety of ecological contexts. In environments where omnivorous arthropods can thrive, their recruitment to nitrogen-rich plants may increase predation and thereby counterbalance and stabilize 'bottom-up' increases in herbivore performance supported by enhanced foliar nutrition.

AB  - Our understanding of Late Cretaceous dinosaur ecosystems from North America has considerably improved through stable isotope analyses on fossil bones and teeth. Oxygen and carbon stable isotopic compositions of structurally-bound carbonate in these fossil apatites are commonly used to infer variations of ingested water and food sources, which are in turn related to environmental and climatic conditions. Incremental isotopic records potentially provide insights into seasonality and migratory behaviour. So far, these reconstructions are based on vertebrate remains from spatiotemporally diverse datasets. Here, we present oxygen (818O) and carbon (813C) isotopic records from a large, spatially and temporally well-constrained, Triceratops bonebed from the Upper Maastrichtian Lance Formation (eastern Wyoming. USA). These isotopic compositions allow to elucidate the palaeoecology of these large herbivores and their ecosystem in detail, as well as their habitat use, diet and possible migration. The 818O signature from incrementally sampled Triceratops teeth reveal relatively low intra-tooth variation (average 1.3 %o), comparable to contemporaneous dinosaur species as well as modern herbivo-rous mammals. Average 813C values (-5.4 %o) are somewhat higher than for modern C3 plant grazers, and hint towards complex interactions during carbon uptake by non-avian herbivorous dinosaurs. Calculated 818O of drinking water (-14.8 %o) combined with the local sedimentology of fine-grained siliciclastic deposits with high total organic and low carbonate contents strongly suggest a freshwater environment. Additionally, the combined average 818O and 813C Triceratops isotope signatures indicate a living environment intermediate between inland forests and coastal floodplains, expanding on earlier theories of ornithischian niche partitioning. Our robust dataset provides meaningful tests of habitat and palaeoecological hypotheses for Triceratops, and highlights the application of spatiotemporally well-constrained fossil remains.

AB  - Highland pastoralism provides economic sustainability to the tribal livelihoods and is endemic to the yak-rearing tracts of India. Transhumant pastoralists of Arunachal Pradesh (in India) have centuries-old deep socio-religious and economic connections with this unique bovine species. As a result of their conservation efforts, Arunachali was recognized as the first and is still the lone breed (to date) of yaks in the country. A survey was conducted on the pastoral production system in the region to enable the phenotypic characterization of yaks and to understand the prevailing husbandry practices. Arunachali yaks are medium-sized bovines that are predominantly black with dense and long hairs hanging down the body and are docile in temperament. They have a convex head with horizontal ears and distinctly curved horns with pointed tips. The average milk yield is 0.98-1.04 kg milk/day with 7.45% fat and 11.5% SNF and the peak milk yield/day is 1.1-1.6 kg. The average ages of clipping of coarse hairs and down fibres are 12-18 months and 12 months, respectively, with average yields of 1.5 kg and 0.5 kg/clipping/animal, respectively. Value addition of yak milk and fibre presents a unique opportunity for the economic rejuvenation of yak pastoralism. However, winter feed scarcity, inbreeding, extreme climate events and the non-availability of essential services are still major challenges for yak production in the country. Our findings acknowledge that pastoral sustainability is critical for the conservation of yaks and yak rearing. This calls for pastoralism-centric governance and research efforts in the highlands to curb the declining population and to put Indian yaks on the road to sustainability.

AB  - Upslope range shifting has been documented in diverse species in response to global warming. Plasticity, which refers to the ability of organisms to alter their phenotypes in changing environments, is crucial for the survival of those that newly migrated to a high-altitude environment. The scope and mechanisms of plasticity across biological levels, however, have rarely been examined. We used two agama lizards (genus Phrynocephalus) as model systems and a transplant experiment to comprehensively assess their plasticity on multiple organization levels. Two low-altitude (934 m) agama species, Phrynocephalus axillaris (oviparous) and P. forsythii (viviparous), were transplanted to a high-altitude site (3,400 m). After acclimation for 6 weeks in seminatural enclosures, plasticity was measured from bite force, tail display behavior, gene expression, and metabolome. Both lizards were capable of acclimating to the high-altitude environment without sacrificing their performance in bite force, but they also showed high plasticity in tail display behavior by either decreasing the intensity of a specific display component (P. forsythii) or by the trade-off between display components (P. axillaris). Genes and metabolites associated with lipids, especially fatty acid metabolism, exhibited significant differentiation in expression, compared to individuals from their native habitats. Improved fatty acid storage and metabolism appeared to be a common response among animals at high altitudes. Despite distinct reproductive modes that may differ in response to physiological pressure, the two lizards demonstrated high concordance in plasticity when they faced a novel environment at high altitudes. Taken together, lizards likely acclimate to high-altitude environments by reducing behavioral activity and increasing energy efficiency after range shifting. Our results provide new insights into our understanding of phenotypic plasticity and its importance in today's changing climate.

AB  - This study investigated the impacts of lime addition and further microbial inoculum on gaseous emission and humification during kitchen waste composting. High-throughput sequencing was integrated with Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) and Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX) to decipher bacterial dynamics in response to different additives. Results showed that lime addition enriched bacteria, such as Taibaiella and Sphingobacterium as biomarkers, to strengthen organic biodegradation toward humification. Furthermore, lime addition facilitated the proliferation of thermophilic bacteria (e.g. Bacillus and Symbiobacterium) for aerobic chemoheterotrophy, leading to enhanced organic decomposition to trigger notable gaseous emission. Such emission profile was further exacerbated by microbial inoculum to lime-regulated condition given the rapid enrichment of bacteria (e.g. Caldicoprobacter and Pusillimonas as biomarkers) for fermentation and denitrification. In addition, microbial inoculumslightly hindered humus formation by narrowing the relative abundance of bacteria for humification. Results from this study show that microbial inoculum to feedstock should be carefully regulated to accelerate composting and avoid excessive gaseous emission.

AB  - Plants and insects are the two most diverse groups among terrestrial macro-organisms. They interact with each other to various extents, and constitute the most significant part of complex terrestrial ecosystems. The early Permian tuff flora in Wuda, China, buried by volcanic ash in its growth position, represents an intricate peat-forming forest in the subtropics of the eastern Tethys. However, the paleoecology of the community, especially the relationships between plants and their herbivorous insects, remains poorly understood. We report evidence for plant-insect interactions in the flora based on a thorough investigation of insect-mediated damage on the plant specimens. In total, 8 types of insect-mediated damage, belonging to 5 functional feeding groups, were recognized in 11 plant species. The insect damage recognized in the flora comprises oviposition on calamitalean axes; external leaf feeding, galling, oviposition, and wood boring on marattialean ferns: external leaf feeding, galling, and oviposition on noeggerathialeans: external leaf feeding, piercing and sucking, galling, and oviposition on cycadophytes. Damage occurrence indicates that the cycadophyte taxon Pterophyllum sp. cf . P. daihoense is likely the most frequently targeted plant in the flora. Our results may be a subset of the broader pattern of plant-insect interaction in the early Permian subtropics, due to the unusual environmental conditions, but they do provide a glimpse into the peat-forming swamp ecosystems of the late Paleozoic Cathaysia.

AB  - 1. Urbanisation and anthropogenic alteration of ecosystems has led to conflict between humans and wildlife. Such conflict is often observed in apex predators. Although human-wildlife conflict has been extensively studied, male/female differences in behaviour are rarely considered.
   2. We investigated male/female differences in foraging behaviour of the predatory/scavenging brown skua Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi breeding on a New Zealand island nature reserve in proximity to farmland. These skuas are subject to culling, when perceived as a threat to livestock.
   3. As part of a long-term ecological study, we used high-resolution Global Positioning System (GPS) devices to characterise the space-use of foraging brown skuas. We also analysed stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) from modern and archived blood samples to investigate possible changes in diet over the past similar to 30 years.
   4. Analysis of 100 GPS tracks collected from 2014 to 2016 demonstrated that males and females consistently visited different habitats. Males spent most of their time close to their breeding territory on the island nature reserve and females frequently visited a farmed island approximately two kilometres away. Consistent with this finding, we show that male and female skuas also differed markedly in their diets: males specialised on burrow-nesting white-faced storm petrels Pelagodroma marina (80%) with only a small proportion of sheep remains Ovis aries (<6%) contributing to their diet. In contrast, female diet comprised 27% white-faced storm petrels, other seabirds (18%) and a relatively large proportion of sheep remains (47%). Further, our data (186 blood samples from 122 individuals) show that this male/female difference in diet has persisted at least since 1987.
   5. Because females fed disproportionally on sheep remains, they may be more vulnerable to being culled by farmers. Importantly, our case study suggests that intersexual differences in diet and foraging patterns can have major implications for the reproduction and survival of apex predators that interact with farming. We strongly suggest that intersexual differences in behaviour should be considered when investigating human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - Genetic effects and radioactive contamination of large mammals, including wild boar (Sus scrofa), have been studied in Japan because of dispersal of radionuclides from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011. Such studies have generally demonstrated a declining trend in measured radiocesium body burdens in wildlife. Estimating radiation exposure to wildlife is important to understand possible long-term impacts. Here, radiation exposure was evaluated in 307 wild boar inhabiting radioactively contaminated areas (50-8000 kBq m(-2)) in Fukushima Prefecture from 2016 to 2019, and genetic markers were examined to assess possible germline mutations caused by chronic radiation exposures to several generations of wild boar. Internal Cs activity concentrations in boar remained high in areas near the power plant with the highest concentration of 54 kBq kg(-1) measured in 2019. Total dose rates to wild boar ranged from 0.02 to 36 mu Gy h(-1), which was primarily attributed to external radiation exposure, and dose rates to the maximally exposed animals were above the generic no effects benchmark of 10 mu Gy h(-1). Using the estimated age of each animal, lifetime radiation doses ranged from < 0.1 mGy to 700 mGy. Despite chronic exposures, the genetic analyses showed no significant accumulation of mutation events. Because wild boar is an occasional human dietary item in Japan, effective dose to humans from ingesting contaminated wild boar meat was calculated. Hypothetical consumption of contaminated wild boar meat from radioactively contaminated areas in Fukushima, at the per capita pork consumption rate (12.9 kg y(-1)), would result in an average effective annual dose of 0.9 mSv y(-1), which is below the annual ingestion limit of 1 mSv y(-1). Additionally, a consumption rate of about 1.4 kg y(-1) of the most contaminated meat in this study would not exceed annual ingestion limits.

AB  - Proper management of digestible energy (DE) is crucial for maintaining pig health, promoting growth, and facilitating reproduction by supporting essential biological processes. Therefore, this study sought to predict the digestible energy requirement (DER) in the growing-finishing phase of pigs, where four machine learning (ML) models: multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) were applied across four datasets, with the input parameters including body weight of pigs (BW), inside temperature (IT), inside relative humidity (IRH), and inside CO2 concentration (ICO2) of pig barns. Two experiments were conducted in 2022 and 2023, involving a total of eighteen 65-day-old crossbred pigs during each experimental period. These pigs were equally divided into three experimental pig barns, each comprising three gilts and three boars, and subjected to different DE content diets. The livestock environment management system sensor and two load cells were used to measure the IT, IRH, ICO2, BW and DE intake of pigs, respectively. The result of the study showed no significant difference in DE intake by pigs with different diets (p > 0.05). While evaluating the model's performance under different datasets, it was observed that the RFR model exhibited the best performance with DS4, explaining over 97 % and 95 % of actual and predicted data during the training and testing phases, respectively, while MLR model demonstrated the worst accuracy (R-2 < 0.93 and RMSE >6.1 MJ/pig day) compared to the other models. The ranking of model's performance under DS4 was as follows: RFR > MLP > SVR > MLR. Most importantly, the sensitivity analysis revealed that BW exerted the most significant impact on predicting DER among other variables. In conclusion, the study suggested that RFR model can precisely predict DER, offering valuable insights for pig farmers to enhance their understanding of DE management.

AB  - Simple Summary One of the most important vegetation zones in West Africa is the so-called "Dahomey Gap", which is a mostly savannah region that separates two rainforest blocks, the West African one (scientifically known as the Upper Guinean Forest block) and the central African one (Lower Guinean Forest block). Forest patches are sparsely distributed within the Dahomey Gap region. In this paper, we studied medium and large mammals (especially ungulates) within an area dominated by patches of flooded forests near the Mono river in south-eastern Togo. We described the species richness of mammals in this area. We found that 19 species coexisted in these forests. The number of species in each forest area correlated with the size of the forest patch. We stress that to ensure the protection of the Dahomey Gap mammals, we should seriously consider protecting not only the forest patches but also the surroundings, mainly savannah landscapes. "The Dahomey Gap" is a human-derived mostly savannah region that separates the Guineo-Congolian rainforest block into two major units: the Upper Guinean and the Lower Guinean Forest blocks. Several forest patches are distributed throughout this savannah-dominated habitat. The mammal communities in the Dahomey Gap region have been poorly studied. In this paper we analyse the species richness and abundance of, as well as conservation implications for, medium and large mammals (especially ungulates) inhabiting a complex of flooded forests near the Mono river in south-eastern Togo. We use several field methods to describe the species richness of mammals in this area, including camera-trapping, recce transects, Kilometric Index of Abundance (KIA) estimates, examination of hunters' catches and face-to-face hunter interviews. Overall, we directly recorded 19 species that coexist in these forests. Based on interviews, nine other species were confirmed as present in the study area. Only five species were common: Cephalophus rufilatus, Tragelaphus scriptus, Chlorocebus aethiops, Atilax paludinosus and Herpestes ichneumon. The area still contains various threatened species such as Tragelaphus spekii and Hippopotamus amphibius. We stress that to ensure the protection of the Dahomey Gap mammals, it is important to seriously consider protecting not only the forest patches but also the surroundings, mainly savannah landscapes.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation affects the survival of wildlife and is a main threat to biodiversity. Corridors are frequently used to alleviate habitat fragmentation. However, corridors are costly and often ineffective in practice. Endangered species in montane regions are particularly affected by habitat fragmentation and therefore require economic and efficient conservation strategies. We propose a stepping stone strategy (SSS) to deal with habitat fragmentation threatening an endangered primate, the black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti). We selected the southern range of R. bieti as the study area, which covers 3,580 km2. We evaluated the habitat status and formulated an SSS based on the dispersal ability of an adult male R. bieti. Six sustainable habitat patches and 340 natural stepping stones were detected. Thirteen artificial stepping stones are needed to establish weak connectivity of habitats. Fortyfour stepping stones are proposed as key stepping stones for attaining strong connectivity. The SSS is projected to incur substantially less pecuniary investment than the corridor strategy (0.06 million versus 5.65 million, USD). We conclude that 5 steps are needed for the SSS: (a) assessing the status of habitats to plan restorative intervention activities, (b) designing artificial stepping stones to weakly link sustainable habitats, (c) proposing corridors to allow for a stable connection between sustainable habitats, (d) identifying key stepping stones to establish small protected area, and (e) recovery of fragmented habitat and reinstatement of sustainable habitat. Our study suggests that SSS is a cost-effective and practical way for maintaining connectivity and supporting habitat recovery for endangered wildlife in montane regions.

AB  - The present study reports new behavioral records for Oxysternon palemo Castelnau, 1840 in Cerrado. According to its nesting habits and resource allocation, this species of dung beetle is traditionally classified as coprophagous and paracoprid, transporting portions of dung through tunnels excavated below the resource. We observed a male individual moving a pequi seed (Caryocar brasiliensis Cambess.) with "head-butting," acting as a secondary seed disperser. At another moment, we recorded necrophagous habits for the species when male individuals were observed moving pieces of domestic pig carcasses (Sus scrofa L., 1758), also with "head-butting." After, we recorded a female O. palemo, accompanied by a male individual, butting a dung mass and burying this resource several meters away from the original source. The behavior of pushing the resource over long distances is typical of telecoprid dung beetles that form dung balls and roll them using hind legs away from the resource source, unlike what is expected for O. palemo. Our hypothesis is that the observed behaviors have developed from competition for resources. Furthermore, the behaviors exhibited by O. palemo contribute to the provision of essential ecosystem services. The ecosystem services include the removal and degradation of decomposing organic matter, as well as secondary dispersal of seeds, thus supporting the maintenance and conservation of plant species.

AB  - Simple Summary Nutritional and organoleptic traits are important components of the meat industry, which can affect consumers' purchasing desire and the processing of meat quality. This study evaluated the effect of feeding system on the muscle fiber characteristics, antioxidant capacity, and nutritional and organoleptic traits of goat meat. It was found that the feeding system had great effect on muscle fiber composition, antioxidant capacity, nutritional value, and organoleptic traits of goat meat, but compared with grazing on mountain range (whole area with about 40% inclination), grazing on flatland (whole area with about 0% inclination) improved the meat nutritional value and quality by altering the myofiber characteristic and antioxidative status. This study assists us in comprehending the influence of diverse feeding systems on nutritional and organoleptic traits of goat meat so as to develop more appropriate measures to retain superior quality of goat meat and provide basic data for the development of goat meat products. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of feeding system on muscle fiber composition, antioxidant capacity, and nutritional and organoleptic traits of goat meat. Goats that grazed on flatland (whole area with about 0% inclination, FG group) and mountain range (whole area with about 40% inclination, MG group) were selected for the analysis. The results showed that grazing on flatland increased oxidized-twitch fiber percentage, the expression of the MyHC IIa gene (p < 0.001), the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (p < 0.05), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) (p = 0.001), and radical scavenging ability (RSA) (p < 0.05); meanwhile, the MyHC IIb gene expression (p < 0.01) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content (p = 0.001) were decreased. Feeding system affected nutritional and organoleptic traits of goat meat, and grazing on flatland increased protein content, total content of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), pH(45min), a* value, and variety of volatile flavor compounds but decreased the content of saturated fatty acid (SFA), shear force, and b* value. In addition, the key flavor substances were screened using relative odor activity value (ROAV), including hexanal, heptanal, (E)-2-octenal, octanal, nonanal, decanal, (E)-2-nonenal, and 1-octen-3-ol. Among them, 1-octen-3-ol and (E)-2-nonenal were the most contributing flavor compounds in the FG and MG groups, respectively, providing distinctive odor to goat meat.

AB  - Living in groups has many benefits including predator protection and information sharing that can outweigh the associated costs. African savannah elephants live in a matriarchal fission-fusion social structure where groups merge or split depending on the relative costs of group living. However, elephants are also nonsynchronous breeders which may cause optimal movement patterns to differ between group members, particularly around parturition. Both the mother and the group must assess whether the benefits outweigh the costs of group cohesion. Understanding the impact of gestation, parturition and the presence of a newborn calf on the mother's movement patterns could provide key insights into the drivers of fission-fusion social dynamics. Here, we examined the relationship between reproductive state and movement using GPS tracking data collected during 23 parturitions from multiparous elephants (> second calving) and three from primiparous females. We analysed daily mean speed before, during and after parturition, and used a three-state hidden Markov model to determine whether parturition results in a distinctive change in speed. The results show that, although speed decreased on the estimated parturition date, parturition could only be detected in four of 23 multiparous parturition events when placed in the context of speed over a 2-month period. Furthermore, the speed on the day before and the day after parturition (i.e. first complete day of the calf's life) was not significantly different from the yearly mean. By contrast, a speed decrease was detected in the limited sample of primiparous females but was of short duration. Our results indicate that the precocial abilities of calves facilitate the maintenance of group cohesion within the matriarchal fission-fusion social structure of elephants. We speculate that, alongside cognitive development, elephants may have evolved a long gestation period to facilitate an advanced stage of fetal physical development.

AB  - Simple Summary The Himalaya blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) in Baima Snow Mountain is found to exhibit a distinctive bimodal distribution along elevation gradient contrasting the unimodal distributions of most species. The first distributional peak of Himalaya blue sheep was in scree habitat around 4100 m a.s.l., while the second peak was in the dry-hot valley around 2600 m. Geographic separation from the original population along elevation suggested that population at lower elevation could be a separate species ecologically, or a taxa ongoing differentiation. Invasive species Opuntia ficus-indica, which colonized the region six hundred years ago, may have formed new foraging niche to support population at lower elevation. Our results suggested conservation measures should pay attention to taxa ongoing differentiation, and consider the possible active effect of biological invasion. The elevational range where montane species live is a key factor of spatial niche partitioning, because the limits of such ranges are influenced by interspecies interaction, abiotic stress, and dispersal barriers. At the regional scale, unimodal distributions of single species along the elevation gradient have often been reported, while discontinuous patterns, such as bimodal distributions, and potential ecological implications have been rarely discussed. Here, we used extensive camera trap records to reveal the elevation distribution of Himalaya blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) and its co-existence with other ground animal communities along a slope of Baima Snow Mountain, southwest China. The results show that Himalaya blue sheep exhibited a distinctive bimodal distribution along the elevation gradient contrasting the unimodal distributions found for the other ungulates in Baima snow mountain. A first distributional peak was represented by a population habituating in scree habitat around 4100 m, and a second peak was found in the dry-hot valley around 2600 m. The two distinct populations co-existed with disparate animal communities and these assemblages were similar both in the dry and rainy seasons. The extremely low abundance of blue sheep observed in the densely forested belt at mid-elevation indicates that vegetation rather than temperature is responsible for such segregation. The low-elevation population relied highly on Opuntia ficus-indica, an invasive cactus species that colonized the region six hundred years ago, as food resource. Being the only animal that developed a strategy to feed on this spiky plant, we suggest invasive species may have formed new foraging niche to support blue sheep population in lower elevation hot-dry river valleys, resulting in the geographic separation from the original population and a potential morphological differentiation, as recorded. These findings emphasize the important conservation values of role of ecological functions to identify different taxa, and conservation values of apparent similar species of different ecological functions.

AB  - Aphids exploit different patches that offer a favourable habitat during their life cycle. Continuous colonization of new patches is critical for the survival of these insect pests. We developed a mesocosm experimental system to study the effects of stress regimes on the colonization of plants by aphids. In the first experiment, we treated Eruca sativa Mill (arugula) plants with either low ozone (O-3) (ambient air with no O-3 added), elevated O-3 (ambient air with O-3 addition) or low O-3 + Myzus persicae aphid feeding, with subsequent observation of natural aphid infestation over time. The second experiment consisted of aphid sources and differently treated aphid sinks. The aphid sources were also exposed to either low or high O-3 levels. The colonization of the sinks was then monitored over time and distance from source. The infestation rate was increased if the patches had been recently exposed to aphid herbivory. On the contrary, aphids did not colonize patches that experienced a recent O-3 episode. The patches of E. sativa plants without prior biotic or abiotic stress were colonized by aphids at the beginning of the experiment, but infestation was poor and most of the plants remained aphid-free throughout the experiment. Aphids from control patches had a better chance of successfully disseminate on hosts with previous herbivory, and aphid spread from O-3-stressed plants was generally poor. Hence, the colonization risk for a generalist aphid plague will depend on the space-time arrangement between crop patches with different stress levels. Ozone contamination could have a negative effect on the spread infestation of aphids in annual crops, because of habitat fragmentation. Here, we present important information to understand how physiological traits of individuals can be scaled up to predict changes within populations in a scenario of climate change.

AB  - The use of lethal methods to manage locally overabundant wildlife populations is rarely without some level of public opposition or debate. While a range of factors have been found to be associated with public support for the use of lethal methods, research has predominately focused on a small set of species in a limited number of countries. We build the evidence base in this area by presenting the results of a quasi-experimental study conducted in Victoria, Australia, to understand what influences public attitudes towards using lethal methods to manage overabundant kangaroo and koala populations. A computer assisted telephone survey of 1000 Victorians measured how attitudes towards lethal methods differed across different scenarios. Results indicate that while there was almost equal support and opposition to the use of lethal methods overall, survey respondents were more likely to support lethal methods if welfare reasons were given as justification, if the target species were kangaroos (rather than koalas), and if the impacts were occurring now rather than in future. Age, gender and profession were also significantly associated with support or opposition. These findings can help wildlife managers engage better with the public when lethal methods are required to manage overabundant populations.

AB  - Simple Summary: The dispersion of ixodid ticks depends on their hosts, with tick density correlating positively with host density. Water deer, designated as harmful wildlife due to their foraging activities in croplands, are considered significant hosts for dispersing ixodid ticks within human residential areas. Over the course of two years, a substantial number of water deer captured while entering croplands were subjected to analysis for the presence of parasitic ixodid ticks. The findings revealed a notable mean intensity of nymphs and adults during summer, whereas larvae were found to be more abundant during fall. The number of larvae correlated positively with the population density of water deer. MaxEnt modeling predicted broad distribution areas for water deer in summer, coinciding with abundant crops, and similarly for nymphs and adults, which peak in summer. Forest valleys converted into croplands are expected to promote ixodid tick dispersion due to alignment with the habitat preferences of water deer and increased crop utilization. Since agricultural factors contribute significantly to the occurrence of tick-borne diseases, preventive measures such as selective land clearing and crop selection should be implemented to mitigate human contact with ixodid ticks in farming environments. Tick-borne diseases result from human-ixodid tick encounters, making it crucial to understand host-ixodid tick interactions and host-dependent distribution for epidemiology and prevention. This study examines water deer patterns and ixodid tick interactions in designated croplands of South Korea over two years, finding that the highest deer presence occurred in July and the lowest in May, during crop harvesting. Four tick species were identified, with Haemaphysalis longicornis being predominant (92.2%). Tick life stage analysis revealed peak nymphs and adults in July and larvae in October. Nymph abundance correlated positively with nearby water deer. MaxEnt biodiversity prediction results indicated wider water deer distribution in summer, reflecting their tendency to use multiple croplands. Areas with nymphs and adults aligned with predicted deer presence in summer, while larval areas aligned in autumn. Increased agroforestry expanded water deer habitats, enhancing tick dispersion. Prevention involved minimizing human-deer encounters by strategic land use in tick-prone areas. This comprehensive study provides insights into preventing severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome in agricultural workers, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions based on host behavior and tick life stages in different seasons.

AB  - The study of the feeding habits of Weddell seals, Leptonychotes weddellii, in the Antarctic Peninsula region is essential to understand their ecological role in the marine food webs, especially considering that this is one of the geographical areas most affected by climate change. The aims of this study were 1) to examine the diet of Weddell seals during the molting/resting stage of their annual cycle throughout five summer seasons 2) to assess the temporal variation in the diet composition 3) to determine the possible association of their feeding habits to climatic and oceanographic events such as El Nino Southern Oscillation ENSO and Southern annular mode (SAM). A total of 339 faecal samples were collected at Hope Bay between 2008/9 and 2013/14. Scat analysis indicated that, overall, fish constituted the dominant and most frequent prey taxon (F: 98.8%), followed by cephalopods (F: 33. 6%). Pleuragramma antarctica was the dominant and most frequent fish prey species representing, in average, 74.5% in numbers and 49.4% in mass of all the fish consumed. Cephalopods were mainly represented by the octopod Pareledone turqueti which represented, respectively, 53.7% and 56.8% in numbers and biomass of cephalopod prey consumed. Weddell seals preyed on demersal-benthic as well as pelagic resources. However, though octopods of the genus Pareledone were uniformly common as prey during the whole study period, P. antarctica became more dominant under negative SAM conditions and warm phase (El Nino) of ENSO.

AB  - African Swine Fever (ASF) is a severe viral disease that has significantly impacted the pig farming industry in China. It first broke out in China in 2018 and quickly spread to multiple provinces, significantly affecting the production efficiency of the pig farming industry. This study utilized pig production data from 17 provinces in China from 2010 to 2022 and applied the Malmquist production efficiency index and panel regression methods to assess the impact of the ASF epidemic on the efficiency of the pig farming industry. The results indicated that the outbreak of ASF significantly reduced overall production efficiency, which magnified the vulnerabilities of the production system. Although there was a general decline in technological change and pure technical efficiency, the increase in scale efficiency suggested effective resource optimization by farmers under resource-constrained conditions. In light of these findings, it is recommended to strengthen biosecurity education and epidemic prevention measures in the pig farming industry and to enhance technological innovation and the application of smart technologies to improve production efficiency and disease response capabilities. Additionally, timely adjustments in farming scale and resource optimization will be key to addressing future challenges. Through these strategies, the pig farming industry can maintain stable production efficiency during future epidemics and push towards a more efficient and refined production model.

AB  - Mitochondrial DNA signatures based on the control region and 12S rRNA gene were used to assess the impact of conservation measures on the effective management of vulnerable Syngnathiformes (seahorses, pipefishes, and allies) species. Results from phylogenetic inference, polymorphism, neutrality indices, haplotype networks and microhabitat information may justify the establishment of distinct management units for different species.For smooth seahorses, Hippocampus kuda was identified as a species complex that formed three clusters with 20 haplotypes. Based on molecular data, these are the first records of Hippocampus capensis and Hippocampus casscsio in the Philippines. High haplotype diversity (h = 28; Hd = 0.943), yet low nucleotide diversity (Pi:0.18095) for polymorphism, suggests minor differences among haplotypes. Neutrality indices calculated using Tajima's D (-2.00774), with P < 0.05 and Fu's Fs (-11.645), were significant. However, both tests were negative, a signature of rapid population expansion from a small effective population size, which could be attributed to past heavy harvests and habitat destruction, as supported by local data.For pipefishes and their allies, there was high haplotype diversity (h = 22; Hd = 0.875) and low nucleotide diversity of Pi: 0.16671. However, neutrality indices calculated using Tajima's D (-1.68518) and Fu's Fs (11.549) were not significant, with P > 0.05, indicating a balancing selection for this population.Results reveal that the recent population expansion of seahorses proves that current conservation measures are effectively safeguarding populations, while balancing selection is maintaining genetic polymorphism in pipefishes and their relatives, making them resilient to changing environments. Moreover, as revealed by haplotype networks, intraspecific variation suggests distinct management for different species.In addition, underwater surveys show an essential association between microhabitats and species' survival, thus encouraging future initiatives regarding habitat protection, especially coral reefs, seagrass beds, sponge gardens, mangrove areas and estuaries.

AB  - Background: Sorocephalus imbricatus (Thunb.) R.Br. is a range-restricted species endemic to the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), South Africa. It is currently classified as Critically Endangered in accordance with the IUCN criteria. Like many other species endemic to the CFR, S. imbricatus is subjected to several major threats in-cluding habitat loss, habitat degradation and the impacts of invasive alien species. Sorocephalus imbricatus was recently identified as a species requiring improved representation in ex-situ collections. During field work undertaken to collect germ plasm for this purpose, a concerning number of dead and dying plants were observed. Objectives: To determine the cause of rapid death of individuals in a remnant subpopulation of S. imbricatus. Method: A field visit to a subpopulation of the only extant population, Elands-kloof, was conducted to examine the symptoms associated with S. imbricatus mor-tality, and to collect samples for isolation and identification of putative pathogens. Results: Dead and dying plants showed clear symptoms of root and collar rot, with Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands recovered from all samples. The collections highlighted the severe impact of P. cinnamomi on S. imbricatus, with the size of the subpopulation being reduced from 62 to 37 individuals (a 40% reduction) between October 2021 and May 2022. Conclusion: This study describes, for the first time, rapid mortality of the Criti-cally Endangered Proteaceae species, S. imbricatus, likely caused by the invasive pathogen P. cinnamomi. This concerning discovery highlights the urgent need for greater recognition of the threat P. cinnamomi poses not only to S. imbricatus, but to the broader floristic diversity of the CFR. Importantly, it illustrates a need for a substantial body of work to be undertaken to address a significant lack of knowl-edge regarding the relative threat that P. cinnamomi poses to species of the CFR.

AB  - For over 300 million years, insects have relied on symbiotic microbes for nutrition and defence. However, it is unclear whether specific ecological conditions have repeatedly favoured the evolution of symbioses, and how this has influenced insect diversification. Here, using data on 1,850 microbe-insect symbioses across 402 insect families, we found that symbionts have allowed insects to specialize on a range of nutrient-imbalanced diets, including phloem, blood and wood. Across diets, the only limiting nutrient consistently associated with the evolution of obligate symbiosis was B vitamins. The shift to new diets, facilitated by symbionts, had mixed consequences for insect diversification. In some cases, such as herbivory, it resulted in spectacular species proliferation. In other niches, such as strict blood feeding, diversification has been severely constrained. Symbioses therefore appear to solve widespread nutrient deficiencies for insects, but the consequences for insect diversification depend on the feeding niche that is invaded.
   Insects rely on symbiotic microbes for nutrition and defence. Analysing a large dataset of microbe-insect symbioses, the authors show that symbiosis evolved in response to nutrient deficiencies but its impacts on insect diversification depend on their feeding niche.

AB  - Interspecific competition among insect herbivores is widely regarded as a significant selection pressure that impacts the distribution, abundance, and structure of their populations. Facilitator-mediated interactions, such as mutualism, have the capacity to modify the dynamics of competition. Furthermore, temporal fluctuations have been demonstrated to modify the outcome of competition. This study reanalyzes data on competition for space between two phytophagous insects commonly known as scales, namely Toumeyella martinezae Kondo and Gonz & aacute;lez (Hemiptera: Coccidae) and Opuntiaspis philococcus Cockerell (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), considering the presence or absence of Liometopum apiculatum Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) (a mutualistic ant species of T. martinezae) and the associated effects on their population structures. A total of 27 Myrtillocactus geometrizans (Mart. ex Pfeiff.) Console 1897 (Cactaceae) plants were selected for the study, with the presence of the study insects. The plants were then classified into one of five conditions: (1) O. philococcus in the absence of competition; (2) T. martinezae in conjunction with the mutualistic ant, L. apiculatum, in the absence of competition; (3) T. martinezae without competition; (4) T. martinezae and O. philococcus in competition, with the mutualistic ant; and (5) T. martinezae and O. philococcus in competition, without the mutualistic ant. A photographic record was maintained for a period of 6 months, during which the population structure was determined according to the size of each individual scale. The total abundance and relative space appropriation for each scale species were then estimated. The study revealed variations in spatial occupation over time. Toumeyella martinezae occupied more space during the initial months of the study, whereas O. philococcus predominated toward the termination of the study period. Competitive interaction significantly affected the population structure, changing over time and between species. In conclusion, the competitive dynamics changed over time, and the presence of the mutualistic ant had a significant effect, allowing the two competitors to coexist.

AB  - The impact of pig slurry (PS) application on the structural dynamics of humic substances (HS) and on the mobility of Cu, Zn, Ni, and Pb in a dystrophic Red Nitosol planted with winter forage grasses was evaluated. After four PS applications, the humic acids (HA) and fulvic acids (FA) were characterized by spectroscopy techniques allied to chemometrics methods. The metals contents in soil, in HS and in the tissues of plant were quantified. PS application increases the total organic carbon, especially the nonhumic carbon, which contribute to increase FA content. The carbon in FA and HA increases with the highest PS dose applied, especially aliphatic structures in FA and aromatic structures in HA. The amount of Pb and Cu in FA and HA increases respectively, as well as Cu, Zn, Ni, and Pb bioavailable. PS applications increase the biomass production in grasses and the metals content accumulated in the tissues. Our study shows that the PS application modifies the structure of SOM, incorporating fragments, and modifying its dynamics, which regulates the dynamics and the accumulation of metals in soils and plants. The association of metals with soluble structures seems to inactivate their toxicity and does not affect plant growth.

AB  - To elucidate genetic variability in vigilance behaviour for reindeer with historical differences in their interactions with predators and humans, we measured vigilance frequency and duration for grazing reindeer in Southern Norway (Rondane and Norefjell-Reinsjofjell), Svalbard (Edgeoya and Nordenskiold Land) and Barf/Royal Bay and Busen in the southern Hemisphere (South Georgia). Averaged for all areas, frequency and duration of vigilance bouts were less than 0.5 and 2.5 s, respectively. Frequency was insignificantly 1.3 times higher in Rondane than Edgeoya, and significantly 2.0, 3.5, 5.2 and 12.4 times higher than Norefjell, Nordenskiold Land, Barf/Royal Bay and Busen, respectively. Duration per vigilance bout was not different amongst the areas. Thus, while frequency varied considerably, duration remained constant, supporting a hard-wired adaptation to, among other suggestions, an open landscape. Plasticity in frequency allows for flexible behavioral responses to environmental factors with predation, domestication and hunting key drivers for reindeer. Other factors include (1) the open, treeless alpine/Arctic environment inhabited by Rangifer subspecies allowing warning time, (2) grouping behaviour, (3) relative low density of predators and (4) the anatomy and physiology of ungulate vision.

AB  - Eutrophication and rising water temperature in freshwaters may increase the total production of a lake while simultaneously reducing the nutritional quality of food web components. We evaluated how cyanobacteria blooms, driven by agricultural eutrophication (in eutrophic Lake Koyliojarvi) or global warming (in mesotrophic Lake Pyhajarvi), influence the biomass and structure of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish communities. In terms of the nutritional value of food web components, we evaluated changes in the omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of phytoplankton and consumers at different trophic levels. Meanwhile, the lakes did not differ in their biomasses of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish communities, lake trophic status greatly influenced the community structures. The eutrophic lake, with agricultural eutrophication, had cyanobacteria bloom throughout the summer months whereas cyanobacteria were abundant only occasionally in the mesotrophic lake, mainly in early summer. Phytoplankton community differences at genus level resulted in higher arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content of seston in the mesotrophic than in the eutrophic lake. This was also reflected in the EPA and DHA content of herbivorous zooplankton (Daphnia and Bosmina) despite more efficient trophic retention of these biomolecules in a eutrophic lake than in the mesotrophic lake zooplankton. Planktivorous juvenile fish (perch and roach) in a eutrophic lake overcame the lower availability of DHA in their prey by more efficient trophic retention and biosynthesis from the precursors. However, the most efficient trophic retention of DHA was found with benthivorous perch which prey contained only a low amount of DHA. Long-term cyanobacterial blooming decreased the nutritional quality of piscivorous perch; however, the difference was much less than previously anticipated. Our result shows that long-term cyanobacteria blooming impacts the structure of plankton and fish communities and lowers the nutritional quality of seston and zooplankton, which, however, is mitigated at upper trophic levels.

AB  - While many cities have embraced urban agriculture, research examining crop productivity in urban environments is limited. Little is known about how abiotic and biotic factors affecting productivity on urban farms compare with those in rural environments. In this study, we investigated environmental factors influencing strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) productivity for two cultivars at ten farms across a rural-urban gradient in Michigan, USA over a three-year period. We evaluated key drivers of production, namely temperature, pathogens, pests, and pollinators, which we hypothesized would be altered by urbanization. We found no direct effect of urbanization on strawberry production or fruit pathogen and pest damage. However, temperature, an environmental correlate of urbanization, significantly influenced crop productivity. In particular, cooler temperatures at rural farms and warmer temperatures at urban farms limited fruit number in the peak production year. We found no relationship between urbanization and overall abundances of arthropod pests, their predators, or pollinators. However, we found opposite effects of urbanization for two arthropod groups -Vespidae (paper wasps) and Araneae (spiders). Vespidae abundance was positively associated with increased urbanization. These omnivorous wasps are both predators of strawberry pests and pests of fruits themselves. Conversely, spiders, which are predators of strawberry pests, were negatively associated with urbanization. Greater pollinator visitation incrementally improved fruit weight, but only at low to moderate levels of pathogen and pest damage. At high levels of damage, the benefits of pollination were not apparent. Our study reveals that environmental drivers of variation in crop yield, such as pathogen and herbivore damage and pollinator visitation, can be comparable across rural-urban gradients. Some factors, however, such as temperature stress and the abundances of certain pest and beneficial organisms may be affected by urbanization. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Vehicle collisions kill at least one million ungulates annually in Europe. The number of traffic-killed individuals is usually relatively low for managed species, compared to the annual harvest quota. Therefore, traffic mortality in common ungulate species has historically been seen as a management and traffic safety problem, rather than a conservation issue. However, rare ungulate species, such as European wild forest reindeer (WFR) Rangifer tarandus fennicus, challenge this paradigm. The global population of WFR is approximately 5 300 individuals, divided into three main subpopulations: Suomenselk & auml; and Kainuu in Finland, and N-W Russia. WFR females generally produce only one calf per year, which makes this species particularly vulnerable to any additional source of mortality. Here, we investigate traffic mortality of WFR in Finland. For both Finnish WFR subpopulations we estimated a kill rate (the proportion of individuals killed/struck) and, in relation to their winter population sizes, the collision and traffic mortality rates. Our collision data was collected during 2017-2022 by volunteer hunters and consisted of 390 road traffic collisions (407 WFR individuals), with supplementary data on railway collisions. In total, 259 individuals were killed directly in road traffic collisions or euthanized later after tracking (kill rate 64 degrees%o). An age class (adult/juvenile) was determined for 265 animals (65 degrees%o), and the results indicated that noticeably more adults than juveniles were killed. In relation to wintering subpopulation sizes, there were higher collision and traffic mortality rates in Suomenselk & auml; (3.0 degrees%o and 2.0 degrees%o of the winter population, respectively) than in Kainuu (1.8 degrees%o and 1.3 degrees%o). WFR-train collisions occurred in both subpopulations. In Suomenselk & auml;, a railway mortality rate of 0.2 degrees%o was recorded, while in Kainuu it was 0.7 degrees%o. We found collision and traffic mortality rates that were relatively low and comparable with those of other ungulate species. However, the relatively high proportion of adults observed among road-killed individuals lends support for further studies to develop species-specific mitigation measures for WFR.

AB  - Twenty-five original prehistoric rock images from the Sahara in Libya, Niger, Mauretania and Algeria are presented which evidently or likely represent dama gazelles (Mammalia, Bovidae: Nanger dama (Pallas, 1766)). A literature revision of gazelles in North African rock art serves to interpret these new examples. Recurrent stylistic devices of engraved antelopes in rock surfaces are inferred. The rock images extend the known prehistoric range of the dama gazelle into the Fezzan (southwest Libya), the Western Desert of Egypt and the border triangle region Egypt/Sudan/Libya. Some rock paintings reveal the subspecies identity of dama gazelles, confirming the red-necked gazelle (N d ruficollis (Hamilton Smith, 1827)) for southwest Egypt. A long brown dorsal saddle patch combined with extensive white areas in their head skins likely proposes N d dama (Pallas, 1766) for the hitherto taxonomically undetermined populations in east-central Algeria, extinct since before taxonomists could study them. Our revision suggests that published conjectures of gerenuks (Litocranius rvalleri (Brooke, 1878)) or dibatags (Ammordorcas clarkei (Thomas, 1891)) depicted in Saharan rock images or in Pharaonic Egyptian art sometimes refer to misidentified dama gazelles, as far as they are interpretable at all.

AB  - Heat stress is one of the primary environmental factors that harm both the productivity and health of buffaloes. The current study was conducted to estimate the threshold of temperature humidity index (THI)1 and genetic features for milk yield of first-lactation Mehsana buffaloes using an univariate repeatability test-day model. The data included 130,475 first lactation test-day milk yield (FLTDMY) records of 13,887 Mehsana buffaloes and the daily temperature and humidity. The statistical model included herd test day as fixed effects, days-in-milk (DIM) classes, age of the animal, as well as random factors such as the additive genetic effect (AGE) of animal in general conditions (intercept), AGE of the buffaloes subjected to heat stress (slope), permanent environmental effect of animal in general conditions (intercept), permanent environmental effect of animal under heat stress conditions (slope) and random residual effect. It was expected that the general effects and the heat-tolerance effects would be correlated, represented by the present investigation's repeatability models. The variance components of FLTDMY in the present study were computed using the REML method. The threshold for THI was 78. At the THI below the threshold, the heritability estimated for the FLTDMY trait was 0.29, and the additive genetic variance (AGV) for heat stress conditions was 0. At THI of 83, AGV for heat stress conditions was highest for FLTDMY. The genetic correlation of general AGE to heat-tolerant AGE was -0.40. The results indicated that a consistent selection for milk production, avoiding the thermal tolerance, may diminish the thermal tolerance capacity of Mehsana buffaloes.

AB  - While successful plant invasions often occur in novel environments, invasive species usually occupy broad niches within their native and introduced ranges. A better understanding of the process of invasion therefore requires a wide sampling of ranges, and a good knowledge of introduction history. We tested for differentiation in herbivore resistance among 128 introduced (European, North American) and native (Chinese, Japanese) populations of the invasive Japanese knotweed Reynoutria japonica in two common gardens in the native range: one in Shanghai and the other in Yunnan. In both common gardens, we found that herbivore resistance of plants from introduced populations differed from that from native populations in China but not from native populations in Japan, the putative source of introduction. Compared to native Chinese populations, plants from native Japanese populations and introduced European and North American populations had thicker leaves in both common gardens, and a lower C:N ratio but higher flavonoids content in the Shanghai garden. Variation in herbivore resistance was more strongly associated with climate of collecting sites for populations from the native range than for those from introduced ranges. Our results support the hypothesis that introduction of particularly resistant plants from Japan may have played a key role in driving biogeographic variation in herbivore resistance. Our study highlights the importance of understanding introduction history to interpret the biogeographic divergence of global plant invaders.

AB  - Background: Gestational exposure to environmental chemicals (ECs) is associated with adverse, sex-specific offspring health effects of global concern. As the maternal steroid, cytokine and oxidative stress milieus can have critical effects on pregnancy outcomes and the programming of diseases in offspring, it is important to study the impact of real-life EC exposure, i.e., chronic low levels of mixtures of ECs on these milieus. Sheep exposed to biosolids, derived from human waste, is an impactful model representing the ECs humans are exposed to in real life. Offspring of sheep grazed on biosolids-treated pasture are characterized by reproductive and metabolic disruptions. Objective: To determine if biosolids exposure disrupts the maternal steroid, cytokine and oxidative stress milieus, in a fetal sex-specific manner.Methods: Ewes were maintained before mating and through gestation on pastures fertilized with biosolids (BTP), or inorganic fertilizer (Control). From maternal plasma collected mid-gestation, 19 steroids, 14 cytokines, 6 oxidative stress markers were quantified. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to test for differences between control and BTP groups (n = 15/group) and between groups based on fetal sex, respectively. Correlation between the different markers was assessed by Spearman correlation.Results: Concentrations of the mineralocorticoids deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, the glucocorticoids deoxycortisol, cortisol, cortisone, the sex steroids androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, 16-OH -progesterone and reactive oxygen metabolites were higher in the BTP ewes compared to Controls, while the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 & beta; and IL-17A and anti-inflammatory IL-36RA were decreased in the BTP group. BTP ewes with a female fetus had lower levels of IP-10.Discussion: These findings suggest that pre-conceptional and gestational exposure to ECs in biosolids increases steroids, reactive oxygen metabolites and disrupts cytokines in maternal circulation, likely contributors to the aberrant phenotypic outcomes seen in offspring of BTP sheep a translationally relevant precocial model.

AB  - Amphipod crustaceans are ubiquitous in temperate freshwaters, where they radiated multiple times in a broad range of habitats. This has led to significant morphological and ecological disparity. However, a limited knowledge of functional morphology and its relation to ecology has often led to the view that freshwater amphipods are omnivorous shredders. Herein, we hypothesise that trophic differentiation is related to functional morphology in a sympatric assemblage of three species belonging to three widespread families: Crangonyctidae, Gammaridae, and Niphargidae. We quantified seasonal diet composition by examining gut contents, and measured 42 functional morphological traits. Our results reveal a clear trophic and morphological differentiation among these sympatric species. The carnivorous Niphargus valachicus exhibited predatory traits exemplified by a smaller molar surface and stomach length, and larger/longer grasping, locomotory, and sensory appendages in comparison to the herbivorous Gammarus dacicus. The third species, Synurella ambulans, was omnivorous given its intermediate diet and morphology. We did not find consistent evidence for seasonal diet variation, except for the summer and winter diet of G. dacicus. The observed niches stretched along a broad trophic spectrum, indicating that even small riverine amphipod communities can exhibit significant functional disparity. The apparent connection between morphology and diet is similar to that observed in other crustaceans, strengthening our mechanistic understanding of the niche-morphology link. However, the generality of these conclusions needs to be tested on larger species datasets.

AB  - In coastal marine food webs, seagrass-grazer interactions play a fundamental role in ecological processes by regulating the structure and functioning of plant communities. Therefore, assessing the strength of these seagrass-grazer links and identifying the mechanisms that regulate these relationships are crucial to increasing our understanding of community and ecosystem structure and dynamics. Herbivory on the temperate seagrass Cymodocea nodosa was evaluated in four locations with contrasting abiotic and biotic factors (i.e., depth; meadow size; seagrass shoot density, productivity, and leaf traits; and herbivore presence) using cross-transplantation experiments carried out once per season to account for seasonal variation. Patterns of feeding rates on C. nodosa meadows showed high temporal variability, with peaks occurring in spring and summer. Results indicate that between 46.59% and 74.08% of the annual leaf production is lost to herbivory at the locations sampled in this study. Herbivory rates increased with higher nitrogen content and shoot density for all types of consumers (mesograzers, fishes, and sea urchins). This work highlights the need to integrate the abiotic and biotic factors modulating herbivory patterns, particularly in a foundation species like C. nodosa, for which changes in plant traits and grazer abundance may trigger trophic cascades with far-reaching consequences for associated species.

AB  - Chrysomya saffranea is an insect that is important in criminal forensics as it plays a large role in decomposition on human cadavers. In this paper, the different developmental stages of C. saffranea flies were studied in the laboratory on different food, such as meat, liver, fat tissue and mixed food, to test whether these media affect the development of their larvae and have an impact on the calculation of the post-mortem interval. Our results indicated a significant growth enhancement among flies that fed on the mixed food (pure fat, meat and liver minced in equal proportions) compared with those that fed on minced (pure fat tissues, pure meat of and minced liver) of buffalo. The present results also confirmed the impact of food on the growth of C. saffranea, as well as the post-mortem interval PMI.

AB  - This study investigated the degradation characteristics of propylbenzenes (PBZs, including isopropylbenzene and n-propylbenzene), with high leakage risks and ecological hazards, by a newly isolated marine microalga named Rhinomonas reticulata S6A which is a promising candidate for eco-friendly bioremediation from marine. About 72% and 56% of n-PBZ and i-PBZ can be degraded after 7 days in culture. The acute toxicity of n-PBZ (96h - EC50 = 2.38 mg/L) was higher than that of i-PBZ (96h - EC50 = 3.65 mg/L). The growth inhibition kinetics of this strain were consistent with the Edwards model (R-2 = 0.998) and Aiba model (R-2 = 0.999). The optimal concentrations for the degradation of n-PBZ and i-PBZ were calculated to be 2.42 mg/L and 2.78 mg/L, respectively. The degradation trends of PBZs conformed to the zero-order kinetic model, and k increased with initial concentrations. The moderate increase in inoculation density could accelerate the degradation of PBZs, with the maximum specific growth rates (r) of 1.116/d (n-PBZ) and 1.230/d (i-PBZ) at the initial inoculation density of 10(4) cells/mL, while over-inoculation (initial microalgae density more than 10(5) cells/mL) was not conducive to the degradation of the pollutants. There is not much data on the biodegradation of PBZs in the aquatic environment, so it would be worthwhile to try to apply the new microalgae to explore the fate of PBZs.

AB  - The populations and distribution areas of large carnivores have declined all over the world due to extirpation and habitat alteration and degradation. However, the grey wolf (Canis lupus) has recovered in Europe in recent decades and has been reappearing in Hungary since the 1990s. Since the dominant prey of this carnivore is the red deer (Cervus elaphus) and the wild boar (Sus scrofa) in Central and Eastern Europe, we aimed to study the impact of wolves on local deer populations. Based on hunters' opinions, we expected an increasing wolf presence and intense effects of wolves on the stress level and body condition of deer. First, we examined the occupied area by wolf in the North Hungarian Mountains. The distribution map was based on a questionnaire among the game managers. To measure the influence of the reappearing predator population on the red deer individuals, we estimated the body condition (kidney fat and bone marrow index) and stress hormone level of faecal samples. We compared them between the areas colonised by wolves and control sites in the mountains. We revealed an increased distribution area of wolves in the mountains since 2014. The stress hormone level was lower in the wolf-free sites in the case of faeces gathered from the ground, but there was similar amount of cortisol in the samples collected from the hunted animals. The body condition indices were not different between the two area types (average kidney fat index > 100% and almost 100% for the bone marrow fat content). Our results do not support a very intense recent impact of the wolf population on the body condition and stress level of red deer in Hungary.

AB  - Metagenomic sequencing, basing on whole genomic analysis, was carried out to explain the taxonomic and functional patterns of microbial communities in co-digestion and mono-digestions with corn straw and pig manure. Bacteroides graminisolvens and Clostridium stercorarium, the dominant species for corn straw degradation, and Proteiniphilum acetatigenes, emphasizing on protein decomposition, performed the optimum abundance during the co-digestion to improve efficiency of substrate decomposition. Methanosaeta concilii was the richest species during the process of bio-methane production, whose quantity and status in co-digestion were better than in mono-digestion. Analysis of functional patterns indicated that the carbohydrate-active enzymes in co-digestion were sustained abundant resulting short lag time, and the abundance of enzymes involving in methanogenesis were extremely high in co-digestion indicating the active methane metabolism. An adequate understanding of taxonomic and functional patterns further revealed the mechanism of rapid startup and superb methane production in co-digestion.

AB  - The study of host-parasite interactions is key to understanding ecological interactions since parasites play a crucial role in the regulation of populations of host species. The families Nycteribiidae and Streblidae (Diptera: Hippoboscoidea) are ectoparasitic flies specific to bats, which have evolved adaptations to their host. The host-parasite interactions are formed by coevolutionary processes and illustrate the current and historical associations between the species involved. For this reason, the use of ecological networks in parasite-host interactions allows us to elucidate how the structure of their interactions respond to biotic and abiotic factors. In the present study, we evaluated changes in the fly-bat interaction networks in two contrasting landscapes in the Department of Arauca of the Colombian Orinoquia Region. The first landscape is composed of savannas and alluvial forests and the second with anthropogenic disturbances composed of cocoa crops, livestock areas and human settlements. We used mist nets to capture bats and collect their respective parasitic flies. Using this data, we built a bipartite interaction network for each landscape, and we calculated the main metrics of each network. 19.8% of the 524 bats captured presented ectoparasitic flies, with a total of 326 flies belonging to nine genera of Streblidae and one genus of Nycteribiidae. The diversity and prevalence of ectoparasitic flies of bats was higher for the disturbed landscape in contrast to savannas and forests. The networks of both landscapes were characterized by being highly specialized and modular. Nonetheless, the network obtained in the savannas and alluvial forests showed greater specialization, and the landscape with anthropogenic impact presented greater modularity. Our results confirm the high specialization and modularity that characterizes the ectoparasitic bat-fly antagonistic network. Also, we provided new observations suggesting that a degraded landscape may affect the bat hosts and favors overcrowding and, consequently, the exchange of ectoparasites between bat species, reducing the level of specialization and promoting the increased prevalence of bat ectoparasitic flies.

AB  - In order to declare the effect and the underlying mechanism of biochar amendment on volatile fatty acid (VFA) emission during aerobic biostabilization of biosolids, different types of biochar (i.e., wheat straw biochar [WHB], sawdust biochar [SDB], and food waste digestate biochar [FRB]; 5% in dry weight) on carbon transformation and VFA emissions during 45-day aerobic biostabilization of biosolids were investigated. The results showed that biochar amendment improved thermophilic phase evolution and product dephytotoxification. During the 45-day period, in comparison to control, biochar addition promoted CH4 reduction by 44.46%-76.90% and enhanced the content of total organic carbon reduction by 20.60%-56.80%. In addition, biochar addition lowered the emissions of acetic, propanoic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, and valeric acids by respectively 23.43%-41.21%, 23.10%-43.92%, 42.62%-56.11%, 26.70%-58.20%, 10.56%-58.27%, and 33.74%-49.45% compared with control values. Moreover, biochar amendment facilitated organic matter humification during biosolid biocon-version as well. Among the applied types of biochar, SDB, with a higher surface area, was more efficient in organic matter degradation and VFA emission mitigation than WHB and FRB. In particular, biochar amendment increased the abundance and diversity of aerobic bacterial communities such as Acinetobacter, Desemzia, Geor-genia, Nonomuraea, Psycharobacter, Planococcus, Paenisporosarcina, Physchrobacillus, Staphylococcus, Thermobifida, and Thermopolyspora, while inhibiting the reproduction of anaerobic bacteria including Bacillus, Bacteroides, Corynebacterium, Ruminofilibacter, and Terrisporobacter during biosolid stabilization, thus improving biosolid maturity and stabilization and reducing VFA emissions. These findings offer a novel method with appropriate recommendations for the use and the selection of biochar in increasing the efficiency of biosolid aerobic biostabilization.

AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), Steinernema riobrave and Heterorhabditis floridensis are under evaluation for eradication of the southern cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus microplus infesting nilgai antelope, in South Texas. Cattle fever ticks are a significant threat to the U.S. livestock industry. Although they have been eradicated in the U.S. they frequently re-invade along the Texas-Mexico border. Remotely operated field sprayers have been developed to directly treat nilgai antelope with EPNs as they transit fence crossings and as they contact wetted foliage and soil from the surrounding area. EPNs are known to be susceptible to mortality from ultraviolet light (UV) and desiccation. A sprayable fire gel, Barricade (R), has been reported to protect EPNs from UV and desiccation but has not been tested on animal hides. Barricade (R) at 1 and 2 percent rates was mixed with the water solution of S. riobrave and H. floridensis and applied to cowhides (to mimic direct treatment of nilgai) and filter paper and then these substrates were placed out of doors in 0, 30, 60 or 120 min of sunlight. Wax moth larvae, Galleria mellonella, were exposed to the cowhides and filter paper to determine efficacy of the EPNs. Efficacy of S. riobrave with 1 and 2% Barricade (R) gel applied to cowhides was significantly improved at 30 and 60 min as compared to the control. At 120 min mortality of the wax moth larvae was near zero for both the control and the treatments. Similar results were found with the filter paper test. In contrast, efficacy of H. floridensis with Barricade (R) applied to cowhides or filter paper was not significantly improved at 30, 60 or 120 min as compared to the water only control. Barricade (R) has the potential to improve the efficacy of S. riobrave and other EPNs by reducing mortality and desiccation, especially when used in the remotely operated sprayer developed for treatment of cattle fever tick infested nilgai.

AB  - Nitrogen loss during composting is closely related to NH4+-N conversion, and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are important microorganisms that promote NH4+-N conversion. Since the biological activity of conventional AOB agents used for compost inoculation declines rapidly during the thermophilic phase of composting, new compound inoculants should be developed that are active during that phase. In the current study, the effects of inoculating cattle manure compost with newly isolated AOB (5%, v/w) [thermotolerant AOB X-2 strain (T-AOB2), mesophilic AOB X-4 strain (M-AOB-4), and AOB X-2 combined with AOB X-4 (MT-AOB-2-4)] on the conversion of nitrogen, compost maturity, and the resident microbial community were studied. During 35 days of composting, compared with the control, AOB inoculation reduced NH3 emissions by 29.98-46.94%, accelerated the conversion of NH4+-N to NO2--N, increased seed germination values by 13.00-25.90%, and increased the abundance of the microbial community at the thermophilic phase (16.38-68.81%). Network analysis revealed that Bacillaceae play a crucial role in the composting process, with the correlation coefficients: 0.83 (p < 0.05) with NH3, 0.64 (p < 0.05) with NH4+-N, and 0.81 (p < 0.05) with NO2--N. In addition, inoculation with MT-AOB2-4 notably increased the total nitrogen content of compost, prolonged the sanitation stage, and promoted compost maturity. Hence, MT-AOB-2-4 may be used to increase the microbial community abundance and improve the efficiency of cattle manure composting.

AB  - Based on previous studies, it can be assumed that the role of pIgR in Actinopterygii is equivalent to that of pIgR in mammals. Irrespective of this, however, it should be emphasised that this receptor is exceptionally diverse in vertebrates at different levels of phylogenetic development (Chondrichthyes, Actinopterygii, Sarcopterygii, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) and that the process of evolution of this protein requires further clarification. The motivated need for research further-more relates to the highly complex problem of analysing the genes of the receptor families included in ddIgSF in ray-finned fish, including the Act-pIgR genes and the characterisation of this receptor, as reported in the literature. The need for their continuation concerns, among others, the sites and efficiency of Act-pIgR binding to pIg in ray-finned fish, the widespread presence of this receptor in various organs and tissues of fish, and its location and role in local and systemic immunity. In addi-tion, issues concerning the structure of the SC Act-pIgR and the mech-anism of Act-pIgR binding to ligands need to be clarified, especially considering the absence of the J-chain in Actinopterygii and with the confirmed presence of this protein in Lungfish and some cartilaginous fish species (Table 2), as well as the differences in the structure of ILD5 in Actinopterygii, lacking the cysteine required for disulphide bonding, which in mammals stabilises the binding of this domain to dimeric IgA [58]. An indication for further research is also the divergent data regarding the presence and role of CDRs (Table 1), the absence of which in fish, as noted by Zhang et al. [20], may be unaffected by the transport of pIg by pIgR in mucosal tissues in Actinopterygii. The need to continue research and fully clarify the uncertainties related to the 'biology' of pIgR in Actinopterygii, in addition to the cognitive aspect, is also com-pounded by the practical importance of fish health protection and the need to be able to precisely and effectively prevent infectious diseases.

AB  - Simple Summary Parity can affect milk yield, milk emission kinetics, and somatic cell count in milk (SCC) in dairy animals, because the mammary gland plays an important role in milk storage capacity between primiparous and multiparous animals. On the other hand, European regulations provide specific SCC limits for cow milk due to it is a well-established indicator of udder health, but lack such criteria for goat or sheep milk. This research paper addresses the effects of parity and SCC threshold on the udder morphology, milkability traits, and milk composition during mid-lactation in Canarian goats. Results showed a positive association between SCC and total bacterial count with the parity, indicating an impairment of the udder epithelial tissue, as well as a greater susceptibility to bacterial infections in older goats. The proximity of the udder to the floor was negatively affected by the SCC threshold, and needs to be taken into consideration for the udder health of dairy goats.Abstract The effects of parity and somatic cell count in milk (SCC) threshold on the udder morphology, milkability traits, and milk composition was evaluated in 41 Canarian goats in mid-lactation. The animals were divided according to parity (1st, 2nd, and 3rd), and a SCC threshold of 2000 x 103 cells/mL in milk was set to evaluate the effect of this factor on the different measured parameters. Results showed that primiparous goats had the udder smaller and less distended than multiparous goats, but no differences were detected on milk flow parameters. Furthermore, SCC and total bacterial count (TBC) tended to be higher when the parity increased. On the other hand, goats with SCC <= 2000 x 103 had higher cistern-floor distance (CF) and lower TBC values compared with those goats with a count above the predetermined threshold. The results suggest that a reduction in SCC can be achieved by a selection of udder morphological traits. Moreover, milk flow parameters do not seem to be a tool to determine the udder health status in Canarian goats, but long-term studies are needed to verify it.

AB  - The phenomenon of renewal of the surface of the tegument in the acanthocephalan Corynosoma strumosum, which parasitizes paratenic hosts of different species, has been discovered and confirmed for the first time by electron microscopy. Under conditions of experimental invasion of Middendorff's eelpout Hadropareia middendorffii (Schmidt, 1904) (Zoarcidae), the separation of the glycocalyx from the tegument was observed on the third day of the experiment. In acanthocephalans found in fish dissected on the 14th and subsequent days of the experiment, and in fish infected in nature, the tegument was covered with the same thick layer of glycocalyx, which apparently formed again. A similar phenomenon was observed in two individuals of Corynosoma strumosum that invaded the halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis (Schmidt, 1904) (Pleuronectidae) in nature; however, their tegument lost the outer membrane along with a thick layer of glycocalyx. In other acanthocephalans that invaded this species of halibut, the tegument was covered with a thin layer of glycocalyx. It is assumed that the described phenomena are a morphological manifestation of the parasite's defense against the host's immune response.

AB  - Human activity affects plant and animal populations across local to global scales, and the management of recreation areas often aims to reduce such impacts. Specifically, by understanding patterns of human activity and its influence on animal populations, parks and recreation areas can be managed to provide spatial and temporal refuge to wildlife most sensitive to this type of human disturbance. However, additional research is necessary to understand how human activity influences wildlife populations, habitat use, and activity patterns for a diversity of wildlife species. We studied the potential impacts of human activity (as measured by nonmotorized recreationists) on populations and activity patterns of 12 mammal species, including herbivores and carnivores, from 63 motion-activated cameras that sampled game trails and human trails with varying degrees of human activity along the Front Range of Colorado. Human activity was greatest during the day and minimal or absent during the night. All wildlife species in our study used human trails, although the extent to which human recreation altered the occupancy, relative habitat use, and activity patterns of wildlife varied across species, where some animals appeared to be more influenced by human activity than others. Some species (e.g., fox squirrel, red fox, and striped skunk) did not demonstrate a response to human activity. Other species (e.g., black bear, coyote, and mule deer) altered their activity patterns on recreation trails to be more active at night. Across all wildlife, the degree to which animals altered activity patterns on human trails was related to their natural activity patterns and how active they were during the day when human activity was greatest; species that exhibited greater overlap in natural activity patterns with humans demonstrated the greatest shifts in their activity, often exhibiting increased nocturnal activity. Further, some species (e.g., Abert's squirrel, bobcat, and mountain lion) exhibited reduced occupancy and/or habitat use in response to human recreation. Managing spatial and temporal refuges for wildlife would likely reduce the impacts of human recreation on animals that use habitat in proximity to trail networks.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Intensified rice cultivation is mostly associated with high input of pesticides. Beneficial arthropods decrease in such environments while pesticide-resistant herbivores can increase, which, in turn, leads to even higher pesticide applications. To break the vicious circle, it is important to implement sustainable farming approaches. Here, we tested such an approach called "ecological engineering" (EE), where non-rice crops were grown in the surroundings of rice fields to provide additional food sources for beneficial arthropods. Farmers did not spray EE fields with pesticides in contrast to conventionally farmed fields, which had no crops in the surroundings, serving as a comparison. Additionally, we included control fields, which were neither treated with pesticides nor had crops in the surroundings. We interviewed farmers to obtain insight about their preference for crops growing in the surroundings and their willingness to use this approach. Our results showed that the yield of EE rice fields was equal to that of conventionally farmed fields. In addition, the benefit-cost ratio was highest for EE and the control fields highlighting their economic advantage. The abundance of parasitoids was lower in conventionally farmed treatments. The proper implementation of EE in combination with farmers' choice of crops is a promising solution towards sustainable rice production.
   Rice production is often associated with high pesticide input. To improve farmers' practice, sustainable management approaches are urgently needed, such as ecological engineering (EE), which aims at enhancing beneficial arthropods while reducing pesticides. Here, we implemented and tested EE in Cambodian rice fields by comparing: (i) fields not treated with pesticides (control); (ii) fields not treated with pesticides but with non-rice crops planted in the surrounding (EE); and (iii) conventionally farmed fields using pesticides (CR). Using benefit-cost analysis, we compared the economic value of each treatment. The non-rice crops preferred by men and women farmers as well as farmers' willingness to implement EE were assessed using surveys. We sampled arthropod abundance and richness in rice fields and bunds during two seasons. During the dry season, we compared EE and CR among three Cambodian provinces. During the wet season, we specifically assessed the differences in EE, control and CR in arthropod abundance and rice yield in one province. While withholding from using pesticides did not result in a decrease in yield in EE and control treatments, parasitoid abundance was higher in both treatments during the wet season. The benefit-cost ratio was highest for EE and control treatments. Pesticides were likely the main driver causing low arthropod abundance, without any benefit towards increased rice yield. The proper implementation of EE coupled with farmers' knowledge of ecologically based pest management is a promising solution towards sustainable rice production.

AB  - The Arctic is warming three times faster than the global average. Rising temperatures could reduce the snowcovered season and increase plant productivity in the spring, fall and summer. While this may increase carrying capacity of pastures and growth of semi-domesticated reindeer, rising temperatures could also lead to increase the frequency of ice-locked pastures, which may negatively affect reindeer body mass, survival, and reproductive success. We create a stage-structured bioeconomic model of reindeer herding that incorporates such counteracting effects of climate change on the economics of reindeer herding in Norway and Sweden. The model is calibrated using historical data on reindeer numbers and slaughter weights, in combination with historical weather data. We find that one more day with ice-locked pastures has a greater negative impact than the benefit of earlier spring. Then the model is used to simulate possible future economic impacts of three climate change scenarios, under different assumptions about herders' information about future weather conditions. The negative impact of icing outweighs any positive impact of earlier spring for all scenarios, and the potential loss is greater the less information herders have about future weather conditions.

AB  - AimPlant invasions are a global problem that requires studying plants and their environmental associations across native and introduced ranges.Location2000 km transects in China, Europe and North America.Time PeriodJune 2019-July 2020.Major Taxa StudiedJapanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica).MethodsWe surveyed 150 populations of Japanese knotweed, a noxious invader of the temperate zone, along 2000 km transects in native China and the introduced ranges of Europe and North America.ResultsWe found that larger plants and denser populations in the introduced ranges were associated with shifts in leaf economy and chemical defences. Introduced knotweed populations had higher SLA but reduced leaf chlorophyll, lignin, C:N ratio and leaf toughness along with altered leaf tannins, flavonoids and alkaloids. We found three distinct multivariate knotweed phenotypes primarily in the introduced ranges, and two multivariate knotweed phenotypes mainly in native populations.Main ConclusionsDecreased herbivore and pathogen impacts in introduced populations and changes in environmental associations indicate that enemy release and novel habitat conditions might have driven the emergence of novel ecological strategies in this global plant invader.

AB  - Wildlife abundance surveys are important tools for making decisions regarding nature conservation and management. Cryptic and nocturnal mammals can be difficult to monitor, and methods to obtain more accurate data on density and population trends of these species are needed. We propose a novel monitoring method using an aerial drone with a laser rangefinder and high zoom capabilities for thermal imagery. By manually operating the drone, the survey area can be initially scanned in a radius of several kilometers, and when a point of interest is observed, animals could be identified from up to one kilometer away by zooming in while the drone maintains an altitude of 120 m. With the laser rangefinder, a precise coordinate of the detected animal could be recorded instantly. Over ten surveys, the scouring drone method recorded significantly more hares than traditional transect spotlight count surveys, conducted by trained volunteers scanning the same farmland area within the same timeframe (p = 0.002, Wilcoxon paired rank test). The difference between the drone method and the transect spotlight method was hare density-dependent (R = 0.45, p = 0.19, Pearson's product-moment correlation); the larger the density of hares, the larger the difference between the two methods to the benefit of the drone method. There was a linear relation between the records of deer by the drone and by spotlight (R = 0.69, p = 0.027), while no relation was found between the records of carnivores by drone and spotlight counts. This may be due to carnivores' speed and vigilance or lack of data. Furthermore, the drone method could cover up to three times the area within the same timeframe as the transect spotlight counts.

AB  - An increase in biotic interactions towards lower latitudes is one of the most consistent patterns in ecology. Higher temperatures and more stable climatic conditions at low latitudes are thought to enhance biotic interactions, accelerating biological evolution and leading to stronger anti-herbivore defences in plants. However, some studies report contradictory findings, highlighting the need for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms. We used a combination of field observations and feeding trials in controlled environments to investigate the effect of climate on chemical defences and insect herbivory in pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) throughout most of its geographic range in Europe, while controlling for physical defences. The concentration of lignin, flavonoids, and total phenolics increased significantly with temperature, whereas both field herbivory and weight of spongy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) larvae were negatively influenced by temperature. Lignin concentration positively influenced the weight of spongy moth larvae whereas it had no effect on field herbivory. We found no evidence of strong positive relationships between insect herbivory and larvae growth with leaf defences. Our study underscores the complexity of plant-herbivore interactions along climatic gradients and highlights the need for further research to disentangle these intricate relationships.

AB  - The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is the largest fish in the world and occurs predominantly in tropical and subtropical waters. In Brazil, the species has a wide distribution, but data on its biology and ecology remain scarce. This study reports the first confirmed stranding of an adult whale shark on the coast of Rio Grande do Norte, northeastern Brazil. The animal, an 11.5-m-long male, stranded alive in August 2014. Despite rescue efforts, it died naturally, with no evidence of anthropogenic impacts. Necropsy findings confirmed natural death due to multiple organ failure. This case study helps to fill existing knowledge gaps regarding the specie<acute accent>s biology and ecology in Brazil, highlighting the need for long-term monitoring and research to support whale shark conservation, as well as the importance of strandings records as a management tool for these populations.

AB  - Environmental heat stress in sub-tropical climates negatively impacts boar semen production and its quality. The present study aimed to examine the heat stress alleviating effects of dietary linseed oil on semen quality and antioxidant status of boar, in the summer and winter seasons in sub-tropical climate. Six Hampshire crossbreed boars were fed with 90 mL linseed oil (treatment) whereas six boars of the same breed were fed 90 mL vegetable oil (control) for sixteen weeks during both season. Sperm quality was assessed for motility, viability, abnormality, acrosomal integrity, and Hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST). Sperm velocity attributes were assessed by computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA). Antioxidants (glutathione peroxidase; GPx, catalase; CAT, total antioxidant capacity; TAC and nitric oxide; NO) and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde; MDA) were measured in seminal plasma and serum. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used for the estimation of fatty acid composition of seminal plasma and spermatozoa. Feeding linseed oil to the boars significantly (p < 0.05) improved sperm quality at the fresh stage and after 72 h of liquid storage in both season. There was a significant (p < 0.01) effect of treatment and season on semen quality parameters. Significant boar (p < 0.05) effect was recorded on reaction time, semen volume, sperm abnormality, acrosomal integrity and HOST reactive sperm. There was a significant (p < 0.01) effect of treatment and season on the velocity attributes viz. VAP, VSL, VCL, ALH, BCF and STR%. Linseed oil supplementation significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced antioxidant and lowered MDA levels in serum as well as seminal plasma. The concentration of alpha-linolenic (ALA), arachidonic and docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acids were significantly (p < 0.01) increased in seminal plasma and sperm after linseed oil supplementation. In conclusion, linseed oil supplementation to boar during high THI months improved the semen quality parameters viz. semen volume, sperm concentration, and progressive motile sperm, along with enhanced antioxidant capacity.

AB  - Effective planning animal transport is essential to safeguard animal welfare and reduce production losses. Environmental conditions, specifically extreme temperatures in combination with ranges of relative humidity are highlighted as one of the main risk factors for production losses during transport (e.g., fatalities). The majority of research evaluating both welfare and production impacts of pig transport have been primarily undertaken in Europe and North America, which cover a relatively limited range of distinct climates (e.g., temperate, sub-arctic, etc.). As a result, research on pig transport in semi-arid conditions is lacking. In this study, we evaluated the effects of both distance (short, 30 km; and long, 170 km) and transport daily periods (morning, (05:00-11:00); afternoon (12:00-17:00); and night, (23:00-04:00)) on the preslaughter losses and heat stress of pigs in commercial transport in a semiarid region. Across 19 journeys of standard slaughter-weight pig loads (124.0 +/- 2.8 kg), 684 focal animals (36 per journey) were evaluated. For each journey, the load's thermal profile (THIadj and enthalpy) and physiological responses of individual pigs were recorded. On arrival at designated slaughterhouses, the percentage pig of non-ambulatory non-injured (NANI), non-ambulatory injured (NAI), death on arrival (DOA), and total losses were recorded. Short journeys in the afternoon were shown to be more detrimental to the thermal comfort of pigs, with higher rectal temperatures recorded. The highest percentage of total losses and DOA occurred in afternoon journeys, irrespective of distance, followed by the morning, with the lowest losses observed in pigs transported at night. Additionally, total losses and DOA were further exacerbated by journey distance, with higher rates observed in short journeys. Higher percentage averages of NANI and NAI were observed in shorter journeys, but daily periods effects were only observed for NANI. These results further demonstrate the welfare and production loss risks associated with journey distance and time of day (representing varying environmental conditions) during road transport of pigs, whilst providing novel data in semiarid conditions. Careful and effective planning for pig transportation is essential to minimize heat stress and production losses. Consideration of the thermal environment on the day of travel, as well as providing flexibility to adjust travel times (e.g., early morning or evening), should help to mitigate risks of heat stress and production losses during pig transport.

AB  - Two of the main issues related to cured meat products are castration to avoid boar taint and the hefty reliance on soybean meal to feed pigs. However, data on the effects of immunocastration in pigs and alternative crop protein feeds on the sensory traits and consumers' acceptance of dry-cured loin are still limited. A preliminary study was conducted on the effect of sex type (surgical castrated male pigs and immunocastrated male and female pigs, at approximately 140 kg in weight and 7 months of age) and animal diet (pea vs. soya) on dry-cured loins. The study involved a sensory evaluation of six treatments, with a 3 x 2 factorial design, conducted by trained panellists and untrained consumers in Spain (n = 126) and Portugal (n = 80). The consumers were also checked for their skatole sensitivity using a pure substance. The results showed that the pea-based diet was significantly different (p < 0.001) from the soy-based diet, as determined by a trained panel of surgically castrated male pigs, although the immunocastration treatments were not split. Dry-cured loin from immunocastrated male pigs fed with peas was considered tenderer and juicier (p < 0.05) than those fed soya-based diets. The untrained consumer panel scored higher on the sensory traits (flavour, juiciness, and overall liking) from the loin samples of surgically castrated male pigs fed a pea diet. All consumers scored similarly in boar taint detection. This study demonstrates the applicability of the pea-based diet for the feeding of pigs destined for cured meat and highlights immunocastration as a tool that does not compromise the skatole detection score.

AB  - Simple Summary Thyroid dysfunction substantially affects quality of life, causing disturbances in different organs. A low intake of selenium and zinc can predispose to thyroid changes, resulting in hypothyroidism. A deficiency of selenium and zinc causes thyroid dysfunction and skin lesions. This paper describes natural cases of diffuse alopecia and thyroid abnormalities in sheep with selenium and zinc deficiency. The sheep had severe alopecia, and the thyroid hormones serum concentrations were below the reference values for the species. Zinc and Se concentrations were low in the serum and liver, and the thyroid gland was smaller than normal size. The present study is important as it is the first study examining zinc and Se deficiencies causing hypothyroidism in sheep. Furthermore, thyroid disorders affect the quality of life of humans and animals, and are associated with many organ-specific and non-organ-specific disorders. Thyroid dysfunction substantially affects the quality of life due to its association with various disorders in different organs. A low intake of selenium and zinc can predispose to thyroid alterations, resulting in hypothyroidism. A deficiency of selenium and zinc causes direct and indirect skin lesions, both by the action of free radicals on the skin and by thyroid dysfunction. The aim of this study was to describe natural cases of diffuse alopecia and thyroid abnormalities in sheep with selenium and zinc deficiency. Five adult sheep presented marked and diffuse alopecia, and the residual hairs were dry and brittle. The skin was thick and crusty, with marked peeling. The triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) serum concentrations were below reference values for the species. Zinc and Se concentrations were low in both the serum and liver. During necropsy, cachexia associated with serous fat atrophy was observed, and the thyroid glands showed marked atrophy. Microscopically, the thyroid presented multifocal to coalescent atrophy, with atrophied and dilated follicles, macrophage infiltration, and the presence of fibrous connective tissue. The skin revealed hyperkeratosis and edema. It is concluded that thyroid atrophy, alopecia, and hyperkeratosis are associated with low serum and liver concentrations of zinc and selenium in sheep.

AB  - The scientific question addressed in this study is how mammals in the Caatinga dry forest of northeast Brazil adapt to seasonal variations, specifically regarding their activity and occupancy patterns and species richness and composition. To investigate, we deployed camera traps across Furna Feia National Park during both wet and dry seasons in 2018. We utilized methods such as rarefaction curves, circular statistics, and occupancy models to analyze data collected from 44 and 40 sampling points during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. We obtained 485 records of 11 mammal species from six orders and nine families, including endangered species like Leopardus tigrinus and Herpailurus yagouaroundi. Notably, we captured the first photographic evidence of a free-living Dicotyles tajacu in Rio Grande do Norte state. Results indicate that some mammals adjust their activity to avoid peak heat, particularly during the dry season, with no significant change in species richness but with important changes in occupancy and relative abundance between seasons. Our research expects to shed light on mammalian ecology in seasonally dry environments, contributing to species management and conservation efforts.

AB  - Convergent evolution arises when unrelated species develop similar traits without a shared ancestral origin possessing those characteristics. While typically observed at the organismal level, it can also occur at higher levels of biological organisation. Polydnaviruses represent a striking example of convergent evolution. These viruses, divided into bracoviruses and ichnoviruses, were independently acquired by braconid and ichneumonid parasitoid wasps respectively, to deliver pathogenic genes to caterpillar hosts. Here we show convergent patterns across trophic levels, demonstrating that both bracoviruses and ichnoviruses induce changes in plant-phenotypic traits that specifically benefit their parasitoid partners, facilitating plant-mediated host discrimination. This is achieved through an interaction network triggered by changes in the polydnavirus-infected herbivore (via alteration in regurgitant composition) which eventually affected parasitoids' foraging decisions. Our findings unveil a novel ecological benefit that polydnaviruses offer to their parasitoid partners through intricate, plant-mediated effects, providing evidence of convergence in symbiont-induced responses in terrestrial trophic systems.

AB  - Negative human-elephant interactions (HEI) present a significant threat to the long-term conservation of Asian elephant populations and negatively impact the psychological well-being of local communities. The Brahmagiri-Nilgiri Eastern Ghats complex in Kerala is a key landscape for Asian elephant conservation and supports the largest single breeding population across their range. However, negative encounters between people and elephants are increasing in frequency and have become a prominent cause for concern. Despite this, the use of predictive distribution models to map the spatio-temporal patterns of human-elephant interactions across the landscape remains poorly explored. Compiling 1942 individual conflict incidents from compensation records, we dynamically extracted 16 ecological and anthropogenic variables identified in the literature as important drivers of interactions between people and Asian elephants. Using an ensemble modelling framework incorporating 10 algorithms, we constructed predictive distribution models for the wet and dry seasons from 2011 to 2023 to map the spatiotemporal distribution of regions at consistent risk of negative human-elephant interactions. Final consensus models achieved a mean accuracy of 0.91 (AUC) and 0.73 (TSS) respectively and suggested that the top predictor in influencing interactions is human population density. Regions within and adjacent to the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuaries (I and II) have the highest predicted likelihood of interactions, however risk-level differs according to season. During the dry season, areas including Kidanganad, Nulpuzha, and Pulpalli, within the Kurichiat, Muthanga, and Sulthan Battery Forest ranges, were identified as having the largest land area at risk. Conversely during the wet season, the Tirunelli and Trisshaleri areas in the Tholpetty forest range demonstrated the highest risk. Results provide valuable insights to inform effective mitigation strategies at the landscape-level.

AB  - Simple Summary The Danish pig industry, in collaboration with the authorities, has implemented several risk-reducing measures to prevent the introduction of African Swine Fever into Danish pig production. Ongoing risk assessments are conducted to adjust or establish new measures. The first outbreaks in a new area in Northern Europe often occur in wild boar, likely due to discarded food waste at rest areas and in forested areas. A fence has been established on the Danish-German border to limit the migration of wild boar from Germany to Denmark, and the limited population of wild boar in Denmark has been culled. All trucks that transport pigs or cattle are cleaned and disinfected at the border if they have been abroad, according to the DANISH Transportstandard. Through continuous contact with the feed industry, changes in the importation of feedstuffs and other auxiliaries are analyzed, and risk assessments for each feed item are conducted. Based on this, according to the Danish Product Standard, it is not permitted to store or use feed items such as hay, straw, silage, or bedding imported from areas with outbreaks of African Swine Fever on Danish properties with pigs. These types of feed items can contain parts of dead animals in which the virus can survive for a long time. Oil cakes, fats, and oils imported from countries with African Swine Fever may only be used after heat treatment.Abstract African Swine Fever poses a significant threat to pig production. An outbreak in Denmark would have severe economic consequences, potentially resulting in a loss between 335 million and 670 million euros. To mitigate the major risk factors, the Danish authorities and the Danish pig industry have implemented several risk-reducing measures. The small wild boar population in Danish nature has been culled, and a fence between Denmark and Germany has been constructed to stop or reduce the risk of migrating wild boar from Germany. All trucks arriving from abroad, intended for the transport of Danish pigs, are inspected, washed, and disinfected at facilities near the border before being allowed to transport pigs between herds or from herds out of Denmark. Cross-border trade of feedstuffs and potentially risky materials is continuously monitored. Based on risk assessments, feed types or bedding materials from countries with African Swine Fever that could contain parts of wild boar are banned from Danish pig herds. Certain types of fats and oils from countries with African Swine Fever can only be used after heat treatment. The import of whole kernels of corn, wheat, or barley is not considered a risk.

AB  - Background Glucocorticoids are often associated with stressful environments, but they are also thought to drive the best strategies to improve fitness in stressful environments. Glucocorticoids improve fitness in part by regulating foraging behaviours in response to daily and seasonal energy requirements. However, many studies demonstrating relationships between foraging behaviour and glucocorticoids are experimental, and few observational studies conducted under natural conditions have tested whether changing glucocorticoid levels are related to daily and seasonal changes in energy requirements.Methods We integrated glucocorticoids into habitat selection models to test for relationships between foraging behaviour and glucocorticoid levels in elk (Cervus canadensis) as their daily and seasonal energy requirements changed. Using integrated step selection analysis, we tested whether elevated glucocorticoid levels were related to foraging habitat selection on a daily scale and whether that relationship became stronger during lactation, one of the greatest seasonal periods of energy requirement for female mammals.Results We found stronger selection of foraging habitat by female elk with elevated glucocorticoids (e ss = 1.44 95% CI 1.01, 2.04). We found no difference in overall glucocorticoid levels after calving, nor a significant change in the relationship between glucocorticoids and foraging habitat selection at the time of calving. However, we found a gradual increase in the relationship between glucocorticoids and habitat selection by female elk as their calves grew over the next few months (e ss = 1.01, 95% CI 1.00, 1.02), suggesting a potentially stronger physiological effect of glucocorticoids for elk with increasing energy requirements.Conclusions We suggest glucocorticoid-integrated habitat selection models demonstrate the role of glucocorticoids in regulating foraging responses to daily and seasonal energy requirements. Ultimately, this integration will help elucidate the implications of elevated glucocorticoids under natural conditions.

AB  - During the past 30 years, there has been a growing belief in and promotion of agroecosystem diversity for pest management and future food production as an agroecological or nature-based approach. Monoculture agriculture, which produces most of our food, is considered to be highly vulnerable to pests in contrast to plant species-diverse agroecosystems which may possess a greater abundance of natural enemies, keeping pest populations under control. In this paper, we question the role of crop diversity for pest management and explore the relationship between crop and associated diversity and pests through the following processes: environmental stresses that favor monodominance; evolutionary adaptations that resist insect herbivores (genetic resistance response); mechanisms of spatial escape from insect herbivores (escape response); and the role of crop-associated biodiversity. We present strong evidence that not only questions the high vulnerability of monocultures to pest damage but also supports why monocultures continue to produce most of the world's food. Reference is made to the importance of targeted plant breeding and the role of trans-continental crop introduction supported by efficient quarantine for pest management. We conclude that-with the exception of irrigated rice-much more research is needed to better understand the role of crop diversity in agroecosystems for pest management and food production.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of global change on ecological communities is a major challenge in modern ecology. The gain or loss of particular species and the disruption of key interactions are both consequences and drivers of global change that can lead to the disassembly of ecological networks. We examined whether the disruption of a hummingbird-mistletoe-marsupial mutualism by the invasion of non-native species can have cascading effects on both pollination and seed dispersal networks in the temperate forest of Patagonia, Argentina. We focused on network motifs, subnetworks composed of a small number of species exhibiting particular patterns of interaction, to examine the structure and diversity of mutualistic networks. We found that the hummingbird-mistletoe-marsupial mutualism plays a critical role in the community by increasing the complexity of pollination and seed dispersal networks through supporting a high diversity of interactions. Moreover, we found that the disruption of this tripartite mutualism by non-native ungulates resulted in diverse indirect effects that led to less complex pollination and seed dispersal networks. Our results demonstrate that the gains and losses of particular species and the alteration of key interactions can lead to cascading effects in the community through the disassembly of mutualistic networks.

AB  - Purpose Phosphorus (P) is an essential limiting nutrient for plant growth in the red soils of southern China. Understanding how intercropping affects soil P fractions and availability is crucial for maintaining P demand in Camellia oleifera agroforestry systems. Materials and methods The effects of intercropping on the soil P fractions, availability and phoD-harbouring bacteria community were investigated in three plantation types: C. oleifera monoculture (CK), C. oleifera intercropped with Capsicum annuum L (CC), and C. oleifera intercropped with Arachis hypogaea L (CA). Results and discussion Intercropping significantly changed P fractions and availability. CA increased the NaHCO3-Po content but decreased the NaOH-Po content, while CC enhanced the NaOH-Pi content compared to CK. Additionally, CA increased the RAP content by 34.3%, whereas the CC depressed the NAP content by 40.4% compared to CK. Molecular analysis revealed that intercropping significantly altered the diversity of phoD-harbouring bacterial community. Correlation analysis showed that the Pi fractions were positively correlated with phoD-harbouring bacteria such as Oxalobacteraceae, Pseudonocardiaceae and Streptomycetaceae. However, the Po fraction (NaHCO3-Po) was significantly negatively correlated with the Chao1 index. RAP was significantly associated with NO3--N, the Chao1 index, Burkholderiaceae and Micromonosporaceae. MAP was significantly positively correlated with the Chao1 index and Burkholderiaceae but negatively correlated with Bradyrhizobiaceae. Conclusions The changes in P fractions and availability were driven by alterations in the phoD-harbouring bacterial community and soil physicochemical properties in the intercropping systems. Intercropping with Arachis hypogaea L was particularly effective in enhancing P availability, suggesting that this practice could be a planting strategy worthy of greater promotion in C. oleifera plantation.

AB  - Species are shifting their distributions in response to climate change. This geographic reshuffling may result in novel co-occurrences among species, which could lead to unseen biotic interactions, including the exchange of parasites between previously isolated hosts. Identifying potential new host-parasite interactions would improve forecasting of disease emergence and inform proactive disease surveillance. However, accurate predictions of future cross-species disease transmission have been hampered by the lack of a generalized approach and data availability. Here, we propose a framework to predict novel host-parasite interactions based on a combination of niche modelling of future host distributions and parasite sharing models. Using the North American ungulates as a proof of concept, we show this approach has high cross-validation accuracy in over 85% of modelled parasites and find that more than 34% of the host-parasite associations forecasted by our models have already been recorded in the literature. We discuss potential sources of uncertainty and bias that may affect our results and similar forecasting approaches, and propose pathways to generate increasingly accurate predictions. Our results indicate that forecasting parasite sharing in response to shifts in host geographic distributions allow for the identification of regions and taxa most susceptible to emergent pathogens under climate change. This article is part of the theme issue 'Infectious disease macroecology: parasite diversity and dynamics across the globe'.

AB  - Evaluating the concentration of trace elements in fish in the river is crucial for assessing the potential risks to humans from eating fish. In this study, we collected 315 muscle samples of seven indigenous fish species Abbottina rivularis (Basilewsky, 1855), Cobitis taenia (Linnaeus, 1758), Hemiculter leucisculus (Basilewsky, 1855), Misgurnus anguillicaudatus (Cantor, 1842), Oreochromis mossambicus (G & uuml;nther, 1889), Rhinogobius cliffordpopei (Rutter, 1897), Rhinogobius giurinus (Nichols, 1925) from the upper reaches of the Pearl River Basin in July, August of 2017 to investigate the concentration of zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and mercury (Hg) and further evaluate their health risk to humans. Trace elements analysis revealed that the average concentration of Zn (9.56 f 3.72 mg/Kg) was the highest, followed by Cr (1.67 f 1.15 mg/Kg), Cu (0.47 f 0.44 mg/Kg), Pb (0.78 f 0.12 mg/Kg), Cd (0.06 f 0.11 mg/Kg), As (0.19 f 0.56 mu g/Kg), and Hg (0.01 f 0.03 mu g/Kg). As the hazard quotient index is <1, the THQ and TTHQ associated with fish consumption represent a negligible non-carcinogenic risk to the health of local consumers. Instead, Cr (cancer risk value: 2.72 x 10- 4) and Cd (cancer risk value: 2.72 x 10(- 4)) pose a potential cancer threat to local residents who eat the fish studied, and it needs more attention in the monitoring of the aquatic product on human health. Our study could be utilized to implement essential interventions in ecological security and protection, and preventing the emergence of adverse situations.

AB  - Simple Summary Individual differences in excitable temperament and its effects on physiological stress responses are not adequately studied in goats. This experiment was conducted to determine if the temperament of goats affects their physiological responses when exposed to stress. Intact male Spanish goats were rated for excitability based on a three-point scoring system with a higher score (excitability score, ES) representing a more excitable temperament. Goats were then subjected to one of three treatments (TRT) for 90 min: (i) isolated in an open pen with metal grill panels, (ii) isolated in a pen with side panels covered using tarp sheets, or (iii) maintained as controls with no isolation. Overall plasma cortisol concentrations were the highest in goats with ES 3. Goats with ES 1 had the lowest plasma glucose and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was also the highest in the ES 3 goats. There is evidence that calm goats had lower physiological stress responses compared to goats with excitable temperament. This study was conducted to determine if excitability score (ES) in goats can influence their physiological responses when subjected to stress. Thirty-six intact male Spanish goats (8-mo-old) were individually weighed and scored for excitability: 1 for calm (13 goats), 2 for moderately excitable (11 goats), and 3 for highly excitable (12 goats). To impose stress, goats were assigned to one of three treatments (TRT) for 90 min: (i) isolation in an open pen with metal grill panels, (ii) isolation in a pen with side panels covered using tarp sheets, and (iii) no isolation (control). Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, and 90 min of isolation and physiological data were analyzed using MIXED procedures in SAS. The data from the two isolation treatments were pooled and compared with that of the control group. Plasma cortisol and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations were the lowest in goats with ES 1 (p < 0.05). Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios were also the lowest in goats with a calm temperament (p < 0.01). Application of full quadratic model using response surface methodology (PROC RSREG) in SAS revealed that the influence of ES on physiological stress responses over time was not the same between the TRT groups. The results indicate that physiological stress responses are greater in goats with an excitable temperament compared to goats with a calm temperament.

AB  - The present study is the first report on ticks infesting domestic animals of the tribal communities and wildlife in Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary, Kerala, India. Questing ticks in the sanctuary were collected through dragging methods and hand collection from domestic animals was used to collect feeding ticks. Among the total 3,081 ticks collected, 2,350 questing ticks were obtained from the forest floor, and 731 ticks were recorded from 40 different domestic animals belonging to four species. The present collection recorded eight Haemaphysalis species: Ha. spinigera, Ha. leachii, Ha. shimoga, Ha. kinneari, Ha. kyasanurensis, Ha. turturis, Ha. bispinosa, Ha. intermedia and one Amblyomma species: Am. integrum from the sanctuary. Whereas five Haemaphysalis species: Ha. bispinosa, Ha. intermedia, Ha. shimoga, Ha. spinigera, Ha. turturis and four Rhipicephalus species: Rh. sanguineus, Rh. haemaphysaloides, Rh. microplus and Rh. annulatus were reported from domestic animals. High abundance of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) vectors, Ha. spinigera and Ha. turturis have been documented from the sanctuary. Relative abundance of Ha. bispinosa was significantly higher in all the domestic animals examined. Tick infestation rate was higher in goats followed by cows, dogs, and cats. Whereas the species richness of ticks was highest in cows and lowest in cats.

AB  - Understanding the role that an environmental prion reservoir plays in the outbreak dynamics of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in free ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is critical for the allocation of disease surveillance resources by state and provincial wildlife agencies. We hypothesized that demographic, ecological, and epidemiological configurations naturally attenuate epidemic risk despite the introduction of infectious prions into a susceptible population of deer, but the magnitude of infectious prions in the environmental prion reservoir complicate outbreak expectations. We developed a Susceptible-Latent-Exposed-Infective (SLEI) compartment model to represent the dynamics of CWD epidemics in free-ranging white-tailed deer, then used the basic reproductive ratio (R0) to pinpoint counties under which pathogenic introduction (transport of infectious bodily fluids, tissues, and carcasses through natural or anthropogenic means) naturally produced (or failed to produce) an epidemic. We found that the outlook for an epidemic hinged on transmission rates, the magnitude of environmental contamination, and system type (density-, frequency-, or density/frequency-dependent). CWD can persistently infect individuals living in a contaminated environment even if direct transmission is insufficient to sustain circulation. Theoretical results show that transmission of CWD cannot be exclusively density dependent, and must behave as either a mix between frequency and density dependent, or strictly frequency dependent. While the compartment model is a simplistic representation of reality and did not contain many complicating biological considerations, it was immediately useful in hypothesis generation, motivating the collection of additional data for use in more biologically detailed models, and in the allocation of finite surveillance resources to place emphasis on data collection in areas where an introduction of infectious prions is comparatively more likely to result in an epidemic.

AB  - The southern elephant seal (SES; Mirounga leonina) has a circumpolar distribution, breeding mainly on sub-Antarctic islands and making long trips between breeding or molting and foraging areas. Most individuals from colonies in the South Shetland Islands (western Antarctic Peninsula; WAP) are distributed in Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA). Despite these protected habitats, pollutants can reach such remote areas far away from emission sources, affecting local fauna. To assess possible mercury (Hg) contamination in SES, we analyzed skin samples collected from free-ranging molting individuals using the remote biopsy PAXARMS system in Isla 25 de Mayo/King George Island (62 & DEG;15 & PRIME;S, 58 & DEG;39 & PRIME;W; ASPA 132). Hairless skin samples were analyzed to determine total-Hg (THg) concentrations, which ranged between 145 ng/g and 1,915 ng/g (M = 730, SD = 388 ng/g), showing significant differences between sexes, with adult-females having higher concentrations (range = 306-1,915, M = 859, SD = 427 ng/g dw) than subadult-males (range = 145-1,645, M = 629, SD = 329 ng/g dw). These differences may be explained mainly by feeding-niche partitioning between sexes. Females prefer mesopelagic prey or prey associated with sea-ice in the WAP, which are enriched in methylmercury. These results provide insight regarding Hg contamination in top Antarctic predators like SES, and the need to monitor for potential effects of Hg contamination in Antarctic marine mammals.

AB  - accurate way to estimate the planktonic food web topology is to consider biomass and flows. However, measurements of flows, as production and grazing rate, are time-consuming. In this paper, we retrace food web topology based on three different degrees of information: input flows (production), internal flows (grazing rate) and plankton biomass in freshwater marshes. For that, a meta-analysis of datasets from 4 freshwater marshes of the Charente-Maritime (French Atlantic coast) were used, corresponding to 47 stations/dates and thus to different geographical and temporal situations. The main results were that, globally, the biomass can yield good results in terms of characterization of the contrasted topology of food web, as the herbivorous food web, the microbial food web and the multivorous food web. However, in order to properly distinguish weak, 'normal' multivorous and strong multivorous food web, the only measure of biomass did not appear to be sufficient. To better separate these different types of multivorous food webs, measurements of primary productions or heterotrophic prokaryote biomass, which correlated well with primary productions, appear interesting. This approach can be applied in all aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - The objective of the study was to characterize the anatomical framework and sites of action of the nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated ovulation-inducing system of llamas. The expression patterns of NGF and its receptors in the hypothalamus of llamas (n = 5) were examined using single and double immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence. We also compare the expression pattern of the P75 receptor in the hypothalamus of llama and a spontaneous ovulator species (sheep, n = 5). Both NGF receptors (TrkA and P75) were highly expressed in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca, and populations of TrkA cells were observed in the periventricular and dorsal hypothalamus. Unexpectedly, we found NGF immunoreactive cell bodies with widespread distribution in the hypothalamus but not in areas endowed with NGF receptors. The organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) and the median eminence displayed immunoreactivity for P75. Double immunofluorescence using vimentin, a marker of tanycytes, confirmed that tanycytes were immunoreactive to P75 in the median eminence and in the OVLT. Additionally, tanycytes were in close association with GnRH and kisspeptin in the arcuate nucleus and median eminence of llamas. The choroid plexus of llamas contained TrkA and NGF immunoreactivity but no P75 immunoreactivity. Results of the present study demonstrate sites of action of NGF in the llama hypothalamus, providing support for the hypothesis of a central effect of NGF in the ovulation-inducing mechanism in llamas.

AB  - The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is the vector of Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent that causes Lyme disease in North America. Studies investigating host-parasite interactions are valuable in understanding I. scapularis ecology, and, by extension, the transmission of the Lyme disease pathogen. Small mammals are important hosts for I. scapularis, particularly white-footed mice and deer mice from the genus Peromyscus. Peromyscus spp. mice have been used as model organisms in several fields of research and are frequently trapped to evaluate broad ecological concepts. Previous studies have suggested that tissue-damaging marking methods were associated with increased tick burdens, which may have consequences in ecological studies. Our study was designed to evaluate 3 tissue-damaging marking methods including lab tags, round tags, and ear punches alongside a non-tissue damage control (blue dye) to determine if any method affected tick burdens on captured mice. Mice were captured biweekly using Sherman traps from May through September in 2020. The overall tick burden fluctuated between months, but no significant difference in total tick burden was found between captured male and female mice. There were no significant differences in tick burden on captured mice among the tissue damaging marking methods and the control. Therefore, marking method choice for Peromyscus spp. for tick ecology studies should consider personal preferences, cost, ease of use, and durability.

AB  - Among the fossil members of the giant panda subfamily of ursid carnivorans, Ailuropodinae, one group of species is of giant size, those of Indarctos. Indarctos species have some dental resemblances to and may be closely related to Agriotherium, although there are other clear differences between these taxa, and no known species has definitive shared derived traits that could link these two genera. Here we describe a rich suite of fossil material from both North America and eastern Asia, all belonging to a new genus, Huracan, which possesses characters shared with both Agriotherium and Indarctos but also has diagnostic autapomorphies. The new taxon was distributed widely in the Holarctic during the latest Miocene, including at least four species: the type species Huracan schneideri (previously Agriotherium schneideri) from the latest Hemphillian ( Hh4) and possibly early Blancan North American Land Mammal "Ages" (NALMAs), North America; H. coffeyi from the early Late Hemphillian (Hh3) NALMA, North America; H. qiui, sp. nov., from the Baodean Asian Land Mammal "Age" (ALMA), northern China; and H. roblesi from the MN13 zone (latest Miocene-earliest Pliocene) of Spain. Huracan is the nearest sister taxon to Agriotherium, the latter herein considered to be an ailuropodine (in the tribe Agriotheriini) rather than a hemicyonid, and the common ancestor of both genera evolved from Indarctos (with resultant paraphyly of that taxon) or another Indarctos-like ailuropodine bear, likely in eastern Asia. The dentitions of Huracan and Agriotherium both are more specialised for carnivory than most Indarctos species, indicating a radiation of diverse ecological carnivores earlier in the history of the laterdiverging, highly specialized herbivores in the giant panda lineage. Their postcranial morphology suggests that species in both genera (Huracan and Agriotherium) were more cursorial than species assigned to Indarctos, and thus well adapted to more open habitats. These derived traits may explain the worldwide replacement of Indarctos species by Huracan and Agriotherium species during the latest Miocene, in response to significant global cooling and expansion of C4 grasslands that occurred at that time.

AB  - Characterizing the extent of genetic differentiation among individuals and its distribution across the genome is increasingly important to inform both conservation and management of exploited species. The Greenland Halibut is one of the main demersal fish species to be commercially exploited in Eastern Canada, and accurate information on geographic population structure and local adaptation is required to ensure the long-term presence of this species. We generated high-quality whole-genome sequencing data for 1,297 Greenland Halibut sampled across 32 locations throughout the Northwest Atlantic (from Arctic Canadian and Greenlandic coasts to the Gulf of St Lawrence). Population genetic structure was analyzed, revealing an absence of population differentiation between Canada and west Greenland but significant genetic differentiation between the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the remainder of the Northwest Atlantic. Except for Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Greenland Halibut thus appear to be panmictic throughout the Northwest Atlantic. Environmental Association Analyses revealed that the environment explained up to 51 % might be replaced by 51% of the differentiation observed between the two stocks, with both ocean-bottom and surface variables (e.g., temperature and oxygen) involved in the observed genomic differentiation. Altogether, these results indicate that phenotypic differences previously observed between the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Northwest Atlantic likely resulted from functional adaptive divergence to their respective environmental conditions. Using coalescent simulations, we also assessed how high levels of migration between the two stocks would allow Greenland Halibut to potentially escape unfavorable environmental conditions in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. In addition to supporting the management of this important exploited species, this work highlights the utility of using comprehensive genomic datasets to characterize the effects of climate change across a wider range of species.

AB  - Studying survival in megafauna populations is a challenge. Survival can vary over time and can be altered by increasing pressures from human activities. Considering time variations in inter -annual survival or cumulative survival is necessary to evaluate conservation status and anticipate detrimental demographic changes before large declines in abundance materialize. Estimating survival is straightforward with mark -recapture methods but remains a challenge if individuals cannot be easily identified or recaptured. This is often the case for marine mammals because natural marks are insufficient to identify individual or because tagging raises insuperable logistical difficulties. Here, we propose to fill this methodological gap using age -at -death data with a flexible Bayesian linear modelling framework. We designed a simulation study with several scenarios of decline in survival and size of the data set. We also applied the approach to a real dataset on harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). We evaluated the ability of a model that includes both a trend and yearly random effects to estimate time variations in survivorship, age -specific survival, and hazard rates. We compared the performance of the model to that of simpler models. Our results show that the model is very effective in detecting a trend in survivorship, but can yield biased estimates of age -specific survival rates. We provide a pragmatic modelling framework to address time variations in a megafauna species survivorship using age -at -death data. This framework will enhance our ability to study populations that cannot be individually identified and to design proactive conservation management measures.

These samples were used to prepare a total of 114 moist chamber cultures, which yielded a total. of 12 species of coprophilous myxomycetes. Didymium nullifilum, Kelleromyxa fimilicola, and Perichaena liceoides were the most abundant, and all three are species rarely recorded from substrates other than dung. Physarum spectabile was recorded for the first time for dung, and only a tentative identification could be reached for two specimens of a problematic Trichia.

AB  - Context. Understanding the factors determining the impacts of roads and how they fragment landscapes limiting the movement of animals, is key to implement efficient mitigation measures. Aims. Here we investigate if road orientation in relation to limiting resources, a largely overlooked factor on road impact assessments, can influence the movement of animals within a landscape where water resources are spatially clustered. Methods. We evaluated movement by monitoring animal tracks on unpaved roads: two with a North-South orientation and two with an East-West orientation. Key results. Animals were more likely to follow roads leading to limiting resources (i.e. East-West orientation), confirming human linear structures can facilitate wildlife movements. Carnivores were more likely to follow roads with any orientation and for longer compared to ungulates, whereas ungulates followed roads mainly in the orientation of limiting resources. Conclusions. Road orientation affects how roads influence the movement of animals in landscapes where resources are distributed along a spatial gradient with different effects for ungulates and carnivores.

AB  - Bibrik sheep is found vastly in Baluchistan province in Pakistan. Randomly sampled animals of this breed were subjected to genetic analysis using ovine molecular markers where fifteen sheep SSR genetic markers were employed for describing multiple-allelomorphism. The average observed number of alleles (Na), effective number of alleles (Ne) and Shannon's Information Index were 2.07 +/- 0.79, 1.86 +/- 0.69 and 0.54 +/- 0.29, respectively. Heterozygosity was described by the average, observed and expected heterozygosities whose values were found to be 0.56 +/- 0.27, 0.44 +/- 0.27 and 0.43 +/- 0.26, respectively. Slightly higher magnitude of observed heterozygosity indicated that forces affecting Hardy-Weinburg Equilibrium were not much effective in these flocks and outbreeding was common phenomenon that reduced the inbreeding in the flocks as inbreeding tends to promote homozygosity. The range in observed heterozygosity was very wide for different molecular markers. These measurements underlined the absence of inbreeding in the flocks that commonly causes inbreeding depression. The presence of genetic diversity was apparent and these markers would be employed for identification of Bibrik sheep through DNA fingerprinting. It was concluded that present assessment of genetic diversity could be used as tool for making future breeding plans but large scale enumeration is required for the Bibrik sheep.

AB  - The late dry season is a period when forage resources become limited in some African savannas that can induce a strong demographic bottleneck in herbivore populations with limited access to resource heterogeneity. This study determined forage quality and quantity between wetlands and drylands habitats during the late dry season. We subjectively sampled forage characteristics in four habitat types around the distal reaches of the Tsum Tsum floodplains of the Okavango Delta during the late dry season of 2015. The habitat types were mopane and sandveld woodland far from floodplains (two major dryland habitat types), sandveld habitats that receive soil moisture inputs from adjacent floodplains (wet sandveld) and sedgeland habitat within the floodplain. Leaves collected from forage in each habitat type were oven dried, milled and analysed for total nitrogen. Data of greenness, height, biomass and protein were analysed using Kruskal-Wallis test. Forage in wet sandveld had by far the highest protein content (similar to 16%) of all habitat types but forage height and biomass were very low, whereas sedgelands had the highest biomass of adequate-quality forage, while dryland communities had the lowest quantity and quality of forage. Thus, foraging between a higher-biomass, adequate-quality reserve resource (sedgeland) and a high-quality but low-quantity bridging resource (wet sandveld) can help to ensure a balanced protein and fibre intake during the late dry season. Our study demonstrated the importance of wetland habitats for providing green forage with sufficient biomass and protein to sustain herbivores over the late dry season.

AB  - The protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit a (PPP3CA) gene is a high reproduction traits candidate gene for goats as revealed by a genome-wide association study. The aim of this work was to explore the genetic variations of the goat PPP3CA as well as to evaluate the genetic effects on litter size. Three novel insertions/deletions (indels) within the goat PPP3CA were found and their minor allelic frequencies (MAF) were 0.105, 0.066, and 0.042, respectively. The results showed that only the 20 bp indel polymorphism was significantly associated with litter size in Shaanbei white cashmere goats (P, 0.05) and individuals with deletion/deletion (DD) genotypes demonstrated the junior phenotypes when compared with those with other genotypes. These findings suggested that the 20 bp indel is a potential DNA marker for selecting superior individuals in marker-assisted selection for breeding concerning fecundity in goats.

AB  - Unsustainable pig breeding is a great threat to the environment. Ammonia is one of the main pollutants emitted in piggery vent air. This work is a comparative survey that presents the findings on the effectiveness of ammonia adsorption from air using various activated carbons (ACs). Detailed consideration is given to the effects of (i) type of raw material (wood char, wood pellet, and commercial lignite-based char), (ii) preparation method (CO2, steam, and KOH activation), and (iii) activation conditions (temperature and KOH/char ratio), on the porous structure of ACs and their ammonia sorption capacity and reversibility. Response surface methodology and genetic algorithm were used to find optimum KOH activation conditions. Economic analyses of AC production were performed using process modeling in Aspen software. It was found that ACs obtained from wood char in KOH activation show a maximum ammonia capacity of 397 g/kg, which is at least 2.5-fold higher than that reached on ACs from physical activation. A lower activation temperature (<750 degrees C) and a higher KOH/char ratio (>3) were preferred for effective adsorption, regardless of the type of feedstock. High sorption reversibility was achieved (87-96%). This makes the obtained sorbents promising sorbents for ammonia removal from piggery vent air with potential subsequent application as nitrogen-enriched biochar for crop fertilization. Thus, it facilitates sustainable pig breeding.

AB  - Haminoea are herbivorous, coastal snails occurring in temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific oceans, with one species present in temperate South Africa (Indian Ocean). The genus is taxonomically difficult as several available nominal species were introduced based on shell descriptions alone, or described based on subtle differences in morpho-anatomical features, without a phylogenetic molecular framework. Fifteen species are currently accepted as valid in recent scientific literature and field guides (eight Eastern Atlantic, one temperate Indian Ocean, four Western Atlantic and three Eastern Pacific). Here we generate the first complete phylogeny (Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood) of this genus based on multilocus molecular data (COI, 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, 28S rRNA) using a taxon set accumulated over a period of 15 years, coupled with species delimitation analyses methods (ABGD, ASAP, bPTP) and morpho-anatomical studies. The goal of this study is to provide insights into the taxonomy, phylogenetic relationships and geographical distributions of species while generating a framework for future systematic reviews of the genus, as well as to study speciation and historical biogeography. Our results rendered four possible hypotheses of species diversity: with 14, 15, 19 and 20 candidate species and point to the fact that several taxa presently regarded as valid might be conspecific (e.g. H. orteai-H. templadoi-H. exigua; and H. alfredensis-H. antillarum-H. orbignyana), while highlighting the existence of a complex of four or five species often identified as H. elegans. Pervasive nomenclatural problems in the genus, including with the type species H. hydatis, are highlighted and discussed.

AB  - The present study aims to investigate the distribution and expression characteristics of HIF-1 alpha, VEGF, VEGFR-2, VCAM-1, and IL-4 in the spleen of plateau yaks and plain yellow cattle and to speculate the possible regulatory role of HIF-1 alpha and its related hypoxia-inducible factors in the adaptation of the yak spleen to the plateau hypoxic environment. Histological features were observed using H&E and PAS stains. Immunohistochemical staining and optical density analysis were applied to investigate the distribution and differences in the expression of HIF-1 alpha, VEGF, VEGFR-2, VCAM-1, and IL-4 in the spleen of yaks and cattle. The results showed that the area of splenic trabeculae and splenic nodules was significantly larger in the yak than in yellow cattle (P<0.05). Glycogen was mainly distributed in splenic arterial endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, splenic blood sinusoidal endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, and the distribution was significantly higher in the spleen of yaks than in cattle (P<0.05). HIF-1 alpha, VEGF, VEGFR-2, VCAM-1, and IL-4 were mainly expressed in lymphocytes, arterial endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, splenic blood sinusoidal endothelial cells, and fibroblast cytoplasm, with higher expression in yak spleen (P<0.05). In conclusion, combining the differences in spleen tissue structure, glycogen distribution, and expression distribution of several hypoxia-related factors between yaks and cattle, we suggest that HIF-1 alpha, VEGF, VEGFR-2, VCAM-1, and IL-4 may be important factors in the adaptation of yak spleen to the plateau environment, which provides a theoretical basis for further exploring the adaptation mechanism of plateau hypoxia in yaks.

AB  - Biochar prepared from various feedstock materials has been utilized in recent years as a potential stabilizing agent for heavy metals in smelter-contaminated soils. However, the effectiveness of animal bone-derived biochar and its potential for the stabilization of contaminants remains unclear. In the present study, sheep bone-derived biochar (SB) was prepared at low (500 degrees C; SBL) and high temperatures (800 degrees C; SBH) and amended a smeltercontaminated soil at 2, 5, and 10% (w/w). The effects of SB on soil properties, bioavailable Zn and Cd and their geochemical fractions, bacterial community composition and activity, and the response of plant attributes (pigments and antioxidant activity) were assessed. Results showed that the SBH added at 10% (SBH10) increased soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and phosphorus, and also increased the oxidizable and residual Zn and Cd fractions at the expense of the bioavailable fractions. The SBH10 lowered the Zn and Cd contents in maize roots (by 57 and 60%) and shoot (by 42 and 61%), respectively, compared to unamended control.

AB  - Invasive buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) is considered a threat to the critically endangered northern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus krefftii; NHW). Buffel grass outcompetes native grasses, reducing availability of native food items for NHW, and causes more intense fires due to the large volumes of dead matter it produces. Previous studies suggested buffel grass was increasing in the diet; however, the diet of the NHW has not been reassessed for over two decades and was limited to Epping Forest National Park, with the population at Richard Underwood Nature Refuge having never been assessed. The recently released 2022 Recovery Action Plan for the species outlined objectives to assist its conservation and recommended the impact of buffel grass on the species' diet be investigated. This study aimed to determine: (1) which plant species are being consumed by the NHW; (2) the differences in the diet between sites; (3) differences between seasons; and (4) the abundance of buffel grass in the diet. The diet was assessed using DNA metabarcoding of scat samples collected from both sites from winter 2020 to spring 2021. Site and season significantly affected the diet of the NHW. Buffel grass dominated the diet and has increased in the diet since past assessments. The findings of this study will support population and habitat management of the critically endangered NHW. Enhanced knowledge of dietary items consumed at both sites will also assist efforts to locate additional sites suitable for translocation.

AB  - Chromatin status is critical for sperm fertility and reflects spermatogenic success. We tested a multivariate approach for studying pig sperm chromatin structure to capture its complexity with a set of quick and simple techniques, going beyond the usual assessment of DNA damage. Sperm doses from 36 boars (3 ejaculates/boar) were stored at 17 degrees C and analyzed on days 0 and 11. Analyses were: CASA (motility) and flow cytometry to assess sperm functionality and chromatin structure by SCSA (%DFI, DNA fragmentation; %HDS, chromatin maturity), monobromobimane (mBBr, tiol status/disulfide bridges between protamines), chromomycin A3 (CMA3, protamination), and 8-hydroxy-2 '-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG, DNA oxidative damage). Data were analyzed using linear models for the effects of boar and storage, correlations, and multivariate analysis as hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA). Storage reduced sperm quality parameters, mainly motility, with no critical oxidative stress increases, while chromatin status worsened slightly (%DFI and 8-oxo-dG increased while mBBr MFI-median fluorescence intensity-and disulfide bridge levels decreased). Boar significantly affected most chromatin variables except CMA3; storage also affected most variables except %HDS. At day 0, sperm chromatin variables clustered closely, except for CMA3, and %HDS and 8-oxo-dG correlated with many variables (notably, mBBr). After storage, the relation between %HDS and 8-oxo-dG remained, but correlations among other variables disappeared, and mBBr variables clustered separately. The PCA suggested a considerable influence of mBBr on sample variance, especially regarding storage, with SCSA and 8-oxo-dG affecting between-sample variability. Overall, CMA3 was the least informative, in contrast with results in other species. The combination of DNA fragmentation, DNA oxidation, chromatin compaction, and tiol status seems a good candidate for obtaining a complete picture of pig sperm nucleus status. It raises many questions for future molecular studies and deserves further research to establish its usefulness as a fertility predictor in multivariate models. The usefulness of CMA3 should be clarified.

AB  - The taruka is one of the least known deer species of the world. Its range includes the northern Andean mountains in Chile, where their relationship with Aymara peasants is conflictive because of crop raiding. The aim of this study is to understand the nature of this conflict in Chile, and identify socio-ecological features that may explain it. Data of different sampling dates from 2003 to 2011 of night transects on roads, crop examination, interviews and direct sighting of tarukas were used to understand its ecology and relationship with local peasants. Peasants interviewed (n=47) cultivated mainly corn (85.1%) and alfalfa (74.5%) in small farms and 83% of them raise livestock. The conflict is widespread in Parinacota Province, where tarukas effectively consume crops, mainly abandoned alfalfa at night. The occurrence of crop raiding is not positively correlated with dry season as expected. However crop consumption is low (10.3% average of damaged plants in crop plots). In Del Tamarugal Province only 29.4% of peasants manifested conflict with tarukas but they did report conflict with other ungulates. Day sightings showed 78 tarukas in 34 encounters during 59 days. Night surveys yielded 11.6 +/- 7.4 tarukas/survey, sighted only in alfalfa plots. Aymara agriculture feeds tarukas and is declining because of rural-urban migration. The conflict must be considered in the conservation strategy of the species.

AB  - The 18 extant members of the Tribe Phloeomyini, the "cloud rats," constitute an endemic Philippine radiation of arboreal herbivores that range in size from ca. 18 g to 2.7 kg, most occurring in cloud forest above 1,200 m elevation. Although calibrated phylogenies indicate that the Phloeomyini is estimated to have begun diversifying within the Philippines by ca. 10-11 million years ago, no extinct fossil species have been described, severely limiting our understanding of this distinctive radiation. Our studies of fossil and subfossil small mammal assemblages from the lowland Callao Caves complex in NE Luzon, Philippines, have produced specimens of Phloeomyini that date from ca. 67,000 BP to the Late Holocene (ca. 4,000 to 2,000 BP). We identify three extinct species that we name as new members assigned to the genera Batomys, Carpomys, and Crateromys, distinguished from congeners by body size, distinctive dental and other morphological features, and occupancy of a habitat (lowland forest over limestone) that differs from the high-elevation mossy forest over volcanic soils occupied by their congeners. Batomys cagayanensis n. sp. is known only from two specimens from ca. 67,000 BP; Carpomys dakal n. sp. and Crateromys ballik n. sp. were present from ca. 67,000 BP to the Late Holocene. These add to the species richness and morphological diversity of this endemic Philippine radiation of large folivores, and show specifically that the lowland fauna of small mammals on Luzon was more diverse in the recent past than it is currently, and that Luzon recently supported five species of giant rodents (ca. 1 kg or more). All three occurred contemporaneously with Homo luzonensis, and two, the new Carpomys and Crateromys, persisted until the Late Holocene when multiple exotic mammal species, both domestic and invasive, were introduced to Luzon, and new cultural practices (such as making pottery) became evident, suggesting that modern humans played a role in their extinction.

AB  - Induced defences in conifers are an effective strategy that allows individuals to increase resistance against pests and pathogens by optimizing associated costs. Studies exploring inducibility of defences in conifers have usually been conducted in young individuals (i.e., seedlings and saplings) whereby effects were addressed within weeks or months after induction, limiting knowledge and generalization of long-term patterns in mature individuals growing under natural conditions. In addition, few studies have explored how plasticity and genetic differentiation among populations may affect the inducibility of defences in mature trees. We took advantage of two long-term Pinus pinaster common gardens to explore the interactive and independent contribution of genetic differentiation (i.e., variation among populations) and the environment (i.e., plasticity between sites) as drivers of variation in short-term, long-term and systemic inducibility of chemical defences (resin flow, non-volatile resin, phenolics) in response to simulated herbivore damage associated with jasmonate signalling. We provide evidence that the external application of methyl jasmonate increased the production of resin based defences in mature P. pinaster trees for at least two years after its application. We found that inducibility of defences did not differ among populations, but was rather contingent on local environmental conditions. Systemic effects of methyl jasmonate were also observed and suggest that induced responses likely involve complex within-individual reallocation of chemical defences. Our results contribute to better understanding of the ecological and evolutionary relevance of induced defence strategies in conifers and have important implications for integrating forest management practices aiming to improve forest health and resistance to pests and pathogens.

Although their individual ecology is well-known, any possible functional link between these structures has almost always been ignored. Here, we recognized their co-presence in the shrub, Adenanthos cygnorum (Proteaceae), and studied their function and interaction. We observed that the same ants frequently visit both structures, seeds are attractive to vertebrate granivores but are released into a leafy cup from where they are harvested by ants and taken to their nests, from which seeds, lacking elaiosomes, germinate after fire. We showed that juvenile plants do not produce EFNs and are not visited by ants. We conclude that EFNs are not just an indirect adaptation to minimize herbivory via aggressive ant visitors (the role of a minority) but specifically enhance reproductive success in two ways: First, by inducing ants to visit the plant as a reliable food source throughout the year. Second, by promoting discovery of the seasonally available, elaiosome-bearing seeds for transport to their nests (the majority of visitors), so avoiding the risk of granivory should seeds instead fall to the ground. Parasitoid wasps play a supporting role in controlling the main insect herbivore whose larvae devour the reproductive apices. Thus, the EFN-elaiosome relationship has three components that enhance species fitness: foliage protection, seed transport, and granivore escape. A similar system has been described only once before (in an unrelated biome) and, consistent with the objectives of ecology as an integrative science, deserves wider study.

AB  - Diet breadth is one of the fundamental species traits of an herbivorous insect as it strongly determines its ecological niche and, at the same time, its ability to cope with changing environmental conditions. To what extent this trait is associated with other characteristics that may influence a species' ability to respond to environmental changes, however, is yet poorly understood. Using European butterflies as a model group of holometabolous insect herbivores, we here tested whether larval diet breadth is positively related with latitudinal range size (i.e. north-south extent of global distribution), voltinism and adult body size. We further investigated whether range size, voltinism, and body size are associated with each other. In order to test for these relationships, we based our analyses on a solid, time-calibrated butterfly phylogeny as well as on an updated host plant database that reflects interactions between butterfly larvae and their food plants in a yet unparalleled breadth and depth. We further calculated two measures to reflect the fundamental dietary niche of a species: taxonomic diet breadth and phylogenetic diet breadth. Irrespective of diet breadth measure, we found that diet breadth increases with latitudinal range size. We further found an overall higher diet breadth for species that are capable to realise multiple broods per year (i.e. multivoltine species) compared to obligatorily univoltine species. Contrary to expectation, our results indicated a negative relationship between larval diet breadth and adult body size. Regarding our explorative analyses, we observed a positive link between voltinism and latitudinal range size, while neither one of these variables was associated with body size. Taken together, our study shows that larval diet breadth, latitudinal range size and voltinism are positively linked in European butterflies, and we argue that these interrelationships are important in determining a species' overall potential to cope with changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Purpose: The infralimbic (IL) subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) regulates the extinction of conditioned fear memory. Glucocorticoid and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are expressed in the mPFC and are also critical in fear extinction. This study investigated the possible interactive effects of the glucocorticoids and GABAergic system in the IL on the regulation of fear extinction. Method: The rats were trained using an auditory fear conditioning task during which they received three conditioned stimuli (tones, 30 s, 4 kHz, 80 dB), co-terminated with the three unconditioned stimuli (footshock, 0.8 mA, 1 s). Extinction testing was conducted over 3 days (Ext 1-3). Thirty minutes before the first extinction trial (Ext 1), the rats received bicuculline (BIC, 1 mg/kg/2 mL, intraperitoneal [i.p.]) as a GABA(A) receptor antagonist or CGP55845 (CGP, 0.1 mg/kg/2 ML, i.p.) as a GABA(B) receptor antagonist followed by systemic injection of corticosterone (CORT, 3 mg/kg/2 ML, i.p.). Furthermore, separate groups of rats received a bilateral intra-IL injection of BIC (100 ng/0.3 mu L/side) or CGP (10 ng/0.3 mu L/side) followed by a systemic injection of CORT (3 mg/kg/2 ML, i.p.) before the first extinction trial (Ext 1). The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1) and cAMP response element-binding (CREB) activity in the IL was examined by Western blot analysis after Ext 1. Finding: The results indicated that systemic CORT injection facilitated fear extinction and increased the expression of ERK1 but not CREB in the IL. Both systemic and intra-IL co-injection of BIC or CGP blocked the effects of CORT on fear extinction and ERK1 expression. Conclusion: These findings suggest that glucocorticoids and the GABAergic system may modulate fear extinction through the ERK pathway in the IL.

AB  - Seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) are exceptional marine species considering their reproductive patterns and other features. Due to the iconic characteristics of these fishes, aquarium trade, and research efforts have increased in the last years. Consequently, novel rearing techniques have been developed; however, there is a need for improvements on a series of issues, namely reproduction success enhancement. The tropical species Hippocampus reidi is the most traded seahorse but many aspects of breeding and its impact on the quality of neonates are still poorly understood. In the present study, we assessed the effects of two pre-breeding diets on newborn quality and viability considering biochemical characteristics, energetic status, and ultrastructural aspects of muscular tissue. During the whole pre-breeding season (5 months), the breeders were fed on one of the following diets: M0 (adult non-enriched Artemia) and M5 (adult non-enriched Artemia + mysidaceans). From the onset of the reproduction period, all breeders were fed for 6 months on diet M5. Breeding success and energetic status (ATP, total adenylic nucleotides, AEC, and NAD) of newborns resulted considerably enhanced in treatment M5. However, initial differences in neonates quality did not affect further newborn performance (survival and growth until day 7 after male's pouch release) while gaining access to high-quality preys (copepods). Besides, morphological alterations in muscle tissue were not observed. The reproduction in the species followed a capital-income continuum pattern characterized by an initial mixed capital-income period (until 70-100 days since the onset of the breeding season) followed by an income breeding period with progressive exhaustion of body reserves, especially in M0-newborns. Interestingly, the effects of pre-breeding diets were also noticed in the second half of the breeding period. Our results seemed to indicate that the requirements in essential fatty acids in H. reidi are lower than in other seahorse species (e.g., Hippocampus guttulatus). Globally, the results achieved revealed that high-quality pre-breeding diets enhanced reproduction success and would likely result advantageous to improve newborn endurance in conditions of moderate starvation or sub-optimal feeding.

AB  - Few studies have examined how dung beetle species composition changes across several mammalian dung types. Species composition and abundance of dung beetles were studied in dung samples of seven African mammals along animal trails and using 14 baited-pitfall traps in both the park and the buffer zone resulting in a combined data set of 113 samples. Both the number of species (18) and the number of individual dung beetles (600) encountered were low for an area close to the Equator. Few species (2) and herbivores (13) tunnellers (9) dominated the dung beetles community, feeding and guild structure respectively. Alpha diversity was moderate 2.06 (1 < H ' <= 3). Beta diversity ranged from low 0.8 (high similarity) to high (zero, no similarity). Dung beetle species composition varied with dung type with the degree of pairwise similarity between two dung types in 19 of the total (21) dung beetle communities comparisons showing low similarity (0.4) to no similarity (zero). The observed discrepancies may be attributed to dung size, composition and consistency as well as to the low number of dung of the different animal species sampled. Furthermore, further research is needed as rarefaction curves suggest that sampling was incomplete.

AB  - Most species of wild felids are threatened, but for many little is known about their status in the wild. For the cryptic and elusive Vulnerable Sunda clouded leopard Neofelis diardi, key metrics such as abundance and occupancy have been challenging to obtain. We conducted an intensive survey for this species on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. We deployed camera traps across four study areas that varied in elevation and threats, for a total of 28,404 trap nights, resulting in 114 independent clouded leopard photographs, in which we identified 18 individuals. Using a Bayesian spatially explicit capture-recapture analysis, we estimated clouded leopard density to be 0.8-2.4 individuals/100 km(2). The highest predicted occurrence of people was at lower altitudes and closer to the forest edge, where we categorized more than two-thirds of people recorded by camera traps as bird poachers, 12.5% each as ungulate/tiger poachers and non-timber collectors, and < 2% as fishers. Our findings provide important insights into the status of this little known species in Sumatra. We recommend that the large volume of camera-trap data from other Sumatran landscapes be used for an island-wide assessment of the clouded leopard population, to provide up-to-date and reliable information for guiding future conservation planning.

AB  - The high demand for syngnathid species in the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) trade is drastically affecting seahorse populations worldwide. Powdered seahorse not only represents the main material for the preparation of remedies in either TCM or folk medicine but is also being used to facilitate smuggling and avoid customs authorities in different countries. Here, we present the first primer set and standardized real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) protocol designed for a fast, accurate, sensitive, and reliable identification of one of the most threatened fish species in the world, the Pacific seahorse Hippocampus ingens, using DNA traces from powdered material. Our protocol efficiently detected quantities as low as 0.85 pg of seahorse DNA, showing a high specificity even in the presence of DNA from other non-target fish species. The qPCR protocol reported herein may be utilized as a powerful tool to monitor the illegal domestic trade and international trafficking of H. ingens, not only in poaching hotspot countries such as Ecuador and Peru but also in transit and final market destinations such as Hong Kong and China. In addition, we show photographic evidence of seahorse extraction and trade in northern Peru and southern Ecuador, highlighting the need for increased efforts to protect the Pacific seahorse.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Since African swine fever (ASF) virus in wild boar populations can spill over to domestic pigs, it is crucial to understand the disease determinants in the wild compartment. However, the imperfect detection sensitivity of wild boar surveillance jeopardizes our ability to understand ASF spatial distribution. In this study, we used national surveillance data of ASF in wild boars collected in the Republic of Korea from 2019-2020 to model the spatial distribution of ASF-positive carcasses for two successive study periods associated with different surveillance intensity. The model allowed us to identify disease risk factors in the Republic of Korea, determine the spatial distribution of the risk of ASF, and estimate the sensitivity of surveillance. The outputs of this study are relevant to policy makers for developing and improving risk-based surveillance programs for ASF in wild boars.
   In September 2019, African swine fever (ASF) was reported in South Korea for the first time. Since then, more than 651 ASF cases in wild boars and 14 farm outbreaks have been notified in the country. Despite the efforts to eradicate ASF among wild boar populations, the number of reported ASF-positive wild boar carcasses have increased recently. The purpose of this study was to characterize the spatial distribution of ASF-positive wild boar carcasses to identify the risk factors associated with the presence and number of ASF-positive wild boar carcasses in the affected areas. Because surveillance efforts have substantially increased in early 2020, we divided the study into two periods (2 October 2019 to 19 January 2020, and 19 January to 28 April 2020) based on the number of reported cases and aggregated the number of reported ASF-positive carcasses into a regular grid of hexagons of 3-km diameter. To account for imperfect detection of positive carcasses, we adjusted spatial zero-inflated Poisson regression models to the number of ASF-positive wild boar carcasses per hexagon. During the first study period, proximity to North Korea was identified as the major risk factor for the presence of African swine fever virus. In addition, there were more positive carcasses reported in affected hexagons with high habitat suitability for wild boars, low heat load index (HLI), and high human density. During the second study period, proximity to an ASF-positive carcass reported during the first period was the only significant risk factor for the presence of ASF-positive carcasses. Additionally, low HLI and elevation were associated with an increased number of ASF-positive carcasses reported in the affected hexagons. Although the proportion of ASF-affected hexagons increased from 0.06 (95% credible interval (CrI): 0.05-0.07) to 0.09 (95% CrI: 0.08-0.10), the probability of reporting at least one positive carcass in ASF-affected hexagons increased from 0.49 (95% CrI: 0.41-0.57) to 0.73 (95% CrI: 0.66-0.81) between the two study periods. These results can be used to further advance risk-based surveillance strategies in the Republic of Korea.

AB  - Parasites constitute a significant economic burden and highly impact environmental, public, and animal health. The emergence of many parasitic diseases is environmentally mediated and they share the same biogeography with humans and both domestic and wild animals. American liver fluke, Fascioloides magna - a trematode parasite of domestic and wild ungulates - is an example of the anthropogenic introduction of an "invasive alien species" in Italy and Europe. Multiple introductions to Europe have led to the biogeographical expansion of the parasite across the Danube region mainly provided by the presence of suitable habitats for all hosts involved in the parasite's life cycle, human-assisted transport, and drastic environmental events such as flooding. In Italy, it was introduced and established in La Mandria Regional Park (LMRP) near Turin in 1865 along with imported wapitis (Cervus elaphus canadensis) from North America (Bassi, 1875), but with no reported expansion to the surrounding areas. LMRP isolated F. magna focus, poses an important threat of possible expansion since the enclosed area is vulnerable to occasional bidirectional passage of roe deer. Additionally, tributary rivers to the Po river system, traversing the enclosed area, could further bolster the possibility of such spread. In this study, we developed a duplex qPCR assay for F. magna and its principal intermediate host Galba truncatula optimized for testing eDNA samples to meet the needs for surveillance of the parasite. Moreover, we validated the developed assay in natura by testing samples derived from filtered water and sediments collected inside and outside LMRP's fenced -off area. Our findings for the first time demonstrate the presence of F. magna's eDNA outside the park's internal fenced -off area.

AB  - Background and aims - The Bromeliaceae family has great importance in the maintenance of neotropical communities. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, bromeliads are among the major groups responsible for maintaining the local flora and fauna and participate in important ecological interactions with insects, anurans, and hummingbirds. This work reports on aspects of the reproductive biology and the interactions between two endemic bromeliad species from the Atlantic Forest (Aechmea bruggeri and Quesnelia indecora) and their floral visitors to assess the impact of these relationships on the reproductive success and conservation of these plants.
   Material and methods - Reproductive phenology, floral biology, pollination experiments, and the reproductive success of both species were investigated. To determine the floral visitors, we made direct observations on flowers and collected floral visitors that could not be identified in the field.
   Key results - Aechmea bruggeri and Quesnelia indecora presented the individual and population flowering phenological pattern classified as annual with intermediate duration. The species are partially and totally self-incompatible, respectively. Both species presented a varied visitation guild, and although Q. indecora presented flowers with ornitofilous characteristics, no hummingbirds were recorded for this species. The hummingbird Thalurania glaucopis was the main visitor for Aechmea bruggeri and the bee Trigona cf. braueri was the main visitor for Quesnelia indecora. Nectar thieving by lepidopterans was observed for both species. Pollen robbing by beetles and nectar robbing by bees were registered for Aechmea bruggeri and Quesnelia indecora, respectively. Fruit and seed set of both species were highly affected by herbivory, which may negatively affect their reproductive success.
   Conclusion - Our work highlights the important role of bromeliads in neotropical communities, showing how floral visitors and plants interact by participating in maintaining biological diversity in the studied forest remnant.

AB  - The study investigated the daily dynamics of the invertebrate communities in the meadow grass stands along the pollution gradient of the Middle Ural Copper Smelter. In the most polluted area, the abundance of invertebrates in the upper part of the grass stand increases in the second half of the day, both in total (1.9 times) and in the groups of herbivores, both sucking (3.2 times) and chewing (2.2 times). This leads to a significant decrease in the similarity of the shape of the curves of circadian dynamics in the background and most polluted areas. In the other trophic groups considered, circadian changes are less pronounced. The obtained results confirm the hypothesis about modification of daily dynamics of grass stand invertebrates under industrial pollution. The most probable reasons for the changes are general degradation of invertebrate habitat, destabilization of temperature regime in it, as well as changes in the composition and structure of invertebrate communities themselves.

AB  - Eld's deer (Rucervus eldi) was once thought to be extinct in the wild in Lao PDR. In early 2000, however, conservationists discovered that they still exist in Savannakhet Province. In 2004, the government of Lao PDR established the Xonnabouly Eld's Deer Sanctuary with an area of about 93,000 ha. However, no population size estimates for this significant population are available for guiding conservation efforts of preserving this important species. In this study, we used the line transect method to assess the Eld's deer density and abundance during the survey. During our surveys, we made 27 visual observations of Eld's deer. We estimated the average detection probability to be 0.57 (CI: 0.45-0.72) and the average density to be 0.58 (CI: 0.33-1.01). We estimated the total number of Eld's deer in the surveyed area of the Xonnabouly Eld's Deer Sanctuary to be 173 (95% CI: 99-305). The population in the Xonnabouly Eld's Deer Sanctuary seems to be the most important Eld's deer population for R. e. siamensis subspecies as well as for the R. eldii, at least in the continental part of Asia. With the sharp decline of Eld's deer populations in other protected areas (especially in Cambodia and Myanmar), we should pay special attention and give more priority on the conservation efforts of preserving the remaining population in Xonnabouly Eld's Deer Sanctuary.

AB  - Simple Summary The pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) gene has attracted a lot of attention as a gene related to myogenesis. The PLAG1 gene is a key gene for growth traits in sheep, cattle, pigs, and chickens. However, it has also become the focus of research to determine whether it is the dominant gene affecting growth traits in goats. To address this problem, a bioinformatics analysis, mRNA expression (n = 6), and identification of copy number variants (CNVs) (n = 224) of PLAG1 were conducted in Shaanbei white cashmere (SBWC) goats. The findings indicated that the gene had a large number of conserved motifs, the expression level of the gene was higher in fetal goats than in adult goats, and all CNV loci were found to be associated with goat growth traits (p < 0.05), making them effective molecular marker loci for goat breeding. The pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) gene, as the major gene responsible for growth, plays a vital role in myogenesis. Meanwhile, the relationship between copy number variation (CNV) of this gene and growth traits in goats remains unclear. Therefore, this study investigated four aspects: bioinformatics analysis, mRNA expression (n = 6), CNV detection (n = 224), and association analysis. The findings indicated that the gene had a large number of conserved motifs, and the gene expression level was higher in fetal goats than in adult goats. Three CNV loci were selected from the database, among which CNV1 was located in the bidirectional promoter region and was associated with goat growth traits. CNV analysis showed that CNV2 and CNV3 of the PLAG1 gene were associated with growth traits such as body weight, heart girth, height at hip cross, and hip width (p < 0.05), with CNV1 loss genotype being the superior genotype, and CNV2 and CNV3 median and gain genotypes of being superior genotypes. This finding further confirms that the PLAG1 gene is the dominant gene for growth traits, which will serve as theoretical guidance for goat breeding.

AB  - The Arabian gazelle (Gazella arabica) population in Israel has experienced a turbulent conservation history and repeatedly faced local extinction. Low fawn survival was considered the main cause for the constant decline. In our study, we analyzed instantaneous fawn mortality rates, using a binomial coding at three different developmental stages, i.e., mortality rates to 3 months after parturition (weaning age), to 5 months after parturition (male fawns leave their mothers), and to the age of reproductive maturity, i.e., recruitment (12 months). We used a dataset obtained from 20 individually discernible mothers and their fawns (49 females and 48 males) born between June 2006 and September 2019. To explore causes for the fawn mortality rates, parental- (age of the mother at parturition) and offspring-related attributes (offspring sex), year of birth, together with one weather variable (mean monthly maximum temperature) were included as independent variables into three independent mixed effects cox regression models. Out of 97 fawns, 92 survived to weaning age, 73 to the age of 5 months and only 7 to the age of reproductive maturity. Temperature had significant effects on instantaneous fawn mortality rates, suggesting that low temperatures were detrimental to the survival of fawns after weaning (4-5 months) and male dispersal age (6-12 months). Male offspring encountered a higher instantaneous mortality rate than female offspring at the age of 6-12 months. Moreover, fawns from less experienced mother (young age at parturition) experienced higher mortality. Our results were in line with previous studies on fawn mortality observed in other desert dwelling ungulates.

AB  - Climate change continues to present global challenges for farmers' livelihoods. Celtis australis (kharik) is one of the versatile multipurpose tree species, that provides quality fodder, particularly during the lean periods and fulfils the needs of rural communities for sustenance. Unfortunately, owing to significant defoliant attacks, tree phenology and forage availability og this species have changed in recent years. Therefore, the present study was conducted during four seasons (spring, summer, rainy, and winter) in three diameter classes (< 10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm) under defoliated and undefoliated tree conditions to assess the alteration in phenology, nutritive value and leaf biomass productivity of kharik. The study revealed that under undefoliated trees, the leaf nutrients (dry matter, ether extract, crude fibre, total ash content, acid insoluble ash, acid fibre content and neutral detergent fibre content) were highest during the summer in 20-30 cm diameter class, except for crude protein, nitrogen-free extract, organic matter and total carbohydrate contents. In defoliated trees, the tree nutrients, namely phosphorus (0.28%) and calcium (12.50%) were highest in winter. However, the leaf antinutrients, i.e., tannins and phenolic content were maximum in the spring season in 20-30 cm diameter class under defoliated and undefoliated tree conditions. Overall, the defoliation of kharik resulted in changed phenology, a marked decline in the crude protein, neutral detergent fibre, organic matter content, and leaf and branch biomass productivity vis-a-vis undefoliated ones. Simultaneously, defoliated trees retain their leaves until winter thus providing fodder availability during scarcity season. However, continued insect attacks may have a negative impact on kharik's health; thus, a timely effective pest management strategy is required to be devised.

AB  - Ozone pollution is a serious global environmental problem, with surface ozone concentrations consistently ranking among the top air pollutants. In response to ozone stress, plants activate various defense mechanisms, including secondary metabolism. Secondary metabolites are organic compounds that are not directly involved in plant growth and development but serve multiple functions, such as defense against herbivores, pathogens, and protection against abiotic stresses. This review aims to accomplish the following objectives: (i) comprehensively understand the physiological functions, significance, and interconnections between plant secondary metabolism and environmental factors; (ii) analyze the impact of ozone stress on both volatile and non-volatile secondary metabolites in plants; and (iii) explore the defense mechanisms of plant non-volatile secondary metabolites against ozone stress, focusing on plant pigments, hormones, and active ingredients. Furthermore, we summarize the severity of ozone pollution and the role of plant secondary metabolism in alleviating ozone toxicity and facilitating plant adaptation to ozone-polluted environments. Additionally, we review relevant studies on the effects of ozone stress on plant secondary metabolism and investigate the protective mechanisms of plant secondary metabolites in response to ozone stress. Gaining insights into the synthesis and regulation mechanisms of specific metabolites in plants under ozone stress is vital for comprehending the protective and defensive effects of plant secondary metabolism. The examination of protective mechanisms utilized by plant secondary metabolism under ozone stress is an essential aspect of ecological research.

AB  - Juvenile stress (JS) is a known risk factor for the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), both of which are frequently co -morbid. Data suggest there may be common, geneticallyinfluenced biological responses to stress that contribute to the development of both AUD and PTSD. The present study investigated the impact of JS on contextual fear learning and extinction, as well as corticosterone (CORT) responses before and after JS, before and after contextual fear conditioning (CFC), and after fear extinction in male and female high -alcohol -preferring (HAP2) and low -alcohol -preferring (LAP2) mouse lines. We also measured unconditioned anxiety -related behavior in the light -dark -transition test before CFC. HAP2 and LAP2 mice did not differ in fear acquisition, but HAP2 mice showed faster fear extinction compared to LAP2 mice. No effects of JS were seen in HAP2 mice, whereas in LAP2 mice, JS reduced fear acquisition in males and facilitated fear extinction in females. Females showed greater fear -related behavior relative to males, regardless of subgroup. HAP2 males demonstrated more anxiolytic-like responses than LAP2 males and LAP2 females demonstrated more anxiolytic-like responses than LAP2 males in the light -dark transition test. HAP2 and LAP2 mice did not differ in CORT during the juvenile stage; however, adult LAP2 mice showed greater CORT levels than HAP2 mice at baseline and after CFC and extinction testing. These findings build upon prior work in these unique mouse lines that differ in genetic propensity toward alcohol preference and provide new information regarding contextual fear learning and extinction mechanisms theorized to contribute to co -morbid AUD and PTSD.

AB  - Radiations of ectothermic vertebrates across cold climates depend on the coordinated evolution of multiple traits that compensate for the constraints imposed by limited and fluctuating resources, such as temperature, food and oxygen. One of nature's most prolific such radiations, Liolaemus lizards, has diversified across the extreme cold climates of the Andes and Patagonia. Remarkably, the prevailing patterns of reptile herbivory are opposed by Liolaemus which, in contrast with lizards generally, have repeatedly evolved plant consumption across small-bodied species from cold climates. Herbivory is hypothesized to depend on the evolution of multiple traits that maximize absorption of nutrients from an intrinsically poor-quality diet, such as increases in gastrointestinal tract size and increases in the density of nematodes in the intestine that may assist with plant digestion. Here, a comparative phylogenetic approach across Liolaemus species is implemented to test these hypotheses, which have only been investigated nonphylogenetically. Results reveal that intestine length increases consistently with increasing herbivory, whereas stomach size or nematode load are not associated with plant consumption. Body size plays no role in herbivory either. Consequently, this evidence places emphasis on the enlargement of the intestine to facilitate the evolution of herbivory in cold climates.

AB  - Plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) play a keystone role in the alpine meadow ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). For decades, alpine meadows on the QTP have suffered from severe degradation, predominantly due to livestock grazing and frequent dramatic increases in plateau pikas. The cause has long been thought to be that livestock grazing provides open habitats for pikas. However, open habitats with low food nutrient quality are insufficient to maintain high-density populations. Feeding facilitation is a process or action undertaken by one species whose activity benefits another species. However, the facilitative effects on population consequences remain unclear. Here, we examined the impact of feeding facilitation on the population dynamics of plateau pikas. We hypothesize that the high protein amount provided by meadows that have been overgrazed would be an important factor leading to dramatic increases in plateau pikas. We found that plateau pikas preferred high-protein foods, and relatively abundant high-protein food resources were found in meadows following high levels of livestock grazing. Body mass and amount of protein in stomach digesta of pikas were higher in moderately and heavily grazed meadows than in lightly grazed meadow. Thus, pika population density was associated with high-protein food resources. A supplemental protein experiment confirmed that high-protein foods led to higher pika population density by increasing reproductive performance. Livestock grazing increased the abundance of plateau pikas by shifting plant nutrient contents toward higher protein conditions favorable to them. Feeding facilitation is an important factor that causes a dramatic increase in plateau pikas.
   Plateau pikas benefit from feeding facilitation by livestock grazing on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. As grazing intensifies higher protein conditions favorable to pikas lead to improved life-history traits and increased densities.

AB  - Previous studies have suggested a significantly higher diversity in the nasal microbiota of pig farmers compared to people having no contact with farm animals. However, the fate of this nasal microbiota specificity after farmers stop being in contact with the pig farm environment is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the change in the nasal microbiota of pig-farmers after the change of occupation.
   Methods: Anterior and posterior nasal swabs were collected from seven people during employment on pig farms, and again after a period of at least 50 days after leaving the pig farm. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA was conducted to characterize the dynamics of the nasal microbiota. The microbiota of actively working pig farmers was compared to microbiota after they had stopped working (ex-pig-farmers) and to control groups (cow farmers and non-exposed individuals).
   Results: Following a prolonged period without exposure to pigs, a-diversity of both anterior and posterior cavities dropped significantly. The composition of the microbiota of pig-farmers had a low inter-similarity with the non-exposed group while ex-pig-farmers were more similar to cow-farmers and the non-exposed group than to their own microbiota during pig farming.

AB  - Simple Summary The evaluation of male animals' fertilizing capacity is based on laboratory-performed tests, as well as on the in vivo and in vitro reproductive outcome. Boar fertility is strongly associated with a pig farm's financial status and income. The scientific community attempts to increase the predictive reliability of male fertility to ensure the profitability of the pig industry. In this direction, a different approach, using biomedical thermal and motion sensors, is utilized. This study investigates the correlation of collected data by biomedical sensors with variables well known as their predictable value semen quality. Strong correlations are revealed, encouraging the further application of biomedical methods in the assessment of boars' fertilizing ability. Biomedical measurements by specialized technological equipment have been used in farm animals to collect information about nutrition, behavior and welfare. This study investigates the relation of semen quality (CASA analysis, viability, morphology, membrane biochemical activity and DNA fragmentation) with boar behavior during ejaculation. Sensors were placed on the boar's body. Movement features were collected using an inertial measurement unit (IMU), comprising an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a magnetometer. Boar, scrotal and dummy temperatures were measured by an infrared (IR) camera and an IR thermometer, while the face salivation of the boar was recorded by a moisture meter (also based on IR technology). All signals and images were logged on a mobile device (smartphone or tablet) using a Bluetooth connection and then transferred wirelessly to the cloud. The data files were then processed using scripts in MATLAB 2021a (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts) to derive the necessary indices. Ninety-four ejaculates from five boars were analyzed in this study. The statistical analysis was performed in the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox of MATLAB 2021a using a linear mixed effects model. Significant and strong negative correlations (R-2 > 0.5, p <= 0.05) were observed between boar, dummy and scrotal temperature with the progressive, rapid and slow movement of spermatozoa, VCL (curvilinear velocity), VSL (straight line velocity) and ALH (amplitude of lateral head displacement) kinematics. The volume of the ejaculate was correlated with the scrotal and dummy temperature. Dummy's temperature was negatively correlated with BCF (beat/cross-frequency), viability and total time of ejaculation, while it was positively correlated with abnormal morphology. Body temperature was negatively correlated with BCF. Positive correlations were noticed between VAP (average path velocity) and total time of ejaculation with body acceleration features, as well as between the overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) and total time of ejaculation. In conclusion, the use of biomedical sensors can support the evaluation of boar sperm production capacity, providing valuable information about semen quality.

AB  - The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are the most important areas for geese to overwinter in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, where about 180,000 geese fly to overwinter each year. Over the past 20 years, the region has experienced extensive and rapid land cover changes that may have exceeded the adaptability of geese, and have led to suitable goose habitat area loss, thereby, reducing the stability of the geese population. In order to identify the suitable goose habitat areas in this region, based on ensemble modeling and satellite tracking data, in this study, we simulated the spatial distribution changes in the suitable goose habitat areas over the past 20 years. The results showed that the suitable goose habitat areas had suffered varying degrees of loss, among which, the lesser white-fronted goose had the greatest suitable goose habitat area loss of over 50%. Moreover, we found that wetlands, lakes, and floodplains were the key components of suitable goose habitat areas, and the categories (land use) showed significant differences in different periods (p < 0.01). This may be one of the main reasons for the decrease in suitable goose habitat areas. The results of this study provide an important reference for the adaptive management and protection of geese in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

AB  - This study investigated the behavior of veterinary antibiotics (VAs) in a small farm ecosystem. Manure and environmental samples were collected around a large pig farm in northeast China. Thirty-four VAs in six cate-gories were analyzed. Then, a multimedia fugacity model was used to estimate the fates of VAs in the envi-ronment. The results showed that VAs were prevalent in manure, soil, water, and sediment, but not in crops. Compared with fresh manure, VA levels were significantly lower in surface manure piles left in the open air for 3-6 months. The main VAs, tetracyclines and quinolones, decreased by 427.12 and 158.45 mu g/kg, respectively. VAs from manure piles were transported to the surroundings and migrated vertically into deep soil. The con-centrations of n-ary sumation VAs detected in agricultural soils were 0.03-4.60 mu g/kg; > 94% of the mass inventory of the VAs was retained in soil organic matter (SOM), suggesting that SOM is the main reservoir for antibiotics in soil. Risk assessment and model analysis indicated that the negative impact of mixed antibiotics at low concentrations in farmland on crops may be mediated by indirect effects, rather than direct effects. Our findings highlight the environmental fates and risks of antibiotics from livestock farms.

AB  - The establishment of vegetation cover is an important strategy to reduce wind and water erosion at metal smelting waste slag sites. However, the mobility of heavy metals in waste slag-vegetation-leachate systems after the application of revegetation strategies is still unclear. Large microcosm experiments were conducted for revegetation of waste slag for 98 d using combined amendments, i.e., phosphate rock and an organic waste coming from the anaerobic digestion of pig manure (named as biogas residue), and by single- and co-planted perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and Trifolium repens (T. repens). The results showed that the application of biogas residue slightly increased the concentrations of Zn and Cd in the leachates; however, the establishment of plants could avoid the excessive leaching of heavy metals coming from the biogas residue. The bioavailability of Cu, Zn, and Cd slightly increased, but Pb bioavailability significantly decreased regardless of single- or co-planting patterns. Additionally, the bioavailability of Cu, Zn, and Cd in the waste slag revegetated with perennial ryegrass was lower than that in T. repens under the single-planting pattern. The change in the heavy metals bioavailability under different revegetation strategies was mainly due to the root-induced change in the pH and speciation of heavy metals in the waste slag. The application of biogas residue and phosphate rock tends to the immobilization of Pb. Heavy metals mainly accumulated in the underground parts of the two herbs, and the heavy metal contents in the underground parts of perennial ryegrass were higher than those in T. repens regardless of single- or co-planting patterns. The heavy metals accumulated in T. repens were lower than those in perennial ryegrass in the single-planting pattern. The bioaccumulation , transportation factors of the two herbs were extremely low. Thus, the two herbs are potential candidates for phytostabilization of zinc smelting waste slag sites.

AB  - This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of habitat connectivity for the Mongolian saiga, a species endemic to Western Mongolia. We utilized a resource selection function (RSF) to identify core habitats (CHs) throughout the saiga's entire range. Additionally, the Circuitscape approach was employed to map the least-cost paths (LCPs) among these core habitats. The RSF models revealed a strong preference for high productivity areas, while avoiding disturbed regions. Through a spatially explicit model, 34 CHs covering an area of 12,480 km2 (30.7% of the saiga's range) were identified. The connectivity models identified 68 LCPs between various pairs of CHs, totaling 1700 km in length across the entire saiga range. The core habitat in the center of the saiga range displayed the highest centrality scores, highlighting their critical importance in maintaining their habitat interconnectedness. Furthermore, the presence of pinch points was observed in several CH pairs within the northwest region, suggesting potential bottlenecks that may hinder movement between these habitats. It is imperative to implement measures aimed at addressing these pinch points and establishing secure corridors to facilitate the saiga movement between the CHs. To ensure the survival of the saiga, it is also crucial to mitigate the impact of existing and planned linear infrastructures, as well as other human disturbances that have the potential to fragment habitats and disrupt connectivity. These findings serve as valuable insights for targeted conservation efforts and the formulation of effective management strategies geared toward safeguarding this iconic species in Western Mongolia.

AB  - The taxonomy of Quaternary medium-sized deer from Europe rests mainly on antler morphology, while adequate dental and postcranial diagnostic features are lacking. When complete antlers are not available, the taxonomic identifications are often attempted on chronological ground. A considerable number of mostly unpublished craniodental and postcranial remains of fallow deer from selected Italian sites from the late Early Pleistocene to the late Middle Pleistocene is here presented and discussed. The aim of this work is to test the validity of the diagnostic characters proposed in literature and to explore the variability of the fallow deer taxa. In addition, the analysis of the two reference samples from Riano and Ponte Molle allows to refine the features of Dama clactoniana. Finally, biometric comparison has been performed in order to investigate possible oscillations across time and/or differences among taxa.

AB  - To ensure long-term sustainability, the meat industry seeks to apply more sustainable practices like replacing imported traditional feedstuff (i.e., cereals) with low-cost local resources. In this sense, carob pulp (Cp), a Mediterranean by-product rich in polyphenols, represents a potential alternative to feed pigs. Polyphenols exhibit antioxidant properties comparable to vitamin E (Vit E) but may impair animal growth in high doses. This study evaluated the influence of supplementing fattening pig diets with 20% Cp and high doses of Vit E (300 IU/kg) on growth performance, economic results, physiological parameters, nutrient digestibility, and animal behaviour. While no synergistic effect between Cp and Vit E was observed, incorporating 20% Cp in pig diets during the last 40 days of the fattening period is feasible without compromising growth performance, physiology, or behaviour. However, crude protein digestibility and the feeding cost were negatively affected by Cp inclusion. Supplementation with Vit E, although not improving pig performance, increased alpha-tocopherol deposition in blood, potentially enhancing the antioxidant tissue profile and meat quality. This study aimed to assess the impact on growth, economic results, apparent nutrient digestibility (CTTAD), physiological variables, and animal behaviour when 214 fattening pigs (78 +/- 8.5 kg of initial body weight and 130 +/- 4.5 days of age) of both sexes (gilts and boars) were fed two levels of carob pulp (Cp, 0 vs. 20%) and two doses of vitamin E (Vit E, 30 vs. 300 IU/kg) for 40 days. No interaction effects between factors studied (Cp, Vit E, and sex) were observed on the variables. Most productive traits were unaffected by Cp or Vit E inclusion. However, the Cp increased the feed conversion ratio during the first 20 days. The Cp group showed a higher CTTAD of ether extract and hemicellulose but lower CTTAD of crude protein. Pigs fed Cp had a lower plasmatic urea content than the control group. The high Vit E doses increased the CTTAD of every nutrient and the plasmatic alpha-tocopherol content. The pigs fed Cp tended to spend more time eating in the early morning, likely to mitigate tannins' astringent effects. Dietary inclusion of 20% Cp in finishing high-conformation pigs is possible without affecting overall performance though it reduces nutrient CTTAD and increases feeding cost. Supra-nutritional doses of Vit E do not affect pig performance but increase the alpha-tocopherol deposition with potential antioxidant effects.

AB  - The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is one of the main invasive species in Chile, where it became naturalized ca. 150 years ago. Their high reproductive capacity, lack of specialist predators, and great adaptability favored the settlement of rabbits in diverse mainland and island ecosystems of the country. Recently, rabbits have become central players in semi-arid ecosystems, such as those represented in Las Chinchillas National Reserve in north-central Chile. We undertook to analyze the place and role of rabbits in the food web of that Reserve, based on a bibliographic review and long-term annual data gathered from 1987 until 2022 (36 years). Results showed that the network comprised 77 species, where 69% were primary producers (plants), 18% were mid-level consumers (herbivores), and 13% were top-level consumers (predators). The most connected species in the food web was the rabbit, which positively or negatively affected the species interacting with it. Predators such as Galictis cuja, Geranoaetus polyosoma, Leopardus colocolo, and Puma concolor, and the scavenger Vultur gryphus, could be negatively affected by an eventual decrease (natural or human-caused) in the rabbit population of the Reserve. To the contrary, primary producers such as Oxalis perdicaria, Plantago hispidula, Schizanthus parvulus, Senna cumminggi, and Tropaeolum azureum could be positively affected by an increase in their biomass in response to a decrease in rabbits, favoring native rodents. We consider that analyzing the rabbit-centered food web and its impacts on native interacting species allows a better understanding of the relevance of invasive species in the local community, providing conceptual tools for rabbit management.

AB  - Since the 1980s, college students in the U.S. have self-reported a decline in their physical and emotional health. With these conditions compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and its physical distancing restrictions, higher education institutions have an increased responsibility to establish strategic interventions and health-promoting programs for their students. Research collaborations between public health professionals and environmental designers have highlighted the benefits of environmental factors, such as wildlife, street trees, and public parks, on mental health. This pilot project aims to build upon the transdisciplinary dialogue between ecology, design, and public health by examining the social benefits of grazing lawnscape management, which is the practice of using herbivorous livestock to manage turfgrass areas. Through the design of an accessible central campus grazing space for a flock of 25 sheep and use of online questionnaires, a smartphone-based single-item survey, and open-ended feedback given via social media, the UC Davis Sheepmower Project addresses three primary questions: (1) Are there differences in self-reported stress levels and well-being between people who did not watch grazing sheep (no sheepmower group) compared with those who did watch grazing sheep (sheepmower group)? (2) Does holding sheep grazing events create opportunities for education about well-being and engagement with the campus community? (3) Can this type of urban grazing installation ultimately contribute to the overall identity of a college campus? Web-based questionnaire results indicate there is no significant difference in self-reported stress levels between the two groups; however, the moment-in-time smartphone-based single item question suggests that the presence of sheep provides temporary, noticeable relief and enhanced mood for those who observe the animals. Reflections posted on social media suggested that participants found the sheep grazing events fostered feelings of community and placemaking within the campus identity. However, the questionnaire sample indicated the grazing events did not have a significant effect on participants' sense of place or overall campus identity. This transdisciplinary effort breaks down traditionally siloed approaches to human and environmental health and is an example of a whole-systems approach to developing innovative solutions and encouraging applied collective action.

AB  - Paratuberculosis (PTB), caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), causes significant financial losses in the ruminant industry. The aim of this study is to describe the concomitant pathological findings as well as PTB-induced lesions in 39 naturally infected goats (15 vaccinated and 24 non-vaccinated). All animals exhibited MAP-induced microscopic lesions affecting target organs, although only 62% of those were detected grossly. Mainly concomitant inflammatory pathologies were recognized affecting the hemolymphatic, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Non-vaccinated animals exhibited both moderate and marked granulomatous enteritis in contrast with vaccinated ones which presented mild intestinal affection. Our results demonstrate that non-vaccinated animals presented pneumonia in all age groups studied (from 12 up to >48 months old). A significantly higher prevalence of ileocecal valve PTB lesions was detected in non-vaccinated animals with pneumonic lesions (p = 0.027). Furthermore, a reduction of gastrointestinal non-PTB processes was described in vaccinated goats. In conclusion, a PTB infected goat herd can be affected by a wide range of concomitant pathologies, mostly inflammatory in origin. Anatomic pathology is of crucial importance for correct herd diagnosis and histopathology is an indispensable tool for lesion detection. Additionally, anti-MAP vaccination could have a beneficial effect on the reduction of respiratory and gastrointestinal non-PTB diseases.

AB  - The seagrass Halophila stipulacea continues to spread rapidly through the Caribbean. Documenting native herbivore use of this invasive plant is important for understanding its impacts on marine communities and the mechanisms favoring its expansion. This study used observational and experimental data to determine if juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and long-spine urchins (Diadema antillarum) from the US Virgin Islands consumed H. stipulacea in the presence of native seagrass. Juvenile turtles associated significantly more with beds of native seagrass than mixed (native and invasive), and monospecific H. stipulacea, beds or sand bottoms. When individuals were followed, turtles foraged significantly more within mixed beds, but selectively fed on native species within them and were never observed feeding on monospecific H. stipulacea stands. When offered the native Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme, along with H. stipulacea, sea urchins significantly preferred S. filiforme over the other two choices. Measurements of fourteen nutritional and chemical parameters in these three seagrasses showed strong interspecific differences, with fewer and less predictable seasonal variations. Expressing these nutritional data by wet mass, rather than dry mass, also decreased the number of significant seasonal contrasts. Despite these differences, no parameters explained low herbivore preference for the invasive seagrass satisfactorily because nutrient values of H. stipulacea were often similar to those of the preferred natives. Our results conflict with recent studies pointing at low nutritional quality aiding against herbivory and suggest other mechanisms, such as herbivore learning and recognition of a novel resource, could be more important than currently appreciated.

AB  - Capsule The distribution of breeding Whinchats Saxicola rubetra shifted uphill following the cessation of grazing, potentially compromising their breeding success through additional squeezing of suitable habitat and environmental niches. Aims To assess whether breeding territories occupied by a conservation-priority grassland bird followed changes in sward structure associated with environmental exposure following cessation of grazing. Methods Whinchat territories and breeding success were monitored at upland study sites in Scotland during a period of habitat transformation from livestock-grazed grassland to young woodland with herbivores excluded. Results After grazing was excluded, there was generally an upwards elevational shift of breeding attempts by Whinchats (by 43 m in 7 years at one site). While the study sites were grazed, breeding attempts were more successful at lower elevations. After grazing ceased, there was lower breeding success at lower elevations where the resulting taller, denser vegetation likely restricted available foraging habitat. Despite that, lower areas continued to be occupied by territorial Whinchats. Conclusions The conservation of grassland birds within afforestation schemes could be supported by the maintenance of some open habitats at suitable elevations. However wider conservation of grassland birds, including within forested and pastoral high nature value farmed landscapes would benefit from a better understanding of the mechanisms operating on breeding success and habitat choice within these dynamically changing habitats.

AB  - The Qaidam Basin in the northern Tibetan Plateau is currently arid, but may have had a semi-humid to semi-arid climate in Miocene times, as suggested by pollen and isotopic data; however, the lack of macroscopic fossils hinders more precise paleoclimatic calibration. In this paper, we report fossil leaves with insect damage from a late Miocene layer (HT-5) in the Huaitoutala section dated similar to 11.4 Ma, and compare them with records from a middle Miocene layer (HT-1) dated similar to 12.7 Ma. Results show that damage diversity dropped from 36 types in HT1 to 24 types in HT-5, suggesting a fall in mean annual temperature. Damage frequency decreased from 70 % in HT-1 to 32 % in HT-5, pointing to a drop in the coldest month temperature. Moreover, a slight fall in the diversity of mining damage, from 5 types in HT-1 to 4 types in HT-5, suggests a shift towards a slightly more arid climate from the middle to late Miocene. The flora from HT-5 is composed mainly of Betulaceae, Populus, Ulmus, and shrubs. Based on the distribution of these taxa in modern vegetation, the climate was probably semi-humid, not entirely arid during the late Miocene. These results are corroborated by fossil mammal data from the same section. Therefore, despite a cooling and drying trend from the middle to late Miocene, the climate of the Qaidam Basin was not as extremely arid as today.

AB  - Sect. Camellia plants, widely distributed across southern China, hold significant economic value through their dual applications in landscape greening, ornamental horticulture, and oilseed production. However, with rapid changes in the global climate, it is becoming increasingly important to study the habitat distributions of species and the factors influencing their adaptations. Using the maximum entropy model, we predicted the past, present, and future distribution areas of suitable habitats for sect. Camellia under different climate scenarios. The results revealed that under current climate conditions, the total suitable area of sect. Camellia was 17.04 x 105 km2, and the highly suitable area was 1.95 x 105 km2. The distribution of sect. Camellia was strongly influenced by key environmental factors, such as the maximum temperature in the hottest month (Bio5), the minimum temperature in the coldest month (Bio6), the annual difference in temperature (Bio7), and the slope (Slope). In view of future climate change, the suitable distribution center of sect. Camellia is expected to shift to higher latitudes and may undergo northward movement to adapt to new environmental conditions, leading to an expansion of the total suitable area.

AB  - A simple food chain (plant, insect pests, and predatory arthropods) in an agro-ecosystem was set up here as a model system to elucidate the potential effect of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton on non-target organisms. The system included transgenic/non-transgenic cotton, neonate larvae of three herbivorous insects (Spodoptera exigua, Helicoverpa armigera, and S. litura), and predatory lacewing larvae (Chrysopa spp.), which represent the first, second, and third trophic levels, respectively. The results showed that transgenic treatments and different densities of prey had significant effects on both body-weight gain of neonate herbivorous larvae and the number of prey captured by lacewing larvae, respectively. It was found that Bt toxin could persist at the third trophic level in lacewing larvae. The diet mixture bioassay showed that body-weight gain of lacewing larvae was significantly affected by various treatments, especially at lower concentrations of plant-expressed Bt toxin in the diet mixture, which caused significant decreases in body-weight gain. In contrast, synthetic Bt toxin at higher concentrations in the diet did not show this effect. Thus, we inferred that Bt toxin indirectly affected the growth of the lacewings and the lacewings may not be susceptible to Bt toxin or are able to metabolize it.

AB  - The escalating global climate anomalies and disruption of ecological equilibrium pose profound threats to agroecosystems and crop productivity. Drought stress, a prominent consequence of climate change, exert detrimental effects on plant physiology, thereby reducing crop yield. This study explores the implementation of Trichoderma-mediated defence priming in barley under drought stress. Through a comprehensive evaluation of encompassing morphological, stomatal, biochemical, and yield parameters, Trichoderma- primed barley is compared with non-primed barley under drought stress conditions. Our results revealed that Trichoderma-primed barley exhibits heightened tolerance to drought stress in comparison to non-primed barley. The improved stomatal characteristics indicate that Trichoderma priming enables the plant to better adapt to drought conditions. Biochemical analysis showed enhanced photosynthetic pigments and reduced MDA in primed barley under drought, suggesting that primed barley experiences less oxidative stress compared to non-primed barley. Additionally, Trichoderma-primed plants displayed heightened levels of both non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant activities, aiding in ROS detoxification. Stress responses are activated upon encountering a triggering stimulus (drought stress), but not after Trichoderma priming. This means there was no wasteful diversion of resources towards resistance mechanisms in the absence of stressful situations, leading to enhanced yield for primed barley compared to non-primed barley under stressful conditions. Furthermore, our investigation into the heritability of priming effects in the succeeding generation demonstrates that the progeny of primed barley retains enhanced protection akin to their primed parents. In contrast the progeny of non-primed barley exhibits greater vulnerability under water-deficit conditions. The expression of the epigenetic regulator gene HvDME was more enhanced in primed barley and its subsequent generations than in non-primed barley. This research emphasizes the potential of Trichoderma priming as a cost-effective strategy to enhance barley production amidst climate change challenges. The priming defense approach offers an intelligent plant health management solution devoid of adverse environmental or yield-related implications. This discovery holds significant promise, particularly in regions with limited water resources where crops are highly susceptible to drought stress. The findings contribute to the advancement of sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture, offering insights for practitioners and policymakers aiming to address the adverse impacts of climate change on crop production.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems, located in the land-sea interface, host a diverse array of fungi. In this paper, we introduce a novel genus, three novel species and one new record of fungi collected from mangrove environments in Pranburi, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Thailand. We establish Pseudomelanconiella as a new genus in Melanconiellaceae, to accommodate Pseudomelanconiella mangrovei, a saprobe from submerged decomposing wood of Avicennia marina. Phylogenetic analysis indicates its close relation with Septomelanconiella, but they differ in the morphology of the conidia. Additionally, our analysis of Melanconiellaceae led to the reclassification of Melanconiella loropetali to Sinodiscula loropetali and synonymizing Sinodiscula camellicola and Melanconiella camelliae. This paper also introduces two other novel species: Peroneutypa hibisci, a saprobe found on Hibiscus tiliaceus and Pseudochaetosphaeronema bruguierae from Bruguiera cylindrica, the first species in this genus reported as a mangrove fungus. A new record of Rimora mangrovei from Ceriops tagal is also reported. These discoveries emphasize the rich fungal diversity in mangrove ecosystems supporting further exploration of this unique environment.

AB  - Dama gazelles (Nanger dama Pallas, 1766) are critically endangered within their native habitat of northern Africa's Sahelo-Saharan Zone. However, several Texas ranches maintain populations that provide a hedge against extinction and that can provide suitable stock for conservation projects, including reintroduction. For these initiatives, there is a critical need for information on spatial requirements of male dama gazelles. This is especially the case, because population increase is hindered by aggressive behaviour of males kept within limited areas. Adult males kill other males. We report on the spatial distribution and interaction potential (interanimal distances) of male eastern dama gazelles (N. dama ruficollis) from a population living on 8 996 ha of fenced rangeland in West Texas, USA. We fitted five males with GPS-radio collars and tracked their positions every 3 h for one year. Adult males (n = 3) maintained annual 95% Kernel Home Ranges (KHR) averaging 1 783 ha with 50% core areas averaging 440 ha. Average distance between adults with adjacent home ranges was 2.8 to 4.6 km, with only four contacts within 20 m recorded. Subadult males (n = 2) had more diffuse home ranges and a common core area. They only associated in a loose bachelor group for part of the time. Their space use can overlap with that of adult males. When spatial requirements are met, problems caused by aggression can be minimised. Small sample size prevents definite recommendations, but results point to productive avenues for additional study to enhance management of other ex situ populations.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had serious consequences on employment and recent reports have warned that the impacts of the crisis are never gender-neutral. The objective of this research is to analyse the variations that have existed in terms of female representation in the Spanish listed companies during the COVID-19 scenario. The integrated annual reports and the non-financial information reports of each company have been examined to identify the changes that have occurred in their governance structures, leadership positions, and total workforce. A descriptive and correlational analysis was carried out in 2019 and 2020. The findings reveal that: (1) there has been a slight increase in the figures of female representation in different hierarchical positions; (2) the proportion of women on the boards of directors does not depend on the number of women in lower positions; and (3) there is a positive relationship between female representation in leadership positions and the number of women in the total workforce. These results have important implications for business sustainability in the medium and long term.

AB  - The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is increasingly threatened by habitat loss, climatic extremes, and genetic isolation. Kangaroo Island hosts the only introduced population of the species outside its natural range, offering a rare opportunity to examine population resilience under environmental stress. We conducted live-trapping surveys in the Rocky River catchment in 2021 and 2022, following severe drought, bushfires, and flooding, and compared results with historical data from 1998 to 2000. Capture rates in 2021-2022 were approximately half those recorded two decades earlier, with declining catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) observed further upstream, suggesting altered spatial dynamics or reduced abundance. Juveniles were captured in both years, indicating continued reproduction despite recent disturbances. Dietary analysis showed a shift in prey composition, with a higher prevalence of Decapoda in 2022, and blood analyses identified year-to-year differences in red cell counts, haemoglobin, and glucose concentrations. These findings point to a population that remains reproductively active and behaviourally flexible, but potentially vulnerable to ongoing environmental change. Given the catchment's limited extent, low genetic diversity, and projections of increasing drought frequency and reduced rainfall, this population may face heightened extinction risks in the coming decades. Continued monitoring of abundance, health, and habitat use is essential for assessing long-term viability and informing conservation strategies, both for this population and as a model for managing isolated platypus populations under climate stress.

AB  - Background: South Africa is an important centre of cycad diversity in Africa, however, the country's cycads face extinction. Among the primary causes is the poaching of plants from the wild, even within protected areas.
   Objectives: This study examined poaching patterns in a local population of the Endangered Encephalartos eugene-maraisii I.Verd. and how it might affect the population structure, sex ratios, as well as interactions with associated insects.
   Methods: The population was surveyed in 2008 and 40% of this population was resurveyed between 2021 and 2022. We mapped missing cycads and generated heatmaps. Lastly, we investigated whether the proportion of stems from different size classes, sex ratios and abundance of insect associates varied between areas with a high and low poaching incidence.
   Results: Poaching, defined as the illegal removal of individuals from the wild, occurred 1.5 times more frequently along the border fence line than areas further away. Medium-sized stems (21-80 cm) are primarily targeted (likely as they can be carried more easily) and low proportions of these stems remain in areas with a high poaching incidence. While E. eugene-maraisii exhibits some resilience against poaching through basal suckering, it takes several decades for suckers to mature and replace harvested stems. No effect on sex ratios were recorded in areas with a high poaching incidence, suggesting poachers have not deliberately selected female or male cycads at this site. No pollinating insects were detected on E. eugene-maraisii, and no seedlings were observed.
   Conclusion: Cone production may be too rare in diminished populations to support pollinators that utilise cones as brood sites. The presence of insects that use other plant parts, including leaves, dried leaf stalks and cycad trunks, in the larger population suggests that they are more resilient to diminishing host populations. However, these insects were absent in smaller populations, and their abundances were lower in low-density sites and smaller clump sizes of their host in the larger population. This suggests these insects may be vulnerable to the decline of their host populations due to poaching.

AB  - Although evidence is sporadic it is becoming clear that haymaking and hay meadow management were likely indispensable elements of practices related to animal husbandry during the Roman period. As large towns begin to emerge, success in breeding large livestock such as cattle and horses would have required good quality fodder. Yet, how we distinguish fodder or other animal associated plant remains in the archaeological record can be problematic for many reasons. This paper explores this issue through the context of Roman Mursa, located in modern day Osijek, Croatia. Two pits dating to c. AD133, contained relatively large quantities of grassland and wet ground species, such as Trifolium/Melilotus sp. Prunella vulgaris and the grasses Poa sp. and Phleum sp., as well as chaff and other remains, such as dung, eggshells, and fish scales. By examining the proportion of species grouped into habitat types, we see that the composition of sample SU391 is indictive of hay meadows and could indicate nearby animal stabling in the centre of the early Roman colony.

AB  - Understanding the factors associated with the species diversity and distribution of insect vectors is critically important for disease epidemiology. Black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) are significant hematophagous insects, as many species are pests and vectors that transmit pathogens to humans and other animals. Ecological factors associated with black fly species distribution have been extensively examined for the immature stages but are far less well explored for the adult stage. In this study, we collected a total of 7706 adult black fly specimens from various locations in forests, villages and animal shelters in Thailand. The integration of morphology and DNA barcoding revealed 16 black fly taxa, including Simulium yvonneae, a species first found in Vietnam, which is a new record for Thailand. The most abundant species was the Simulium asakoae complex (n = 5739, 74%), followed by S. chumpornense Takaoka and Kuvangkadilok (n = 1232, 16%). The Simulium asakoae complex was dominant in forest (3786 of 4456; 85%) and village (1774 of 2077; 85%) habitats, while S. chumpornense predominated (857 of 1175; 73%) in animal shelter areas. The Simulium asakoae complex and S. nigrogilvum Summers, which are significant pests and vectors in Thailand, occurred at a wide range of elevations, although the latter species was found mainly in high (>1000 m) mountain areas. Simulium chumpornense, S. nodosum Puri and the S. siamense Takaoka and Suzuki complex occurred predominately in low (<800 m)-elevation areas. Simulium furvum Takaoka and Srisuka; S. phurueaense Tangkawanit, Wongpakam and Pramual; and S. nr. phurueaense were only found in high (>1000 m) mountain areas. A host blood meal analysis revealed that the S. asakoae; S. chamlongi Takaoka and Suzuki; S. nigrogilvum; S. chumpornense; and the S. striatum species group were biting humans. This is the first report of the latter two species biting humans. We also found that S. chumpornense was biting turkeys, and S. chamlongi was biting chickens, which are new host blood sources recorded for these species. In addition, we found that the S. feuerborni Edwards complex was biting water buffalo, which is the first report on the biting habits of this species.

AB  - One of the challenges that living organisms face is to promptly respond to genotoxic stress to avoid DNA damage. To this purpose, all organisms, including plants, developed complex DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms. These mechanisms are highly conserved among organisms and need to be finely regulated. In this scenario, microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as active players, thus attracting the attention of the research community. The involvement of miRNAs in DDR has been investigated prominently in human cells whereas studies in plants are still scarce. To experimentally investigate the involvement of plant miRNAs in the regulation of DDR-associated pathways, an ad hoc system was developed, using the model legume Medicago truncatula. Specific treatments with camptothecin (CPT) and/or NSC120686 (NSC), targeting distinct components of DDR, namely topoisomerase I (TopI) and tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), were used. Phenotypic (germination percentage and speed, seedling growth) and molecular (cell death, DNA damage, and gene expression profiles) analyses demonstrated that the imposed treatments impact DDR. Our results show that these treatments do not influence the germination process but rather inhibit seedling development, causing an increase in cell death and accumulation of DNA damage. Moreover, treatment-specific changes in the expression of suppressor of gamma response 1 (SOG1), master-regulator of plant DDR, were observed. Additionally, the expression of multiple genes playing important roles in different DNA repair pathways and cell cycle regulation were differentially expressed in a treatment-specific manner. Subsequently, specific miRNAs identified from our previous bioinformatics approaches as putatively targeting genes involved in DDR processes were investigated alongside their targets. The obtained results indicate that under most conditions when a miRNA is upregulated the corresponding candidate target gene is downregulated, providing an indirect evidence of miRNAs action over these targets. Hence, the present study extends the present knowledge on the information available regarding the roles played by miRNAs in the post-transcriptional regulation of DDR in plants.

AB  - Restoration of dryland ecosystems is often limited by low seedling establishment and survival. Defoliation caused by insects and small mammals could be an overlooked cause of seedling mortality. In the sagebrush steppe, we examined the effect of seedling defoliation on the survival of perennial grasses commonly used as restoration materials. Under field conditions, seedlings of three perennial bunchgrass species (non-native Agropyron cristatum, and native grasses Poe secunda and Pseudoroegneria spicata) were defoliated at two intensities (30 % and 70 % leaf length removal) and frequencies (one or two clippings) and compared to a non-defoliated control. Following emergence the first year, clippings occurred at the two-leaf stage; a second clipping occurred 1 month later for repeated defoliation treatments. We monitored seedling survival and tillering for 2 years. We expected higher defoliation intensity and frequency to reduce survival for all species, but only a few treatments reduced Po. secunda survival. Conversely, larger-statured Triticeae (wheatgrasses) benefited from some defoliation treatments. In both years, A. cristatum survival increased with repeated defoliation at both intensities. Defoliation did not affect Ps. spicata survival in the first year, but a single defoliation in the second year resulted in increased survival. In both A. cristatum and Ps. spicata, higher-intensity defoliation reduced the boost to survival resulting from defoliation frequency. Seedlings with more tillers had greater survival probabilities, but tiller number was unaffected by defoliation. Further research may elucidate mechanisms seedlings use to compensate for or benefit from defoliation. In the meantime, managers should aim to select defoliation-tolerant species if they anticipate herbivory will be problematic for restoration sites.

AB  - Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), is an important disease in both human and animal systems. Helminths are commonly found in coinfection with MTC and TB is often exacerbated in such coinfections. Long-term anthelmintic administration, to control helminths, can improve a host's ability to control MTC infection. Mass drug administration programmes, in which anthelmintics are given only once or twice a year, leaving periods where helminth reinfection can occur, are common in both human and domestic animal populations. To date, the effect of such intermittent control programmes on MTC infection and severity has not been explored.Methods: Here we investigate the consequences of a ten-day, annual, mass ivermectin administration on TB prevalence and severity in free-ranging juvenile and yearling (<2 years) wild boar (Sus scrofa).Results: This single annual anthelmintic treatment administered over six years reduced TB severity. Further, the proportion of wild boar with severe TB continued to decrease with successive treatments. TB prevalence, however, did not decrease significantly over the course of the study.Discussion: While ivermectin has direct anti-mycobacterial effects in vitro, the short duration of treatment means that the reduction in TB severity we observe in wild boar is unlikely to be accounted for by such a direct mechanism. Disruption of the helminth community and subsequent modification or enhancement of the host immune response is a potential mechanism. Future work should examine the consequences of annual anthelmintic drug administration on helminth community composition and structure and on the host immunological responses through time.

AB  - The degradation of marine ecosystems is a growing concern worldwide, emphasizing the need for efficient tools to assess their ecological status. Herein, a novel ecosystem-based ecological evaluation index of shallow rocky reefs is introduced and tested in the Aegean and Ionian Seas (NE Mediterranean). The index focuses on a specific set of pre-selected species, including habitat-forming, key, commercially important, and non-indigenous species, across a wide range of trophic levels (1.00-4.53). Data acquisition is conducted through rapid non-destructive SCUBA diving surveys to assess all macroscopic food web components (macroalgae, invertebrates, and fish). Two versions of the index, ECOfast and ECOfast-NIS, were developed, each applying a different approach to account for the impact of non-indigenous species. In our case study, the correlations between the two versions of the index and sea surface temperature, protection status, occurrence of carnivorous fish, and non-indigenous herbivores were assessed through generalized additive models (GAMs). The assessment assigned 93% (ECOfast) or 96% (ECOfast-NIS) of the sites to a moderate to bad ecological status, indicating an alarming situation in the shallow rocky reefs of the NE Mediterranean. Sites evaluated as poor or bad were characterized by extensive coverage of ephemeral macroalgae, absence or minimal presence of large indigenous carnivorous fish, and complete absence of one to three out of five invertebrate functional trophic groups. The community composition of macroalgae, herbivorous species, and carnivorous fishes differed between the 5 m and 15 m depth zones. Surface temperature and carnivorous fish occurrence were the most important tested predictors of the ecological status of shallow rocky reefs. The best GAMs showed that the ECOfast score declined with sea surface temperature and increased with the occurrence of carnivorous fish; ECOfast-NIS declined with sea surface temperature and the occurrence of non-indigenous fish and increased with the occurrence of carnivorous fish. The nondestructive and integrative nature of this approach, its speed of data acquisition and analysis, and its capacity to account for highly mobile predatory fish and non-indigenous species render the ECOfast index a novel, robust, and valuable tool for assessing the ecological status of shallow rocky reefs.

AB  - Global warming causes dramatic environmental change to Arctic ecosystems. While pelagic primary production is initiated earlier and its intensity can be increased due to earlier ice melt and extended open-water periods, sea-ice primary production is progressively confined on a spatio-temporal scale, leading to unknown consequences for the ice-associated (sympagic) food web. Understanding ecological responses to changes in the availability and composition of pelagic and sympagic food sources is crucial to determine potential changes of food-web structure and functioning in Arctic marine communities under increasingly ice-free conditions. Focus was placed on the importance of suspended particulate organic matter vs. sympagic organic matter for 12 zooplankton species with different feeding modes covering five taxonomic groups (copepods, krill, amphipods, chaetognaths, and appendicularians) at two ice-covered, but environmentally different, stations in the north-western Barents Sea in August 2019. Contributions of diatom- and flagellate-associated fatty acids (FAs) to total lipid content and carbon stable isotopic compositions of these FAs were used to discriminate food sources and trace flows of organic matter in marine food webs. Combination of proportional contributions of FA markers with FA isotopic composition indicated that consumers mostly relied, directly (herbivorous species), or indirectly (omnivorous and carnivorous species), on pelagic diatoms and flagellates, independently of environmental conditions at the sampling locations, trophic position, and feeding mode. Differences were nevertheless observed between species. Contrary to other studies demonstrating a high importance of sympagic organic matter for food-web processes, our results highlight the complexity and variability of trophic structures and dependencies in different Arctic food webs.

AB  - The negative in utero effects of bisphenol A (BPA) on female reproduction are of concern since the ovarian reserve of primordial follicles is constituted during the fetal period. This time-window is difficult to access, particularly in humans. Animal models and explant culture systems are, therefore, vital tools for investigating EDC impacts on primordial germ cells (PGCs). Here, we investigated the effects of BPA on prophase I meiosis in the fetal sheep ovary. We established an in vitro model of early gametogenesis through retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of sheep PGCs that progressed through meiosis. Using this system, we demonstrated that BPA (3 x10(-7) M & 3 x10(-5) M) exposure for 20 days disrupted meiotic initiation and completion in sheep oogonia and induced transcriptomic modifications of exposed explants. After exposure to the lowest concentrations of BPA (3 x10(-7) M), only 2 probes were significantly up-regulated corresponding to NR2F1 and TMEM167A transcripts. In contrast, after exposure to 3 x 10(-5) M BPA, 446 probes were deregulated, 225 were down-and 221 were up -regulated following microarray analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of differentially expressed genes revealed that pathways mainly affected were involved in cell-cycle phase transition, meiosis and spindle as-sembly. Differences in key gene expression within each pathway were validated by qRT-PCR. This study provides a novel model for direct examination of the molecular pathways of environmental toxicants on early female gametogenesis and novel insights into the mechanisms by which BPA affects meiosis I. BPA exposure could thereby disrupt ovarian reserve formation by inhibiting meiotic progression of oocytes I and consequently by increasing atresia of primordial follicles containing defective oocytes.

AB  - The study of attitudes toward wild elephants and human-elephant conflict (HEC) is vital to understanding what attitudes are held by local people and how to incorporate them into wild elephant conservation. This study investigated the interlinkages between the HEC experience and local people's attitudes toward the conservation of wild elephants and which exploratory factors influence these attitudes. We used a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) framework to highlight the interlinkages between HEC and people's attitudes. The basic BBN model indicated that HEC was central in determining the attitudes of local people. Although people generally hold positive attitudes toward elephants, people support having elephants in the country but not in their own regions. Conservation willingness was not obvious due to the lack of deliberate assistance from the government to the affected communities. We suggest implementing education programs to promote local awareness of conflict mitigation techniques.

AB  - Social perception of ungulates and their management depends on both their abundance and the socioeconomic context. However, an approach that addresses this issue is currently unavailable. Our objective was to employ a survey in Spain (n = 440) to evaluate the knowledge and perceptions on the eight species of wild ungulates that inhabit the Iberian Peninsula, and their abundance. The results showed that respondents were unaware of the existence of many of the species. Only wild boar (95% of the surveyed population) and red deer (72%) were widely identified. Respondents perceived that urban, agricultural, and livestock contexts were the most frequent suffering overabundance, with the wild boar as most relevant species (86%). This study illustrates how a better understanding of overabundance and public perceptions is important to ensure effective communication on ungulate population status and to improve public support for their management, thus avoiding bias toward certain species, impacts, or specific contexts.

AB  - Herbivores rely heavily on liver enzymes to deal with plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) due to their consumption on plant-based diets, but only a small amount of enzymes have been described based on the genomic level. It is suggested that a multigene subfamily, cytochrome P450 2B ( CYP2B ), involved in PSMs processing. However, CYP2B subfamily genes of only several rodent species have been characterized, and the copies of CYP2B gene have been compared between the specialist and generalist. Here we investigated the phylogeny of CYP2B subfamily genes in primates with known genome sequences, and related the number of gene to the diet. Furthermore, we compared the CYP2B subfamily genes in two closely related species, Macaca assamensis and Ma. mulatta, , which can be viewed as specialist (mainly feeds on Bonia saxatilis) ) and generalist, respectively, to examine whether the difference of gene number or sequence diversity exists between these two species. The result showed that, most primates have only one CYP2B subfamily gene, although several herbivores have two copies; and both Ma. assamensis and Ma. mulatta have one CYP2B subfamily gene, each with 8 SNPs in them, which is mainly because that multiple SNPs can lead to higher diversity, and further can help deal with various toxins. Physicochemical property prediction indicated that some of these SNPs may cause radical variations between the gene functions. This study is a comprehensive exploration on the evolution of a detoxification enzyme gene subfamily in the primate group, and provides an initial genetic foundation to explore how the closely related species respond to diet from the perspective of P450.

AB  - Closely related species that have previously inhabited geographically separated ranges are hybridizing at an increasing rate due to human disruptions. These human-mediated hybrid zones can be used to study reproductive isolation between species at secondary contact, including examining locus-specific rates of introgression. Introgression is expected to be heterogenous across the genome, reflecting variation in selection. Those loci that introgress especially slowly are good candidates for being involved in reproductive isolation, while those loci that introgress quickly may be involved in adaptive introgression. In the context of conservation, policy makers are especially concerned about introduced alleles moving quickly into the background of a native or endemic species, as these alleles could replace the native alleles in the population, leading to extinction via hybridization. We applied genomic cline analyses to 44,997 SNPs to identify loci introgressing more or less when compared to the genome wide expectation in a human-mediated hybridizing population of red deer and sika in Kintyre Scotland. We found 11.4% of SNPs had cline centres that were significantly different from the genome wide expectation, and 17.6% of all SNPs had excess rates of introgression. Based on simulations, we believe that many of these markers have diverged from the genome-wide average due to drift, rather than because of selection, and we suggest that these simulations can be useful as a null distribution for future studies of genomic clines. Future work on red deer and sika could determine the policy implications of allelic-replacement due to drift rather than selection, and could use replicate, geographically distinct hybrid zones to narrow down those loci that are responding to selection.

AB  - PurposeThe degrading impacts of livestock production on the environment are well acknowledged. Although ruminants are much studied due to their large contribution to climate change impact, monogastrics are also known to carry a significant load, and mitigation options need investigation. Here, the climate change impact and water scarcity impact of Finnish pork production was investigated using the life cycle assessment approach.MethodsAs the importance of communicating reliable environmental information has been acknowledged in the EU, methods and guidance for this purpose have been developed. Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules have also been published for several food product categories, although not yet for meat. Here, the life cycle assessment methods were used based on PEFCR guidance and the draft version of red meat PEFCR guidance to achieve a reliable, transparent and comparable assessment.ResultsFinnish pork production resulted in a climate change impact of 3.6 kg CO2 eq. kgCW-1 and a water scarcity impact of 0.69 m3 eq. kgCW-1. The largest contribution to the climate change impact came from feed crop production, with an impact of 43%. Land-use changes were included, and their contribution to the Finnish pork climate change impact was 3%. Similarly, in the water scarcity impact, feed crop production was a major contributor, with 41% from fattening pig feed production. Significant contributions to both categories also came from piglet production, including feed crop production, and to the climate change impact from manure storage.ConclusionsFinnish production was seen to already largely utilise sidestreams and domestic feed ingredients, although, e.g. soybean is still used. Based on the results, in mitigating the environmental impacts of Finnish pork production, attention should especially be paid to the resource-efficient production of domestic feed crops and reduced use of organic soils. As current assessment models are unable to grasp the impacts of regenerative farming techniques, the development of LCA methods is also required. Water scarcity impact was seen to be largely affected by the utilisation of feed crops originating from water-scarce countries. As a mitigation measure, the procurement of these feed crops and ingredients should therefore be directed to water-abundant areas and from production which does not depend on irrigation water or the extensive use of synthetic inputs.

AB  - Historic practices to reduce dangerous interactions between people, livestock, and large carnivores are returning alongside the recovery of some large carnivore populations. Emerging novel scenarios where people and carnivores interact make it important to identify nonlethal tools to reduce risk to people and facilitate coexistence. We tested an ancient practice in a novel way by placing livestock guardian dogs (LGDs) at farmsteads (i.e., areas with a family home and grain bins) with chronic interactions with grizzly bears (Ursus arctos). Grizzly bears are attracted to spilled grains around storage bins, causing concern over human safety near homes. Although we were only able to place five LGDs at four farmsteads, we found several lines of evidence supporting the use of LGDs to deter bears and protect people. There were 58-fold fewer camera-trap detections of bears visiting farmsteads with LGDs and an increase in behaviors suggesting bear discomfort compared to paired neighbor farmsteads that did not receive an LGD (i.e., control sites). After LGDs were deployed, there was an 87.8 % reduction in GPS-collar locations of bears within 300 m of farmsteads relative to before. Farmers had a positive experience using LGDs and would recommend them to others. Our results suggest LGDs could serve to protect specific locations and offer a new use of an old tool, but we recommend further research to broaden the scope of inference because of the small sample size of this study.

AB  - In the present study, we carried out palynological (pollen, spores, fungal remains, and freshwater algae) and pedological analyses from three paleosols (Ps6, Ps7, and Ps8) that developed in the upper part of the Arturo perched dune deposits, in the periphery of the homonymous lake, and compared the results with modern palynological assemblages from the Fuegian steppe in southern Argentina. These proxies offer an exceptional opportunity to enhance our knowledge of environmental conditions during the Holocene in the southern high latitudes. Pollen spectra from the paleosols Ps6 (middle Holocene), Ps7 and Ps8 (late Holocene) were dominated by Asteraceae subf. Asteroideae undifferentiated, which suggests that herbaceous and/or shrub vegetation probably developed locally on the dune. The existence of herbivorous grazers is indicated by the record of ascospores of several coprophilous fungi (Coniochaeta cf. lignaria, cf. Delitschia pachylospora, cf. Schizothecium sp., Sordaria-type, Sporormiella-type). Most other fungal remains (Glomus, cf. Cryptendoxyla hypophloia, Microthyriaceae, Alternaria sp., Dictyosporium sp.) are likely associated with the presence of steppe vegetation communities. In general, the paleosols displayed a low degree of pedological development and in one of them (Ps7) there is evidence of the re-activation of eolian processes. Taken together, our palynological and pedological results, as well as sedimentological and geomorphological data, indicate that Ps6 developed under less humid conditions than the overlying paleosols, Ps7 and Ps8. The variations in moisture availability during soil-forming intervals could be related to shifts in the latitudinal position and/or strength of westerlies throughout the middle to late Holocene.

AB  - Wedgefishes (Rhinidae) are threatened by unsustainable fishing globally, and especially in the Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO), due to their high-value fins in the shark trade. The whitespotted wedgefish Rhynchobatus djiddensis and the bottlenose wedgefish R. australiae are both classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, yet a lack of species-specific knowledge and taxonomic uncertainty still exists within this genus. Genetic approaches aid in taxonomic classification and identifying distinct populations for targeted conservation. Morphological specimen identification of samples (n = 189) collected across the SWIO was confirmed based on the cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) and/or nicotinamide adenine dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) gene regions. The genetic diversity and population structure within and between species and sampling locations were investigated using a dual marker approach: (1) 2 concatenated mitochondrial gene regions, namely COI and the control region (n = 117), and (2) 9 nuclear microsatellite markers (n = 146). The overall genetic diversity was moderate, with an indication that different evolutionary forces are at play on a mitochondrial versus nuclear level. The 2 species were delineated based on both marker types, and for R. djiddensis, the sampling locations of South Africa and Mozambique were genetically homogeneous. For R. australiae, significant differentiation was found between sampling locations, with Madagascar and Tanzania being genetically the most similar. This information provides critical insights into the distribution range and population structure of the whitespotted wedgefish species complex that can support the sustainable management of wedgefishes.

AB  - Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is regarded as an emerging and reemerging pathogen that is a primary cause of viral encephalitis in humans. However, there is a scarcity of research on the prevalence of JEV genotypes across the different mosquito species in Shanghai. In this study, the diversity of mosquito species and prevalence of JEV in pig and sheep farms in Shanghai were surveyed in 2022. A total of 24,073 mosquitoes, belonging to four genera and seven species, were collected from pig and sheep enclosures in the Chongming, Jiading, Pudong, Fengxian, and Jinshan Districts of Shanghai. Culex tritaeniorhynchus was identified as the predominant species (87.09%, 20,965/24,073) with the highest JEV detection rate. Six strains of JEV were isolated in this study, and genetic analysis revealed that five strains (SH22-M5, SH22-M9, SH22-M14, SH22-M41, and SH22-M52) belonged to genotype I (GI), while one strain (SH22-M1) was classified as genotype III (GIII). The sequence homology was highest between SH22-M9 and SD-1 (99.87%) and between SH22-M14 and SD12 (99.53%). SH22-M5, SH22-M41, and SH22-M52 shared the highest sequence homology with the HEN07011 strain (99.73-99.93%). SH22-M1 was most closely related to SH18, with a sequence homology of 99.8%. Additionally, for the first time, the GI JEV strain was isolated from mosquitoes in sheep sties in this study. The findings highlight the necessity of enhancing the surveillance of JEV in pigs and other livestock farms, including sheep, as well as monitoring the mosquitoes present in these environments. It is recommended that livestock farming areas be kept separate from human habitation to reduce the risk of JEV infections in humans.

AB  - Species distributions are driven by abiotic and biotic factors, but the importance of variation in the availability and quality of critical resources is poorly understood. Disentangling the relative importance of these factors-abiotic environment, availability of critical resources, and resource quality-will be important to modeling species current distributions and responses to projected climate change. We address these questions using species distribution models (SDMs) for the western monarch butterfly population (Danaus plexippus), whose larvae feed exclusively on Asclepias species known for their heterogeneous distribution and variation in host quality. We modeled the distribution of 24 Asclepias species to compare three monarch distribution models with increasing levels of complexity: (1) a null model using only environmental factors (climate envelope model), (2) a model using environmental factors and Asclepias availability estimated as species richness, (3) and a model using environmental factors and Asclepias' availability weighted by host plant quality as assessed through a greenhouse bioassay of larval performance. Asclepias models predicted that half of the Asclepias species will expand their ranges and shift toward higher latitudes, while half will contract. These patterns were uncorrelated with host plant quality. Among the three monarch models, the climate envelope model was the poorest performing. Models accounting for host plant availability performed best, while accounting for host plant quality did not improve model performance. The climate envelope model estimated more restrictive contemporary and future monarch ranges compared to both host plant models. Although all three models predicted future monarch range expansions, the projected future distributions varied among models. The climate envelope model predicted range expansions along the Pacific coast and contractions inland. In contrast, the host plant availability and quality models predicted range expansions in both of these regions and, as a result, 14% and 19% increases in distribution (respectively) relative to the climate envelope model. These models do not include other factors affecting monarch persistence. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that accounting for information on host plant availability and response to climate change is necessary to predict future species distributions, but that variation in the quality of those critical resources may be of secondary importance.

AB  - Independently, both heat stress (HS) and zearalenone (ZEN) compromise female reproduction, thus the hy-pothesis that ZEN would affect phenotypic, endocrine, and metabolic parameters in pigs with a synergistic and/ or additive impact of HS was investigated. Prepubertal gilts (n = 6-7) were assigned to: thermoneutral (TN) vehicle control (TC; n = 6); TN ZEN (40 mu g/kg; TZ; n = 6); pair-fed (PF; n = 6) vehicle control (PC; n = 6); PF ZEN (40 mu g/kg; PZ; n = 6); HS vehicle control (HC; n = 7); and HS ZEN (40 mu g/kg; HZ; n = 7) and experienced either constant 21.0 +/- 0.10 degrees C (TN and PF) or 35.0 +/- 0.2 degrees C (12 h) and 32.2 +/- 0.1 degrees C (12 h) to induce HS for 7 d. Elevated rectal temperature (P < 0.01) and respiration rate (P < 0.01) confirmed induction of HS. Rectal tem-perature was decreased (P = 0.03) by ZEN. Heat stress decreased (P < 0.01) feed intake, body weight, and average daily gain, with absence of a ZEN effect (P > 0.22). White blood cells, hematocrit, and lymphocytes decreased (P < 0.04) with HS. Prolactin increased (P < 0.01) in PC and PZ and increased in HZ females (P < 0.01). 17 beta-estradiol reduced (P < 0.01) in HC and increased in TZ females (P = 0.03). Serum metabolites were altered by both HS and ZEN. Neither HS nor ZEN impacted ovary weight, uterus weight, teat size or vulva area in TN and PF treatments, although ZEN increased vulva area (P = 0.02) in HS females. Thus, ZEN and HS, inde-pendently and additively, altered blood composition, impacted the serum endocrine and metabolic profile and increased vulva size in prepubertal females, potentially contributing to infertility.

AB  - This study examines the behavioral adaptations of Gaddi goats (Capra hircus) managed under transhumant pastoralism in the Himalayan region of Himachal Pradesh, India. Seasonal migrations by Gaddi pastoralists align with reproductive cycles and forage availability. The objective was to explore how seasonal migrations and traditional pastoral decisions align with key reproductive stages-mid-pregnancy (MP), post-kidding (PK), and mid-lactation (ML)-to optimize resource utilization and ensure goat welfare. Behavioral patterns were documented across three altitudinal zones: high hills (>1800 m), mid hills (651-1800 m), and low hills (350-650 m). Observations were conducted on four flocks (n=248 +/- 15.1) along two migratory routes, documenting behaviors over 8-h grazing periods using focal sampling and video recordings. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA in SPSS. Results showed total feeding time was highest (P<0.05) during ML (58.77%) compared to PK (56.33%) and MP (54.58%). Browsing time peaked during ML (45.87%), while grazing was most prominent during MP (46.18%). Standing time was significantly higher (P<0.05) at MP and PK compared to ML, with no significant differences in walking, ruminating, or lying. Bipedal stance and object grooming were highest during ML, while self-grooming was most frequent post-kidding. The findings highlight how pastoral decisions align with the physiological needs of Gaddi goats, enhancing their adaptability, resource utilization, and welfare. Behavioral observations validate traditional transhumant practices and suggest pathways for optimizing livestock management in mountainous terrains.n

AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a highly virulent DNA virus that causes African swine fever, a severe hemorrhagic disease affecting domestic and wild pigs, leading to significant animal health burdens and economic losses. Initially limited to the sub-Saharan African region, ASFV genotype II has spread globally and is now a major concern in Africa, Europe, Asia, the Pacific and, more recently, the Caribbean. In this study, we performed phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses using newly sequenced ASFV genomes from Lithuania, combined with previously available complete genomes, to investigate the spatiotemporal dispersal dynamics of ASFV genotype II in Europe. Our analysis suggests that ASFV genotype II has not been recently imported to Europe from other regions; instead, the spread is largely driven by long-distance dispersal, followed by regional (within-country) circulation. The estimated dispersal metrics suggest that ASFV has a slower dispersion capacity compared to other pig-transmitted viruses and is associated with a notable degree of spatial structure. Despite these findings, significant uncertainty remains regarding certain ancestral locations, highlighting challenges related to applying phylodynamic methods to DNA viruses with low genetic variability. Nevertheless, in our study, we managed to implement a phylogeographic framework to investigate major patterns of ASFV dispersion in Europe and the contribution of international importations in the establishment of regional transmission chains. This framework could be further expanded as more genomes become available. Our study emphasizes the need for increased genomic surveillance to enlarge the ASFV genome database to support outbreak control.

AB  - A spatial tool to identify potential conflict hot spots for the European ground squirrel in agricultural land. Some of the hardest challenges in conservation are those situations which occur when endangered species' and human interests collide. The European ground squirrel Spermophilus citellus, a mainly herbivorous rodent which feeds on agricultural crops when available, is an endangered species facing extinction in several countries. Sustainable conservation of the species can only be achieved in collaboration with all stakeholders, particularly farmers. However, in the past, this species was considered a pest, and farmers actively persecuted it, using invasive methods such as trapping and poisoning. In this situation, early monitoring and prevention are the best tools to minimise and mitigate potential conflicts. We developed a risk model to assess the potential for crop damages by ground squirrels, using data from three different locations with agricultural mosaic landscape in the Czech Republic. Our model is based on four parameters: occur- rence and density of ground squirrels, migration potential, and type of habitat. The resulting model provides a graphical map of the local potential risk of crop damage. These maps can complement the regular monitoring of the European ground squirrel and its potential effects on agriculture, aiding the implementa- tion of proactive management strategies to prevent conflicts and support the sustainable conservation of the species.

AB  - Rapid and regionally contrasting climate changes have been observed around Antarctica. However, our understanding of the impact of these changes on ecosystems remains limited, and there is an urgent need to better identify habitats of Antarctic species. The Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) is a circumpolar mesopredator and an indicative species of Antarctic marine communities. It has been extensively studied in the western Ross Sea and East Antarctica, and an understanding of its ecology in the Weddell Sea in the wintertime is emerging. We documented the behavioural response(s) of four Weddell seals from February to June in 2017 in the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf region and related these to unusual oceanographic conditions in 2017. Unexpectedly, we found that Weddell seals had the longest foraging effort within the outflow of Ice Shelf Water or at its turbulent boundary. They also foraged on the eastern side of the trough from April to June within the Modified Warm Deep Water and seem to take advantage of the unusual conditions of persistent inflow of warm waters through the winter. Linking animal behavioural responses to oceanographic conditions is informative for quantifying rarely recorded events and provides great insight into how predators may respond to changing conditions.

AB  - Since the 1970s, the amount of aquatic plants and algae debris, called beach wrack (BW), has increased along the shores of industrialised regions. The strong ability of primary producers to accumulate pollutants can potentially result in their deposition on the beach along with the BW. Despite that, the fate and impact of such pollutants on sandy beach ecosystems have not been investigated so far. This study examines the fate of neurotoxic mercury and its labile and stable fractions in BW on sandy beaches of the Puck Bay (Baltic Sea). In addition to BW, beach sediments and wrack-associated macrofauna were also analysed. Rough estimations showed that Puck Bay beaches (58.8 km) may be a temporary storage of 0.2-0.5 kg of mercury, deposited on them along with the BW annually. A large proportion of Hg (89 +/- 16%) in a BW was labile and potentially bioavailable. The contribution of Hg fractions in the BW was conditioned by the degree of its decomposition (molar C:N:P ratio). With the progressive degradation of BW, a decrease in the contribution of Hg adsorbed on its surface with a simultaneous increase in the proportion of adsorbed (intracellular), mercury was observed. BW accumulation decreased oxygen content and redox potential and increased methylmercury content in underlying sediments, indicating methylation. Hg concentrations in the studied fauna were up to 4 times higher than in the BW. The highest values occurred in a predatory sand bear spider and the lowest in a herbivorous sand hopper. Regardless of trophic position, most of Hg (92-95%) occurred as an absorbed fraction, which indicates about a 30% increase in relation to its share of BW. These findings suggest the significant role of BW as a mercury carrier in a land-sea interface and increased exposure of beach communities to the adverse effects of mercury in coastal ecosystems.

The authors investigated the possible feminization of seahorses in a population of Hippocampus reidi in Brazil, as well as report a case of a brood pouch reduction after reproductive stimuli. The female seahorses of this population showed two kinds of morphological anomalies. The proportion of the animals affected in the study population was consistent and was uncorrelated with the sex ratio. The study indicates the changes in the sexual profile of the individual.

AB  - Islands are renowned for their remarkable biotas and have been widely recognised as natural laboratories for the study of evolution, speciation, and extinction. Large mammals in insular environments typically evolve to dwarfs and small ones to giants, a trend known as the island rule. Despite their dominance in the continental European mammal faunas of Middle-Late Pleistocene, Bison and Bos are usually lacking from the neighbouring endemic insular assemblages. Here, we report the first insular bovin from the Late Pleistocene of Kythera Island, Greece and we carry out a detailed morphometrical analysis with emphasis on its adaptations and palaeogeographic implications. Based on both dental and postcranial qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we attribute the studied material from Kythera to Bos primigenius. Significant differences from both its continental Pleistocene relative and the endemic bovins from Mediterranean islands, allow us to recognize it as a new subspecies, Bos primigenius thrinacius n. ssp., the third known insular dwarf of this taxon in Europe. Our main hypothesis is that the gradual disconnection of Kythera Island from the neighbouring Peloponnese peninsula just after MIS 6 (late Middle Pleistocene, similar to 180 ka) resulted in the isolation of a mainland Bos primigenius population in the rocky and predator free environment of palaeo-Kythera Island. Under these particular conditions the population underwent some remarkable changes and gained some peculiar features, especially on metapodials. The timing and reasons of Bos primigenius thrinacius extinction remain unknown.

AB  - Losses in crop yield due to invasive insects, weeds, pathogens, and herbivores cost trillions of dollars per year globally. To prevent further spread of invasive agricultural pest species, continuous monitoring and prevention are crucial. Once introduced, however, assessing the impact of an invasive pest on agricultural production and testing management strategies are essential. The green iguana ( Iguana iguana), a globally widespread invasive herbivore, is considered a possible agricultural pest although no quantitative data on its impact are available. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the invasive green iguana on cucumber ( Cucumis sativus, var. Dasher II) and lettuce ( Lactuca sativa, var. Black-seeded Simpson) yield by testing the efficacy of two management strategies - Neem-based pesticide and mesh fencing - compared to open field cultivation in Puerto Rico. Mesh fencing led to 20% more growth and doubled cucumber yield compared to open field cultivation, while spraying Neem led to an 18% increase in plant growth but no effect on cucumber yield. We found no difference in lettuce growth or yield among treatment and control plots. This study supports categorizing the green iguana as an invasive agricultural pest species and demonstrates the reptile's potential to reduce crop yield. It also shows that Neem application at the manufacturer's suggested concentration is not an effective mitigation technique for reducing crop loss due to green iguana herbivory. Government agencies in regions where the green iguana has the potential to be introduced should consider the species a threat to food production when developing monitoring programs and drafting regulations.

AB  - Accurate streamflow prediction is significant for water resources management. However, due to the impact of climate change and human activities, accurately identifying the input factors of the streamflow prediction model and achieving high-precision results presents a significant challenge. In this study, past streamflow, meteorological, and climate factors were utilized as inputs to develop a predictive scenario for the bi-decomposition of input factors and streamflow series, i.e. Scenario 3 (S3). Mutual information (MI) was applied to recognize the input factors prediction potential. Based on the predictive potentials, factors were progressively incorporated into the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) and hybrid kernel extreme learning machine (HKELM) models optimized by the gazelle optimization algorithm (GOA) to ascertain the optimal input configuration for each sub-series. The prediction results of S3-KELM and S3-HKELM models were obtained by reconstructing the optimal prediction results of each sub-series. The monthly streamflow of the upper Fenhe River Basin, which is in the semi-humid and semi-arid climate zone, was selected as a case study. The results indicate that in comparison to both undecomposed and singly decomposed scenarios, the input-output bi-decomposed scenario more accurately identifies the input factors and constructs high-precision prediction models. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of both the S3-KELM and S3-HKELM models exceeds 0.85. Specifically, the S3-HKELM model demonstrates superior performance, capable of handling more complex inputs, with its NSE reaching up to 0.93. Importantly, meteorological and climate factors contribute to the accuracy of streamflow predictions across different scenarios.

AB  - Visual positioning accuracy is crucial for ensuring the successful execution of nut disassembly and assembly tasks by a fastener-nut disassembly and assembly robot. However, disturbances such as on-site lighting changes, abnormal surface conditions of nuts, and complex backgrounds formed by ballast in complex railway environments can lead to poor visual positioning accuracy of the fastener nuts, thereby affecting the success rate of the robot's continuous disassembly and assembly operations. Additionally, the existing method of detecting fasteners first and then positioning nuts has poor applicability in the field. A direct positioning algorithm for spiral rail spikes that combines an improved Canny algorithm with shape feature similarity determination is proposed in response to these issues. Firstly, CLAHE enhances the image, reducing the impact of varying lighting conditions in outdoor work environments on image details. Then, to address the difficulties in extracting the edges of rail spikes caused by abnormal conditions such as water stains, rust, and oil stains on the nuts themselves, the Canny algorithm is improved through three stages, filtering optimization, gradient boosting, and adaptive thresholding, to reduce the impact of edge loss on subsequent rail spike positioning results. Finally, considering the issue of false fitting due to background interference, such as ballast in gradient Hough transformations, the differences in texture and shape features between the rail spike and interference areas are analyzed. The HOG is used to describe the shape features of the area to be screened, and the similarity between the screened area and the standard rail spike template features is compared based on the standard Euclidean distance to determine the rail spike area. Spiral rail spikes are discriminated based on shape features, and the center coordinates of the rail spike are obtained. Experiments were conducted using images collected from the field, and the results showed that the proposed algorithm, when faced with complex environments with multiple interferences, has a correct detection rate higher than 98% and a positioning error mean of 0.9 mm. It exhibits excellent interference resistance and meets the visual positioning accuracy requirements for robot nut disassembly and assembly operations in actual working environments.

AB  - The global impact of increased human activities has consequences on the conservation of wildlife. Understanding how wildlife adapts to increased human pressures with urban expansion and agricultural areas is fundamental to future conservation plans of any species. However, there is a belief that large wild free-ranging carnivores and ungulates, cannot coexist with people, limited studies have looked at wildlife movements through differing human-dominated landscapes at finer spatial scales, in Africa. This information is vital as the human population is only going to increase and the wildlife protected areas decrease. We used remote-sensor camera traps to identify the movement patterns of African elephant (Loxodonta africana) through six wildlife corridors in Botswana. The wildlife corridors were located in two different human-dominated landscapes (agricultural/urban), with varying degrees of human impact. While we found that elephants use corridors in both landscapes, they use the urban corridors both diurnally and nocturnally in contrast to agricultural corridors which were only nocturnal. Our results provide evidence for temporal partitioning of corridor use by elephants. We identified that seasonality and landscape were important factors in determining the presence of elephants in the corridors. Our findings demonstrate that elephant diel patterns of use of the wildlife corridor differs based on the surrounding human land-uses on an hourly basis and daily basis, revealing potential adaptation and risk avoidance behaviour.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries provide nutrients to hundreds of millions of people worldwide, with yields dependent on the condition of marine habitats such as coral reefs. Small-scale fisheries are a particularly important food source in societies with nutrient deficiencies and where unhealthy food alternatives are widely available. Using data from coral reef surveys around two islands in French Polynesia (Moorea and Raiatea), we show how the availability of nutrients to fisheries changed in relation to the condition of coral habitat. Fish biomass and nutrient availability were highest when coral cover was low around both islands, driven predominantly by abundant herbivorous reef fish. We also investigated the importance of fish in people's diets, to determine if fish consumption was aligned with available fisheries resources on local reefs and if nutrient intakes from fish could be explained by people's socioeconomic background. People ate a higher diversity of reef fish in Raiatea, however nutrient intakes from fish were higher in Moorea. Most people ate more fish than meat on both islands, however fish consumption declined over generations. People from fishing households had higher nutrient intakes from reef and pelagic fish, and people from farming households had higher intakes from reef fish. Preference for eating reef fish over pelagic fish was also associated with higher total nutrient intakes. Promoting traditional diets rich in fish could be key to meeting people's nutritional needs in French Polynesia while reducing diet-related health issues linked to the overconsumption of fat. French and Tahitian versions of the Abstract are available in Supplementary Material.

AB  - To study the effects of the seleno-chitosan on daily gain, wool yield, and blood parameters in the Chinese merino sheep in the selenium (Se)-deficient pastures. The samples of soils, forages, and tissues had been collected in the Southern Xinjiang of Northwest China. Our findings indicated that the Se contents in soils and forages from affected pastures were remarkably lower than those unaffected by the pastures (P < 0.01). The Se contents in the blood and the wool from affected Chinese merino sheep were extremely lower than those from healthy sheep. Meanwhile, the values of Hb, PCV, and PLT in affected sheep were significantly decreased (P < 0.01). The yield of wool and the growth rate in affected sheep were also remarkably reduced (P < 0.01). The affected Chinese merino sheep were orally treated by seleno-chitosan for 150 days; the Se contents in blood were remarkably increased and reached the healthy range on day 5. The blood parameters soon recovered to a healthy range on day 10. The growth rate of sheep in the treated group was remarkably higher than that in the control animals. The yield of the wool was also significantly increased in the treated group. Consequently, the Se-deprived environment caused a threat to daily gain, wool yield, and blood parameters in the Chinese merino sheep. The seleno-chitosan could not only markedly increase the Se contents blood contents, but also significantly increase the production performance (daily gain and wool yield), and release the symptoms of anemia in the Se-deprived animal.

AB  - Simple Summary One of the goals of the Feed Sustainability Charter is the inclusion of a circular feed concept in animal production. Although it is still not possible to replace traditional feed production, the supplementation of diets with alternative ingredients able to maintain animal production appears to be a promising step. This study investigated the effects of supplementing a commercial diet with leftovers (stems and leaves) of bitter gourd (6.5 or 13 g/kg) on the performance, carcass characteristics, and serum parameters of growing-finishing pigs. None of the tested inclusion levels of bitter gourd affected pig production, mortality, or carcass quality, as well as serum levels of urea, insulin, or leptin. In conclusion, bitter gourd leftovers can be included in the diet of growing-finishing pigs. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of bitter gourd (BG) leftovers (stems and leaves) as an alternative dietary ingredient on pig performance, carcass characteristics, serum parameters (urea, insulin, and leptin levels), and faecal consistency. Healthy Tempo x Great Yorkshire and Landrace pigs (N = 240; 120 gilts and 120 boars) weighing 25.8 kg (9-10 weeks of age) were randomly assigned to three treatments (eight pens per treatment; each pen with five gilts and five boars). The three treatments consisted of a non-supplemented commercial diet (control; CON) and a CON diet supplemented with 6.5 g/kg BG (BG1) or 13 g/kg BG (BG2). Pigs were fed the experimental diets until slaughter (120 kg body weight; BW). Feed intake was recorded daily and calculated for each experimental phase (i.e., days 0-36, days 36-66, days 66-98, and the overall experimental period). Average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated. The frequencies of visiting the feed station and of feeding were recorded daily. Faecal scores (FS) for consistency were measured per pen twice weekly. On the day of slaughter, two pigs per pen (one male and one female) were randomly selected for the measurement of muscle thickness and blood collection. At the slaughterhouse, carcass weight, dressing percentage, back fat thickness, muscle depth, and lean meat percentage were recorded. Data were analysed using ANOVA, with the pen as the experimental unit. Diets BG1 or BG2 did not affect the performance of the pigs, except for a significant decrease in the ADG of the pigs fed the BG2 diet in the feeding period of 50-80 kg. However, no differences in performance were observed in the overall experimental period. Faecal scores, carcass quality, and serum levels of urea, insulin, and leptin were also not affected by the diet. In summary, leftovers (stems and leaves) of BG can be successfully added to the diet of growing-finishing pigs without interfering with performance and carcass characteristics.

AB  - Across Africa, space for conservation is sometimes limited to formally protected areas that have become progressively more isolated. There is a need for targeted conservation initiatives such as the demarcation of landscape connections, defined as areas that encompass environmental variables that promote the natural movement of individuals between populations, which can facilitate gene flow. Landscape connections can mitigate genetic isolation, genetic drift, and inbreeding, which can occur in isolated populations in protected areas. Promoting gene flow can reduce the risk of extirpation often associated with isolated populations. Here we develop and test models for identifying landscape connections among African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations by combining habitat suitability modeling with gene flow estimates across a large region including seven countries. We find a pronounced non-linear response to unsuitable habitat, consistent with previous studies showing that non-transformed habitat models are poor predictors of gene flow. We generated a landscape connections map that considers both suitable habitats based on telemetry occurrence data and gene flow estimated as the inverse of individual genetic distance, delineating areas that are important for maintaining elephant population connectivity. Our approach represents a novel framework for developing spatially and genetically informed conservation strategies for elephants and many other taxa distributed across heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Introduction Terrestrial species in riverine ecosystems face unique constraints leading to diverging patterns of population structure, connectivity, and disease dynamics. Desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) in Grand Canyon National Park, a large native population in the southwestern USA, offer a unique opportunity to evaluate population patterns and processes in a remote riverine system with ongoing anthropogenic impacts. We integrated non-invasive, invasive, and citizen-science methods to address questions on abundance, distribution, disease status, genetic structure, and habitat fragmentation.Methods We compiled bighorn sightings collected during river trips by park staff, commercial guides, and private citizens from 2000-2018 and captured bighorn in 2010-2016 to deploy GPS collars and test for disease. From 2011-2015, we non-invasively collected fecal samples and genotyped them at 9-16 microsatellite loci for individual identification and genetic structure. We used assignment tests to evaluate genetic structure and identify subpopulations, then estimated gene flow and recent migration to evaluate fragmentation. We used spatial capture-recapture to estimate annual population size, distribution, and trends after accounting for spatial variation in detection with a resource selection function model.Results and discussion From 2010-2018, 3,176 sightings of bighorn were reported, with sightings of 56-145 bighorn annually on formal surveys. From 2012-2016, bighorn exhibiting signs of respiratory disease were observed along the river throughout the park. Of 25 captured individuals, 56% were infected by Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, a key respiratory pathogen, and 81% were recently exposed. Pellet sampling for population estimation from 2011-2015 yielded 1,250 genotypes and 453 individuals. We detected 6 genetic clusters that exhibited mild to moderate genetic structure (F ST 0.022-0.126). The river, distance, and likely topography restricted recent gene flow, but we detected cross-river movements in one section via genetic recaptures, no subpopulation appeared completely isolated, and genetic diversity was among the highest reported. Recolonization of one large stretch of currently empty habitat appears limited by the constrained topology of this system. Annual population estimates ranged 536-552 (95% CrI range 451-647), lamb:ewe ratios varied, and no significant population decline was detected. We provide a multi-method sampling framework useful for sampling other wildlife in remote riverine systems.

AB  - PremiseFlower damage caused by florivores often has negative consequences for plant reproduction. However, the factors affecting plant-florivore interactions are still poorly understood, especially the role of abiotic factors and interspecific variation in florivory within ecosystems. Thus, the patterns of florivory levels and its consequences for plant communities need to be investigated further. MethodsWe assessed the influence of abiotic factors related to climatic seasonality, of phylogenetic relationships among plants, and of functional attributes associated with attractiveness to pollinators on florivory incidence and intensity in the Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland. Between December 2020 and November 2021, the percentage of flowers attacked (incidence) and petal area removed (intensity) by florivores were examined in 51 species from 25 families, considering flowering season, the substrate where the plants occur, and flower attributes as potentially determining factors on florivory levels. ResultsPhylogeny and environmental factors did not have a significant influence on florivory. The only determinant of interspecific variation in florivory incidence and intensity was flower size, where larger flowers experienced higher florivory levels regardless of season and substrate, while flower arrangement and color were not significant factors. ConclusionsOur study is one of the first to estimate the community-wide effects of biotic and abiotic factors on both the incidence and the intensity of florivory. The magnitude of this plant-florivore interaction may reduce reproductive success and entail selective pressures on plant attractiveness to pollinators.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation profoundly impact Southeast Asian rainforest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. While many larger herbivores are hunted and area-demanding apex predators are lost from degraded forests (logged forests, forest fragments and forest edges), smaller herbivore species may be comparatively resilient or even benefit from a release from competition and predation in degraded forests. Mousedeer (or chevrotains) in the Tragulus genus are some of the world's smallest ungulates (1.5-4.5 kg) and are widespread in Southeast Asia. We evaluated mousedeer habitat associations at three spatial scales. At the regional scale, presence-only species distribution modelling suggested mousedeer are negatively associated with aridity and elevation. At the landscape scale, variation capture rates among 186 published camera trapping studies suggested mousedeer are negatively associated with forest degradation and elevation. At the local scale (within landscapes), mousedeer abundance sampled with 1218 cameras at 10 landscapes and analysed with hierarchical abundance modelling suggested mousedeer are negatively associated with humans and elevation. Mousedeer diel activity patterns shifted towards increased nocturnality in degraded forests, possibly to avoid interactions with diurnal humans. Taken together, mousedeer prefer wet lowland forests and they persist - but decline - in degraded habitats and near humans. One exception was degraded forest fragments of Singapore where mousedeer are very abundant, likely due to the absence of hunting and predators. Our results emphasize that small herbivores persisting in fragmented rainforests decline relative to intact forests and thus are unlikely to be experiencing significant release from competition or predation. They also differ from small omnivorous generalists who experience beneficial foraging opportunities at edges. In degraded forests where larger wildlife has been lost, even low densities of small herbivores may perpetuate important ecological interactions such as herbivory, seed dispersal, or as prey for remaining predators.
   Mousedeer habitat associations were evaluated at multiple spatial scales. Mousedeer abundance is associated with low-altitude areas, with high forest integrity and low human presence. Nevertheless, mousedeer can persist in low-integrity forests surrounded by densely populated matrix.image

AB  - The response of herbivorous insects to plant drought stress can range from positive to negative, and it has been challenging to understand the causes of this variation. We tested whether plant trait values associated with aridity gradients might underlie this variation and how such effects vary between two insect feeding guilds. Here, we propose that plants trait values associated with adaptation to arid environments would result in positive effects of experimental drought on herbivores, with such plant species adaptively shifting resources away from resistance to maintain performance under stress. In contrast, plants with trait values associated with adaptation to mesic environments would result in negative effects of drought because such species lose vigour and thus decrease their host quality. We tested these predictions using experimental manipulations in 13 milkweed species (genus Asclepias) adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions and the herbivore performance of a specialist leaf-chewer (monarch butterfly; Danaus plexippus) and sap-feeder (oleander aphid; Aphis nerii). We exposed plants to physiologically calibrated species-specific watering regimes to maximize (100%) or reduce (50%) stomatal conductance and then monitored herbivore performance. The effects of drought stress on herbivore survival ranged from strongly positive (50% increase) to strongly negative (80% decrease) among milkweed species, but these effects were inconsistent between the two herbivores. Plant trait values associated with adaptation to aridity were correlated with monarch survival in the predicted manner, such that milkweed species with high water-use efficiency (WUE) and low relative water content (RWC) increased monarch survival under drought. In contrast, aphid survival was unrelated to arid-adapted trait values. Drought-induced changes in plant quality were negatively associated with both herbivore survivals. Specifically, milkweed species that increased cardenolides concentration under drought conditions decreased monarch and aphid survival. Synthesis. We demonstrated that the indirect effects of drought on herbivores varied tremendously among closely related plant species and between co-occurring insect herbivores. We in turn present evidence that some of this variation is explained by plant traits associated with adaptation to arid versus mesic environments for leaf-chewers but not sap-feeders and that such effects are mediated by drought-induced changes in chemical defences.

AB  - Although live prey remain essential for most marine finfish larviculture, the larvae or young juveniles are ultimately weaned onto formulated feeds at foodfish and ornamental fish hatcheries. Understanding the development of larval digestive capabilities is crucial for optimizing weaning success. The present study used the digestive system ontogeny to interpret the effects of different weaning times on larval rearing of orchid dottyback Pseudochromis fridmani, a marine ornamental fish species. The study documented the ontogenetic digestive system development of P. fridmani larvae from hatching to 40 days post-hatching (DPH). The histological analysis showed that as a demersal spawning species, the newly hatched P. fridmani larvae possessed advanced gut development which allowed the onset of exogenous feeding soon after hatching. Most major larval gut morphological changes were completed by 13 DPH; however, the stomach and gastric glands were first observed between 32 and 36 DPH. At this stage, P. fridmani larvae were expected to acquire substantially improved digestive capabilities, and were likely capable of digesting formulated feed. In the subsequent experiment, P. fridmani larvae were weaned onto formulated feed from 20, 23, 26, 29, or 32 DPH over a three-day period of co-feeding with enriched Artemia; the control group were exclusively fed enriched Artemia until the end of experiment. The timing of weaning significantly affected the larval growth and pigmentation development rather than survival (mean: 44-64%). P. fridmani larvae weaned later tended to grow larger, and the control group grew significantly larger in length than all weaning treatments (p < 0.05). Interestingly, at the end of the experiment (40 DPH), none of larvae from the control obtained adult-type pigmentation despite their larger size. In contrast, the introduction of formulated feed appeared to stimulate pigmentation development in P. fridmani individuals with a clear trend of higher pigmentation completion by 40 DPH (mean: 62-97%) with earlier weaning. Overall, this study demonstrated that P. fridmani larvae could be weaned onto formulated feed from as early as 20 DPH, before the stomach and gastric glands were fully developed; indeed, the timing of adult-type pigmentation change in P. fridmani was also advanced by the introduction of the weaning diet.

AB  - This article focuses on the toxic element chromium (Cr) in wastewater, its incorporation into soil plant systems, and its relevant toxicity in the food chain as assessed by a health risk assessment from dietary intake. The Nili Ravi buffalo is an important cattle inhabiting Sargodha, Punjab, Pakistan, and forage crops grown on soils contaminated with Cr might cause toxicity in the food chain by local inhabitants eating meat. The soil, forage and animal blood samples were collected from five different locations in Tehsil Sahiwal (Chak Dhool, Bagabalocha, Chandia, Dhool Bala and Kakrani) twice at six-month intervals. A total of 30 samples from each ecological zone were collected from the soil and forage crops (Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor, Trifolium alexandrinum). The samples from zone-V and zone-IV showed the maximum concentration of Cr because these areas receive highly contaminated water for irrigation. The Cr was greater than the permissible limits. Environmental indices for all samples ranged below 1. The bioaccumulation and pollution load of Cr in soil and forage crops due to wastewater irrigation can contaminate the whole food chain via the soil, forages and animals. The health risk index (HRI) and a high value of enrichment factor were found for Cr in some sites. The Cr concentration was higher during the summer season than winter. Fodder crops with different concentrations and an elevated level of Cr were observed in maize. Attention should be paid when wastewater is used for fodder crop irrigation and its potential risks to human health following dairy product (milk, meat) entry into the food chain.

AB  - The process of crop domestication leads to a dramatic reduction in the gene expression associated with metabolic diversity. Genes involved in specialized metabolism appear to be particularly affected. Although there is ample evidence of these effects at the genetic level, a reduction in diversity at the metabolite level has been taken for granted despite having never been adequately accessed and quantified. Here we leveraged the high coverage of ultra high performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry based metabolomics to investigate the metabolic diversity in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Information theory highlights a shift towards lower metabolic diversity and specialization when comparing wild and domesticated bean accessions. Moreover, molecular networking approaches facilitated a broader metabolite annotation than achieved to date, and its integration with gene expression data uncovers a metabolic shift from specialized metabolism towards central metabolism upon domestication of this crop.

AB  - Oil tea (Camellia oleifera Abel.) is one of the most important woody edible oil tree species in China, with intraspecific polyploid. In order to study the variation in pollen size and vigor of C. oleifera at ploidy level, four ploidy covers a total of 32 types of Camellia pollens as the material for the experiment. The results showed that the pollen sizes of diploid, tetraploid, hexaploidy, and octaploid were positively correlated with the ploidy level. Pollen viability of C. oleifera was determined by fluorescein diacetate (FDA) dye solution staining and medium containing 10% sucrose, 0.01% boric acid, and 1% agar germination in vitro, which indicated that the pollen viability and germination rate of the hexaploid were relatively high among the four ploidy levels, at 79.69% and 71.78% respectively. The pollen vigor of diploid NR-3, tetraploid DP43, hexaploid CJ-12, and octoploid YNYC-1 was higher than that of other materials with the same ploidy level. Knowledge of different ploidy pollen sizes and pollen viability provides basic information for formulating pollen breeding plans and pollination methods of C. oleifera.

AB  - Ants and termites are ubiquitous members of most modern terrestrial ecosystems. These insects act as agents of selection among plants and animals, driving ecological and evolutionary shifts in disparate groups across the tree of life. Obligate consumers of ants or termites, called myrmecophages, exhibit morphological adaptations such as lengthened tongues and reduced teeth that are associated with a bulk feeding strategy. Though a typifying feature of some mammal lineages, the macroevolutionary history of obligate myrmecophagy and its relationship to social insect evolution is unknown. We report large-scale patterns of myrmecophagous evolution through a synthesis of the social insect fossil record, ant and termite evolutionary history, and mammal natural history data spanning 4,099 species. Specialized ant and termite feeding has arisen at least 12 times in mammals and through multiple pathways; transitions to myrmecophagy stem from insectivorous and carnivorous ancestors. We recover one reversal out of social insect feeding, perhaps owing to food source stability or difficulty in regaining generalist features. Despite the contemporary ubiquity of social insects, their history suggests a recent capacity for specialist consumers. While both lineages originated in the Cretaceous, rising fossil prevalence of ants and termites and their acquisition of large colony sizes predominantly occurred in the Cenozoic.

AB  - Here we report the first thorough genetic characterization of the long-understudied red deer population of Belarus in regards to its ancestry according to mtDNA sequence analysis. Employing a 346 base pair segment of the mitochondrial control region (d-loop) from 36 deer specimens of either sex recently harvested across the country, we have discovered 10 haplotypes belonging to 3 of the widely described European red deer lineages, or haplogroups: Iberian (A), Tyrrhenian (B), and Maraloid (E), clarifying the range limits of those lineages in the region. Combining this data with a comparative analysis of genetic diversity and historical records, we conclude that the Belarusian population of red deer has an artificially mixed origin, though it remains unclear how desirable such a state is, in terms of sustainable management, use, and conservation. Inquiries into ancient DNA are required to recognize the lineages closest to the autochthonous deer population of Belarus.

AB  - Wildlife-based tourism, including hunting, is attracting interest from governments, the tourism industry, and researchers. Capital investment in renewable resources, like forests, represents spatial and temporal management, which is significantly limited by the natural potential of a particular habitat (e.g., volume increment, the quantity of food for wildlife, etc.). Therefore, the return rate expected by the investor is quite fixed and the only tool by which the investor can increase it is by adding further business activities and/or expanding the existing value chain. In the Republic of Croatia, the only forests which can be purchased by individual or institutional investors, and in which it is possible to establish both active forest management and commercial hunting, are private forests. Based on these insights, we analysed characteristics of capital invested in a large-scale private forest, where game management is carried out in addition to extensive forest management. Of the 1,104 hunting grounds in Croatia, the one with the largest percentage of forest cover (92%) and privately owned (61%) was taken as the subject of this case study (name of the hunting ground: VIII/120 "Permani" (10,017 ha)). A theoretical approach was used in which the investor buys all private forests (predominantly consisting of common beech), conducts forest management activities, and makes a profit by selling timber (30-year period). Furthermore, the hunting segment consisting of game management for red deer, roe deer, wild boar and brown bear is evaluated. At the lowest cost of capital (5.41%), the results of the separate forest management revealed an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 5.10%, a negative Net Present Value (NPV) (-760,000 euro) and a 30-year discount payback period. Joint forest and game management resulted in an IRR of 5.69%, a positive NPV (680,000 euro), and the same length of a discount payback period.

AB  - In this study we assessed how an invasive tree (Acacia mearnsii) and an ecologically equivalent native species (Virgilia divaricata) interact with their insect pests and fungal pathogens in sympatric populations along forest edges in the Cape Floristic region of South Africa. We determined how insect herbivore abundance and fungal disease development differ between the two species across a moisture gradient and whether observed differences can be explained by moisture availability and/or plant nutrient levels. The two host plants had similar foliar nutrient content, but measurements of 612C / 613C isotope ratios in leaves indicated that only the native plant experienced drought stress at drier sites. The degree of disease development after tree wounding was similarfor both species and was not correlated with soil moisture content in either species. As predicted by the biotic release hypothesis, herbivore numbers were significantly higher on the native plant. Herbivore numbers on A. mearnsii were unaffected by moisture availability, but herbivore numbers on V. divaricata increased at drier sites. Consequently, under conditions of increased drought, V. divaricata may experience higher levels of drought stress than the invasive A. mearnsii and may suffer from increased insect herbivory, rendering it a weaker competitor. Herbivore abundance and disease development were significantly influenced by plant nutrient content for A. mearnsii, but not for V. divaricata. Relatively nutrient-poor A. mearnsii trees experienced higher herbivore loads but slower disease development than nutrient-rich trees. Therefore, the susceptibility of A. mearnsii seems to be determined by plant nutrient levels, a factor that varies independentlyfrom water availability.

AB  - BACKGROUND Fences are one of the most widespread manmade features in nature, constituting an artificial limitation to the movement of wildlife. To date, their effects on wildlife behavior have been understudied but this knowledge is required to design effective management procedures. Using 21 GPS-monitored wild boar, we evaluated the permeability of different types of fences and described temporal patterns and spatial hotspots for crossing events. A fence's permeability was inferred by the crossing success, i.e., the number of times that animals crossed a barrier vs the number of times they did not cross. The vulnerability of fences at watercourses was explored by assessing whether the frequency of crossings was higher around watercourse intersections than expected by chance. RESULTS Well-maintained big game proof fences were the most effective in reducing successful wild boar crossings; they were, on average, 30% more efficient than livestock type fences. Crossing success was higher for males than females and during the food shortage period than in the food abundance period. The frequency of crossings around watercourses was higher than expected by chance, especially in moderately and well-maintained big game proof type fences. CONCLUSION While no fence type was 100% wild boar proof, well-maintained big game proof fences substantially constrained the movement of boar. However, they are vulnerable around watercourses. Managing the conflicts in which this species is involved, such as shared infections and agricultural damage, would require fences that are even more effective than the ones analyzed here, ideally in conjunction with other preventive actions.

AB  - Background and Aims Epichlo & euml; endophytes are vertically transmitted via grass seeds and chemically defend their hosts against herbivory. Endophyte-conferred plant defence via alkaloid biosynthesis might occur independently of costs for host plant growth. However, fitness consequences of endophyte-conferred defence and transgenerational effects on herbivore resistance of progeny plants are rarely studied. The aim of this study was to test whether severe defoliation in mother plants affects their seed production, seed germination rate and the endophyte-conferred resistance of progeny plants.Methods In a field study, we tested the effects of defoliation and endophyte symbiosis (Epichlo & euml; uncinata) on host plant (Festuca pratensis) performance, loline alkaloid concentrations in leaves and seeds, seed biomass and seed germination rates. In a subsequent greenhouse study, we challenged the progeny of the plants from the field study to aphid herbivory and tested whether defoliation of mother plants affects endophyte-conferred resistance against aphids in progeny plants.Key Results Defoliation of the mother plants resulted in a reduction of alkaloid concentrations in leaves and elevated the alkaloid concentrations in seeds when compared with non-defoliated endophyte-symbiotic plants. Viability and germination rate of seeds of defoliated endophyte-symbiotic plants were significantly lower compared with those of non-defoliated endophyte-symbiotic plants and endophyte-free (defoliated and non-defoliated) plants. During 6 weeks of growth, seedlings of defoliated endophyte-symbiotic mother plants had elevated alkaloid concentrations, which was negatively correlated with aphid performance.Conclusions Endophyte-conferred investment in higher alkaloid levels in seeds, elicited by defoliation, provided protection from herbivores in progenies during the first weeks of plant establishment. Better protection of seeds via high alkaloid concentrations was negatively correlated with seed germination, indicating a trade-off between protection and viability.

AB  - Biochar as a soil amendment has been proposed for enhancing carbon sequestration and manure-borne hormone contaminant remediation. However, little is known about the ecological risk of biochar application in the soil with hormone contamination. This study investigated the influence of biochar in three manure-impacted soils contaminated with estrogen hormones, natural estrogen 17 beta-estradiol and synthesized estrogen 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol in a microcosm experiment. Specifically, microbial respiration was periodically determined during microcosm incubation while microbial community phospholipid fatty acids and activities of nutrient (C, N, P, S) cycling related enzymes (beta-glucosidase, urease, phosphodiesterase, arylsulfatase) were characterized after the incubation. Results showed that the manureimpacted soils with high SOC generally had greater total microbial biomass, ratios of fungi/bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria/Gram-negative bacteria, and phosphodiesterase activity, but lower urease activity. Additionally, hormones stimulated microbial respiration and biomass, while had little impact on activity of the enzymes. On the other hand, biochar showed negative priming effect by significantly decreasing total microbial biomass by 8.7%-26.4%, CO2 production by 16.6%-33.5%, and glucosidase activity by 27.1%-41.0% in the three soils. Biochar significantly increased the activity of phosphodiesterase, showed no impact on arylsulfatase, while decreased the activity of urease. Overall, the study suggests that when used in hormone remediation in manure-impact soils, biochar could improve phosphodiesterase activity, but may decrease soil microbial activity and the activity of soil glucosidase and urease.

AB  - Deer have been a major resource for human populations for thousands of years. Anthropogenic activities, such as hunting, have influenced the genetic structure and distribution of deer populations. In Japan, wild Japanese sika deer (Cervus nippon) have been hunted since ancient times but have also been historically protected as sacred animals in several sanctuaries. Sika deer have been protected for over a thousand years in the religious sanctuary around the Kasuga Taisha Shrine on the Kii Peninsula, located in the center of Japan. Here, we used short sequence repeats (SSR) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to investigate the genetic diversity, population structure, and demography of Japanese sika deer inhabiting the Kii Peninsula, Japan, and discuss possible anthropogenic influences. Using SSR, three distinct genetic groups were distinguished on the Kii Peninsula: an Eastern genetic group, a Western genetic group, and an isolated genetic group with individuals in the religious sanctuary of Kasuga Taisha Shrine in Nara city. The isolated genetic sanctuary group had only the mtDNA haplotype S4. The SSR genotype data suggested a newer divergence time of the genetic groups of the religious sanctuary than would have occurred as a result of Late Quaternary climate change. This time scale coincided with the establishment of the sanctuary with Kasuga Taisha Shrine. Thus, the religious protection conserved genetic variation over a thousand years.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a composite plant extract (CPE) rich in polyphenolics and saponins from seeds of Dolichos biflorus (horse gram), root of Asparagus racemosus (shatavari), bark of Amoora rohituka (rohitaka), and peel of Punica granatum (pomegranate) on ruminal fermentation and methanogenesis in vitro, milk production, nutrient digestibility, immune response, and blood profiles in lactating Beetal goats fed CPE at 20 g/kg diet. Dose effect of CPE was assessed using different doses (0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 g/kg substrate) to find out an optimum dose for the in vivo study. The in vivo experiment lasted 70 days including a 10-day adaptation period. In the in vitro study, dry matter (DM) and fiber degradability increased linearly (P < 0.05) and methane production and ammonia concentration decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing doses of CPE. Concentrations of total VFA and proportion of propionate increased (P < 0.001) linearly, whereas proportion of acetate and acetate to propionate ratio decreased with a linear effect. Dietary CPE increased milk yield (P = 0.017) and concentrations of protein and lactose (P = 0.045) by CPE, but concentrations of fat and solid not fat in milk were not affected (P > 0.10). Somatic cell counts in milk reduced (P = 0.045) in the CPE-fed goats. Apparent digestibility of DM (P = 0.037) increased significantly and NDF (P = 0.066) tended to increase due to supplementation of CPE. Blood glucose (P = 0.028) and albumin (P = 0.007) concentrations increased, while other liver-marker metabolites and enzyme activities and superoxide dismutase activity were not altered in goats due to feeding of CPE. Concentrations of total amino acids (P = 0.010), total essential amino acids (P = 0.012), and total ketogenic amino acids (P < 0.001) were greater in the CPE-fed goats than the control goats. Cell-mediated immune response improved due to CPE feeding. This study suggests that the CPE rich in both phenolics and saponins could improve ruminal fermentation, milk production, and nutrient utilization in lactating goats with better health status while decreasing methane emission.

AB  - The horn fly is an economically important hematophagous ectoparasite of cattle. Its management relies heavily on broad-spectrum pesticides, which are harmful to the environment and have led to the development of resistance. Therefore, alternative control methods are needed. Semiochemicals involved in communication between horn flies and their host are a promising alternative. Considering that the egg-laying of this fly occurs almost exclusively in fresh cattle dung, and most parts of its life cycle occur totally in dung, dung volatiles might play an important role in horn fly behavior. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of volatile blends and compounds emitted from fresh/aged cattle dung on the olfactory response and oviposition of horn flies. Dung blends were captured and analyzed by SPME-GC/MS. p-Cresol was the most abundant compound in dung blends, followed by alpha- and beta-pinene, limonene, and beta-caryophyllene, among other common dung volatiles. Fresh-dung volatiles attracted males and females in a Y-tube olfactometer, and they elicited the egg-laying of flies in two-choice tests. p-Cresol and alpha-pinene were attractive to females and they elicited higher oviposition, demonstrating that dung volatile semiochemicals, in part, lend to dung attractiveness and stimulate the horn fly oviposition.

AB  - The euryhaline mysid Neomysis awatschensis occurs widely in estuaries and brackish lakes in Japan. Although N. awatschensis may serve as an essential energy channel to higher trophic levels, its feeding ecology has been studied only in sheltered and desalinated Lake Kasumigaura. To determine major food sources for N. awatschensis, monthly sampling was conducted during the day along the microtidal Yura River estuary from March 2014 to July 2015. Additional sampling was conducted in May 2019 to assess diel vertical migration in relation to feeding. Microscopic examinations revealed that benthic diatoms (e.g. Bacillaria paxillifer and Navicula spp.) dominated in the stomach irrespective of developmental stage, diel cycle, or season. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in N. awatschensis and its potential food sources indicated great contributions to the diet of N. awatschensis from benthic microalgae (mainly benthic diatoms) in 2014 and from particulate organic matter (mainly phytoplankton) in 2015. Although N. awatschensis always concentrated close to the bottom in 2019, diel vertical migration might have happened in 2015, when fresh water occupied the whole estuary possibly due to river mouth clogging. Under the stagnant and oligohaline conditions, N. awatschensis could have swum up into the water column and fed on phytoplankton at night in 2015. This hypothesis may resolve the apparent contradiction between the microscopy and stable isotope analysis in 2015. In the Yura River estuary, N. awatschensis feeds primarily on benthic diatoms, although it can utilize phytoplankton flexibly in response to prevailing environmental conditions.

AB  - Veterinary pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, are emerging contaminants of concern worldwide. Avian scavengers are exposed to pharmaceuticals through consumption of livestock carcasses used for feeding wildlife for conservation purposes at supplementary feeding stations. Here we tested the hypothesis that griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) would be more exposed to antibiotics (i.e., quinolones) when feeding on livestock carcasses from intensive farming than when they rely on carcasses from extensive farming or wild animals. We sampled 657 adult griffon vultures captured between 2008 and 2012. In addition, we sampled tissues from domestic livestock supplied at feeding stations in the study area between 2009 and 2019; pig (n = 114), sheep (n = 28), cow (n = 1) and goat (n = 2). Samples were analysed by liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spec-trometry (LC-ESI-MS). Quinolones were detected in plasma from 12.9% of the griffon vultures analysed. Qui-nolone prevalence in griffon vultures varied significantly among feeding stations but was also affected by the total amount of carcasses supplemented, especially the mass of pig carcasses. These results aligned with a 21.1% quinolone prevalence in pig carcasses sampled at feeding stations, wherein enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin levels of up to 3359 ng/g and 1550 ng/g, respectively, were found. Given enrofloxacin pharmacokinetics in pig tissues, 5.3% of the analysed pigs may have died no more than one day after treatment. Quinolone presence in vultures was negatively associated with blood lead levels, which mostly originates from lead ammunition and indicates a higher consumption of game animal carcasses. Carcass disposal for feeding avian scavengers must always assess and manage the risks posed by veterinary pharmaceuticals, especially when livestock provided may have died soon after treatment.

AB  - Cover crop integration into grain crop rotations is a promising strategy for mitigating nematode-induced diseases in agriculture. However, the precise mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we first assessed the impact of five commonly used cover crops on the suppression of rice root-knot nematodes (RKNs). We then chose ryegrass as a model to explore the mechanistic basis of the suppression effect. Contrary to expectations, while ryegrass rotation significantly enhances soil fertility, this increased fertility has minimal impact on RKN suppression. Furthermore, neither integrated ryegrass residues nor root exudates exhibit direct toxicity towards RKNs. We demonstrated that ryegrass rotation primarily suppresses RKNs by enriching beneficial soil microbiota. By complementing with isolated bacteria strains, we further demonstrated that ryegrass-enriched bacteria not only directly reduce RKN infectivity and preference, but also activate plant immunity via the OsLRR-RLK-MAPK-WRKY-JA cascade, thereby diminishing RKN infection. Our study highlights the crucial role of soil microbiota in plant-nematode interactions, challenging conventional views on the direct effects of cover crops in nematode suppression. It offers a mechanistic understanding of the regulation potential and action modes of cover crops in mitigating nematode diseases, providing valuable insights for sustainable agriculture.

AB  - In response to the present ecological crisis, new approaches to environmental conservation and management are being developed in Europe. One of the axes considered by nature protection stakeholders since the 2000s is to encourage the return of the wilderness. This has led to the deployment of a variety of initiatives, mainly led by civil and non-profit organisations. The objective here, through the analysis of the discourses of stakeholders-from semi-directive interviews-and the initiatives developed in Western Europe, is to understand how the multitude of projects carried out throughout Europe constitutes a proposal for new environmental management practices. Indeed, the studied initiatives introduce a paradigm shift by reflecting a will to go beyond the mere preservation of nature in order to contribute to a global territorial transition. To this end, the studied projects propose to create both a social and interspecies link around their sites, but also to ensure the development of virtuous economic forms in the territories.

AB  - Soil-borne microorganisms can impact leaf-chewing insect fitness by modifying plant nutrition and defence. Whether the altered insect performance is linked to changes in microbial partners of caterpillars remains unclear. We investigated the effects of root inoculation with soil bacteria or fungi on the gut bacterial community and biomass of the folivore Spodoptera exigua. We also explored the potential correlation between both parameters. We performed herbivory bioassay using leaves of tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum), measured caterpillar weight gain and characterized the gut bacterial communities via 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. All soil microbes modified the gut bacterial communities, but the extent of these changes depended on the inoculated species. Rhizophagus irregularis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens had opposite effects on S. exigua weight. While plant inoculation with the fungus influenced gut bacterial diversity, B. amyloliquefaciens also affected the community composition. A reduced abundance of two S. exigua enterococcal symbionts correlated with decreased insect biomass. Our results show that soil microorganisms can induce plant-mediated changes in the gut bacterial community of foliar-feeding caterpillars. We propose that the impact of these alterations on insect performance might rely on specific adaptations within the gut bacteria, rather than solely on the occurrence of changes.

AB  - Surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) are diverse and common members of coral reef faunal assemblages and are important coastal fisheries resources throughout the tropics. Life-history research provides a foundation for understanding and predicting population dynamics and is therefore important to fisheries management. However, our understanding of surgeonfish biology stems primarily from high-latitude tropical regions where they exhibit multidecadal life spans. To derive an eco-evolutionary and biogeographic perspective on the biology of acanthurids, we derived age-based life-history information for a suite of species representing over 99% of the surgeonfish fishery in the Mariana Islands. Multivariate analysis failed to provide a powerful summary of trait variation among surgeonfishes, as body size is not positively correlated with longevity, growth trajectories and length of maturation varied widely among species, and mortality is not simply a function of size or growth. In fact, seven of twelve species studied exhibited unusual biphasic mortality pattern. Different modes of reproductive investment in species appear to carry a taxonomic signature and may influence the vulnerability of some species to overexploitation. Comparisons with previous studies demonstrated a strong thermal gradient in life span and body size across latitude. Ultimately, surgeonfishes display puzzling features whereby extended life spans are uncharacteristically coupled with higher-than-expected mortality rates as a result of biphasic mortality schedules at the population level. Trait relationships among species are not straightforward, posing challenges for designing effective management and for predicting population dynamics under global climate change.

AB  - The length-weight relationships (LWRs) of 15 lethrinid fish species of the Gulf of Mannar, Southeast Coast of India were studied. The fish specimens were collected fortnightly from three main fishing harbours Thoothukudi, Pamban and Chinnamuttom from December 2022 to November 2023. These coastal fish species were caught usinggears such astrawl net, gill net, hook and line.In addition, three different condition factors werealso determined for these species. Thecalculatedgrowth coefficient, i.e., the b value (shape parameter) of all these species fell within the expected range of2.5 to 3.2. Further, a new maximum length was recorded for two species viz., Lethrinus microdon (82.0 cm) and Lethrinus lentjan (53.0 cm).The calculated minimum and maximum Fulton condition factor (KF), Relative condition factor (KR), and Allometric condition factor (KA) varied from 1.0169 to 1.7557, 0.5023 to 1.1050 and 0.0088 to 0.0757, respectively. For the first time, the study provides insights on LWR estimates for two species of pig-face bream viz., Lethrinus conchyliatus and Gymnocranius elongatus in Indian waters. This information will be valuable for constructing the frontline data for future biological studies in the Gulf of Mannar region.

AB  - The wild boar (Sus scrofa) population has recently increased in Fennoscandia, leading to increasing interactions with humans, e.g. in the form of hunting opportunities or property damages. These experiences may shape the attitudes towards wild boars and affect their population management. We studied attitudes among 165 farmers towards wild boar by means of survey data. We also made preliminary estimates of wild boar damage costs in Finland. Our analysis revealed three attitude groups among farmers, emphasizing various perspectives: "hunting resource", "pest-of-concern", and "ambivalent". The benefits, costs, feelings, and perceived wild boar population development partly explained the division. The direct annual damage costs in southeast Finland were broadly estimated to be circa 990,000euro and mitigation costs circa 350,000euro. Reconciling differing opinions and goals into a widely accepted management strategy is a key precondition for sustainable coexistence. While the level of economic loss is so far not substantial, monitoring of crop damages is vital. Our results provide a valuable baseline for future evaluations, as the wild boar population is expected to grow.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions from liquid livestock manure storage significantly contribute to global warming. Accurate farm-scale models are essential for predicting these emissions and evaluating manure management strategies, but they rely on multiple parameters describing carbon loss dynamics. Surface respiration may significantly influence carbon loss and methane emission, yet it is not explicitly included in current models. We conducted experiments to measure pig manure surface respiration rate and its effect on organic matter degradation and methane and carbon dioxide emissions. Manure was incubated for 283 days at 10 degrees C or 20 degrees C under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, while measuring methane and carbon dioxide emission. This was followed by anaerobic digestion at 38 degrees C. Surface respiration reduced the organic matter content, and the effect was temperature dependent. Methane emission was not affected by surface respiration, suggesting that substrate availability was not rate-limiting for methanogenesis. Surface respiration rates were 18.1 +/- 3.5 g CO2 m-2 day-1 at 10 degrees C and 37.1 +/- 13.1 g CO2 m-2 day-1 at 20 degrees C (mean +/- standard deviation) and were consistent with microsensor measurements of oxygen consumption in different manure surfaces. Based on these results, temperature- and surface area-dependent respiration was incorporated in the existing anaerobic biodegradation model (ABM). Simulations showed that surface respiration accounts for 29% of carbon losses in a typical pig house and 8% for outdoor storage. Developing and refining algorithms for diverse carbon transformations, such as surface respiration, is crucial for evaluating the potential for methane emission and identification of variables that control emissions at the farm scale.
   Degradation of organic matter is much higher when manure is incubated with an aerobic atmosphere due to surface respiration. Carbon dioxide loss from surface respiration does not reduce methane emission. The fraction of carbon lost as methane during manure storage varies with season and management.
   Methane emission from livestock manure storage is a considerable contributor to global warming. Accurate models for predicting emission are needed for estimating effects of the local farmers management. Surface respiration may be an important process that affects methane and carbon dioxide emission from stored manure, and we conducted experiments to measure its rate and effect on these gases. Methane emission was not affected by surface respiration, suggesting that carbon availability was not a limiting factor for methane producing microorganisms. Surface respiration rates were 18.1 +/- 3.5 g CO2 m-2 day-1 at 10 degrees C and 37.1 +/- 13.1 g CO2 m-2 day-1 at 20 degrees C. The results were implemented in a model, and simulations indicated that 29% and 8% of carbon losses in a typical pig house and storage, respectively, are from surface respiration. Establishing such models is crucial in evaluating the potential for methane emission at farm scale.

AB  - Objective: Fisheries provide countless benefits to human populations but face many threats ranging from climate change to overfishing. Despite these threats and an increase in fishing pressure globally, most stocks remain unassessed and data limited. An abundance of data-limited assessment methods exists, but each has different data requirements, caveats, and limitations. Furthermore, developing informative model priors can be difficult when little is known about the stock, and uncertain model parameters could create misleading results about stock status. Our research illustrates an approach for rapidly creating robust initial assessments of unregulated and data-limited fisheries without the need for additional data collection.Methods: Our method uses stakeholder knowledge combined with a series of data-limited tools to identify an appropriate stock assessment method, conduct an assessment, and examine how model uncertainty influences the results. Our approach was applied to the unregulated and data-limited fishery for Crevalle Jack Caranx hippos in Florida.Result: Results suggested a steady increase in exploitation and a decline in stock biomass over time, with the stock currently overfished and undergoing overfishing. These findings highlight a need for management action to prevent continued stock depletion.Conclusion: Our approach can help to streamline the initial assessment and management process for unregulated and data-limited stocks and serves as an additional tool for combating the many threats facing global fisheries.

AB  - The coastal waters off Western Iberia are an important fishing ground and a marine megafauna foraging area. Overlap between fishery target species and the diet of several air breathing marine megafauna species can lead to negative interactions and consequently conservation and economic issues. This work aimed to assess marine megafauna (cetaceans, marine birds, and marine turtles) - fishery interactions through face-to-face interviews to fishers of the local and coastal artisanal fisheries fleets in the landing sites of the Portuguese mainland Southern coast (Algarve). The main goal was to identify and evaluate problematic interactions known to cause bycatch or economic loss through depredation. We found that bycatch is a concern for all marine megafauna groups, but depredation problems are mostly associated with cetaceans. Of the sampled artisanal fisheries (longlines, pots and traps, bottom set-nets, and purse seine), the fishing gears of most concern were purse seine and coastal bottom set-nets. Purse seine showed problems associated with important bycatch numbers, especially of common dolphins, Delphinus delphis, while bottom set-nets have considerable bycatch of all animal groups and depredation was highly associated with bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus. Bycatch and depredation were found to be species, gear, area, and vessel size dependent. Economic loss caused by depredation led to catch and gear damage and was widely reported by bottom set-net fishers, ranging from 7% to 21% of their revenue. Higher losses were reported for local vessels in leeward (eastern) Algarve area. This study showed that the active participation of fishers provides improved localized knowledge on interactions between local and coastal fisheries and marine megafauna, allowing for the definition of specific management and mitigation strategies.

AB  - Hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) play a significant role in contaminant transformation and element cycling during redox fluctuations in paddy soil. However, these important processes might be affected by widely used agricultural amendments, such as urea, pig manure, and biochar, which have rarely been explored, especially regarding their impact on soil aggregates and associated biogeochemical processes. Herein, based on five years of fertilization experiments in the field, we found that agricultural amendments, especially coapplication of fertilizers and biochar, significantly increased soil organic carbon contents and the abundances of iron (Fe)-reducing bacteria. They also substantially altered the fraction of soil aggregates, which consequently enhanced the electron-donating capacity and the formation of active Fe(II) species (i.e., 0.5 M HCl-Fe(II)) in soil aggregates (0-2 mm), especially in small aggregates (0-3 mu m). The highest contents of active Fe(II) species in small aggregates were mainly responsible for the highest (OH)-O-center dot production (increased by 1.7-2.4-fold) and naphthalene attenuation in paddy soil with coapplication of fertilizers and biochar. Overall, this study offers new insights into the effects of agricultural amendments on regulating (OH)-O-center dot formation in paddy soil and proposes feasible strategies for soil remediation in agricultural fields, especially in soils with frequent occurrences of redox fluctuations.

AB  - Porker immunocastration against gonadoliberin (GnRH) secretion has been utilized since 2009; however, consumers are still skeptical of it. This is due to not having full information available on the problem of a boar taint, as well as a lack of research on morphological and molecular changes that may occur in the animal reproductive system and other body systems. The present study aimed to explore the functional status of steroidogenic Leydig cells of the testicular interstitial tissue in immunocastrated Polish Landrace pigs. Analyses were performed using Western blot, immunohistochemistry for relaxin (RLN), insulin-like 3 protein (INSL3), pelleted growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR alpha), cytochrome P450scc, 3 beta- and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3 beta-HSD, 17 beta-HSD), cytochrome P450arom, and 5 alpha-reductase (5 alpha-RED). Immunoassay ELISA was used to measure the androstenone, testosterone, and estradiol levels in the testis and serum of immunocastrates. We revealed disturbances in the distribution and expression of (i) RLN, indicating an inflammatory reaction in the interstitial tissue; (ii) INSL3 and PDGFR alpha, indicating alterations in the differentiation and function of fetal, perinatal, or adult Leydig cell populations; (iii) P450scc, 3 beta-HSD, 17 beta-HSD, P450arom, and 5 alpha-RED, indicating disturbances in the sex steroid hormone production and disturbed functional status of Leydig cells; as well as (iv) decreased levels of androstenone, testosterone, and estradiol in testicular tissue and serum, indicating the dedicated action of Improvac to reduce boar taint at both the hypothalamic-hypophysis-gonadal axis and local level (Leydig cells). In summary, our study provides a significant portion of knowledge on the function of Leydig cells after immunocastration, which is also important for the diagnosis and therapy of testis dysfunction due to GnRH action failure and/or Leydig cell differentiational-functional alterations.

AB  - Delineating spatial boundaries that accurately encompass complex, often cryptic, life histories of highly migratory marine megafauna can be a significant conservation challenge. For example, marine turtles range across vast ocean basins and coastal areas, thus complicating the evaluation of relative impacts of multiple overlapping threats and the creation of coherent conservation strategies. To address these challenges, spatially explicit 'regional management units' (RMUs) were developed in 2010 for all marine turtle species, globally. RMUs were intended to provide a consistent framework that organizes conspecific assemblages into units above the level of nesting rookeries and genetic stocks, but below the species level, within regional entities that may share demographic trajectories because they experience similar environmental conditions and other factors. From their initial conception, RMUs were intended to be periodically revised using new information about marine turtle distributions, life history, habitat use patterns, and population structure. Here, we describe the process used to update the 2010 RMU framework by incorporating newly published information and inputs from global marine turtle experts who are members of the IUCN Marine Turtle Specialist Group. A total of 48 RMUs for 6 of 7 marine turtle species and 166 distinct genetic stocks for all 7 species are presented herein. The updated RMU framework reflects a significant advance in knowledge of marine turtle biology and biogeography, and it provides improved clarity about the RMU concept and its potential applications. All RMU products have been made open access to support research and conservation initiatives worldwide.

AB  - The impact of different operational parameters on the composting efficiency and compost quality during pilotscale membrane-covered composting (MCC) of food waste (FW) was evaluated. Four factors were assessed in an orthogonal experiment at three different levels: initial mixture moisture (IMM, 55 %, 60 %, and 65 %), aeration time (AT, 6, 9, and 12 h/d), aeration rate (AR, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m3/h) and mature compost addition ratio (MC, 2 %, 4 %, and 6 %). Results indicated that 55 % IMM, 6 h/d AT, 0.4 m3/h AR, and 4 % MC addition ratio simultaneously provided the compost with the maximum cumulative temperature and the minimum moisture. It was shown that the IMM was the driving factor of this optimum composting process. On contrary, the optimal parameters for reducing carbon and nitrogen loss were 65 % IMM, 6 h/d AT, 0.4 m3/h AR, and 2 % MC addition ratio. The AR had the most influence on reducing carbon and nitrogen losses compared to all other factors. The optimal conditions for compost maturity were 55 % IMM, 9 h/d AT, 0.2 m3/h AR, and 6 % MC addition ratio. The primary element influencing the pH and electrical conductivity values was the AR, while the germination index was influenced by IMM. Protein was the main organic matter limiting the composting efficiency. The results of this study will provide guidance for the promotion and application of food waste MCC technology, and contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in MCC for organic solid waste treatment.

AB  - The black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis L.) is a critically endangered species historically distributed across sub-Saharan Africa. Hunting and habitat disturbance have diminished both its numbers and distribution since the 19th century, but a poaching crisis in the late 20th century drove them to the brink of extinction. Genetic and genomic assessments can greatly increase our knowledge of the species and inform management strategies. However, when a species has been severely reduced, with the extirpation and artificial admixture of several populations, it is extremely challenging to obtain an accurate understanding of historic population structure and evolutionary history from extant samples. Therefore, we generated and analyzed whole genomes from 63 black rhinoceros museum specimens collected between 1775 and 1981. Results showed that the black rhinoceros could be genetically structured into six major historic populations (Central Africa, East Africa, Northwestern Africa, Northeastern Africa, Ruvuma, and Southern Africa) within which were nested four further subpopulations (Maasailand, southwestern, eastern rift, and northern rift), largely mirroring geography, with a punctuated north-south cline. However, we detected varying degrees of admixture among groups and found that several geographical barriers, most prominently the Zambezi River, drove population discontinuities. Genomic diversity was high in the middle of the range and decayed toward the periphery. This comprehensive historic portrait also allowed us to ascertain the ancestry of 20 resequenced genomes from extant populations. Lastly, using insights gained from this unique temporal data set, we suggest management strategies, some of which require urgent implementation, for the conservation of the remaining black rhinoceros diversity.

AB  - Both the quantity and nutritional quality of food resources can strongly influence the foraging movements of herbivores, which in turn determine the strength of top-down control on primary producer biomass. Nutrient enrichment can alter the biomass and nutritional quality of primary producers, but the consequences for the foraging of herbivores and hence for top-down control are still poorly understood. In this study, we combined a two-factorial experiment (two nutrient levels x grazing by the freshwater gastropod Ancylus fluviatilis) with video analyses tracking grazers' movements to investigate nutrient enrichment effects on spatial ranges of grazing activity and algal biomass removal. Natural stream biofilms were grown in phosphorus-enriched (P+) and phosphorus-poor flumes (P-) for two weeks before A. fluviatilis were added to the flumes and allowed to graze on biofilm for an additional 2 weeks. Total periphyton biomass was enhanced by P+ and reduced by grazer presence. However, the total grazer effect depended on the nutrient level: at the end of the experiment, on average 95% of algal cover were removed by grazing in the P- flumes versus 26% in the P+ flumes. Fast movements of A. fluviatilis were detected significantly more often in the P- treatment, whereas grazers were detected resting more often in the P+ treatment. Our results demonstrate that nutrient enrichment can increase primary producer biomass both directly and indirectly by limiting the foraging ranges of herbivores. The resulting feedback loop between reduced grazing activity and increased plant biomass might in turn exacerbate eutrophication effects on habitat structure.

AB  - Glyphosate, a highly toxic pesticide, is potentially harmful to the environment and human health. Applying biochar has proven to effectively reduce the glyphosate content in environment. In this study, biochar was prepared from pig manure and modified with thiourea to study the adsorption behavior of glyphosate from soil. The effects of environmental factors, such as pH and dissolved organic carbon, on the above sorption characteristics also were studied. The results showed that modification of biochar with thiourea can improve the adsorption capacity of biochar to glyphosate from soil. Moreover, the best adsorption performance was obtained for raw biochar under acidic condition, while the best adsorption best adsorption behavior was found for modified biochar under alkaline condition. The equilibrium isotherm data fitted well with the Freundlich and Langmuir models suggesting that the glyphosate adsorption was a complex adsorption process including physical adsorption and chemical adsorption. This study provides an economical and environmentally friendly technical means for the management of organic matter in the environment.

AB  - Context Wildlife emergencies (e.g. injured animals) often require capture or humane dispatch of animals to resolve the situation. Conducted electrical weapons (CEWs) have the potential to immobilise white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) for a short duration to avoid potential risks of extended immobilisation (e.g. chemical immobilisation) and increase safety for managers and the public during humane killing by gunshot.Aims To test rapid immobilisation with minimal long-term physiological consequences of CEW immobilisation of white-tailed deer.Methods We arranged five treatment groups of captive deer, including (1) chemical immobilisation with 5-s CEW exposure (n = 5), (2) chemical immobilisation with 15-s CEW exposure (n = 5), (3) 5-s CEW exposure with no chemical immobilisation (n = 10), (4) 15-s CEW exposure with no chemical immobilisation (n = 10) and (5) a control group with no chemical immobilisation or CEW exposure (n = 10). We conducted treatments 1 and 2 to determine short-term physiological effects of CEWs on deer, related to overall welfare. In treatment groups 1 and 2, we sedated deer to collect blood immediately before CEW exposure, and 2 days and 5 days post-exposure for serum biochemical analysis (to measure physiological markers of organ and tissue damage). We observed deer before, during and after treatments to evaluate potential behavioural changes.Key results All deer showed signs of muscle paralysis immediately after exposure to CEW and regained muscle control immediately after the exposure ended. Serum biochemistry results for treatment group 1 and 2 revealed significant increases in creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 2 days post-treatment, before returning to pre-exposure concentrations by day 5-post-exposure, suggesting temporary myopathy. By 15-days post-exposure, deer that were only exposed to the CEW had 27 of 39 (69%) remotely fired probes still attached. No long-term behavioural or physiological changes were observed post-treatment.Conclusions Our findings suggest that for immobilisation of white-tailed deer, short-term exposure to a CEW to is a potential alternative to typical capture techniques and can provide sufficient immobilisation to approach and humanely kill deer by gunshot if necessary in wildlife emergencies.Implications As with all capture techniques, trainings and protocols should be developed to ensure the safety of personnel and animals during CEW exposures.

AB  - Symbiotic microorganisms are essential for the physiological processes of herbivorous pests, including the pear lace bug Stephanitis nashi, which is known for causing extensive damage to garden plants and fruit trees due to its exceptional adaptability to diverse host plants. However, the specific functional effects of the microbiome on the adaptation of S. nashi to its host plants remains unclear. Here, we identified significant microbial changes in S. nashi on 2 different host plants, crabapple and cherry blossom, characterized by the differences in fungal diversity as well as bacterial and fungal community structures, with abundant correlations between bacteria or fungi. Consistent with the microbiome changes, S. nashi that fed on cherry blossom demonstrated decreased metabolites and downregulated key metabolic pathways, such as the arginine and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, which were crucial for host plant adaptation. Furthermore, correlation analysis unveiled numerous correlations between differential microorganisms and differential metabolites, which were influenced by the interactions between bacteria or fungi. These differential bacteria, fungi, and associated metabolites may modify the key metabolic pathways in S. nashi, aiding its adaptation to different host plants. These results provide valuable insights into the alteration in microbiome and function of S. nashi adapted to different host plants, contributing to a better understanding of pest invasion and dispersal from a microbial perspective.

AB  - Irruptions in plant and animal populations are not uncommon, but the factors underlying irruptions are rarely explored quantitatively. In addition, it has been suggested that these irruptions may be reduced by predators or herbivores, but there is a paucity of controlled experimental evidence. Using data from the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment (KLEE), we show that populations of perennial Hibiscus spp. (primarily Hibiscus flavifolius) show multiple short-term irruptions a year after rainy periods, increasing in abundance in some cases by more than an order of magnitude before declining in ensuing months and years. We demonstrate that these irruptions are largely limited to experimental plots from which large mammalian herbivores have been excluded, particularly megaherbivores (elephants, mostly). This represents a rare controlled, replicated experimental demonstration of top-down regulation of irruptions. African elephants and giraffes are often at greater risk of local extirpation than other large mammals, and their absence appears to destabilize this African savanna ecosystem.

AB  - This study proposed a feasible strategy to promote plant-growth biostimulants (PGB) production using sludge as an alternative precursor in plant-derived substances composting, providing new insights into the nutrient-driven intrinsic regulatory mechanisms of microbial ecology. Our results indicate that the intervention of sludges achieved rapid polymerization and accumulation of humic substances (HS) within a brief timeframe. The nutrients in the sludge drove the establishment of a unique microbial interaction network, optimizing the utilization of carbon/nitrogen sources, and resulting in accelerated PGB production. The positive responses of microbial physiological behaviors were the intrinsic factors in regulating microbial community composition and metabolisms, which impact the transformation of organic matter into PGB. Therefore, targeted strategies that induce microbial physiological behaviors could substantially enhance PGB production efficiency. Overall, this study provides a novel sustainable approach to sludge resource management, providing deeper insights into the relationship between microbial physiological behavior and PGB production.

AB  - The Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) is a key species in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea ecosystems, where it also supports important fisheries. However, the lack of genomic resources limits our understanding of evolutionary, environmental and anthropogenic forces affecting key life history characteristics of Pacific halibut and prevents the application of genomic tools in fisheries management and conservation efforts. In the present study, we report on the first generation of a high-quality chromosome-level assembly of the Pacific halibut genome, with an estimated size of 602 Mb, 24 chromosome-length scaffolds that contain 99.8% of the assembly and a N-50 scaffold length of 27.3 Mb. In the first application of this important resource, we conducted genome-wide analyses of sex-specific genetic variation by pool sequencing and characterized a potential sex-determining region in chromosome 9 with a high density of female-specific SNPs. Within this region, we identified the bmpr1ba gene as a potential candidate for master sex-determining (MSD) gene. bmpr1ba is a member of the TGF-beta family that in teleosts has provided the largest number of MSD genes, including a paralogue of this gene in Atlantic herring. The genome assembly constitutes an essential resource for future studies on Pacific halibut population structure and dynamics, evolutionary history and responses to environmental and anthropogenic influences. Furthermore, the genomic location of the sex-determining region in Pacific halibut has been identified and a putative candidate MSD gene has been proposed, providing further support for the rapid evolution of sex-determining mechanisms in teleost fish.

AB  - Creole pigs (Sus scrofa domestica), descendants of Iberian breeds, possess significant genetic and cultural importance but are under-researched and at risk due to the dominance of improved breeds for commercial production. The aim of this study was to identify the most representative body morphometric measurements for the differentiation of two Creole pig breeds, using statistical and machine learning methods. A sample of "Casco de Mula" (n = 54) and San Pedre & ntilde;o (n = 30) Creole pigs, aged between 2 and 6 months, belonging to seven traditional farms located in the department of Meta (Colombia), was studied. A total of 14 morphometric variables were recorded, as well as the animal's sex. Four algorithms-linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and classification trees-were used to classify the breeds. The results indicated that head width, height at the withers, and right ear length measurements could be used to differentiate the "Casco de Mula" and San Pedre & ntilde;o Creole pigs. The decision tree was the most accurate algorithm (accuracy = 92%, sensitivity = 96%, specificity = 83%, and Matthews correlation coefficient = 0.82), and its performance can be improved by increasing the number of animals. Non-parametric supervised learning methods like decision trees can be used to morphometrically differentiate Creole pigs raised in the same or different environments in order to characterize animal genetic resources.

AB  - Despite decades of fate and effects studies, environmental selenium (Se) contamination and management remain an issue for many freshwater systems in North America. Several regulatory bodies have promulgated updated targets or management levels for Se; however, additional guidance on best practices for monitoring Se to protect freshwater aquatic life is warranted. In this article, we describe current approaches to assessing the ecological risks of Se in impaired freshwater systems and outline recommended methods for collecting and analyzing biological and abiotic samples and interpreting data. Because reproductive impairment of fish populations is most commonly used to determine the potential impacts of Se, several biological factors that could affect Se toxicity are explored, including diet, trophic positions, reproductive biology, body size and maturity, migratory movements, and use of seasonal habitats. Measuring Se concentrations in mature eggs is the most reliable metric for estimating potential reproductive impairment in fish populations because the range of toxicity thresholds is relatively narrow for all but a few tolerant fish species. In situations where collecting mature eggs is not feasible, we review the use of alternative fish tissue for estimating potential effects. Factors affecting Se uptake from freshwater are also considered with guidance on collecting abiotic (e.g., water and sediment) and biotic components of aquatic food webs (e.g., macroinvertebrates, biofilm).

AB  - Fermented organic fertilizers made from pig manure contaminated with antibiotics are widely used in fruit tree production. However, their effects on the residual antibiotics and the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in apple orchards are still largely unknown. In the present study, we detected 100 ARGs and 10 MGEs that were transferred from pig manure to an apple orchard. Compared with the original pig manure, significantly greater concentrations of tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, sulfadiazine, and salfamethyldiazine were observed in anaerobic fermentation residues of the pig manure. The total relative abundance levels of ARGs on the apple pericarp surface, in the orchard soil treated with biogas slurry, and in the orchard soil treated with biogas residue were 122.5, 5.2, 1.4 times higher than those in pristine soil, respectively, which were primarily attributed to the increase in the relative abundance of some ARG subtypes, including blaCTX-M, blaTEM, ermC, sul2, tetO, vgaB, and vgb. Long-term biogas slurry and biogas residue applications to orchard soil enriched bioaccumulation of 10 ARGs and 1 MGEs on the apple pericarp surface with 67.98 the highest factor. This research indicates that the application of anaerobic fermentation residues of pig manure promoted the spread of ARGs in the soil and fruits and increased the level of ARG pollution in the orchard. Results of this study highlight the importance of assessing the ecological safety of organic fertilizers from the perspective of ARGs and indicate that efforts should be devoted to further reducing ARG levels in pig manure before its application to farmland.

AB  - Plant-mediated interactions between phytophagous insects are ubiquitous. Silicon (Si) accumulation can defend plants against chewing insect herbivores, although sap-feeders are comparatively less affected. It remains unknown how Si impacts interspecific interactions between chewing and sap-feeding insect herbivores when sharing a host plant. We grew the model grass Brachypodium distachyon with (+Si) or without (-Si) Si and assessed the impacts of Si supplementation on the contemporaneous performance and interguild interactions between a chewing (Helicoverpa armigera) and a sap-feeding (Rhopalosiphum padi) insect herbivore. We further performed dual-choice tests to assess insect preferences for +Si or -Si plants with or without prior insect attack. Si reduced the relative growth rate (RGR) of both separately and contemporaneously fed caterpillars (H. armigera). Conversely, aphid abundance was higher on +Si plants compared to -Si plants. Caterpillar RGR and aphid abundance were negatively correlated on shared host plants. Furthermore, decreased caterpillar RGR on +Si plants benefitted aphid colonisation, indicating the plant-mediated effects of Si on interspecific competition between the two insects. Attack by caterpillars induced leaf Si accumulation, regardless of aphid presence. In dual-choice tests, caterpillars preferred aphid-attacked -Si plants to aphid-attacked +Si plants, whereas aphids preferred caterpillar-attacked +Si plants to caterpillar-attacked -Si plants. Our results provide the first evidence for plant-mediated effects of Si on interspecific competition between two insect herbivores. We suggest that the dissimilar effects of Si against different feeding guilds of herbivores may promote asymmetry in interspecific competition when sharing host plants, potentially impacting insect abundance and distribution.

AB  - Reconstruction of damaged goat shelters was a key need for communities in the Gorkha district, which was the epicenter of the earthquake in 2015, as lack of shelters led to distress sale of goats and reduction in herd size. Additionally, existing shelters caused diseases in goats due to poor ventilation and hygiene features. Drawing on its global experience and expertise in livelihoods, cash, and markets especially in emergency situations, CRS supported conditional cash transfers, provided in two tranches (upon beneficiary choice and construction completion), along with extension (group orientations, mentoring) focused on shelter design principles, to help poor households critically depending on income from goats reconstruct hygienic goat shelters. CRS promoted two simple, cost-effective design principles while facilitating the reconstruction of goat shelters, i.e., a raised platform and provision for ventilation. A study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of conditional cash transfers combined with a targeted extension on the adoption of improved goat shelter principles by earthquake-affected households, through 100% visual verifications, household surveys, focus group discussions (FGD) with beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, and key informant interviews with stakeholders. The study reported that 99% of beneficiaries adopted the hygienic shelter principles promoted by the project based on the conditionality. Beneficiaries co-invested on an average of $80-100 in addition to the $100 received from the project. A 20-30% increase in herd size among most beneficiaries was reported after the reconstruction of goat shelters due to the availability of safe space. The study showed strong ownership by the beneficiaries which was evident from the maintenance and up-keeping of the goat shelters. Households, who had not received cash from the project, have also started adopting the design principles mainly due to the low-cost and simple nature of the design principles. Which project has provided them with flexibility in using the material of their choice based on the local context.

AB  - Effects of Mycorrhiza and Azotobacter biofertilizers on the biochemical properties and grain yield of rapeseed cultivars were investigated in a randomized complete block design with four replications in two years 2016 and 2017 in Khorramabad, Lorestan province, Iran. Biofertilizer factors included application of Mycorrhiza, Azotobacter, Mycorrhiza and Azotobacter combination and non-application of biofertilizer (control) and cultivar factors included Gabriella, Neptune, Expower and Okapi. According to interaction effect of biofertilizers x cultivar, results showed that the highest seed and oil yields were obtained with the application of Mycorrhiza and Azotobacter combination in case of Gabriella (4918.6 and 1165.2 kg/ha, respectively) and the least was found with non-application of biofertilizers in case of Expower (3350.4 and 731.3 kg/ha, respectively). Biochemical parameters like shoot proline, protein, peroxidase, catalase, Chlorophyll a and b content of canola were also significantly affected by biofertilizer, cultivar and due to interaction of biofertilizer and cultivar. Therefore, application of Mycorrhiza and Azotobacter combination in case of Gabriella is recommended for Khorramabad and similar regions.

AB  - Straw return and biochar are often applied to improve soil fertility and increase crop yield. However, the effects of these practices on soil aggregates and tobacco leaf yield and quality are still unclear. Five treatments: no straw (CK), application of rice straw (RS), tobacco straw biochar (TSB), RS plus TSB (RS+TSB), and RS plus pig manure (RS+PM) were conducted to evaluate the effects of straw return and biochar on soil aggregates, tobacco leaf yield and quality in Southern Anhui, China. Results showed that TSB significantly increased soil pH by 0.38. The RS+TSB and RS+PM significantly increased the contents of soil organic matter, available nitrogen (N) and potassium (K). Biochar and straw return increased 5 mm aggregates fraction in topsoil (0-20 cm) with an order of RS+PM > RS+TSB > TSB > RS. The RS+TSB and RS+PM significantly increased the yield, appearance and sensory quality of tobacco leaf. The leaf yield and quality were positively correlated with >5 mm aggregates fraction, but negatively correlated with <0.25 mm aggregates. These results indicated that straw return with pig manure (375 kg ha(-1)) or biochar (1050 kg ha(-1)) increased the yield and quality of tobacco leaf, likely due to their effect on large soil aggregate and the available of macronutrients in soil.

AB  - Simple Summary Castration is a standard method for eliminating boar taint in industrial hog production, but it also causes enormous fat accumulation in the carcass. Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) was selected to investigate its functions on the regulation of adipose deposition based on our previous data. In the present study, SPP1 overexpression and interference bidirectionally verified that SPP1 inhibited adipogenic differentiation of porcine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (pBMSCs). Testosterone-treated cell models were used to simulate the androgen status of intact pigs, and testosterone addition influenced SPP1 mRNA levels during the differentiation of pBMSCs. Moreover, we identified novel-miR-659 and targeted the 3 ' untranslated region of SPP1 based on bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase assays, and found that the novel-miR-659 upregulation promoted adipogenesis while novel-miR-659 downregulation suppressed adipogenesis in pBMSCs detected by Oil Red O staining and adipogenic markers. Collectively, the interaction between novel-miR-659 and SPP1 can regulate adipose accumulation in castrated male pigs. Our data provide a theoretical basis for further study on the fat deposition mechanism caused by castration. Castration is usually used to remove boar taint in commercial pork production, but the adipose accumulation was increased excessively, which affected the meat quality of pigs. Based on our previous study, secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) was significantly differentially expressed between castrated and intact male pigs. However, the role of SPP1 in regulating adipose growth and fat storage caused by castration is unknown. In this study, SPP1 was identified to inhibit adipogenesis by the expression of adipogenic markers PPAR gamma and FABP4 as well as Oil red staining assay during differentiation of porcine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (pBMSCs). Subsequently, testosterone was used to treat pBMSCs to simulate the androgen status of intact pigs. Compared with the control groups without testosterone, the SPP1 expression in the testosterone group was markedly increased in the late stage of pBMSCs differentiation. Furthermore, novel-miR-659 was predicted by TargetScan and miRDB to target SPP1 and verified through a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Oil Red O staining assay indicated that novel-miR-659 overexpression significantly promoted adipogenesis, whereas novel-miR-659 inhibition suppressed adipogenesis. The expressions of adipogenic markers PPAR gamma and FABP4 showed the same tendency. Taken together, our study found that the targeted interaction between novel-miR-659 and SPP1 is involved in regulation of fat deposition in castrated male pigs.

AB  - Understanding the spatial ecology of small populations at the periphery of their range is important for identifying factors limiting population growth and developing sound management strategies. Bighorn sheep were reintroduced to Nebraska in 1981 and persist in a small population at the easternmost extent of the distribution of the species, where 1 of the 2 subpopulations is declining. Bighorn sheep space use and movement has been studied extensively in mountain and desert populations, but information is sparse from prairie populations in the Northern Great Plains. We investigated the spatial ecology of female bighorn sheep in Nebraska, USA, with global positioning system (GPS) telemetry. We tested the hypothesis that space use and movements would vary across seasons, years, and individuals but predicted that migration would involve relatively short distances in this translocated population (relative to native populations) occupying a fragmented landscape. Overall, females used smaller seasonal home ranges (3.3-7.8 km(2)) than most of those reported previously for the species and exhibited a high degree of variability in space use and movements across seasons, subpopulations, and individuals. Most females (92-100%) exhibited fidelity to their home ranges across seasons and years. Six females migrated between spatially distinct core lambing and winter ranges, although the distances (range = 7.9-8.7 km) and mean elevations (range = 31-41 m) between these core seasonal ranges were less than those reported for most native, migratory bighorn sheep populations. After accounting for variation in season, subpopulation, and years, home range size was positively associated with road density in both subpopulations (P < 0.001), suggesting that females incur greater energetic costs associated with greater space use in areas of higher fragmentation. Our results establish the basic spatial ecology of female bighorn sheep in Nebraska where their behavior appears to reflect the isolated nature of suitable habitat in this fragmented prairie landscape.

AB  - In the marine environment, distance signaling based on water-borne cues occurs during interactions between macroalgae and herbivores. In the brown alga Laminaria digitata from North-Atlantic Brittany, oligoalginates elicitation or grazing was shown to induce chemical and transcriptomic regulations, as well as emission of a wide range of volatile aldehydes, but their biological roles as potential defense or warning signals in response to herbivores remain unknown. In this context, bioassays using the limpet Patella pellucida and L. digitata were carried out for determining the effects of algal transient incubation with 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and dodecadienal on algal consumption by grazers. Simultaneously, we have developed metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches to study algal molecular responses after treatments of L. digitata with these chemical compounds. The results indicated that, unlike the treatment of the plantlets with 4-HNE or dodecadienal, treatment with 4-HHE decreases algal consumption by herbivores at 100 ng.ml(-1). Moreover, we showed that algal metabolome was significantly modified according to the type of aldehydes, and more specifically the metabolite pathways linked to fatty acid degradation. RNAseq analysis further showed that 4-HHE at 100 ng.ml(-1) can activate the regulation of genes related to oxylipin signaling pathways and specific responses, compared to oligoalginates elicitation. As kelp beds constitute complex ecosystems consisting of habitat and food source for marine herbivores, the algal perception of specific aldehydes leading to targeted molecular regulations could have an important biological role on kelps/grazers interactions.

AB  - Environmental factors determine the suitability of natural habitats for crop pests and often facilitate their proliferation and that of the crop diseases they carry. Crop pests and diseases damage food crops, significantly reducing yields for these commodities and threatening food security in developing, predominantly agricultural economies. Given its impact on environmental factors, climate change is an important determinant of crop pest and disease distribution. This study uses Targeting Tools, a climate suitability analysis and mapping toolkit, to explore the potential impact of climate change on select environmental factors linked to crop pest and associated diseases' proliferation. Based on the existing literature, prediction modeling was performed on 21 key pests and diseases that impact the major food crops for Zambian consumption. Future changes in habitat suitability for these crop pests and diseases were mapped based on their optimal temperature and relative humidity conditions for proliferation. Results project that there will be an overall increased geographical spread of suitable habitats for crop pests (and as follows, crop diseases) that thrive in warmer environments. By the 2030s, crop pests and diseases will increasingly spread across Zambia, with a higher likelihood of occurrence projected under RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. Crop pests and diseases that thrive in cooler environments will experience decreasing habitat suitability in the 2030s, but will transition to a slower decrease in the 2050s under RCPs 2.6 and 4.5. Overall crop pest and disease habitat suitability will continue to rise slowly in the 2050s; RCP 8.5 shows an increased habitat suitability for crop pests and diseases that thrive in warm environments, with a decreased likelihood of occurrence for crop pests and diseases that thrive in cooler environments. The results highlight the need for future-facing, long-term climate adaptation and mitigation measures that create less suitable microclimates for crop pests and diseases.

AB  - Laiwu black goats comprise an excellent local germplasm resource; however, a shortage of feed resources has led to the application of unconventional feed. Ginger straw feed has good physiological effects, but research on this feed source for ruminant animals is lacking. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of enzymatic silage ginger straw on Laiwu black goat performance. The experiment used an independent sample t-test analysis method; 24 healthy Laiwu black goats with a body weight of 20.05 +/- 1.15 kg and age of 5.67 +/- 0.25 months were randomly divided into two groups with three replicates (bars) per group and four goats per replicate. The experimental diet was composed of mixed concentrate, silage, and garlic peel at a 2:7:1 ratio. The silage used in the two groups was whole corn silage (CON group) and 60% whole corn silage plus 40% enzymatic silage ginger straw (SG group), and the other components were identical. Daily feed intake/daily gain (F/G) was significantly higher in the SG group than in the CON group (p < 0.05), but there were no significant differences in dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) digestibility between the groups. The shear force, cooking loss, centrifugal loss, and pressure loss of the longissimus dorsi muscle group were significantly lower in the SG than in the CON group (p < 0.05). Compared with those in the CON group, the serum and liver total antioxidant capacity was significantly increased in the SG group, and in the liver, the O2<middle dot>-, malondialdehyde, and OH<middle dot> contents were significantly decreased. Collectively, the rumen fluid microbial diversity was changed in the SG group. It was concluded that enzymatic silage ginger straw usage instead of 40% whole silage corn as feed for Laiwu black goats can significantly improve the muscle quality, antioxidant capacity, and intestinal flora, with no adverse effects on production performance. In conclusion, our study provides a basis for ginger straw processing and storage and its rational application in the Laiwu black goat diet.

AB  - Seed dispersal plays a pivotal role in plant ecology, impacting various aspects such as dispersal, reproduction, and population dynamics. In this study, we investigated the endozoochoric seed dispersal by the onager or Persian wild ass (Equus hemionus onager) in Qatrouiyeh National Park, located in south-central Iran. Fecal samples were collected from three plains within the park over three seed production seasons. A subsequent greenhouse experiment was conducted to identify and quantify the germinated seedlings. We discovered a total of 63 plant species across 45 genera and 21 families, with the majority of species categorized as annual or perennial forbs. Seasonal variations were observed for seedling count, species richness, and species diversity, with peak values observed during autumn. The seedlings consisted primarily of forbs (86%), followed by grasses (10%) and other plant types (4%). Astragalus podolobus, Lepidium vesicarium, and Chenopodium album emerged as the most abundant species from the fecal samples. Our findings shed light on the critical role played by the onager in the dispersal of numerous plant species and emphasized the potential cascading effects of herbivore-mediated seed dispersal. This highlights the significance of conserving and restoring the remaining populations of this threatened subspecies in arid habitats, where seed dispersal by abiotic factors is limited.

AB  - Inbreeding depression is of major concern in declining populations, but relatively little is known about its genetic architecture in wild populations, such as the degree to which it is composed of large or small effect loci and their distribution throughout the genome. Here, we combine fitness and genomic data from a wild population of red deer to investigate the genomic distribution of inbreeding effects. Based on the runs of homozygosity (ROH)-based inbreeding coefficient, F-ROH, we use chromosome-specific inbreeding coefficients (F-ROHChr) to explore whether the effect of inbreeding varies between chromosomes. Under the assumption that within an individual the probability of being identical-by-descent is equal across all chromosomes, we used a multi-membership model to estimate the deviation of F-ROHChr from the average inbreeding effect. This novel approach ensures effect sizes are not overestimated whilst maximising the power of our available dataset of >3000 individuals genotyped on >35,000 autosomal SNPs. We find that most chromosomes confer a minor reduction in fitness-related traits, which when these effects are summed, results in the observed inbreeding depression in birth weight, survival and lifetime breeding success. However, no chromosomes had a significant detrimental effect compared to the overall effect of inbreeding, indicating no major effect loci. We conclude that in this population, inbreeding depression is likely the result of multiple mildly or moderately deleterious mutations spread across all chromosomes, which are difficult to detect with statistical confidence. Such mutations will be inefficiently purged, which may explain the persistence of inbreeding depression in this population.

AB  - The semi-arid steppe and forest-steppe regions of southern Siberia have a long history of human occupation. During the Bronze and Iron Ages, the area became home to a number of archaeological cultures that greatly influenced the cultural and technological development and exchange processes in the middle latitudes of Eurasia and left a rich archaeological record. One of the lesser-known Iron Age archaeological cultures is the Tashtyk culture, which flourished in the Minusinsk Basin in the upper reaches of the Yenisei during the 1st to 7th centuries CE. Using an extensive set of radiocarbon dates and identifications of plant and animal remains from the best-preserved and most spectacular Grave 4 of the Oglakhty burial ground, our study aims to improve the age determination of the examined grave and to better understand the natural environments and way of life of the local population in this remote region of Central Asia during the early 1st millennium CE. Our dating approach could narrow down the probabilistic age range of the time at which Grave 4 was constructed and used to ca. 250-300 CE. The inferred age together with polychrome jin silks documented in Grave 4 suggests a connection between the local populations and silk producing centres in eastern China via either oases-states in the Tarim and Turfan basins or via the Mongolian steppes. The records of zooarchaeological remains and artefacts approve that the local Tashtyk people were skilful craftsmen and had a complex subsistence economy mainly based on animal husbandry, which was supplemented by hunting-gathering and small-scale agriculture. The available evidence on the use of sheep indicates that they played an important role in the local economy, although other domesticated animals (such as goats, cattle, horses) were bred as well. Whether reindeer were present locally (i.e. domesticated) or their skins were obtained through hunting or more distant exchange requires further investigation. Also, the role of agriculture and millet cultivation (mentioned in the reports of the first archaeological excavations) remains an important topic for upcoming research. The available, albeit still rare, palaeoenvironmental records from the region suggest drier conditions during the 4th to 1st centuries BCE, partly corresponding to a colder and dryer phase in the North Atlantic region. The regional pollen and isotope records demonstrate a weak trend towards wetter and warmer climate during the following five centuries representing the Tashtyk culture.

AB  - Host shifts to new plant species can drive speciation for plant-feeding insects, but how commonly do host shifts also drive diversification for the parasites of those same insects? Oak gall wasps induce galls on oak trees and shifts to novel tree hosts and new tree organs have been implicated as drivers of oak gall wasp speciation. Gall wasps are themselves attacked by many insect parasites, which must find their hosts on the correct tree species and organ, but also must navigate the morphologically variable galls with which they interact. Thus, we ask whether host shifts to new trees, organs, or gall morphologies correlate with gall parasite diversification. We delimit species and infer phylogenies for two genera of gall kleptoparasites, Synergus and Ceroptres, reared from a variety of North American oak galls. We find that most species were reared from galls induced by just one gall wasp species, and no parasite species was reared from galls of more than four species. Most kleptoparasite divergence events correlate with shifts to non-ancestral galls. These shifts often involved changes in tree habitat, gall location, and gall morphology. Host shifts are thus implicated in driving diversification for both oak gall wasps and their kleptoparasitic associates.

AB  - Pasteurella multocida a Gram-negative bacterium exists as a commensal in the upper respiratory tracts of livestock, and poultry. It is causative agent of a range of diseases in mammals and birds including fowl cholera in poultry, atrophic rhinitis in pigs and bovine hemorrhagic septicemia in cattle and buffalo. This study aimed to isolate P. multocida from sheep and cattle lungs sampled and assessed by bacteriological procedures and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) characterization. In this study 52 isolated of P. multocida were obtained (2016-2017) from clinically healthy and diseased animals (sheep and cattle) evaluated by PFGE for determining the relationship between them. According to the results of this study 12 sheep isolates had similarities above 94.00% and two cattle isolates showed similarities above 94.00%. When compared between sheep and cattle, most isolates showed a similarity of less than 50.00% indicating the great differences between isolates. It is noteworthy that in the present study, performed by PFGE to determine the type of P. multocida isolates, a very high distinction was made to determine the type of isolates and the relationship between isolates based on fragments in their genome using enzymes.(c) 2023 Urmia University.

AB  - Mineral nutrients, such as zinc (Zn), are critical for plant growth; however, the effect of Zn on insect herbivory is poorly characterized. Because Zn deficiency may compromise plant physiology while high levels of zinc may be directly toxic to herbivores, we predicted lepidopteran herbivores would perform best on plants deficient in Zn or those with an intermediate dose of Zn fertilizer. We first tested these hypotheses in a greenhouse experiment using maize (Zea mays L. [Poaceae]) and two noctuid caterpillars, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and evaluated the effects of a normal range of Zn (0-11.7 g m(-3)) on the interaction between maize and each caterpillar species. In the greenhouse, we found Zn increased uptake of other nutrients, particularly nitrogen (N), and fertilizing with just 2.5 g m(-3) Zn maximized maize growth. Spodoptera frugiperda performance increased marginally with Zn fertilization. While neither caterpillar species was directly affected by Zn concentrations in leaves, S. frugiperda caterpillars responded to leaf N. In the field, we investigated the effect of Zn fertilization on leaf-nutrient concentrations, early season damage by resident herbivores, performance of S. frugiperda on excised leaf tissue, and maize yield. We found fertilizing with Zn increased leaf N, but compared to the greenhouse experiment, had a smaller effect on Zn uptake and no effect on herbivory. Zinc treatments did not affect maize yield in the field. We conclude that Zn fertilization can increase N leaf concentrations, which in turn can affect some herbivores, with species-specific effects.

AB  - People's perception of the conflict they are experiencing with wildlife is a major factor in determining the extent of human-elephant conflict (HEC) occurring and needs to be considered when devising HEC management strategies. To understand perceptions and attitudes, however, it is necessary to identify factors that influence them. This study used a combination of multivariate ordered probit and generalized linear models to probe the complexities of farmer perception and attitudes and reveal underlying influential factors that shape perceived conflict levels. The study shows that the perception of HEC is complicated, influenced by an array of factors, both directly and indirectly, many of which are socio-demographic characteristics of the farmer, rather than quantifiable indicators of actual conflict. It was found that perceived human-elephant conflict (HEC) in the Okavango is affected by the ethnicity of the farmer, the raiding history of a field, the distance of fields to elephant pathways, and a farmer's feeling towards elephants. Yet, feelings towards elephants are affected by attitudes towards wildlife, which are influenced by the benefits communities receive from living near wildlife. The perceived conflict levels of respondents were higher than the predicted actual conflict levels. Such discrepancies could be interpreted as "people over-reporting the scale of the problem", yet results indicate that the crop-raiding history of a farmer alone is not adequate to assess the overall level of conflict being experienced because other social and environmental factors are involved in determining farmer perception of conflict. A holistic approach is needed to address the complexities of perceived and actual conflicts to ultimately reduce HEC. This involves targeting mitigation strategies for specific groups of people, considering elephant pathways and field locations in land use planning, and finding ways to improve benefits accrued to the community through wildlife-related enterprises that bring benefits back from living with elephants.

AB  - Human activities significantly influence the changes in wildlife habitats and biodiversity, highlighting the necessity to enhance public knowledge, perceptions, and practices (KPP) to mitigate their consequences. Previous research suggests that many people in Bangladesh do not consider wildlife and biodiversity conservation a crucial issue. However, enhancing their KPP could be essential in developing effective and sustainable conservation efforts in Bangladesh. So, the current study aimed to evaluate the public's KPP of wildlife conservation and biodiversity management in Bangladesh. A total of 3060 individuals' data were collected from various sociodemographic backgrounds using a structured questionnaire followed by statistical analyses including Pearson's chi-square, Spearman's correlation, and logistic regression analysis, which were performed to assess the correlations and trends among variables using STATA and SPSS. The results revealed a significant heterogeneity in KPP across different sociodemographic groups. Importantly, the younger respondents (ages 21-30) indicated a high level of KPP, and respondents without formal education and belonging to older ages demonstrated markedly low levels of KPP. In the country's divisional levels, respondents from Khulna and Rangpur revealed the highest and lowest KPP levels, respectively. Our study also revealed that students represented the major occupational demographic and displayed moderate levels of KPP. Notably, respondents highlighted the decline or absence of several wild animal species, including black bears, deer, vultures, wild cats, hanuman monkeys, and rhesus monkeys, from their local areas over the past decades. Public opinion on wildlife protection revealed 78.6% and 73.4% disapproving of hunting rejection and wildlife trading, respectively. Nonetheless, a lack of knowledge remained, as 16.89% of respondents were unaware of measures to alleviate human-wildlife conflict. The correlation analysis indicated a favorable association among KPP components, especially between knowledge and perception (correlation coefficient = 0.438), underscoring the essential influence of awareness on conservation actions. This study offers critical insights for developing interventions to enhance KPP among local communities and stakeholders, hence promoting sustainable wildlife conservation and biodiversity management in Bangladesh. Taken together, the findings provide baseline data for safeguarding biodiversity and fostering long-term wildlife sustainability in Bangladesh.

AB  - The present research studied the potential of using plant species adapted to areas affected by Municipal Solid Waste disposal to phytoextract or phytostabilize heavy metals. The study area was an old unlined landfill that is regarded as contaminated by heavy metals, organic matter, and salts. Firstly, soil contamination around the waste deposit was assessed, secondly, the ability of local plants to extract metals from the soil was evaluated and thirdly, a greenhouse pot experiment was conducted using Vetiveria zizanioides (vetiver) planted in different soil samples collected from the study area. Heavy metal concentrations were below the Brazilian Screening Level in all soil samples but were generally higher at sites directly affected by the waste disposal, especially for Ba, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn. Psidium guajava (guava tree) and Pennisetum purpureum (elephant grass) growing naturally over the landfill surface presented potential applications for phytoextracting Ba, Pb, and Zn. Regarding the pot experiment with vetiver, it was observed that the plants could adapt to all the different treatments, showing their environmental adaptability. Metals were found to accumulate mainly in root tissues, indicating the potential for phytostabilization. Relevant bioaccumulation and translocation factors were found, respectively, for Ba, Cu, and Zn, and Ba, Cr, and Zn. The study concluded that guava tree, elephant grass, and vetiver can contribute to mitigating impacts of waste disposal sites and are able to thrive in such environments under a subtropical climate, phytoextract and/or phytostabilize Ba, Cu, Pb, and Zn, and thus, avoid leaching to the surroundings.

AB  - Pig production contributes significantly to the high environmental footprint of the livestock sector. Therefore, in this framework, a transition toward more sustainable production is essential. Local natural livestock resources, such as Mexican Creole Hairless Pigs, provide a good opportunity to achieve sustainable pig production. In the present study, a first approximation to compare the carbon emissions of Mexican Creole Hairless Pig manure from Commercial Pig manure is presented. Under the same feeding and housing conditions, the specific methane emissions of both Mexican Creole Hairless Pigs and Commercial Pigs manure were determined experimentally at room temperature. In addition, specific methane production kinetics was modeled using the Gompertz equation to estimate the specific methane production rate. The methane emission factors for Mexican Creole Hairless Pig manure (0.33 +/- 0.02 kg[CO2-eq]/LU per day) were half those of Commercial Pig manure (0.7 +/- 0.04 kg[CO2-eq]/LU per day), and biochemical manure analysis suggested that Mexican Creole Hairless Pigs had better digestibility of the diet. In general, due to physiological factors such as food intake rate and gut microbiota development, which could influence the fat and fiber digestibility of Creole genotypes, pig genotype should be included as an additional factor to estimate greenhouse gas emissions from pig manure. The production of Mexican Creole Hairless Pigs in an extensive local system is therefore an attractive option for developing new sustainable markets.
   Pig farming contributes to the greenhouse gaseous emissions worldwide. In this study, the methane emissions from Creole Pig manure and Commercial Pig manure were measured and compared. Under the same feeding and housing conditions, the methane emission for Creole Pig manure were half those of Commercial Pig manure. Creole pig genotype is an attractive alternative to achieve sustainable pig production. image

AB  - Herbivore grazing on macroalgae promotes the release of macroalgal organic carbons into seawater and potentially impacts their bioavailability. However, the influence of herbivores on the fate of macroalgal organic carbon remains unclear, hindering a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the role of macroalgae in ocean carbon cycle. Here, we cocultured suspended herbivore (Apohyale sp.) and benthic herbivore (Nereis diversicolor) with macroalgae (Ulva prolifera) in the laboratory, and found that the two grazers promote the release of macroalgal organic carbon through different pathways. Apohyale sp. Can simultaneously increase the release of different forms of organic carbon by feeding on U. prolifera thalli, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particluate organic carbon (POC), and algal organic detritus; while N. diversicolor demonstrated a preference for ingesting algal detritus and POC, thereby reducing the detrital carbon but greatly promoting their conversion to DOC. The amount of organic carbon released per day after predation by Apohyale sp. is much higher (7.2 vs 0.5 mg C d-1) than by N. diversicolor. Meanwhile, through long-term microbial degradation experiments, we found that herbivores significantly alter the fate of macroalgae organic carbon. Although the proportions of stable carbon (recalcitrant DOC and recalcitrant POC) in different forms of macroalgal organic carbon varied after predation, the absolute amount of their residuals in seawater were 2-3 times higher than those not ingested by herbivores. Our results highlight that herbivores play a pivotal role in promoting carbon flow in marine food webs and have a significant impact on macroalgal carbon sequestration.

AB  - Seed dispersal is a critical process for plant reproduction and regeneration. Successful recruitment depends on pre- and post-dispersal processes that complete a seed's journey until becoming a new plant. However, anthropogenic stressors may disrupt the seed dispersal process at some stages, collapsing plant regeneration and hampering its long-term persistence. The Chilean palm tree Jubaea chilensis is the southernmost and the only non-tropical palm species, which currently relies on the scatter-hoarding rodent Octodon degus for seed dispersal. We assessed seed fate by measuring predation and dispersal rates through experimental fieldwork in the Palmar de Ocoa site (located within La Campana National Park) and the Palmar El Salto. We also used previous reports on seed harvest and seedling herbivory to depict the whole J. chilensis seed dispersal process and assess the relative importance of different anthropogenic pressures. We asked the following questions: (1) What is the effect of human harvesting on J. chilensis recruitment? (2) Do native and exotic rodents predate J. chilensis seeds in the same way? and (3) Does post-dispersal herbivory matter? We found that J. chilensis fruits are harvested for human consumption, reducing pre-dispersal available seeds by removing about 23 tons per season. Then, post-dispersal seeds at the Ocoa palm grove are heavily predated by exotic (Rattus rattus) and native (Octodon spp.) rodents; only 8.7% of the seeds are effectively dispersed by Octodon degus. At Palmar El Salto, 100% of the seeds were predated by Rattus rattus, precluding further analysis. Finally, 70% of the seedlings were consumed by exotic herbivores (mainly rabbits), resulting in a success rate of 1.81%. Only 7.9% of the surviving seedlings become infantile plants (4 year-old). Our assessment suggests that J. chilensis has aging populations with very few young individuals in disturbed sites to replace the old ones. For those reasons, we suggest increasing its conservation category to critically endangered as land-use change is rapidly fragmenting and shrinking the extant J. chilensis populations. We urge to take urgent actions to protect this relict palm, which otherwise may go extinct in the next decades.

AB  - In Norway, cattle (Bos taurus) are released to large areas of boreal forest for summer grazing. To determine to what degree this practice challenges timber production and wildlife management, we need a better understanding of basic cattle ecology. What do cattle, typical grazers, feed on in a habitat typically used by browsers? We determined cattle's resource use and selection at three scales: habitat and microhabitat selection when foraging and diet selection. Boreal forest is dominated by grass-poor habitats, and despite their strong selection for grass-rich habitats, cows spent a lot of time in suboptimal habitats, like old bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) spruce (Picea abies) forest. However, they managed to find grass-rich habitat patches within those, selecting for patches with bentgrass (Agrostis spp.). Graminoids, mainly wavy hair-grass (Avenella spp.), tussock grass (Deschampsia), and true sedges (Carex spp.), made up the biggest part of the fecal samples. Woody plants, mainly willow (Salix spp.), Vaccinium spp., pine (Pinus spp.), and birch (Betula spp.), made up 9.4% +/- 4.7% of the samples, a value lower than reported for other forest grazing cattle. Cattle avoided woody plants in their diet and selected for graminoids. They preferred deciduous over coniferous species. At these low stocking densities, the cows were grazers in this browser's habitat. Moreover, they selected rather on habitat and patch scale than for individual plants within a given habitat patch, considered typical for a grazer. Their grass-rich diet indicates little overlap with the diet of local wild ungulates, which are mostly browsers. Their aversion of spruce and selection for graminoids and deciduous trees indicates low conflict risk for browsing damages and even a beneficial weeding effect on trees planted for timber production.

AB  - Feed efficiency, the relative ability to convert feed nutrients into growth, is an important factor in the primary production of animals. Farming fish with improved feed efficiency is necessary to reduce production costs and achieve sustainability for the aquaculture industry. Proteomics provides an approach to discover biochemical mechanisms driving feed efficiency. To do this, we have evaluated the proteomic profile of liver and white muscle in efficient (EFF) and inefficient (INEFF) Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Twenty-six fish, 14 EFF and 12 INEFF individuals, were assessed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/ MS) and a data-independent acquisition method. In total, 2433 liver and 635 white muscle proteins were quantified across all samples. Bioinformatics showed enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms related to lipid metabolism in liver of EFF fish (-30% of total GO terms). Protein metabolism (-30% of total GO terms) were the top enriched pathways in white muscle of EFF fish. In INEFF fish, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum and proteolysis (-40% of total GO terms) were the highest enriched GO terms in the liver. This is the first study to compare feed efficient and inefficient individuals at the proteomic level in an aquatic species and the results provide a preliminary insight into the fundamental molecular landscape of feed efficiency in Chinook salmon.

AB  - Expanding coal-mining operations in the Elk River Valley (British Columbia, Canada) have increased total selenium (Se) concentrations in the transboundary Lake Koocanusa (Canada and United States), but the spatial extent of Se transport from the Elk River Mines is unknown. We evaluated multiple lines of evidence of long-range transport of Se at five sites downstream of the mines relative to a site unaffected by the mines. First, all mine-affected sites had increasing trends in flow-normalized Se concentrations between 2005 and 2021 (35-89%), while no trend was observed at the unaffected site between 2005 and 2017. Second, all mine-affected sites had elevated annual mean Se concentrations and 5-year mean annual loads (2013-2017) by up to an order of magnitude relative to the unaffected site. Third, Se concentrations and the magnitude of the concentration trend generally decreased with distance downstream from the mines while loads increased, which is consistent with the downstream transport of the bulk of the Se load from the mines with smaller contributions from other sources. These results provide multiple lines of evidence that Se from the Elk River Mines is transported over 575 river kilometers and may pose risks to aquatic life in the transboundary Columbia River.

AB  - This study explores the impact of the "Worth More Alive" wildlife conservation campaign implemented at Zambia's Kenneth Kaunda International Airport, aiming to contribute to addressing the global challenge of illegal wildlife trade and raise awareness among international travelers. Wildlife trafficking remains a critical global issue, threatening biodiversity and necessitating innovative awareness strategies. Zambia, with its rich biodiversity, serves as a case study to evaluate the efficacy of targeted conservation messaging in influencing perceptions and attitudes. Data collection involved pre- and post-campaign surveys with 79 and 101 respondents, respectively. The demographic analysis revealed a predominance of male participants, though the gender ratio improved post-campaign. The campaign successfully increased public recognition of elephants as endangered, rising from 40 % to 49 %. However, awareness on black and white rhinoceroses and African lions declined, indicating a potential shift in focus. Knowledge of wildlife protection, particularly regarding illegal wildlife trade, showed slight improvement, with recognition of campaign materials increasing from 11 % to 20 % post-campaign. Awareness of penalties for illegal possession of trophies saw a marginal rise, from 24 % to 26 %. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that campaign awareness significantly improved recognition of the pangolin (beta = 1.1928, p = 0.032), showing a 330 % increase in knowledge about this lesserknown species. Chi-square tests confirmed a significant association between campaign awareness and increased recognition of endangered species, particularly pangolins. While park visitation positively correlated with awareness, inconsistencies across residency status and nationality were observed. Gender disparities were evident, with males exhibiting higher awareness levels, highlighting the need for targeted communication strategies to engage all demographic groups effectively. The present study underscores the "Worth More Alive" campaign's success in enhancing awareness of lesser-known species, particularly pangolins while identifying areas for improvement in broader species recognition and engagement. Future campaigns should prioritize tailored messaging to address diverse demographic interests and behaviors, ensuring a more comprehensive and effective approach to wildlife conservation awareness.

AB  - Simple Summary Alpacas (Vicugna pacos) are South American members of the tribe Lamini of the Camelidae family. They are bred for their fiber, which is considered a luxury material. Interest in alpaca breeding is increasing in Poland, but the local alpaca population is relatively young and heterogeneous. The poor quality of alpaca fiber results from uncontrolled crossing with llamas (Lama glama). Hybridization between the two species is a well-known phenomenon among alpaca breeders worldwide and is the cause of poor fiber quality, which leads to economic losses. Microsatellite markers can distinguish alpacas from llamas and indicate the level of admixture. However, it is difficult to determine in which generation the admixture took place. The high genetic diversity of alpacas bred in Poland has emerged as a consequence of their mixed origins. In this context, the microsatellite markers recommended by the International Society for Animal Genetics have been shown to be highly useful for individual identification and parentage testing of alpacas. This study aimed to characterize the population structure and genetic diversity of alpacas maintained in Poland using 17 microsatellite markers recommended by the International Society for Animal Genetics. The classification of llamas, alpacas, and hybrids of both based on phenotype is often difficult due to long-term admixture. Our results showed that microsatellite markers can distinguish alpacas from llamas and provide information about the level of admixture of one species in another. Alpacas admixed with llamas constituted 8.8% of the tested individuals, with the first-generation hybrid displaying only 7.4% of llama admixture. The results showed that Poland hosts a high alpaca genetic diversity as a consequence of their mixed origin. More than 200 different alleles were identified and the average observed heterozygosity and expected heterozygosity values were 0.745 and 0.768, respectively, the average coefficient of inbreeding was 0.034, and the average polymorphism information content value was 0.741. The probability of exclusion for one parent was estimated at 0.99995 and for two parents at 0.99999.

AB  - The area destined for agricultural production in Parana state in Brazil is similar to 6 million hectares, of which 79% are under notillage systems (NTS) that can positively affect earthworm populations. Furthermore, earthworm abundance and richness can be valuable soil quality. This study assessed earthworm communities in long-term no-tillage sites (NTS) and nearby secondary Atlantic Forest (SF) fragments. Sampling was performed in June 2018 and May 2019 using the quantitative Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility handsorting method (ISO-TSBF), complemented by qualitative sampling in three municipalities: Faxinal, Maua da Serra and Palmeira, in NTS and SF. Eleven earthworm species, belonging to five families (Benhamiidae, Glossoscolecidae, Megascolecidae, Ocnerodrilidae, and Rhinodrilidae) were found along with seven native species (Glossoscolex sp.22, Glossoscolex sp.23, Fimoscolex sp.21, Fimoscolex sp.24, Fimoscolex sp.42, Andiorrhinus duseni and Urobenus brasiliensis) and four exotic or cosmopolitan species (Dichogaster gracilis, Amynthas gracilis, Metaphire californica and Pontoscolex corethrurus). The cosmopolitan P. corethrurus dominated Faxinal and Maua da Serra, while in Palmeira Fimoscolex and Glossoscolex were the most abundant. Six species belonging to Glossoscolex and Fimoscolex were new to science and must be described. Overall, 239 individuals were found. In 2018 126 individuals were found (76 in NTS and 50 in SF) and in 2019, only 112 individuals were found (45 in NTS and 67 in SF). The highest earthworm abundance was in Faxinal (123 individuals), with 76 individuals in NTS and 47 in SF. In Maua da Serra the same pattern was observed (SF > NTS), while in Palmeira in overall, fewer individuals (38) were collected (24 in NTS and 14 in SF). The NTS at Faxinal and SF Maua da Serra in 2019 had only/more exotic/cosmopolitan species, while at the other dates and sites > 50% of the specimens sampled were native species. Overall, forests had more native species than exotics: in 2018, natives represented > 75% of all specimens, but in 2019 both Faxinal and Maua da Serra had more exotic species (> 65%), while at Palmeira, they represented 50% of the individuals. Earthworm total biomass for forest sites was higher in Faxinal (3.2 g) and NTS in Maua da Serra (1.7 g) in 2019. Overall, the total biomass was higher in SF sites than NTS. Using a classification available for earthworm populations in no-tillage systems, all three sites were considered to have poor quality in terms of abundance (ind m-2), while for species richness, they were considered to have moderate (Faxinal and Maua da Serra) and good quality (Palmeira).

AB  - Understanding individual behavioural differences could enhance welfare research. Many methods for assessing fear to make inferences about 'personality' have been proposed but not validated for goat kids. The study's primary aims were to 1) investigate individual-level test-retest reliability of Novel Object (NO) and Familiar Person (FP) tests; 2) establish the effects of testing environment (Modified Home (MH) or Unfamiliar Testing (UT) arenas) and weaning method (Gradually (GW; n=18) or Abruptly (AW; n=17)), and 3) test for associations between repeatable behaviours and production metrics (e.g. growth). A secondary aim was to assess interobserver reliability. One AW pen and one GW pen were used for each testing environment (MH/UT). Four NO tests were conducted, two pre-weaning (25d and 29d), and two post-weaning (63d and 67d); FP tests were conducted the day after each. Tests lasted 180 s (+90 s habituation for NO tests) and were recorded. An observer blinded to weaning treatment scored all videos, and another scored 1 kid's test for each timepoint/pen. One kid from MH and seven from UT environments were removed from testing and subsequent analysis due to distress. Intraclass coefficient calculations indicated good interobserver reliability (W-1=0.670, p<0.001). For FP tests 'bipedal stance' (W-3=0.379 p<0.001) and 'stand still-look' (W-3=0.378 p=0.010) and for NO tests bipedal stance (W(3)0.234 p=0.006) and 'latency until contact' W-3=0.202 p=<0.001 showed test-retest repeatability. MH and UT environments were compared using Kendall's W (calculated for each behaviour separately), the coefficients were compared with Mann-Whitney U tests, which found no impact of testing environment (p=0.579). GLMMs assessed the effect of external factors pen, test type, and weaning treatment; concordance coefficients between individual kids' tests were the dependent variable with test type, kid age and pen as independent variables. The model of best fit was selected on the basis of lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC); test type (p=0.184) did not predict individual consistency, but pen did (p=0.002). Further GLMMs found no effect (p>0.05) of 'personality' indicators on weight gain, milk intake/day, nor relationship with weaning treatment, but a significant effect of bipedal stance on milk feeds/day (p=0.04) was identified. Results indicate that 'bipedal stance' in both tests, 'stand still-look' in FP tests, and 'latency to interact' in NO tests have some repeatability, therefore could be 'personality' indicators. Statistical analysis found that testing environment did not affect fear among kids tested, but in practice the unfamiliar environment resulted in more distress-related removals therefore a modified home pen is recommended.

AB  - 1. Juvenile mammals in their postweaning developmental stages face many challenges in transitioning to adulthood. Among large grazing species such as ruminant bovids and cervids, an overarching challenge is acquiring and processing sufficient nutrients to survive and grow, with a gut that may not yet be fully developed. Marsupial kangaroos of Australia face similar challenges; they also digest vegetation by fermentation in a large foregut. In red kangaroos, Osphranter rufus (=Macropus rufus), the dominant species of Australia's arid interior, females may breed continuously; however, juvenile recruitment to the adult population is irregular and coincident with sporadic rainfall.
   2. As compared with adult females, the nutritional requirements of juvenile O. rufus are high in relation to their body mass (BM), largely due to the cost of their rapid growth. We examined processes that juveniles have in their morphology, physiology, and behaviors to meet their elevated nutritional needs, by comparing recently weaned juveniles of both sexes and adult female O. rufus in their desert habitat. Features studied include relative body sizes, relative dimensions, and capacities of principal gut regions, the foregut, small intestine, caecum, and large intestine with rectum. Also examined were digesta attributes and rates of digesta excretion. Additionally, the rates of change in skull parameters and dental characteristics to maturity were assessed. Field determinations of diet choice were made for both age classes.
   3. In juveniles, the content masses of major gut structures were related to body mass (BM), as were those of adult females, that is, similar to BM1.0. In both age classes, the digesta mass of the foreguts exceeded 75% of the total digesta mass. Diets of both juvenile and adult O. rufus largely focused on grasses. Juveniles had higher rates of digesta excretion while foraging than adults. In addition, the foregut contents in juveniles occupy proportionally less of the total gut than in adult females. Together, the higher excretion rate and smaller relative foregut of juveniles suggest that they necessarily focus on forage that can be rapidly digested, such as young, green grasses, or herbage.
   4. Comparison of the skulls of juveniles and adults revealed how this harvest can occur. Relative to BM, juveniles had skulls of larger volume than adults. Additionally, during growth the skull lengthens proportionally faster than increasing BM. By weaning, the dimensions of the incisor bite of juveniles neared those of adult females. The area of wear on premolars/molars increased only slowly relative to the development of incisors, further pointing to juveniles selecting more digestible forage than adults. The intermittent availability of such forage, principally young grasses, appears key to the significant recruitment into the O. rufus population in their arid habitat.

AB  - Migration is a tactic used across taxa to access resources in temporally heterogenous landscapes. Populations that migrate can attain higher abundances because such movements allow access to higher quality resources, or reduction in predation risk resulting in increased fitness. However, most migratory species occur in partially migratory populations, a mix of migratory and non-migratory individuals. It is thought that the portion of migrants in a partial migration population is maintained either through (1) a population-level evolutionary stable state where counteracting density-dependent vital rates act on migrants and residents to balance fitness or (2) conditional migration, where the propensity to migrate is influenced by the individual's state. However, in many respects, migration is also a form of habitat selection and the proportion of migrants and residents may be the result of density-dependent habitat selection. Here, we test whether the theory of Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) can explain the coexistence of different migratory tactics in a partially migratory population. IFD predicts individuals exhibit density-dependent vital rates and select different migratory tactics to maximize individual fitness resulting in equal fitness (lambda) between tactics. We tested the predictions of IFD in a partially migratory elk population that declined by 70% with 19 years of demographic data and migratory tactic switching rates from >300 individuals. We found evidence of density dependence for resident pregnancy and adult female survival providing a fitness incentive to switch tactics. Despite differences in vital rates between migratory tactics, mean lambda (fitness) was equal. However, as predicted by the IFD, individuals switched tactics toward those of higher fitness. Our analysis reveals that partial migration may be driven by tactic selection that follows the ideal free distribution. These findings reinforce that migration across taxa may be a polymorphic behavior in large herbivores where migratory tactic selection is determined by differential costs and benefits, mediated by density dependence.

AB  - Composting with food waste was assessed for its efficacy in decontaminating Bisphenol A (BPA). In a BPA-treated compost pile, the initial concentration of BPA 847 mg kg-1 fell to 6.3 mg kg-1 (99% reduction) over a 45-day composting period. The biodegradation rate was at its highest when bacterial activity peaked in the mesophilic and thermophilic phases. The average rate of total biodegradation was 18.68 mg kg-1 day-1. Standard methods were used to assess physicochemical parameters of the compost matrix and gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to identify BPA intermediates. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to detect BPA degraders and the diverse bacterial communities involved in BPA decomposition. These communities were found consist of 12 phyla and 21 genera during the composting process and were most diversified during the maturation phase. Three dominant phyla, Firmicutes, Pseudomonadota, and Bacteroidetes, along with Lactobacillus, Proteus, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas were found to be the most responsible for BPA degradation. Different bacterial communities were found to be involved in the food waste compost biodegradation of BPA at different stages of the composting process. In conclusion, food waste composting can effectively remove BPA, resulting in a safe product. These findings might be used to expand bioremediation technologies to apply to a wide range of pollutants.

AB  - Life-history theory predicts a trade-off between growth rates and lifespan, which is reflected by telomere length, a biomarker of somatic state. We investigated the correlation between telomere length and early-life growth of wild boar piglets, Sus scrofa, kept under semi-natural conditions with high food availability to examine our hypothesis that increased pre- and postnatal growth will lead to telomere length attrition, but that a high supply of nutrient may provide the possibility to compensate telomere loss via telomere repair mechanisms. As predicted, our data showed a clear negative correlation between birth body mass and initial telomere length: heavier neonates had shorter telomeres at birth, and we did not find an influence of the mother on initial telomere length. Body mass at birth correlated with body mass later in life and postnatal growth rate did not affect telomere length. We observed an increase in telomere length during postnatal development, suggesting that high food availability allowed piglets to invest into both, growth and telomere restoration. The increase in telomere length over the duration of the study was not accompanied by telomerase activity; thus, telomere elongation was caused either by alternative mechanisms or by short pulses of telomerase activity that we missed. Taken together, this study suggests a trade-off between investment into growth and telomere maintenance even before birth and the possibility to compensate telomere attrition during growth under high amounts of available energy.

AB  - Salmon farming in Chile faces the dual challenge of maintaining growth while improving sustainability. One approach to advance sustainability involves the feeds without marine-fishery inputs. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of completely replacing fish oil (FO) on the performance of Salmo salar throghout marine growout. The investigation involved fish ranging from 400 g to 4000 g and explored three diets without fish meal, each which included 2.2% EPA + DHA from different sources: FO (control), transgenic canola oil (Can n-3) and Schizochytrium sp. oil (AOV) as unique type of oils. Each diet was randomly distributed in triplicate among nine tanks with a recirculation system maintained at 12 degrees C, with automatic feeding and a 24-h light photoperiod. Fish density was 29 fish m(-3) at day 133 of the experiment and seven fish m(-3) at day 319. The diets were isoproteic, isolipidic and isoenergetic. Fish were evaluated at 133 and 319 days of experiment in terms of productive performance, liver health, EPA + DHA and lipid retention efficiency, fatty acid metabolism, response to acute stress, and final product quality. The results showed similar productive performance and liver health among the three diets during both sampling periods. No differences were observed in lipid or EPA + DHA retention efficiency in the whole body or fillet. Eicosanoids and receptors for anti-inflammatory mediators derived from EPA and DHA showed similar or higher capacities in fish fed with Can n-3 and AOV than those fed FO. Responses to induced stress, measured through lactate, cortisol, sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, and the liver profile were similar between the three diets. Similarly in fillet quality between the three diets. However, sensory analysis revealed a lower intensity of "global aroma" in Can n-3-fed fish fillets and lower evaluations in "typical salmon aroma", "oily aroma" and "fresh flavor" in AOV-fed fish fillets when they are compared with FO. The nutritional indicators of the final product were similar between the three diets, except for PUFA/SFA, the thrombogenicity index, hypercholesterolemia/hypocholesterolemia, and the health promotion index. In these specific indicators, fish fed with Can n-3 and AOV demonstrated more favorable results for consumer health than the FO-fed fish.

AB  - Morphological identification of planktic crustacean larvae is required in many scientific contexts, such as ecology or taxonomy. Due to a still low availability of genetic sequences for many ingroups of Eumalacostraca, this task is still more feasible by morphological methods. Our understanding of eumalacostracan larval morphology is challenged by phenotypic variability. We investigated four eumalacostracan ingroups: Galatheidae, Hippoidea, Raninidae and Stomatopoda. Representatives of all four groups develop through spine-bearing planktic larval stages. Incorporating dorsal and lateral shield outlines into three-dimensional shape analysis of the shields, we compare specimens from the wild with laboratory-reared specimens. Using graphical and statistical analysis methods, we find that at least the lateral morphology of the shields of Hippoidea and Raninidae seems to be too strongly dependent on phylogeny to show phenotypic variability with our current sample size, but Hippoidea do show phenotypic variability in their dorsal shield morphology. In Galatheidae and Stomatopoda, a clear difference in shield morphology can be found between wild-caught and laboratory-reared specimens. This difference likely represents phenotypic variability. The exact environmental signals causing this phenotypic variability are still unknown, but some candidates are discussed.

AB  - Simple Summary Sheep farming is crucial for preserving biodiversity, maintaining soil and water quality, and supporting local communities. Preserving genetic resources is vital for combating new diseases and tackling environmental changes. This study focuses on the Massese sheep, an indigenous breed which is primarily bred in Tuscany in extensive conditions using natural resources. The examination of their genealogy revealed that the data were incomplete, as a significant number of animals were recorded with one or two parents whose identity was unknown. This made it difficult to accurately evaluate the relationships among animals and to determine the extent of inbreeding. Breeders' associations can play a crucial role in preserving genetic diversity; however, the completeness of the genealogical data needs improving.Abstract This study investigates the genealogical and demographic trends of the Massese sheep breed in Tuscany from 2001 to 2021. The Herd Book kept by the Italian Sheep and Goat Breeders Association (Asso.Na.Pa) provided the data. The descriptive statistics were analyzed using JMP software. The pedigree parameters of a total of 311,056 animals (whole population-WP) were analyzed using CFC, ENDOG, and Pedigree viewer software. A total of 24,586 animals born in the period 2007-2021 represented the Reference Population (RP), and 18,554 animals the Base Population (BP). The demographic results showed an inconsistent trend of offspring registration. This study showed a short period of productivity for both ewes and rams, with means of 1.47 and 19.2 registered newborn ewes and rams, respectively. The genealogical analysis revealed incomplete data, highlighting inaccurate assessments of the relationships among the animals, and inbreeding with large differences among provinces. The average inbreeding coefficient in the WP was 1.16%, and it was 2.26% in the RP. The total number of inbreds was 2790 in the WP, with an average FPED of 13.56%, and 2713 in the RP, with an average FPED of 12.82%. The use of pedigree data is a key and economical approach to calculating inbreeding and relationship coefficients. It is the primary step in genetic management, playing a crucial role in the preservation of a breed. The regular updating of genealogical data is the first step to ensuring the conservation of animal genetic resources, and this study is compromised by the lack of such updates.

AB  - Purpose A study was carried out on composting pistachio hull aided with chemical fertilizer. Recycling of pistachio wastes is one of the major agricultural way in pistachio producing country.
   Method The collected pistachio hull was allowed to decompose either naturally through composting or with the addition of chemical fertilizers. Biological and chemical properties with organic matter were monthly measured in both composting methods. The data was analyzed in a completely randomized design. Mean values were compared using Duncan's multiple range test in SPSS software (p < 0.05).
   Results Increasing chemical fertilizers reduced the microbial density and diversity during the composting, the concentration of the elements in both composting methods increased over time. The EC in both methods decreased over time from 6.95 to 6.17 dSm(-1) in natural composting and 6.95 to 4.85 dSm(-1) in adding of chemical fertilizers. The C: N ratios of the produced compost was found to be lowered in adding of chemical fertilizers during composting compared with those naturally composting treatment.
   Conclusion Addition of chemical compounds to the primary wastes could accelerate and improve the decomposition process and lead to faster composting as well as nutritional enrichment and lower C: N ratios, but it reduced microbial density and changed their diversities.

AB  - The horseshoe bats of the Rhinolophus ferrumequinum group form a well-defined lineage within the Afro-Palaearctic clade of the genus Rhinolophus. The group currently comprises four species widely distributed across the Palaearctic and Afrotropic regions: R. bocharicus (Central Asia), R. clivosus (from northern Africa and the Levant through Arabian Peninsula and eastern Africa to southern Africa), R. ferrumequinum (from western Europe and northern Africa through the Balkans and Middle East to Central Asia and India) and R. nippon (southern and central China, Korea, and Japan). The broad ranges and geographical variations within these species have led to the proposal of numerous subspecies. The phylogenetic relationships and intraspecific variation of the R. ferrumequinum group were investigated using a genetic approach. One mitochondrial marker and five nuclear markers were sequenced and supplemented with available sequences for all four species of the group. Our study revealed five major lineages within the R. ferrumequinum group, resulting in the recognition of four currently known species and identification of a new species. The prior name available for this lineage/species is R. acrotis. The relationships between the lineages varied depending on the chosen marker, leaving the interspecific relations within the ferrumequinum group unresolved. In addition, the results indicated that R. clivosus experienced historic introgression from northern Africa and the Levant, resulting in replacement of its mtDNA by that of R. ferrumequinum. Together, this study introduces a new Rhinolophus species, which increases the number of species in the ferrumequinum group to five.

AB  - The occurrence of indented growth-rings, commonly known as hazel wood, is rare in nature and the biology of its formation has not been studied much. Here, we review the current understanding and update on the issue of indented growth-rings formation in trees. We propose distinguishing between internally induced indented growth-rings, and externally induced ones as the outcome of cambial wounding (following fires, rockfall, various human activities, by insects, mammalian herbivores, and pathogens). Indented growth-rings are known to be endogenously induced by genetically-based imbalances in the hormonal regulation in the cambial zone in Karelian birch, and because of unknown reasons in Cryptomeria japonica. In some Pinus species it can be induced artificially by longitudinal (axial) parallel scratches of the active cambium with sharp razors. Indented growthrings display remarkable aesthetic properties, and also may possess superior acoustic characteristics when used for constructing musical string instruments. Deeper understanding of indented growth-rings' formation mechanisms is needed in order to exploit the possibility of its regular artificial induction by cambial wounding or via tree breeding for potential commercial and scientific purposes.

AB  - Temperature affects many life processes, but its effect might be expected to differ among eukaryotic organisms inhabiting similar environments. We reviewed literature on temperature thresholds of humans, livestock, poultry, agricultural crops, and sparse examples of fisheries. We found that preferable and harmful temperatures are similar for humans, cattle, pigs, poultry, fish, and agricultural crops. Preferable temperatures range from 17 degrees C to 24 degrees C. Stress temperature thresholds are lower when humidity is higher. However, extended exposure to temperatures above 25 degrees C with high humidity can cause heat stress in many organisms. Short exposures to temperatures above 35 degrees C with high humidity, or above 40 degrees C with low humidity, can be lethal. Increases in exposure, frequency, and duration of stressful and lethal temperatures increase the physiological stress and bodily damage suffered by humans, livestock, poultry, fish, and agricultural crops.

AB  - Captive breeding programmes can play an important role in the conservation of species threatened with extinction in the wild. White rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum, have suffered drastic declines due to illegal poaching across their range, and captive populations have the potential to safeguard this species from extinction. However, white rhinoceros birth rates in captivity have been extremely low, and there is substantial variation in breeding success between different institutions. A better understanding of the factors limiting their reproduction in captivity could improve their breeding management and conservation potential. This study used studbook data (n = 467) and comparisons with wild populations in Kenya (n = 236) to assess the breeding performance and viability of the European captive southern white rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum simum, population. Our results show that the European population is declining 2% annually under current demographic parameters. On average, just 10% of females calved annually, in comparison to almost 40% across wild populations. To become self-sustaining, this must increase to a minimum of 17%, though reaching this target may lead to additional management challenges. Further analyses using studbook (n = 134 individuals) and multi-institutional questionnaire data (n = 20 institutions) suggest that modifying the social structure of captive groups could improve female breeding success. Institutions housing larger groups had proportionally greater breeding success, and females were more likely to copulate if housed with another breeding female, and more receptive to bulls if housed in a group with a lower mean age. These findings highlight the importance of considering social conditions in captive breeding programmes, particularly for species with complex social systems and low reproductive rates.

AB  - In this paper, we developed a multiphysics mesoscale model of carbon fiber oxidation in the upper most layer of a phenolic impregnated carbon ablator thermal protection system. The presented model uses the phase-field method to capture the reduction of carbon fibers due to an oxidation reaction between carbon and oxygen to form carbon monoxide. The model is fully coupled with heat transport in the system, including the heat absorbed by the endothermic oxidation reaction. We implemented the model in the new Macaw application, created using the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE). The model was verified against an analytical solution of surface reactions. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the parameters that most impact the oxidation time are those related to the reaction rate. The model was demonstrated using 2D and 3D simulations of the oxidation of multiple fibers, illustrating the impact of fiber diameter, temperature, and gas flow on the fiber oxidation.

AB  - Human impacts on the environment and wildlife populations are increasing globally, threatening thousands of species with extinction. While wildlife-based tourism is beneficial for educating tourists, generating income for conservation efforts, and providing local employment, more information is needed to understand how this industry may impact wildlife. In this study, we used motion-activated cameras at 12 waterholes on a private game reserve in northern Namibia to determine if the presence of humans and permanent infrastructure affected mammal visits by examining their (1) number of visits, (2) time spent, and (3) diel activity patterns. Our results revealed no differences in the number of visits based on human presence for any of the 17 mammal species studied. However, giraffes (Giraffe camelopardalis) spent more time at waterholes before observer presence compared to during. Additionally, several species changed diel activity patterns when human observers were present. Notably, several carnivore and ungulate species increased overlap in their activity patterns during periods while humans were present relative to when humans were absent. These modifications of mammal temporal activity patterns due to human presence could eventually lead to changes in community structure and trophic dynamics because of altered predator-prey interactions. As humans continue to expand into wildlife habitats, and wildlife-based tourism increases globally, it is imperative that we fully understand the effects of anthropogenic pressures on mammal behavior. Monitoring of wildlife behavioral changes in response to human activity is crucial to further develop wildlife tourism opportunities in a way that optimizes the impact of conservation goals.

AB  - Membrane filtration technologies are the best available tools to manage dairy byproducts such as cheese whey, allowing for the selective concentration of its specific components, namely proteins. Their acceptable costs and ease of operation make them suitable for application by small/medium-scale dairy plants. The aim of this work is the development of new synbiotic kefir products based on sheep and goat liquid whey concentrates (LWC) obtained by ultrafiltration. Four formulations for each LWC based on a commercial kefir starter or traditional kefir, without or with the addition of a probiotic culture, were produced. The physicochemical, microbiological, and sensory properties of the samples were determined. Membrane process parameters indicated that ultrafiltration can be applied for obtaining LWCs in small/medium scale dairy plants with high protein concentration (16.4% for sheep and 7.8% for goats). Sheep kefirs showed a solid-like texture while goat kefirs were liquid. All samples presented counts of lactic acid bacteria higher than log 7 CFU/mL, indicating the good adaptation of microorganisms to the matrixes. Further work must be undertaken in order to improve the acceptability of the products. It could be concluded that small/medium-scale dairy plants can use ultrafiltration equipment to valorize sheep's and goat's cheese whey-producing synbiotic kefirs.

AB  - Local adaptations of host plants to climatic conditions along an elevation gradient can affect insect-plant interactions. Using local accessions sampled from different elevations within South America, plant defense responses and herbivore growth were evaluated on two host plants: a) cherry tomato, Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme, and b) wild tomato, Solanum pimpinellifolium. The elevational origin of the accessions ranged from 100 to 3000 m above sea level. We hypothesized a higher level of defensive compounds in plants originating from lower elevations and, consequently, stronger resistance to insect herbivory. Interestingly, plant resistance to insect herbivory, as demonstrated by a reduction in Helicoverpa zea growth, was stronger for middle and high-elevation accessions. Total phenolic content increased with elevation in both herbivore-damaged and undamaged leaves, augmenting plant resistance. However, an elevational gradient was not evident for plant defensive proteins (polyphenol oxidase and trypsin protease inhibitors) or the density of leaf trichomes. Tradeoffs between constitutive and induced defenses were evident in both tomato genotypes. Future studies should test the role of plasticity in plant defense systems in restricting or facilitating range expansion of insect herbivores with climate change.

AB  - To explore the influence of state changes on brucellosis, a stochastic brucellosis model with semi-Markovian switchings and diffusion is proposed in this paper. When there is no switching, we introduce a critical value R-s and obtain the exponential stability in mean square when R-s<1 by using the stochastic Lyapunov function method. Sudden climate changes can drive changes in transmission rate of brucellosis, which can be modelled by a semi-Markov process. We study the influence of stationary distribution of semi-Markov process on extinction of brucellosis in switching environment including both stable states, during which brucellosis dies out, and unstable states, during which brucellosis persists. The results show that increasing the frequencies and average dwell times in stable states to certain extent can ensure the extinction of brucellosis. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the analytical results. We also suggest that herdsmen should reduce the densities of animal habitation to decrease the contact rate, increase slaughter rate of animals and apply disinfection measures to kill brucella.

AB  - Purpose Sheep manure-derived biochar (SMB) is applied to enhance soil productivity, but its impacts on soil phosphorus (P) species distribution have not been thoroughly investigated. This research aimed to explore the effects of SMB amended soil on phosphatase activities, nutrients, P species distribution, and the underlying mechanisms in agricultural soil.
   Materials and methods The soils (collected from rice and tea cultivation) were incubated for a period of 92 days receiving different rates of biochars 0% (CK), 2% (T-1) and 4% (T-2) respectively. The SMB was manufactured at 500 degrees C, and P species were tested via P-31 NMR spectroscopy. Acid phosphomonoesterase (ACP) activities, CEC, NH4+-N, pH, NO3--N, Olsen- P and alkaline phosphomonoesterase (ALP) were determined.
   Results and discussion The findings suggested that the SMB addition enhanced the pH, NO3--N, Olsen- P, CEC, NH4+-N contents in both paddy and tea soils. Furthermore, compared with CK (control), application of SMB at T-2 reduced the ACP activities by 85.9 and 74.8%, but promoted the ALP activities by 89.1 and 70.6% for paddy and tea soils, respectively. The findings showed that major forms of P were orthophosphate and orthophosphate monoesters.
   Conclusions The SMB application increased soil inorganic P, P availability and ALP activities as a result of increasing of P availability by decomposition of organic P. Our research showed that the SMB application is an alternative nutrient for plants instead of chemical fertilizers. Nevertheless, care should be taken with the long-term SMB application, consequently excessive nutrient utilization has the potential to induce eutrophication in aquatic environments.

AB  - Climate change is advancing the onset of phenological events, with the rate of advance varying among species and trophic levels. In addition, local populations of the same species may show genetic differences in their response to seasonal cues. If populations of interacting species differ in their response, then climate change may result in geographically varying shifts in the community-level distribution of interaction strength. We explored the magnitude of trophic- and species-level responses to temperature in a tritrophic system comprising pedunculate oak, insect herbivores, and their associated parasitoids. We sampled local realizations of this community at five sites along a transect spanning fifteen degrees of latitude. Samples from each trophic level at each site were exposed to the same set of five climatic regimes during overwintering in climate chambers. We then recorded the number of days and degree-days required for oak acorns to develop and insects to emerge. In terms of dates of events, phenology differed among populations. In terms of degree-days, we found that for two species pairs, the heat sum required to develop in spring differed by an additional similar to 500 degree-days between trophic levels when overwintering at the highest temperature. For three species, within-population variation in the number of degree-days required for emergence was higher at warmer temperatures. Our findings suggest that changing temperatures can modify interactions within a community by altering the relative phenology of interacting species and that some interactions are more vulnerable than others to a shift in temperature. The geographic variation in the phenological response of a species suggests that there is a genetic component in determining the phenology of local populations. Such local variation blended with interspecific differences in responses makes it complex to understand how communities will respond to warmer temperatures.

AB  - Understanding the protein composition of the follicular fluid from brown brocket deer would aid the development of a medium for in vitro embryo production, which would in turn contribute toward programs for species preservation. Proteomic shotgun is a sensitive tool for analysis of complex protein mixtures. Thus, this study aimed to use shotgun technique to investigate the proteome of fluid from small/medium and large follicles from brocket brown deer. The fluid was obtained by laparoscopy-guided follicular puncture from five females. Quantitative proteomic analysis was performed by multidimensional liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. A total of 226 proteins were identified in the follicular fluid, 53 and 60 of which were found only in small/medium and large follicles, respectively. One hundred and thirteen proteins were common to both groups of follicles. Quantitative analysis showed no significant differences (P > 0.05) in protein abundances in the follicular fluid from small/medium and large follicles. The proteins identified were classified by gene ontology terms, in silico interaction and assigned to 12 pathways indicated that proteins are involved in protein binding, catalytic activity, regulation of biological processes, extracellular matrix organization, and complement and coagulation cascades. In conclusion, these data add knowledge on the follicular development and provide original information on the follicular environment, which can contribute in the future to formulation of culture medium to use in embryo technology in brown brocket deer.

AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDF) are one of the most threatened and poorly protected ecosystems in the Americas. Although there are international efforts for the restoration of TDF, how stress factors such as herbivory or water limitation due to changes in precipitation, impact the regeneration dynamics of these forests is poorly understood. Specifically, how seedlings of key tree species for TDF restoration cope with current abiotic pressures such as the intensification of climatic events, and biotic factors like herbivory, is not yet fully understood. Here, we compared seedling performance, and allocation of biomass, and water to roots vs. shoots for three legume, and one non-legume TDF tree species, as a response to water limitation and herbivory in an 8-month greenhouse experiment. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the non-legume species, G. ulmifolia, had the best performance compared to legumes, while N-fixing and non-fixing legumes showed similar performance. Based on our findings, we suggest the use of G. ulmifolia in TDF restoration projects due to its high performance despite abiotic and biotic stress factors, its allocation of biomass and water to belowground structures. We also recommend the use of N-fixing legume species owing to their ability to fix nitrogen, which guarantees an N input to the soil, important in the first stages of succession. However, the legume species used in this experiment do not appear to resist the abiotic and biotic stressors studied. Thus, more studies exploring the response of dry forest plant species to stress factors are key for informing and assuring more effective TDF restoration efforts.

AB  - Gestation and lactation have high energetic requirements. Up to three-fourths of the gestation period in moose (Alces alces) overlaps with the food-scarce period in winter. During this period, moose deal with the limited forage resources available through hypometabolism with decreased heart rate and body temperature (Tb). Body temperature is also an indicator of oestrus, pregnancy and parturition, which is well documented in several domestic species. In this study, we sought to determine if moose displayed a similar Tb pattern during pregnancy and parturition to domesticated ruminants, and if we could detect parturition by combining Tb and activity data. We studied the Tb pattern of 30 free-ranging adult female moose (>= 1.5 years old), equipped with ruminal temperature loggers and GPS collars. We documented a 0.13-0.19 degrees C higher Tb in pregnant compared to non-pregnant moose, depending on the study area with the Tb difference increasing along a south-north gradient, and a drop in Tb and in activity when parturition was imminent. Detection of parturition was highly successful when combining Tb and activity data with an accuracy of 91.5%. Our findings demonstrate that Tb responses to pregnancy and parturition in a wild capital-breeding ruminant are similar to those of domesticated ruminants.

AB  - Sensory integration theory predicts natural selection should favour adaptive responses of animals to multiple forms of information, yet empirical tests of this prediction are rare, particularly in free-living mammals. Studying indirect predator cues offers a salient opportunity to inquire about multimodal risk assessment and its potentially interactive effects on prey responses. Here we exposed California ground squirrels from two study sites (that differ in human and domestic dog activity) to acoustic and/or olfactory predator cues to reveal divergent patterns of signal dominance. Olfactory information most strongly predicted space use within the testing arena. That is, individuals, especially those at the human-impacted site, avoided coyote urine, a danger cue that may communicate the proximity of a coyote. By contrast, subjects allocated less time to risk-sensitive behaviours when exposed to acoustic cues. Specifically, although individuals were consistent in their behavioural responses across trials, 'quiet coyotes' (urine without calls) significantly increased the behavioural reactivity of prey, likely because coyotes rarely vocalize when hunting. More broadly, our findings highlight the need to consider the evolution of integrated fear responses and contribute to an emerging understanding of how animals integrate multiple forms of information to trade off between danger and safety cues in a changing world.

AB  - A survey was carried out on ethnoveterinary practices used by Fulani agropastoralists for maintaining the health and treating of livestock diseases in Ido agrarian community of Oyo State, Nigeria. Information was collected from fifty cattle herders using interview method with the help of Hausa interpreter and with the aid of questionnaires. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (cross tabulations) to generate frequencies and percentages. Plants used for various ethnoveterinary and ethnomedicinal purposes were revealed. Information on the type of animals kept and management practices used by the respondents show that 48% kept cattle, goat and sheep. 14% kept cattle and goat, 36% kept cattle and sheep, while 2% kept cattle only. All the respondents agreed to stomach and intestinal worms as the prevalent ruminant diseases in the area. However, 86% of respondents reported seasonal appearance of worm infestations during wet season, while 14% both seasons. Higher percentage of respondents (80%) adopted the use of traditional medicine and conventional drugs in treating animals. 88% showcased the effectiveness of such combination of traditional and conventional drugs as being very effective. 20% of the respondents used the whole plant in formulating herbal preparations. Urbanization, seasonal variations and unquantifiable dosage have been highlighted as challenges encountered in the use of ethnoveterinary medicine in Ido agrarian community. 12% used decoction method of preparation, 50% used infusion, while 30% mixed plant with non-plant to formulate herbal preparations in solving the problem of helminthiasis and other diseases. The respondents who used local remedies claimed the knowledge of ethnoveterinary was passed from the parents to the children, and this keeps going from generation to generation. The results obtained from this study show that the awareness and the availability of ethnoveterinary plants among Fulani agropastoralists in Ido agrarian community of Oyo state is high, and this is responsible for the high patronage and usage of ethnoveterinary plants in this community. Intestinal worm infestations are the prevalent livestock disease encountered by the Fulani agropastoralists in the study area.

AB  - Fifteen years have elapsed since the arrival of the invasive snake Hemorrhois hippocrepis to the island of Ibiza (Balearic Islands, Spain). In that time, the only endemic vertebrate, the Ibiza Wall Lizard (Podarcis pityusensis), has disappeared across half of the island, a subspecies restricted to an offshore islet has vanished, and its extinction in its native range is likely to happen in the next several years if managers do not implement conservation measures with alacrity and decisiveness. In light of these findings, our re-assessment of the IUCN extinction risk category for this lizard shows that its risk status has increased by two levels since its last assessment in 2008, from Near Threatened to Endangered. We also classify this snake as producing a Massive (MA) impact under the Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa. Lastly, we suggest six management measures to prevent the extinction of the majority of genetic and taxonomic diversity of this lizard on Ibiza, Formentera, and the numerous surrounding islets.

AB  - Four composting experiments were adopted to evaluate the effect of inoculating mature compost on the harmless treatment of avermectin fermentation residue (AFR): added 100% spent mushroom substrate (SMS) and no AFR in CK, 15% AFR and 85% SMS in T1, 30% AFR and 70% SMS in T2, 30% AFR, 60% SMS and 10% mature compost in T3. Results showed that, compared with that of T2, the thermophilic stage in T3 arrived 12 days earlier and extended by 5 days, the GI reached above 90% 6 days earlier, and the changes of pH, EC, nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen and C/N ratio were all correspondingly advanced. The number of total OTUs and unique OTUs were increased, the dominant microbial populations and the biodegradation of avermectin were improved. Inoculating mature compost also had a significant impact on the expression of antibiotic resistance genes, as it significantly improved the bacterial community of compost. The addition of AFR was increased from 15 to 30% without delaying the composting process, which was conducive to the harmless treatment of AFR, and was of great significance to the cleaner production of avermectin factories.

AB  - Simple Summary Selective culling of female deer is effective in reducing overabundant sika deer (Cervus nippon) populations. Sodium (Na), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) can act as an attractant to selectively cull female sika deer due to the differences in mineral requirements. Here, using global plant trait data and a published list of sika deer feed plants in Japan, we estimated whether feed plants provide sika deer sufficient Na, Ca and Mg, and compared the results between males and females. Our analysis showed that sufficient Na and Ca were not always provided, especially when intakes were low and deer were large. Na deficiency was more intense for lactating females than males, whereas Ca deficiency was more intense for males. We suggest that Na and Ca could be useful for developing effective culling methods. Especially, Na could be useful for selective culling of female sika deer during the lactating period. Deficient minerals in overabundant populations could act as an attractant to cull sika deer (Cervus nippon). Because selective culling of female deer is reported to be effective in reducing sika deer populations, it is particularly important to clarify the differences in mineral requirements between males and females. Here, using global plant trait data and a published list of sika deer feed plants in Japan, we estimated whether feed plants provide sika deer sufficient sodium (Na), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), and compared the results between males and females. An analysis of 191 feed plant species suggested that feed plants can provide sufficient Mg, whereas sufficient Na and Ca is not always provided, especially when the intake is small or the deer large. Na deficiency was more intense for lactating females than males, suggesting that Na can be an effective attractant for selectively culling female deer. In summary, this study demonstrated that sika deer in Japan might require extra Na and Ca sources in addition to feed plants, and therefore these minerals could be useful for developing effective culling methods.

AB  - The intensely rich flora of lowland tropical rain forests includes rare species that represent a significant portion of the overall diversity. In the Pasoh Forest Reserve, Malaysia, Timonius is represented by two sympatric species: T. wallichianus, and a new species described and illustrated here. The new species T. pasohensis is rare and so far known only from this reserve. The population characteristics of the new species and the commoner and more widespread T. wallichianus were compared in the 50-ha plot. The distribution of both species overlapped in several habitat types. The torus translation test indicated that T. pasohensis is positively associated with swamps and slopes, whereas T. wallichianus prefers alluvium. However, other factors such as competition, fecundity, susceptibility to droughts, and herbivory, may also be important in influencing the distribution of the two species. They have a similar population structure but are distinctly different in other aspects. From 1986 to 2015, the abundance of T. pasohensis has greatly declined to less than half its original population, and saplings and trees < 10 cm diameter at breast height appear to be the most affected. In contrast, the population size of T. wallichianus has remained relatively stable during the same period, possibly owing to the abundance of suitable habitat type and higher seed set.

AB  - Animal husbandry is an important emission source of greenhouse gas. In order to discover the real situation of carbon emission in China's animal husbandry scientifically, the paper measured and calculated carbon emission in China's animal husbandry from 1997 to 2017 on the basis of soil and water resources. In addition, analyzing its time-order characters, structural characters, driving factors and decoupling relationships are all done in this treatise. Major findings are as follows: (1) The carbon emission of China's animal husbandry in 2017 was 374.3528 million tons, an increase of 17.8066 million tons over 1997, with the average annual growth rate of 0.24% and the average annual carbon emission of 398.7817 million tons; (2) There was a decreasing trend in carbon emission of intestinal fermentation in China's animal husbandry while there was an increasing trend in carbon emission of manure emission in China's animal husbandry; (3) The carbon emission of China's animal husbandry peaked in 2006 and went through three phases of up-down-steady between 1997 and 2017; (4) The contribution of cattle, pig, sheep, other large livestock, poultry and rabbits to China's animal husbandry carbon emissions decreased in turn, and the average contribution of cattle, pigs and sheep to China's animal husbandry carbon emissions was as high as 98.15%. (5) Five factors reducing carbon emission of China's animal husbandry were carbon intensity, agricultural industrial structure, agricultural population-water resources matching degree, agricultural water-soil resources and per capita cultivated land area. Two factors increasing carbon emission of China's animal husbandry were population and economic benefits of agriculture per unit agricultural population; (6) There was a generally weak decoupling between carbon emission in China's animal husbandry and animal husbandry's economic growth from 1997 to 2017.

AB  - The ability to fix nitrogen may confer a competitive advantage or disadvantage to symbiotic nitrogen-fixing plants depending on the availability of soil nitrogen and energy to fuel fixation. Understanding these costs and benefits of nitrogen fixation is critical to predicting ecosystem dynamics and nutrient cycling. We grew inoculated (with symbiotic bacteria) and uninoculated seedlings of Pentaclethra macroloba (a nitrogen-fixing tree species) both in isolation and with Virola koschnyi (a nonfixing species) under gradients of light and soil nitrogen to assess how the ability to fix nitrogen and fixation activity affect growth, biomass allocation, and responses to neighboring plants. Inoculation itself did not provide a growth advantage to nitrogen fixers, regardless of nitrogen limitation status. Higher nitrogen fixation rates increased biomass growth similarly for nitrogen-limited and nitrogen-saturated fixers. Nodule production was offset by reduced fine-root biomass for inoculated nitrogen fixers, resulting in no change in total belowground allocation associated with nitrogen fixation. Under nitrogen-limited conditions, inoculated nitrogen fixers partially downregulated fixation in the presence of a nonfixing neighbor. These results suggest that nitrogen fixation can provide a growth advantage, even under nitrogen-saturated conditions, and that nitrogen fixers may reduce fixation rates to minimize facilitation of neighbors.

AB  - Hipposideros pratti called at higher intensities while keeping the constant frequencies of their echolocation pulses consistent under spectrally non-overlapping background noise conditions. The noise could decrease auditory sensitivity and sharp intensity tuning, suggesting an acoustic masking effect. These results provide further evidence of negative consequences of anthropogenic noise.
   The environment noise may disturb animal behavior and echolocation via three potential mechanisms: acoustic masking, reduced attention and noise avoidance. Compared with the mechanisms of reduced attention and noise avoidance, acoustic masking is thought to occur only when the signal and background noise overlap spectrally and temporally. In this study, we investigated the effects of spectrally non-overlapping noise on echolocation pulses and electrophysiological responses of a constant frequency-frequency modulation (CF-FM) bat, Hipposideros pratti. We found that H. pratti called at higher intensities while keeping the CFs of their echolocation pulses consistent. Electrophysiological tests indicated that the noise could decrease auditory sensitivity and sharp intensity tuning, suggesting that spectrally non-overlapping noise imparts an acoustic masking effect. Because anthropogenic noises are usually concentrated at low frequencies and are spectrally non-overlapping with the bat's echolocation pulses, our results provide further evidence of negative consequences of anthropogenic noise. On this basis, we sound a warning against noise in the foraging habitats of echolocating bats.

AB  - Invasions by insects that become pests are an increasing problem for agriculture. Introductions of parasitoids from the regions of pest origin and breeding plants resistant to invasive pests can reduce the abundances and impacts of pests, while providing safe, sustainable alternatives to insecticides. However, impacts of parasitoids and plant resistance are likely to interact, and the abiotic environment, and in particular, climate change is likely to affect these interactions. Here I report results from simulations with mathematical models of population dynamics of aphids and parasitoids on resistant versus susceptible plants, parameterized with published results, designed to test the following hypotheses: (1) parasitoids can reduce abundances and frequencies of virulent aphids able to overcome plant resistance, (2) temperature regime affects the impacts of parasitoids on virulent aphids, and (3) the outcomes of these interactions vary with crop. Two systems were modeled: the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, on soybean, and the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noeia, on wheat. The parasitoids in the models are in the genus Aphelinus, species of which have a long association with biological control of invasive pests. In the simulations with these models, parasitoids reduced the abundances, and on wheat, the percent of virulent aphids. The impacts of parasitoids on virulent aphids were greater in southern locations than in northern locations, and the impacts on virulent aphids were greater on wheat than on soybean. Indeed, parasitoids actually increased the frequencies of virulent aphids on soybean when only susceptible plants were present, while reducing the abundance of all aphids. If one accepts that comparisons of population dynamics in southern versus northern locations indicate the likely affects of climate change in the northern locations, these results suggest that climate change would lead to decreased abundance and frequency of virulent aphids in northern locations.

AB  - Increasing plant diversity in agroecosystems is often proposed as a way to reduce arthropod pest pressure and support natural enemy populations to reduce reliance on traditional chemical controls. Over 2 field seasons, we examined the effects of interplanting cantaloupe (Cucumis melo L. var. cantalupensis) with alsike clover (Trifolium hybridum L.) and Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus L.) on arthropod populations, cantaloupe yield, and fruit quality. Arthropod sampling through visual counts, sticky cards, and pitfall traps focused on herbivores and natural enemies across feeding guilds, with more specialized pests in the cucurbit system being identified to lower taxonomic levels. Living mulches might have delayed initial crop colonization by striped cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum F.) but had limited impact on beetle counts, which remained similarly low throughout the study across treatments. Aphid populations were lowest in wildrye interplanted plots, suggesting species-specific impacts on pest suppression. Beneficial arthropods, such as spiders, piercing predators, and parasitoids, were often more abundant in clover than in wildrye or monoculture plots, especially early in the season. However, cantaloupe yield was highest in monoculture plots, where fruit showed increased weight, size, and favorable color metrics compared to those from living mulch plots. These results indicate that while living mulches can support beneficial arthropods and possibly reduce early pest pressure, they may also introduce trade-offs in yield and quality. Future studies should explore adjustments to living mulch management in cantaloupe, such as reduced density or narrower planting strips, to optimize pest suppression benefits while limiting competition with the cash crop.

AB  - Desert organisms have evolved physiological, biochemical and genomic mechanisms to survive the extreme aridity of desert environments. Studying desert-adapted species provides a unique opportunity to investigate the survival strategies employed by organisms in some of the harshest habitats on Earth. Two of the primary challenges faced in desert environments are maintaining water balance and thermoregulation. We collected data in a simulated desert environment and a captive colony of cactus mice (Peromyscus eremicus) and used lab-based experiments with real time physiological measurements; energy expenditure, water loss rate and respiratory exchange rate, to characterize the response to water deprivation. Mice without access to water had significantly lower energy expenditures and in turn, reduced water loss compared to mice with access to water after the first 24 h of the experiment. Additionally, we observed significant mass loss that is probably due to dehydration-associated anorexia a response to limit fluid loss by reducing waste and the solute load as well as allowing water reabsorption from the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Finally, we observed body temperature correlated with sex, with males without access to water maintaining body temperature when compared with hydrated males, whereas body temperature decreased for females without access to water, suggesting daily metabolic depression in females.

AB  - Wheat (Triticum aestivium L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) are two commonly grown cereal crops in the northern Great Plains. Adding other crops such as field pea (Pisum Sativum L.), canola (Brassica napus L.), or camelina (Camelina sativa L.) to wheat or barley cropping systems may improve soil quality. However, little is known about the effects of including oilseeds in small grain cropping systems on soil physical properties. We sampled an 8-year dryland study with 10 different cropping systems including continuous spring wheat, continuous winter wheat, continuous barley, pea-spring wheat, pea-barley, pea-winter wheat, pea-barley-camelina-spring wheat, pea-barley-canola-spring wheat, pea-winter wheat-camelina-spring wheat and pea-winter wheat-canola-spring wheat. We measured dry aggregate stability, wet aggregate stability, water retention, hydraulic conductivity, bulk density and total carbon. Continuous barley and winter wheat had a higher fraction of large dry soil aggregates, whereas the pea-barley-canola-spring wheat and pea-spring wheat cropping systems had a higher fraction of small aggregates in the 0-15 cm depth. However, wet aggregate stability, water retention, bulk density, hydraulic conductivity and soil carbon concentration were not affected by the cropping system in the 0-15 cm depth. Diversifying small grain cropping systems by adding canola or camelina oil seeds and peas generally did not affect soil physical properties at this location.

AB  - Tedera is a valuable high-quality forage for sheep during summer-autumn. There is evidence that prior grazing experience of novel forages influences preference and haymaking of tedera improves preference by goats. In the first experiment, it was hypothesised that the voluntary feed intake (VFI) of fresh leaves and stems of tedera by sheep would be greater for experienced vs. naive sheep. In the second experiment, it was hypothesised that the VFI of naive sheep fed wilted leaves and stems of tedera would be greater than fresh leaves and stems of tedera. To test these hypotheses, adult Merino sheep were fed seven accessions of tedera, in two outdoor pen feeding experiments conducted consecutively. Each of six pens had 14 feeders, two for each accession, and two sheep. In experiment 1, three pens had sheep that had previously grazed tedera (experienced) and three pens had sheep with no experience (naive), and all were fed fresh leaves and stems of the seven tedera accessions. Experiment 2 involved only naive sheep, with three pens fed fresh leaves and stems and three pens fed wilted leaves and stems of the seven tedera accessions. Preference was measured each day for six days in experiment 1; and for five days in experiment 2 by calculating the average differences of feed offered and feed remaining from the feeders. In experiment 1, experienced sheep showed no difference in preference (average percentage eaten) in the first hour of each day compared to naive sheep (70% vs. 56% DM intake (kg), p = 0.27). There was an increase in the amount eaten from the first to the last day for both groups, except for the intake of one accession that was reduced for the experienced sheep. In experiment 2, there was no statistical difference in preference between accessions. However, when the average percentage eaten by the experienced and naive groups are combined, they are strongly correlated, with significant differences between accessions. Sheep did not eat more wilted tedera compared to fresh, which did not support our hypothesis. The only differences we found in sheep preference for tedera accessions occurred in experiment 1. Further studies to investigate seasonal differences in sheep preference between accessions is required and increased replication is needed to better determine the effect of prior grazing experience on the preference for tedera accessions.

AB  - Globally, wildlife populations are becoming increasingly small and isolated. Both processes contribute to an elevated risk of extinction, notably due to genetic factors related to inbreeding depression and a loss of adaptive potential. Wildlife translocation is a valuable conservation tool to reintroduce species to previously occupied areas, or augment existing populations with genetically divergent animals, thereby improving the viability of endangered populations. However, understanding the genetic implications of mixing gene pools is key to avoid the risk of outbreeding depression, and to maximise translocation effectiveness. In this study we used mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA collected from 110 black rhinoceroses (Diceros bicornis minor) in Kruger National Park, South Africa, to determine levels of genetic diversity, inbreeding and relatedness. We compared this diversity with the two source populations (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and Zambezi River, Zimbabwe) using data from previously published studies, and assessed changes in the relative contribution of source lineages since their reintroduction in the 1970s. Our results show that Kruger's black rhinoceroses are genetically more diverse than those from KwaZulu-Natal, with levels closer to those from the Zambezi Valley. Furthermore, our findings indicate a relative increase in the Zimbabwean lineage since reintroduction, suggesting a possible selective advantage. From a conservation perspective, our results demonstrate the benefits of mixing multiple source populations to restore gene flow, improve genetic diversity and thereby help protect small, isolated populations from extinction.

AB  - The health effects associated with chronic low-dose, low-dose rate (LD-LDR) exposures to environmental radiation are uncertain. All dose-effect studies conducted outside controlled laboratory conditions are challenged by inherent complexities of ecological systems and difficulties quantifying dose to free-ranging organisms in natural environments. Consequently, the effects of chronic LD-LDR radiation exposures on wildlife health remain poorly understood and much debated. Here, samples from wild boar (Sus scrofa leucomystax) and rat snakes (Elaphe spp.) were collected between 2016 and 2018 across a gradient of radiation exposures in Fukushima, Japan. In vivo biomarkers of DNA damage and stress were evaluated as a function of multiple measurements of radiation dose. Specifically, we assessed frequencies of dicentric chromosomes (Telomere-Centromere Fluorescence in situ Hybridization: TC-FISH), telomere length (Telo-FISH, qPCR), and cortisol hormone levels (Enzyme Immunoassay: EIA) in wild boar, and telomere length (qPCR) in snakes. These biological parameters were then correlated to robust calculations of radiation dose rate at the time of capture and plausible upper bound lifetime dose, both of which incorporated internal and external dose. No significant relationships were observed between dicentric chromosome frequencies or telomere length and dose rate at capture or lifetime dose (p value range: 0.20-0.97). Radiation exposure significantly associated only with cortisol, where lower concentrations were associated with higher dose rates (r(2) = 0.58; p < 0.0001), a relationship that was likely due to other (unmeasured) factors. Our results suggest that wild boar and snakes chronically exposed to LD-LDR radiation sufficient to prohibit human occupancy were not experiencing significant adverse health effects as assessed by biomarkers of DNA damage and stress.

AB  - Eutrophicated inland water bodies are noticed to be one of the contributing factors to greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. Direct discharge of untreated or partially treated water is a major concern. Microalgae-based technology and management are regarded as one of the potential nature-based approaches to combat eutrophication. In turn, the microalgae facilitate the recovery of GHGs contributing compounds in the form of organic biomass. The recovered algal biomass can be harnessed for the production of biofuels and other bio-products, like biofertilizer, using anaerobic digestion. By virtue, cir-cular bio-economy can be achieved alongside mitigating GHGs emissions. Before implementing, it is vital to thoroughly explore the links between the process and potential alternatives for wastewater treatment, waste valorization, biofuel pro-duction, and land usage. Thus, the present review discusses the impact of eutrophication on ecology and environment, cur-rent technologies for mitigating eutrophication and GHGs, and energy recovery through the anaerobic digestion of algal biomass. Further, the processes at the intercept of wastewater treatment and biogas production were reviewed to leverage the potential of anaerobic digestion for making a circular bioeconomy framework.

AB  - Declining recruitment in elk (Cervus canadensis) populations is a common issue faced by managers in western North America. To better understand a decline in calf:female (>= 1 yr) ratios in northern New Mexico, USA, we investigated the influence of bottom-up factors on the condition and productivity of 1,885 adult (>= 2 yr), female Rocky Mountain elk (C. c. nelsoni) harvested on the Vermejo Park Ranch during December and January, 2009-2016. We used ingesta-free body fat (IFBF) estimated from kidney fat mass as a measure of condition. Based on maximum likelihood model selection, age, harvest date, hunt zone, pregnancy status, lactation status (as determined in Dec-Jan), June-August precipitation, and December-March mean temperature were important variables for predicting IFBF and field-dressed mass (FDM). Age, IFBF, FDM, harvest date, and June-August precipitation were important variables for predicting conception date, pregnancy rate, and lactation rate. Pregnancy status and lactation status were also important for predicting lactation rate and pregnancy rate, respectively. Older females (>= 12 yr) had progressively lower IFBF and FDM and later conception dates than prime females (3-11 yr) and their pregnancy rates declined an average of approximately 9%/year after age 11. The probability of pregnancy in prime females generally exceeded 0.95 when IFBF was >= 12% and FDM was >= 155 kg in late December and early January. Lactating females had lower IFBF, FDM, pregnancy rates, and later conception dates than nonlactating females. The mean IFBF of females harvested on 1 December was generally 2.3-2.7 percentage points higher than values of females harvested on 31 January within age and lactation categories. There was strong evidence that greater IFBF and FDM, higher pregnancy rates, and earlier conception dates in nonlactating females and all adult females were related to increased June-August precipitation (P < 0.01) during the conception year, but, with the exception of conception date, there was little evidence in lactating females. Greater conception year June-August precipitation (P = 0.04) and greater mean annual IFBF of nonlactating females (P < 0.01), but not conception year IFBF of lactating females (P = 0.94), were related to higher subsequent September calf:female ratios. There was also strong evidence that earlier mean conception dates and higher pregnancy rates of adult females (P < 0.01) were related to higher calf:female ratios. The only birth year variables at least moderately related to higher calf:female ratios were lower mean IFBF (P = 0.03) and FDM (P = 0.02) of adult females that likely reflected negative lactation effects. Based on our bivariate models, September calves/100 females increased 10.7 calves per 0.1 increase in the annual adult pregnancy rate and 10.9 calves per 10-cm increase in June-August precipitation during the conception year. Our results indicated that bottom-up factors related to summer precipitation the previous year and age structure of the adult female population had meaningful effects on September calf:female ratios at Vermejo during our study. We found strong evidence of a nexus among summer precipitation, IFBF, conception dates, pregnancy rates, and following year calf:female ratios in nonlactating females but not in lactating females even though probability of pregnancy was primarily determined by IFBF irrespective of lactation status.

AB  - Camellia harbors unique diversity along Sino-Vietnamese border. Some species of them are under threat due to human activity. Camellia hekouensis, a native of Hekou, Yunnan, China, was once considered extinct as the previously known "last living tree" died in 2024. Fortunately, 11 in-situ and 32 ex-situ trees have been protected and propagated by the staff of Hekou Administration Branch of Dawei Mountain National Nature Reserve in Yunnan with their great unpublicized efforts. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that C. hekouensis is nested in the main clade CI of Camellia and forms a clade with C. corallina, C. gracilipes and C. pubicosta, which are generally distributed in Vietnam. Morphological characters of the capsule and seed of C. hekouensis are supplementally described. The leaves of C. hekouensis contain 1.18 mg/g theobromine, which disagrees with the previous chemotaxonomic claim. Though the economic and ecological values are little known for C. hekouensis, the species should be conserved and propagated effectively and promptly to prevent extinction.

AB  - The Antarctic is particularly sensitive to mercury (Hg) pollution and even low levels of Hg may cause significant damage in this fragile environment. The aim of this study was to investigate routes of mercury and methyl-mercury (MeHg) elimination by animals inhabiting the maritime Antarctic. The results showed that organisms at the highest trophic level (elephant seal) have the highest concentrations of THg and MeHg in both excrement and fur samples. Interspecies differences in mercury levels were observed in materials sourced from penguins of the genus Pysgocelis. 13C and 15N values confirmed differences in the diets and foraging areas, which may affect Hg concentration in the tissues we analyzed. Time variations in THg and MeHg concentrations were observed in the excrement of the penguin species, which may be due to periods of fasting and intense feeding closely related to egg laying and moulting stages.

AB  - Mandibles of 2161 juvenile roe deer (8-10 months; 1176 females and 985 males) were studied to check for dental anomalies. The sample was legally shot during the annual harvest (1st January-15th March) of the hunting seasons 2013-2015 in the Arezzo province (Central Italy). The frequency of anomalies was 0.32% (n = 7), confirming that anomalies are uncommon in roe deer dentition. All individuals had only one type of dental anomaly. The teeth of the incisor arcade seldom showed anomalies (10%) in comparison to premolars (20%) and molars (70%). In more than half of juveniles with anomalies, the length of the posterior section of the mandible was shorter than the population average (from - 8 to - 20%), unlike the length of the medio-anterior section. Some dental anomalies seem to affect the growth of the posterior section of the mandible, which occurs mostly during the first year of life, rather than the growth of the medio-anterior section, which occurs mostly in utero. Due to the complex relationship between mandible growth and dental anomalies and their low frequency, further data are needed to deepen the possible influence of anomalies on growth pattern.

AB  - Silicon (Si) accumulation alleviates a diverse array of environmental stresses in many plants, including conferring physical resistance against insect herbivores. It has been hypothesised that grasses, in particular, utilise 'low metabolic cost' Si for structural and defensive roles under nutrient limitation. While carbon (C) concentrations often negatively correlate with Si concentrations, the relationship between nitrogen (N) status and Si is more variable. Moreover, the impacts of N limitation on constitutive physical Si defences (e.g. silica and prickle cells) against herbivores are unknown. We determined how N limitation affected Si deposition in the model grass Brachypodium distachyon and how changes in these constitutive defences impacted insect herbivore Helicoverpa armigera growth rates. We used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry in conjunction with X-ray mapping (XRM) to quantify physical structures on leaves and determine Si deposition patterns. We also determined how N limitation and Si supply impacted the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway, the master regulator of induced defences against arthropod herbivores. N limitation reduced shoot growth by over 40%, but increased root mass (+21%), leaf Si concentrations (+50%) and the density of silica (+28%) and flattened prickle (+76%) cells. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and XRM established that Si was being deposited in these structures, together with hooked prickle cells and macro-hairs. Herbivore relative growth rates (RGR) were more than 115% lower in Si-supplied plants compared to plants without Si supply and negatively correlated with leaf Si concentration and silica cell density. RGR was further reduced by N limitation and positively correlated with leaf N concentrations. Increases in JA concentrations following induction of the JA pathway were at least doubled by N limitation. Synthesis. Si accumulation and deposition were highly regulated by N availability, with N limitation promoting both constitutive Si physical defences and induction of the JA defensive pathway, in line with the resource availability hypothesis. These results indicate that grasses use 'low-cost Si' when resources are limited and suggest that plant productivity may benefit from optimising conventional fertilisers and Si fertilisation.

Melatonin implants (18 mg) were applied to half of the female and male animals, one to female animals and three to male animals. The rate of oestrus was determined as 100% in the melatonin (M) and control (C) groups. The non-return rate, conception rate and lambing rate were close in both groups of ewes and rams groups (p > .05). The rate of oestrus was 100% in the melatonin and control groups of does and bucks groups in Turkish Saanen goats. The non-return rate in does was 75.0 +/- 9.02% in M group and 92.0 +/- 5.53% in C group (p = .0101), the non-return rate was 83.3 +/- 6.92% in group M and 84.2 +/- 8.59% in group C for bucks (p = .5570). For ewes, the duration from ram introduction to first oestrus, conception and lambing was significantly lower in group M than in group C (p <= .05). Litter size of M in ewe and ram groups were 1.70 +/- 0.08 and 1.59 +/- 0.09, respectively, whereas it was 1.62 +/- 0.10 and 1.74 +/- 0.10 in C group, respectively. Birth weight significantly differed between ewe groups (p = .0017). For goats, the duration from buck introduction to first oestrus, conception and lambing was similar in the groups of does and bucks (p > .05). Litter size of M in doe and buck groups were 1.57 +/- 0.11 and 1.53 +/- 0.12, respectively, and 1.46 +/- 0.11and 1.50 +/- 0.09 in C group, respectively (p > .05). While the live weight and body condition score (BCS) of ewes were significantly affected by melatonin implants (p <= .05), the live weight and BCS of does were not affected. In conclusion, it might be said that melatonin implants obtained better results for reproduction in Tahirova sheep than Turkish Saanen goats.

AB  - This study compared the effects of the cooling mode of a geothermal heat pump (GHP) system with those of a traditional cooling system (ventilation fans) inside a pig house on the internal house temperature, harmful gas emissions, and the growth performance of the pigs. During the 19-week experimental period, the temperature inside the house connected to the GHP cooling system was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that of a house with a conventional cooling system. Similarly, the temperature-humidity index (THI) was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in the GHP cooling system-connected pig house. Furthermore, the concentrations of ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) were also decreased significantly in the GHP-installed pig house (p < 0.05). However, no differences were observed in the concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5) and formaldehyde (p > 0.05). The pigs reared in the GHP-equipped pig house gained significantly more weight (p < 0.05) by the end of the experiment. The GHP cooling system can therefore be implemented as a renewable, environmentally friendly energy source in pig farms for sustainable swine production without adversely affecting the productivity parameters.

AB  - Most cold-season grasses can be colonized by belowground arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and foliar grass endophytes (Epichlo & euml;) simultaneously while also be attacked by insect herbivores. The colonization of AM fungi or the presence of grass endophytes is associated with increased resistance by the host plant. However, studies on how these two symbionts affect host plants and mitigate insect pest attack are currently lacking. In a glasshouse study we investigated the effects of an AM fungus (Acaulospora delicata), a foliar grass endophyte (Epichlo & euml;), and the insect pest Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm, FAW) on plant growth, defense enzyme activity, and hormone concentrations of the important pasture grass Lolium perenne. Additionally, we assessed the selective behavior of FAW larvae in response to these interactions using olfactometer tests. Our results showed that the AM fungus and its co-colonization with Epichlo & euml; endophytes increased aboveground biomass, while Epichlo & euml; endophytes alone had no significant impact on ryegrass aboveground biomass. In contrast, FAW reduced aboveground biomass. The Epichlo & euml; endophytes and FAW significantly decreased the mycorrhizal colonization rate by 21.67% and 30.16%, respectively. Interestingly, compared to non-mycorrhizal plants, AM fungus colonized plants were more attractive to FAW larvae feeding, and the defense enzyme activity was not discernibly affected by any experimental treatments. The interactions of the AM fungus and Epichlo & euml; endophyte increased the jasmonic acid concentrations by 24.29% and decreased trasylol activity by 11.75% in the host plants under FAW attack. Neither the AM fungus nor Epichlo & euml; endophyte influenced the relative growth rate (RGR) of FAW. Overall, the AM fungus had a greater positive effect on plant growth than the Epichlo & euml; endophyte, regardless of FAW larvae infestation.

AB  - In recent decades, conflict between geese and agriculture has increased. Management practices to limit this conflict include concentrating geese in protected areas, derogation shooting or population reduction. To justify such management, we need to understand their effects on goose-related damages, which requires an understanding of how yield loss is influenced by goose abundance and species interactions. We combined data from monthly goose counts and GPS-tracked geese to estimate grazing pressures by barnacle, white-fronted and greylag geese on agricultural grassland in Fryslan, the Netherlands. Using linear mixed models, we related this to damages assessed by professional inspectors. Our results show a positive nonlinear relationship between yield loss and barnacle goose grazing pressure, where assessed damage increases with a decelerating rate as grazing pressure increases. For white-fronted geese, we find a negative relationship, while for greylag geese both positive and negative relationships occur. For each species, the relationship is influenced by the abundance of the other two. For barnacle geese, the relationship can be explained by selection of fields offering the best balance between food intake and energy expenditure, and by grass regrowth, with highest grazing pressures occurring over a longer time period. The results for the other species are likely due to spatial and temporal differences in foraging preferences compared to barnacle geese, where larger species avoid areas with highest damages. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that decreasing herbivore abundance may not translate directly to decreased yield loss, and management tools such as population reduction or derogation shooting should be used with care. Management aimed at concentrating geese in refuges could help to alleviate farmer-goose conflict, although further studies are required to determine if it would lead to damage reduction. We also find that not all species contribute equally to agricultural damage; care should be taken to ensure wildlife management targets the right species.

AB  - Remobilization of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) from roots and crowns to regrowing shoots is an important strategy for grassland plants to tolerate herbivory. While this remobilization is thought to terminate once plants have the capacity to photosynthesize again and to take up N from the soil, this has rarely been quantified.Here we investigated the remobilization of C and N to regrowing shoots of a perennial grassland under two defoliation frequencies (every 15 and 30 days) and two N fertilization levels (0 and 2.8 g m(-2)) by growing intact plant-soil cores for 60 days in a growth chamber. We measured the C remobilization from roots and crowns to regrowing shoots using a novel continuous C-13 labelling method, and quantified the N remobilization to regrowing shoots and plant N uptake from soil with a N-15 tracer method.Regrowing shoots relied strongly on below-ground C reserves, where up to 52% of C in regrowing shoots came from below-ground during the first 30 days after defoliation. Below-ground C was still remobilized when plant shoots had fully regrown and retained full capacity to photosynthesize. Plants relied more on C remobilization with shorter times between defoliation events at the expense of root biomass, particularly without N fertilization. Large amounts of C remobilization were accompanied by large amounts of N remobilization (up to 89% of total shoot N) that were positively related, suggesting a coupled C and N transfer from roots and crowns to shoots.Synthesis. The unexpectedly high dependency on C and N remobilization occurred continuously after defoliation and did not terminate once plants were fully regrown. Our results indicate that remobilization of C and N from below-ground has profound effects on long-term productivity and C sequestration that needs to be considered for managing similar grasslands worldwide.

AB  - The flatfish European plaice is a demersal, temperate species and a candidate for marine aquaculture. To better understand growth and the mechanisms involved in growth regulation, juvenile plaice (initial mean weight f SEM, 10.4 f 0.1 g) were reared in triplicate rearing tanks at three different temperature: ambient (average of 8.6 degrees C), 12 degrees C and 16 degrees C, for 100 days. Interactions between growth, expression of growth regulating genes, and skeletal development were studied to determine optimal rearing conditions for juvenile plaice. Juvenile plaice grew fastest at 16 degrees C, followed by the 12 degrees C group. The condition factor was inversely correlated to increased temperatures and was highest in the 8.6 degrees C group. At the start of the experiment, 11% of the fish had vertebra deformities. Increasing temperature resulted in higher frequency and severity of malformations, and the 8.6 degrees C group had 8% less vertebra deformities at the end of the experiment compared to other two groups. The 12 degrees C and 16 degrees C groups had similar frequency of deformed fish, however, the 16 degrees C had more severe deformities, measured as number of deformed vertebrae per fish. Temperature affected gene transcript levels of ghr, igf-1, and igf-1r in muscle and liver tissue differently. Hepatic igf-1 transcript levels increased with increased growth and temperature. Muscular igf-1r transcript levels increased with increasing temperature in each sampling, indicating that igf-1r corresponded with muscular growth. Based on the present findings, a rearing temperature of 12 degrees C is recommended for on-growing of juvenile plaice.

AB  - Small changes in the large stock of soil organic carbon (SOC) can have a substantial influence on the climate impact of agriculture. We used information from a Swedish soil monitoring program, in combination with farm census data, to analyze decadal SOC concentrations and SOC stock changes on dairy farms compared with other farm types, and to quantify the climate impact of these changes on dairy farms. Soil monitoring data included topsoil samples from two inventories on 159 dairy farms, 86 beef farms, 318 arable farms, and 13 pig farms, taken at the same locations in 2001-2007 and 2011-2017. Concentrations of SOC on dairy farms (3.0%) were significantly higher than on arable farms (2.3%) and pig farms (2.4%), but not significantly different from beef farms (3.1%). SOC concentration was correlated with proportion of ley at farm scale. SOC stocks in the upper 20 cm increased significantly on dairy, beef, and arable farms, by 0.38, 0.14, and 0.21 Mg C ha(-1 )year(-1), respectively, between 2001-2007 and 2011-2017. For dairy farms, this corresponded to -1.4 Mg CO2 ha(-1) and approximately -0.22 kg CO2 kg(-1) energy-corrected milk, demonstrating that SOC changes could have a substantial influence on the climate footprint of milk.

AB  - Simple Summary Yaks can grow in extremely harsh natural environmental conditions, such as high altitude, low temperature, and hypoxia, and hair plays an important role. As an appendage of the skin, hair follicles involve the specialization of various types of cells and intercellular communication during morphogenesis. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing technology to identify 11 cell types from the scapular skin of yaks, constructed a transcription map of the main cells of hair follicles in the skin, and described the heterogeneity of DP cells and dermal fibroblasts in the hair follicle cycle. Our findings provide a molecular landscape of the fate determination process of dermal cell lineages. Our research provides valuable resources for further exploration of the molecular pathways involved in hair follicles.
   The morphogenesis of hair follicle structure is accompanied by the differentiation of skin tissue. Mammalian coats are produced by hair follicles. The formation of hair follicles requires signal transmission between the epidermis and dermis. However, knowledge of the transcriptional regulatory mechanism is still lacking. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to obtain 26,573 single cells from the scapular skin of yaks at hair follicle telogen and anagen stages. With the help of known reference marker genes, 11 main cell types were identified. In addition, we further analyzed the DP cell and dermal fibroblast lineages, drew a single-cell map of the DP cell and dermal fibroblast lineages, and elaborated the key genes, signals, and functions involved in cell fate decision making. The results of this study provide a very valuable resource for the analysis of the heterogeneity of DP cells and dermal fibroblasts in the skin and provide a powerful theoretical reference for further exploring the diversity of hair follicle cell types and hair follicle morphogenesis.

AB  - Diet is fundamental to an individual's biology because energy acquired from food constrains growth and reproduction, which subsequently influences survival. It is, therefore, important to have a strong understanding of a population's diet for species of conservation concern, such as the green turtle (Chelonia mydas). While the diet of adult green turtles is generally characterised as primarily herbivorous, growing evidence suggests variation in diet between and within populations is prevalent. We use complementary stable isotope analysis techniques to elucidate diet variation within a C. mydas population (ranging from small juveniles to adults) foraging at Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia. Analyses of multiple tissues and samples from ten individuals recaptured between 4 months and 4.5 years apart revealed that adults showed the highest levels of individual specialisation and consistency in diet over time. Analysis of red blood cell delta C-13 and delta N-15 values revealed macroalgae is likely the dominant food source for all size classes, and sub-adult and adults also ate animals (probably jellyfish). Compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids indicated the main sources of essential amino acids for Ningaloo C. mydas were macroalgae or bacteria. Taken together, these results suggest C. mydas at Ningaloo conform to the general description of adult C. mydas diet as predominantly herbivorous, but diet varies with size and between adult individuals. Consideration of within-population diet variation will be important for predicting responses to stressors such as climate change, that directly affect foraging resources, as fitness consequences may vary for individuals with different diets.

AB  - Climate-change induced tree mortality or productivity declines have (if not mediated by herbivory, pathogens or fire) mostly been attributed to drought stress. Although the importance of drought is undisputed, evidence is accumulating that the role of heat stress as a separate factor has been underestimated. The photosystem II (PS II) is known to be particularly sensitive to heat and its functionality can be easily tracked with chlorophyll fluorescence analysis. Several recent studies have substantiated species-specific differences in heat tolerance based on reductions of the maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of PS II. However, these seminal studies were based on short-term heat exposures for 15 or 30 min, which often resulted in unrealistically high critical temperatures compared to ambient conditions even under climate change. Therefore, we tested the feasibility of heat treatments of up to 4 h, which comes closer to the duration of daily heat maxima in the noon and afternoon hours in 14 temperate tree species native or introduced to Central Europe. Critical reductions in Fv/Fm occurred after 4 h of heat at lower temperatures compared to short-term experiments. While all species coped well with 35 degrees C, reductions in Fv/Fm started to occur in some species at leaf temperatures of 40 degrees C and were widespread at 45 degrees C. Broadleaved trees were generally more tolerant to heat than conifers. Though heat tolerance was correlated with drought tolerance, deviations from the regression line showed that these factors have to be regarded as independent factors when assessing the climate change sensitivity of tree species.

AB  - AimThe enemy release hypothesis states that the invasion success of non-native species is partly due to their escape from natural enemies, e.g., herbivores. Large-scale studies of herbivory using multiple species across multiple sites are needed to test the generality of herbivory release in non-native plants.LocationEurope.MethodsWe carried out leaf-herbivory surveys from 2007 to 2021 in 15 botanical gardens ranging in latitude from 47 degrees N (Switzerland) to 63 degrees N (Norway) to investigate how herbivory levels differed between (i) native and non-native species, and (ii) native and non-naturalised or naturalised species.ResultsOverall, we found that herbivory levels were lower on non-native than native species. In addition, we found that non-naturalised plants suffered less herbivory than natives and that naturalised plants showed similar levels of herbivory to native plants.Main ConclusionsWe find broad support for lower herbivory of non-native plant species compared to natives. However, the stronger reduction in herbivory for non-naturalised plants suggests that herbivore release may be transient and less pronounced for naturalised non-native species that have become abundant and integrated into resident communities. This has implications for the management of naturalised non-native plants, which are performing well in their non-native ranges despite suffering comparable herbivory levels to native species.

AB  - This article, based on the sustainable livelihood framework and survey data from 1264 households in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Puer City, and Lincang City in Yunnan Province, China, analyzes the impact mechanism of livelihood capital on the production input behavior of farmers affected by Asian elephant damage and the moderating effect of Asian elephant damage on this process using ordinary least squares (OLS) models. The study finds the following: (1) Asian elephant damage has a significant negative effect on farmers' production input, meaning that as the severity of Asian elephant damage increases, farmers reduce their input into agricultural production factors. (2) Livelihood capital has a significant positive effect on farmers' production input, and both the increment and stock of livelihood capital promote an increase in farmers' production input. (3) Asian elephant damage strengthens the influence of livelihood capital on farmers' inputs of agricultural production factors. Based on these findings, four recommendations are proposed: emphasizing the cultivation and enhancement of farmers' livelihood capital, improving strategies for managing and preventing wildlife damage, optimizing the economic compensation mechanism for human-wildlife conflicts, and adhering to sustainable development and resource allocation. These recommendations aim to enhance wildlife conservation and management policies, strengthen farmers' risk-coping capabilities, and ensure the sustainability of agricultural production and livelihoods.

AB  - Seeds represent a stage of a plant's life cycle that is extremely vulnerable to predation, which unlike most vegetative herbivory, is fatal to the individual. As such, understanding the distribution and abundance of plants may rely on understanding seed defences: characteristics that make seeds more difficult for granivores to locate, less beneficial for granivores to consume or both. Seeds that produce mucilage are widespread, found across many families and species. Although short-term (single day) studies indicate that mucilage may be a fundamental seed defence found throughout the plant kingdom, it is not clear to what extent mucilage provides long-term benefits to seeds by reducing granivory. Moreover, it is not clear whether this long-term defence occurs because mucilage reduces seed apparency as substrate-coated seeds are more difficult to detect, whether substrate-coated seeds are less valuable or both. In the first field experiment, we factorially manipulated sand coatings, background sand colour and granivore community using feeding depots to test the mechanistic basis of mucilage-bound sand as a seed defence against diverse granivores. We found that the sand coating significantly extended chances of seeds remaining over the 101-day trial, during which rodents were the primary granivores, and our coloration manipulation suggests that the effect was almost entirely physical. We found that whether a seed's sand coating matched its background did not greatly affect chance of removal, leaving the crypsis mechanism unsupported. We conducted a follow-up field experiment to test the background-matching hypothesis in more detail, using 20 sand colours and two colours of flax seeds. We again found no support for crypsis, corroborating the finding that mucilage-bound sand provides a primarily physical defensive benefit. Synthesis. The totality of the results from this and previous studies across granivore taxa and plant species suggests that seed mucilage is a widespread and highly effective physical defence employed by many plants against diverse granivores in many environments

AB  - Some species of batoids have dermal coverage with morphological variations used for taxonomical research. This study characterizes the morphology of dermal structures of batoids landed on the Peruvian coast, according to the species, regions of the body, life stage and sex. Three species were analyzed: Pseudobatos planiceps, Rostroraja velezi and Sympterygia brevicaudata acquired from artisanal fisheries from the north to the south of the country. Three types of structures were identified: Dermal denticles, cutaneous tubercles and thorns. Diverse dermal structures are present since the birth of batoids. In Rajiformes, differences between sexes were the existence of malar and alar thorns in males. The presence of pores on the ventral side of tubercles and spines from Rhinopristiformes, differs from Rajiformes, which have a cavity where the skin will be attached and will extend to the pulp cavity of the spine. Differences on the morphology of dermal structures were related to the regions of the body evaluated and with the dermal covering pattern of the species. Furthermore, these results indicate that the methodology used in this study allows determination at the species level.

AB  - Background: The Gram-negative bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an intracellular pathogen and an etiological agent of human and animal anaplasmosis. Its natural reservoir comprises free-ranging ungulates, including roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus). These two species of deer also constitute the largest group of game animals in Poland. The aim of the study was to genotype and perform a phylogenetic analysis of A. phagocytophilum strains from roe deer and red deer. Methods: Samples were subjected to PCR amplification, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis of strain-specific genetic markers (groEL, ankA). Results: Five haplotypes of the groEL gene from A. phagocytophilum and seven haplotypes of ankA were obtained. The phylogenetic analysis classified the groEL into ecotypes I and II. Sequences of the ankA gene were classified into clusters I, II, and III. Conclusions: Strains of A. phagocytophilum from red deer were in the same ecotype and cluster as strains isolated from humans. Strains of A. phagocytophilum from roe deer represented ecotypes (I, II) and clusters (II, III) that were different from those isolated from red deer, and these strains did not show similarity to bacteria from humans. However, roe deer can harbor nonspecific strains of A. phagocytophilum more characteristic to red deer. It appears that the genetic variants from red deer can be pathogenic to humans, but the significance of the variants from roe deer requires more study.

AB  - The conservation and utilization of livestock genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biodiversity and breed innovation. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 90 samples from Chinese Yangtze River Delta White goats (YRD), sourced from two populations of Chongming island white goats and Haimen white goats, aiming to dissect their genomic characteristics. In addition, 262 WGS data from nine other breeds of goats were downloaded from the NCBI database. These WGS data obtained were used to identify and analyze genetic variation with the goat reference genome, and the genetic structure of goat populations was analyzed. Through selective sweep analysis, the selection-signature genes and their polymorphic features were identified. It was found that the most significant genomic selection region in YRD goats was in the region of 62.9-64.6 Mb on chromosome 13, which contained genes related to the coat color and muscle growth of the goats. Nucleotide diversity of MYH7B, a gene related to the development of the goat's skeletal muscle, within the Yangtze River Delta white goat population was significantly lower than in other domestic and foreign goat breeds, suggesting that the gene was subject to selection. In addition, the IGF2BP2 gene, reported to be associated with litter size in goats, showed clear selection-signature characteristics in the Boer goats compared to the YRD goats.

AB  - Mosquito-borne pathogens are an important challenge for public and animal health. In the last years, invasive mosquito species have spread globally, resulting on emerging diseases in many regions of the world. A combination of several factors, such climate change, globalisation and transport have been associated to this phenomenon and scientific predictions indicate that this pattern will continue during the next decades. It is not yet clear to which extent the introductions of these vectors will negatively affect wildlife ecosystems. Most information on mosquito-borne diseases is often limited to those of medical and/or veterinary relevance, while our understanding of pathogens affecting wildlife is limited. The detection of mosquito-borne diseases in wild mammals is essential in their conservation, but also because it helps detecting emerging mosquito-borne diseases in humans. Furthermore, preventing the spillover of wildlife pathogens to humans requires a deep understanding of the dynamics of the disease in the reservoir hosts and this information is still scarce. We present a comprehensive review of the mosquito-borne pathogens that affect wild mammal species, particularly viruses and parasites. In relation to the latter, many have been described morphologically prior to the introduction of molecular techniques and therefore such information must be critical assessed. Therefore, the number of pathogens included in this chapter is far from complete but includes those with most stable information.

AB  - A culturally important food fish in Hawai'i, Achilles tang (Acanthurus achilles Shaw), recently experienced sharp declines in biomass, density, and average length in west Hawai'i Island. In December 2022, State resource managers placed a 2-year moratorium on the Achilles tang fishery in west Hawai'i Island so that the cause of the collapse could be explored. The lack of life-history information for Achilles tang from Hawai'i, or elsewhere in its range, has been noted as an impediment to decision-making. Therefore, our objectives were to characterize this population's age, growth, and reproductive biology. In working with community fishers, we collected 363 individuals ranging 69 - 264 mm in fork length (FL) and 0 - 39 years in age based on estimates from otoliths. Achilles tang in Hawai'i exhibit a high growth rate, reaching 138 +/- 11 mm FL (mean +/- SE) in their first year, and exhibit relatively little growth after their second year (< 5 mm yr-1). The majority of males (92.0% of n = 101) and females (73.6% of n = 159) were classified as spawning capable or actively spawning, without annual or lunar periodicity. Our study highlights that the basic biology of Achilles tang poses unique challenges to fisheries managers looking to ensure its sustainable harvest. Future research will aim to characterize the susceptibility of recruits' habitat to local environmental stressors and the relative connectivity of juvenile and adult habitats.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation caused by road infrastructures represents a major threat to the genetic diversity of a region. The resulting genetic isolation between subpopulations may lead to consanguinity, and consequently to population collapse and extinction. However, the construction of wildlife crossings can help maintain connectivity. In the present paper, we evaluated the genetic spatial structuring of populations of wild boars (Sus scrofa) in three areas of the Geneva region connected by an ecological corridor. Those areas are cut off either by a highway that is crossed by a wildlife overpass or by an anthropized sector. Genetic profiling with 9 nuclear microsatellite markers yielded 61 single profiles, which allowed for clustering, parentage, and linkage disequilibrium analyses, uncovering the populations' genetic structure. We also evaluated whether the genetic structure was affected by the sex of individuals. In our analyses, all individuals clustered into a single genetic group, suggesting that no structure limited significantly the gene flow in the region. However, a recent admixture indicated a potential increase in the gene flow between two of the subpopulations due to the wildlife overpass, while the other part of the ecological corridor was not or was only partially functional. Genetic distances between males were significantly higher than between females, although the role of sex remains unclear as to its influence on population genetics. Finally, in order to avoid a subregion becoming fully isolated, urbanization planning should consider this genetic evaluation and proceed with further monitoring, especially by focusing on species more sensitive to landscape fragmentation.

AB  - Bio-logging technology is now the golden standard for assessing how individual animals change their movement and behavior over time and space. Three-dimensional accelerometer data, in particular, can provide extremely detailed information on individuals' activity and energetics associated with critical life-history events, such as reproduction and mortality. Applications, where accelerometer data have been recorded over sufficiently long periods of time to quantify how individuals modulate their activities when facing seasonality, environmental constraints, and how this might affect life-history events, remain rare, however. We collected high-resolution accelerometer data, over an entire year, from seven muskox females (Ovibos moschatus) with different reproductive statuses moving in the high-Artic. Individual-specific hidden Markov models (HMMs) were built based on overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) and pitch. Snow depth was included as a dependent structure to incorporate the dominant environmental constraint on muskox activity. We used GPS and vaginal implant transmitter data to further clarify the behavioral partition and to validate calving and mortality events. We detected lower ODBA recordings during periods with increased snow depth, suggesting that snow influences animal velocity and movement-related (energetic) costs. Time budgets and behavioral switching showed clear seasonal patterns, with distinct signatures depending on individuals' survival and reproductive status. Individuals that ultimately died drastically reduced time spent foraging/searching for food during winter, between February and May when snow depth is highest, while increasing time spent transiting/being highly active. This pattern could indicate failure to acquire sufficient food resources. Overall, individuals that survived the Arctic year spent greater amounts of time foraging yet with high individual variability in time spent foraging and transiting. Individuals that gave birth showed marked behavioral shifts at parturition times with a clear reduction in foraging behavior and increased activity. We show how long-term high-resolution accelerometer data analyzed within HMM frameworks can successfully be used to detect environmental-dependent behavioral changes with implications for life-history events. Such information opens up opportunities to study life-history events in more detail and will facilitate integration of data at both individual and population levels, which is critical for management and conservation of species.

AB  - Seahorses (family Syngnathidae) are ovoviviparous fish whose embryos can obtain paternal immunoprotection through the male's brood pouch, which is a specialized organ for pregnancy. Previous studies have revealed that seahorses have a unique immune system and alpha-2 macroglobulin (alpha 2M) may be involved in male pregnancy. To ascertain the significance of alpha 2M in the immune system of the brood pouch, the characteristics of the alpha 2M gene were first investigated in the lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus). In this study, alpha 2M showed a broad expression pattern, with the highest expression in the liver and brood pouch. Interestingly, during the six-month seahorse culture, expression level of alpha 2M in the liver was particularly decreased during brood pouch formation (fourth and fifth months), but was restored the complete development of this brood pouch (sixth months), and a similar expression occurred in the brood pouch. This suggests that the seahorse might be able to regulate its immune response while a new organ develops. Further investigation also examined the immune regulation of alpha 2M in brood pouches by injecting lipopolysaccharide and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. The results showed that, after the challenge experiment, alpha 2M expression in the inner pseudoplacenta was upregulated, along with other important immune factors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma). Taken together, our results reveal that alpha 2M plays an important role in immunoprotection of the brood pouch, and may provide new insights into studies of male pregnancy regulation in seahorses.

AB  - Trunk injection with imidacloprid is used to reduce the infestation rate of trees by pests. However, further research is needed to determine the insecticide persistence in trees. Here, we present a case study in which we evaluated horse chestnut trees for imidacloprid residues and the invasive leaf miner Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) infestation 14 years after a single injection (5 mL of pesticide per tree). We detected residues of imidacloprid (on average 0.648 mu g/kg in leaves) and its metabolites: imidacloprid-guanidine in leaves and inflorescences and imidacloprid-urea in the leaves of treated trees. In addition, imidacloprid residues in inflorescences were at much lower concentrations (on average 0.07 mu g/kg) compared to those found in leaves. Tree infestation by leaf miners was significantly lower in injected trees (0.035 mines/cm(2)) than in control trees (0.091 mines/cm(2)). Our research thus indicates for the first time that, once applied, imidacloprid may affect the target and non-target species for a long time owing to its persistence in plant tissues.

AB  - Extensive bushmeat hunting is a major threat to wildlife conservation worldwide, particularly when unselective methods such as wire snares kill target and non-target species (by-catch). Animals that escape from snares have injuries of varying severity, with effects on performance that are largely unknown, as most studies typically focus on immediate mortality caused by snaring. Here, we assessed the life-history costs of debilitating snare injuries in individually known female spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta in three clans in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. This keystone predator is a regular by-catch of illegal bushmeat hunting of herbivores in the Serengeti ecosystem. We monitored individuals which escaped from snares between May 1987 and March 2020 and survived long enough to return to their clan territories from commuting trips in the park and surrounding protected areas. Snares that inflicted debilitating injuries on females did not reduce longevity but did delay age at first reproduction and reduced both litter size and offspring survival to the age of 1 year. This long-term decrease in reproductive performance likely resulted from increased inflammatory and immune responses to the snare injury and/or a decreased ability to travel the long distances necessary to feed on migratory herbivores. While our results are based on a relatively small sample of females with debilitating injuries, they suggest that the total population-level costs of wire snares in terrestrial by-catch species may be underestimated and that future studies may need to account for the potential reproductive costs of sublethal snare injuries.

AB  - Hummingbird flower mites are assumed to monopolize single host plant species owing to sexual selection for unique mating rendezvous sites. We tested the main assumption of the mating rendezvous hypothesis-extreme host specialization-by reconstructing interactions among tropical hummingbird flower mites and their host plants using DNA barcoding and taxonomic identifications. We collected 10,654 mites from 489 flowers. We extracted DNA from 1,928 mite specimens and amplified the cytochrome c oxidase I (CO1) DNA barcode. We analyzed the network structure to assess the degree of generalization or specialization of mites to their host plants. We recorded 18 species of hummingbird flower mites from three genera (Proctolaelaps, Rhinoseius, and Tropicoseius) interacting with 14 species of plants. We found that generalist mites are common, and congeneric mite species often share host plants. Our results challenge the assumption of strict specialization that supports this system as an example of mating rendezvous evolution.

AB  - Material fluxes between ecosystems subsidize consumers in recipient ecosystems. While alpine zones are generally regarded as isolated, arthropods from lower elevations may be deposited on the snow surface in alpine zones by flight or wind. This arthropod fallout should be essential food resources for alpine consumers that are forced to deal with scarce food in environments. In this study, the source location of arthropods that fell onto the alpine snowpack was examined using data of their host plants. Furthermore, seasonal changes in the arthropod diets of two insectivorous and one primarily herbivorous alpine bird species were evaluated by fecal DNA metabarcoding with correction of PCR amplification bias among arthropod taxa using DNA mock assemblages of arthropods. We present quantitative evidence that winged aphids originating from the subalpine and montane zones are abundant on the snowpack. These subsidized aphids accounted for approximately 40% of the arthropod portion of the diet, and 6%-40% of the overall diet, of these birds during their early breeding seasons. Our findings indicate that material fluxes from foothill areas contribute to the maintenance of biotic communities in alpine ecosystems during less productive seasons.

AB  - This small-scale study aimed to preliminarily explore the potential of leadership in group movements in cattle for improving uniformity of grazing distribution of the group on grazing land. We created two groups of beef cows with two common individuals without leadership or followership plus an individual with either strong leadership or strong followership and compared foraging patterns of the groups in two grassland plots. The plots, which comprised subplots separated by walls having narrow passages, were designed so that naive cows would have difficulty in knowing the presence of a grazable subplot next to them, and especially the common cows and the follower cow would have a fear of entering the subplot by themselves even if they noticed its presence. The inclusion of the leader cow in replacement of the follower expanded grazing distribution patterns of the entire group into the subplot or subplots that were relatively unexploited by the group with the follower cow (P = 0.005-0.015), as a result of increased occurrence of inter-subplot group movements led by the leader cow (P = 0.005-0.043). More studies are needed for shaping the leadership into a management tool for manipulating spatial distribution of livestock at the farm scale.

AB  - Drought associated with climate change and climate variability is the main factor affecting the productivity and diversity of terrestrial ecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the tolerance to drought and the compensatory growth of two provenances of Paspalum notatum subjected to defoliation and water deficit. The experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions, located at the Experimental Station for the Study of the Dry Tropics "El Limon", attached to the UNAN Managua. An experiment was carried out with a factorial arrangement of treatments with three repetitions. Individuals from two provenances of P. notatum were subjected to two levels of defoliation and two levels of water regime. The variables evaluated were dry matter production, relative growth rate and water potential. The main results show the P. notatum plants in conditions without water stress in an increase in their aerial biomass by 15%, the accumulation of rhizome biomass of defoliated plants was lower in relation to the non-defoliated plants, the root biomass was dependent on the water regime, the total accumulated biomass increased by 20% in non-defoliated conditions and the defoliated plants of Muy Muy showed overcompensation and the defoliated plants of Rivas presented a partial compensation. The water potential in defoliated plants did not show differentiation, regardless of the water regime to which they were subjected. Drought is a determining factor that modifies the compensatory capacity of grasses subjected to defoliation in aerial biomass and rhizomes.

AB  - Direct-seeding trials in Tasmania tested the effectiveness of five treatments: a clear polymer film removed at three time intervals; insecticide; wetting agent; irrigation; and caging to exclude all mammal herbivores. The most effective treatment in improving early establishment of 15 native species across 2 years and at five sites was the application of the insecticide Bifenthrin to reduce seed predation by ants. The polymer film removed after 10 weeks also improved germination of a range of shrubby but not tree species. However, these early advantages were eroded over time at the first trial site due to damage from herbivores and at subsequent sites due to weed competition and mortality of seedlings over summer. Caging was beneficial to the ongoing persistence of tree and shrub species but also protected weeds. Further work on seed testing and timely weed control is needed.

AB  - Large carnivores encounter various threats from human activities. Population trend detection among carnivore species and implementation of management policies based on monitoring are urgently needed for human-carnivore coexistence. We demonstrate how young citizens have helped reveal long-term trends in brown bear field sign detection rates following a government policy change (i.e., abolishment of the spring cull). We used a 40-year dataset of field signs collected by volunteer college students in northern Japan and analyzed the resulting data using state-space models. The spring cull had a significant negative impact on the number of grids with field signs; the detection rate under spring cull pressure declined from 19 to 0% between 1976 and 1990. However, abolishment of the spring cull in 1990 had a significant positive effect on the number of grids with field signs; the detection rate increased from 0 to 13% between 1991 and 2015, suggesting that the government policy change strongly affected the threatened brown bear population. Structured monitoring schemes, simplicity and/or attractiveness in monitoring targets may ensure the data quality and duration of citizen-based monitoring. These findings suggest a high potential for engaging college students in developing sustainable monitoring of large carnivore populations and in supporting wildlife management.

AB  - Simple Summary Neem leaves are a rich source of tannin, may prevent protein degradation in the rumen, and may increase growth performance because they are natural substances; thus, they are appealing as rumen modifiers. Animal nutritionists must manipulate ruminal ecology and fermentation to improve feed intake in ruminants. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of neem leaf supplementation on digestibility, growth performance, rumen fermentation, and ruminal microbial population in goats. The findings indicated that goats fed 6% neem leaf (NL) + 15% (polyethylene glycol (PEG)) in the concentrate had the highest values of feed intake, nutrient digestion, and nitrogen utilization increased growth performance; the highest values of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Streptococcus gallolyticus; and reduced protozoa and methanogens. Our results suggest that neem leaf could be an interesting substitute supplement for goat feed. We believe that neem leaf has the potential to help the goat meat industry meet the demands of health-conscious consumers. This study aims to investigate the effect of neem leaf supplementation on the feed intake, digestibility, performance, fermentation characteristics, and ruminal microbes in goats. We included 24 Anglo-Nubian Thai native male goats with a body weight of 20 +/- 2.0 kg, using 2 x 2 factorial in a completely randomized design for the following four treatments: (1) control, (2) control + 15% PEG in the concentrate, (3) 6% NL in concentrate, and (4) 6% NL + 15% PEG in concentrate. The results show that supplementation with 6% NL + 15% PEG in the concentrate had a higher (p < 0.05) feed intake gDM/d, % BW, g/kgBW(0.75), nutrient intake, nutrient digestion, weight change, and ADG than did the goats that were fed with 0% NL + 0% PEG, 0% NL + 15% PEG, and 6% NL + 0% PEG in concentrate, respectively. The feeding with 6% NL + 15% PEG had a higher (p < 0.05) level of propionic acid at 2 and 4 h post feeding compared to the other treatments. Supplementation with 6% NL + 15% PEG in the concentrate had the lowest (p < 0.05) methanogen, protozoa, blood urea nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, acetic acid, and butyric acid, as well as a lower ratio of acetic acid to propionic acid at 2 and 4 h post feeding than the other treatments. However, supplementation with 6% NL + 15% PEG in concentrate had the highest values of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Streptococcus gallolyticus at 2 and 4 h post feeding compared to the other treatments (p < 0.05). Collectively, this study indicates that neem leaf supplements can increase growth performance and propionic acid and can modulate the abundance of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Streptococcus gallolyticus. Thus, neem leaf could potentially be a good supplement for goat feed.

AB  - Electric fences are an effective means of mitigating human-wildlife conflict; however, some fences are not impenetrable and allow some animal intrusion. This study revealed the most appropriate height of fence lines for target species and whether line tension affected their effectiveness. Nine study plots were used, and an equilateral triangular area of 3.2 m per side (4.43 m(2)) was enclosed by an electric fence. Electric lines were set at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, and 160 cm, and all lines were connected to the positive terminal of an energizer. The following electric fence conditions were provided for the animals: (i) three levels of voltage (1500, 4000, and 10,000 V), (ii) two types of grounding (soil and metal mesh), and (iii) two levels of line tension. There were nine target species. Two cameras were set up in each study plot, and attractants were placed inside and outside the fence. Animals were observed and recorded both inside and outside the fence. The most touched height of the electric lines was half the adult shoulder height of each species. In addition, the height at which most animals passed through the fence was below their shoulder height. Moreover, high-tensile electric fences were twice as likely to electrify animals than low-tensile fences. These results highlight the importance of understanding the height and tension of electric lines. Thus, the fence line should be set at a high tension and lower than half of the shoulder height of the target species.

AB  - Tea polyphenols are the most widely distributed class of secondary metabolites (Camellia sinensis) and account for a considerable proportion of the pruning residues of tea. A large amount of tea polyphenols have fallen down over soil with prunning residues every year. However, the effect of tea polyphenols on soil nitrogen cycle, especially the denitrification process and its related microbial communities, remains unclear. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant component of tea polyphenols, was selected to simulate the effects of tea polyphenols on soil nitrification, denitrification, related functional genes and microbial community. The results indicated that addition of EGCG can significantly (p < 0.05) inhibit soil nitrification. Copy numbers of bacterial and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase genes (amoA) decreased as EGCG concentration increased. Further, the ammonia oxidisers exhibited a significantly (p < 0.05) greater niche differentiation under the effect of EGCG compared with the control treatment (no EGCG addition). However, the inhibition effect of EGCG over soil denitrification was most significant at 34 and 36 day of incubation period, and such inhibitory effect was more apparent on nitrification compared with denitrification. EGCG addition increased the diversity of bacterial community. The composition of bacterial community was significantly altered and community variation was primary explained by EGCG, NH4+-N, NO3--N, soil organic carbon contents and potential denitrification rates. EGCG addition significantly increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla whereas decreased Actinobacteria. Overall, tea polyphenols can inhibit soil nitrification to a larger extent than denitrification by reducing the abundance of microorganisms carrying the related functional genes. Our results can serve as important basis of reducing the nitrogen pollution risk in tea orchards and could be considered as a powerful natural nitrification inhibitor to reduce the environmental risks caused by unreasonable nitrogen fertiliser adaptation.

AB  - The stimulatory effect of biochar addition on dry anaerobic digestion (AD) has been rarely investigated. In this study, the effects of commonly used biochars (bamboo, rice husk, and pecan shell) on dry co-AD were investigated using mesophilic batch digesters fed with pig manure and food waste as substrates. The results show that the specific methane yield was mildly elevated with the addition of biochars by 7.9%, 9.4%, and 12.0% for bamboo, rice husk, and pecan shell-derived biochar additions, respectively. Biochar did facilitate the degradation of poorly biodegradable organics. In comparison, there was no significant effect on the peak methane production rate by the supplementation of the selected biochars. Among the three mechanisms of enhancing methanogenesis by biochar (buffering, providing supporting surface, and enhancing electron transfer), the first two mechanisms did not function significantly in dry co-AD, while the third mechanism (i.e., enhancing electron transfer) might play an important part in dry AD process. It is recommended that the utilization of biochar for the enhancement of biomethanation in dry AD should be more focused on mono digestion in future studies.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Milk from red deer is richer in fat and proteins than that of cow or other ruminants. The semi-captive breeding of this species has traditionally focused on meat, velvet or hunting purposes, but recent studies suggested that the high level of nutrients, the promising content of bioactive peptides and the better digestibility than that of milk from other species could open innovative alternatives for the dairy industry. As for other non-commercial mammalian species that are gaining technological interest for the elaboration of dairy products, it is necessary to understand the aptitude and performance of milk from red deer to be used for the production of cheese, fermented milks or other products. Our study aims to assess some chemical, physical, microbiological and technological properties of red deer milk during a lactation period of 18 weeks. The results show that milk from this species is similar to that of other ruminant species whose milk is commercialized. In addition, our results indicate the best period to industrialize the milk during lactation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the benefits of using red deer milk with a technological approach.
   This study describes chemical, physical, microbiological and technological characteristics of red deer milk and the effect of lactation on these parameters in order to know their potential aptitude to elaborate dairy products. During 18 weeks, milk from five hinds was monitored for composition, bacteriology, somatic cell count (SCC), physical properties and rennet coagulation. Mean values (g/100 g) for fat, protein, lactose and dry matter were 10.4, 7.1, 4.3 and 24.2, respectively, and for urea, 265 mg/100 mL. Except for lactose, a significant increase in these components was observed (p < 0.01) as lactation progressed. The average values for bacteriology and SCC were 5.3 log cfu/mL and 4.7 log cells/mL, respectively. Regarding physical properties, conductivity (mean: 2.8 ms/cm), viscosity (3.1 Cp), coordinates L* (89.9) and a* (-3.1) and milk fat globule diameter (D-4,D-3: 6.1 mu m) increased along with lactation while density (1.038 g/mL) decreased (p < 0.01). The pH (6.7), acidity (22.9 degrees Dornic), coordinate b* (8.4) and ethanol stability (66.6% v/v) were stable during the study period. The stage of lactation also has a significant impact on milk coagulation properties and mean curd yield was 3.29 g/10 mL. These results suggest that red deer milk could be a potential innovative source of milk for the dairy industry.

AB  - The asynchronous upward shift of insect herbivores and plants towards higher elevations following climate warming is anticipated to generate novel plant-insect interactions. As generalist herbivores shifting to higher elevations might incorporate novel plant species into their diet, high-elevation plant communities could experience increased herbivory pressure. Accordingly, we investigated the impact of lower-elevation orthopterans on high-elevation plant communities and some of the mechanisms enabling orthopterans to establish at higher elevations. We conducted a common garden experiment at two elevations in the Swiss Alps, exposing high-elevation plants to different orthopteran communities. This field experiment was complemented by a cafeteria choice experiment to assess the diet preferences of the orthopteran species included in the first experiment, along with functional trait measurements. The field experiment highlighted that high-elevation plants belonging to the Liliopsida [= monocotyledons] clade experienced higher herbivory rates when fed upon by a mixed group of lower- and higher-elevation orthopterans than when plants were attacked by single-elevation communities. The cafeteria experiment revealed diet conservatism, with orthopterans favouring plants sharing functional traits with their home-elevation diets. Additionally, our trait analysis indicated that orthopterans can be categorized into either Liliopsida or Magnoliopsida [= dicotyledons] feeders based on their dietary traits and functional characteristics, explaining the observed feeding niche complementarity. In summary, upslope-shifting orthopterans may increase herbivory pressure on high-elevation plant communities. High-elevation Liliopsida, in particular, are highly vulnerable due to the functional traits of lower-elevation orthopterans that drive their feeding preferences towards this plant group.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - The suspension-feeding gastropod Pachyoliva semistriata and its predator Agaronia propatula (both Olividae) are dominating members of many sandy beach communities of the central American west coast. Due to their abundance and the accessibility of their intertidal habitat, the two species lend themselves to the study of the behavioural basis of predator-prey interactions among marine invertebrates in the wild. Here I report freezing in Pachyoliva, the complete ceasing of motion upon encountering Agaronia trails on the beach. Numerous vertebrates and invertebrates freeze when they become aware of a predator, which reduces the success rate of predators that rely on movement for prey recognition; the behaviour had not previously been observed in gastropods, though. In Pachyoliva, freezing is induced by seawater that had been in contact with Agaronia, whereas other gastropods do not evoke this reaction. Thus, Pachyoliva responds specifically to olfactory cues that originate from its predator. Freezing differs from active flight responses that in Pachyoliva have been shown to be induced by mechanical stimuli. I conclude that P. semistriata integrates predator-derived mechanical and olfactory sensory inputs to respond efficiently to predation threats in a variety of circumstances.

AB  - Lectin-like molecules play a key role in mammalian sperm functionality. These multifunctional proteins have been proven to be involved in sperm capacitation, sperm motility, and viability, formation of the oviductal sperm reservoir, and in sperm-oocyte interaction. In a previous study, we reported the pres-ence of a novel seminal plasma lectin, sperm lectin 15 kDa (SL15), adsorbed to the llama sperm. In order to gain knowledge in the understanding of SL15 and its functions, the aims of this study were to (a) elucidate the presence and localization of SL15 in the llama male reproductive tract and sperm, and (b) determine whether the sperm cryopreservation process of cooling and freeze-thawing affects the SL15 levels and distribution on llama sperm. We found that SL15 protein was expressed along the male reproductive system: testis, epididymis, prostate, and bulbourethral glands, being the prostate the main site of SL15 secretion. SL15 was localized on the sperm head, following different localization patterns. In order to understand if sperm cryopreservation induces modifications in the SL15 adsorption pattern, immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry analysis were carried out on fresh, 24 h cooled, and frozen -thawed sperm. Both cooled and frozen sperm showed particular SL15 patterns, that were not observed in the freshly ejaculated, indicating loss of SL15. Flow cytometry analysis also exhibited a decrease of SL15 in the cooled sperm (P < 0.05), whereas a tendency to decrease was found in frozen-thawed sperm (P < 0.1) when compared with freshly ejaculated sperm. This study extends the knowledge about the SL15 in the llama male physiology and provides evidence that cryopreservation-related techniques disrupt SL15 adsorption to the sperm membrane, possibly affecting sperm functionality and fertility.

AB  - Context. As invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) expand throughout North America, wildlife managers are increasingly tasked with implementing strategies for alleviating their damage to anthropogenic and natural resources. Aims. Aerial operations, such as shooting from helicopters, are now commonly used strategies for controlling wild pig populations in the USA. Aerial operators are interested in identifying more effective strategies and tools, such as choke tubes and ammunition that produce the best animal welfare outcomes and reduce the number of shots required, while determining maximum effective shot distances. A strategic approach to evaluating shotshell and firearm options used in aerial operations can help aerial operators understand performance and adjust their techniques accordingly to maximize lethality at various distances. Methods. We evaluated pellet patterns and ballistics from various shotshells and developed a strategy for evaluating lethality and predicting performance in the field at increasing distances. Key results. We found distance to target and shotshell type had the strongest effects on predicting lethality, with probability of a vital impact declining as distances increased and number of pellets per shotshell decreased. We also found that penetration decreased as distances to the target increased; however, heavier pellets were less affected. Conclusions. Limiting shot distances and shotshell selection are important factors in optimizing aerial operations. Specifically, we recommend 00 buckshot shotshells with >= 12 pellets in situations where shot distances are <= 46 m. None of the shotshells we tested performed well at longer distances (i.e. <0.50 probability of lethal hit and lower penetration). Implications. This research has described a perfunctory strategy for comparative evaluation of firearm and shotshell options to optimize aerial operations for wild pigs. Utilizing such a strategy can enhance the abilities of an aerial operator and establish limitations to improve efficiencies and animal welfare outcomes.

AB  - Simple Summary Pork is one of the most consumed meats worldwide. In many countries, pork is produced only from gilts or barrows because of the presence of boar taint in boar's meat. Boar taint is an unpleasant odour, which is present in the meat and fat of boars. This odour is related to the increasing age and body weight of boars. The absence of boar taint in the final product can be achieved by castration of boars. Regarding the welfare of the animals, it would be appropriate to find a non-invasive, reliable, and working method for the determination of boar taint during the fattening of boars. Androstenone, which is one of the main compounds responsible for boar taint, can be determined from saliva. This method appears to be a hopeful way to predict individuals with a high level of this compound. Based on the current knowledge, the early slaughter of boars could be a suitable and functional step to avoid boar taint in the meat or fat, respectively. This is a pilot study that is focused on the non-invasive determination of boar taint on live animals. In the future, this method could be simplified and adjusted for use in farm conditions. With the increasing age of boars, the possibility of androstenone (5 alpha-androst-16-en-3-one (AND), 5 alpha-androst-16-en-3 alpha-ol (alpha-AND), and 5 alpha-androst-16-en-3 beta-ol (beta-AND)) occurrence increases as well. The aim of this study was to evaluate concentrations of androstenone compounds in the saliva of boars concerning the age of animals. In total, 72 boars were evaluated (24 boars per replication). The effect of age (three different ages-152, 163, and 172 days) was observed, and (Landrace x Large White) x Pietrain genotypes were used. Chemical analysis of saliva samples was conducted by multidimensional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (MDGC/MS). Salivary alpha-AND increased with age (p < 0.05), and positive correlations were found between age and submaxillary salivary gland weight (p < 0.05), age, and salivary AND concentration (p < 0.05), body weight and submaxillary salivary gland weight (p < 0.05), submaxillary salivary gland weight and salivary beta-AND concentration (p < 0.05), as well as submaxillary salivary gland weight and total salivary 5 alpha-androstenone (AND total) concentration (p < 0.001). Nowadays, animal welfare is becoming a more and more discussed topic, and pig breeding is not an exception. Specifically, the castration ban is a current issue, so it is very important to know as much as possible about compounds responsible for boar taint. Androstenone's appearance in boars' saliva could be one of the most important precursors for future early detection of boar taint.

AB  - The 6.7-million-hectare Raja Ampat archipelago is home to Indonesia's largest reef manta ray (Mobula alfredi) population and a representative network of nine marine protected areas (MPAs). However, the population dynamics of M. alfredi in the region are still largely unknown. Using our photo-identification database, we fitted modified POPAN mark-recapture models with transience and per capita recruitment parameters to estimate key demographic characteristics of M. alfredi from two of Raja Ampat's largest MPAs: Dampier Strait and South East (SE) Misool. A total of 1,041 unique individuals were photo-identified over an 11-year period (2009-2019) from Dampier Strait (n = 515) and SE Misool (n = 536). In our models, apparent survival probabilities and per capita recruitment rates were strongly linked with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Our models also estimated high apparent survival probabilities and significant increases in (sub)population sizes in both MPAs over a decade. In Dampier Strait, the estimated population size increased significantly (p = 0.018) from 226 (95% CI: 161, 283) to 317 (280, 355) individuals. Likewise, the estimated population size in SE Misool increased significantly (p = 0.008) from 210 (137, 308) to 511 (393, 618) individuals. Regardless of variation in the percentage change in population size between years throughout the study, the estimated overall population change shows a compound growth of 3.9% (0.7, 8.6) per annum in Dampier Strait and 10.7% (4.3, 16.1) per annum in SE Misool. Despite the global decline in oceanic sharks and rays due to fishing pressure in the last five decades, our study demonstrates the positive impact of a suite of long-term conservation efforts, coupled with the influence of ENSO events, on increasing M. alfredi abundance in Raja Ampat MPAs. Our study also underscores the importance of long-term monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation management measures on manta ray populations. Our modification of the standard POPAN model by incorporating per capita recruitment and transience parameters represents an important advance in mark-recapture modelling that should prove useful when examining other manta ray populations and other highly migratory species that are likely to have a substantial percentage of transient individuals.

AB  - The increasing use of hyperprolific sows has led to greater litter heterogeneity, highlighting the need for effective nutritional support for low-birth-weight piglets. This study explores the potential of using surplus goat transitional milk as a nutritional supplement for piglets, especially for those facing increased survival and developmental challenges during the early life stages. To this end, two experiments were carried out as follows: in the first, goat transitional milk was administered via an oro-esophageal feeding tube to all piglets in the litter; in the second, concentrated transitional milk was administered via an oral dispenser to whole litters composed of low-birth-weight piglets. Performance parameters, mortality, and serum IgG levels were measured. In Experiment 1, supplementation with goat colostrum showed a tendency to improve weight in piglets <= 1100 g, with no significant effect on temperature, serum IgG level, or mortality. In Experiment 2, supplementation with goat colostrum did not affect live weight, rectal temperature, or serum IgG levels at 10 and 21 days. However, there was a trend towards lower mortality at 21 days in the supplemented piglets. These results suggest that goat transitional milk may provide context-dependent benefits, with a potentially greater impact on vulnerable piglets in more difficult conditions. Furthermore, its use represents a sustainable strategy to valorize surplus milk from goat farms.

AB  - Cladocerans, an important zooplankton community, are consumers from the base of the food web of aquatic environments. We investigated the contribution of producers (phytoplankton and periphytic biofilm) and particulate organic carbon (POC). Collections were carried out in lakes of the Upper Parana River Floodplain, the last stretch free of dams in the second-largest South American basin. Isotope ratios (delta 13C and delta 15N) were measured, besides the contributions of probable food sources to the cladocerans biomass. The phytoplankton constituted the source of carbon for cladocerans, followed by POC. Thus this work, in addition to emphasizing the importance of cladocerans in nutrient cycling, highlighted the need for the conservation of environments surrounding the lakes as they are the sources of organic matter for aquatic communities. Besides, the analyzed zooplanktonic organisms demonstrated their role in the interconnection between the green and brown food webs, which have been studied separately for a long time.

AB  - Simple Summary Cervidae represents a substantial family within the Artiodactyla, yet their phylogenetic relationship has not been fully clarified due to limited data available. With the increasing availability of genomic data, there is now an opportunity to further explore their phylogenetic relationship. In our study, we employed a comparative genomics approach focusing on the chromosome-level genomes of eight Cervidae species to explore their phylogenetic relationship and chromosomal evolutionary events. Furthermore, we conducted an analysis of gene families to identify those potentially involved in adaptive evolution.Abstract Cervidae represents a family that is not only rich in species diversity but also exhibits a wide range of karyotypes. The controversies regarding the phylogeny and classification of Cervidae still persist. The flourishing development of the genomic era has made it possible to address these issues at the genomic level. Here, the genomes of nine species were used to explore the phylogeny and chromosomal evolutionary events of Cervidae. By conducting whole-genome comparisons, we identified single-copy orthologous genes across the nine species and constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the single-copy orthologous genes sequences, providing new insights into the phylogeny of Cervidae, particularly the phylogenetic relationship among sika deer, red deer, wapiti and Tarim red deer. Gene family analysis revealed contractions in the olfactory receptor gene family and expansions in the histone gene family across eight Cervidae species. Furthermore, synteny analysis was used to explore the chromosomal evolutionary events of Cervidae species, revealing six chromosomal fissions during the evolutionary process from Bovidae to Cervidae. Notably, specific chromosomal fusion events were found in four species of Cervus, and a unique chromosomal fusion event was identified in Muntiacus reevesi. Our study further completed the phylogenetic relationship within the Cervidae and demonstrated the feasibility of inferring species phylogeny at the whole-genome level. Additionally, our findings on gene family evolution and the chromosomal evolutionary events in eight Cervidae species lay a foundation for comprehensive research of the evolution of Cervidae.

AB  - Organic solid wastes (OSWs) are important reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Aerobic composting transforms OSWs into fertilizers. In this study, we investigated ARGs dynamics and their driving mechanisms in three OSW composts: pig manure (PM), kitchen waste (KC), and sewage sludge (SG). The dominant ARGs were different in each OSW, namely tetracycline, aminoglycoside, and macrolide resistance (PM); tetracyclines and aminoglycosides (KC); and sulfonamides (SG). ARGs abundance decreased in PM (71%) but increased in KC (5.9fold) and SG (1.3-fold). Interestingly, the ARGs abundance was generally similar in all final composts, which was contributed to the similar bacterial community in final composts. In particular, sulfonamide and & beta;-lactam resistant genes removed (100%) in PM, while sulfonamide in KC (38-fold) and tetracycline in SG (5-fold) increased the most. Additionally, ARGs abundance rebounded during the maturation period in all treatments. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the main ARGs hosts. Several persistent and high-risk genes included tetW, aadA, aadE, tetX, strB, tetA, mefA, intl1, and intl2. The structural equation models showed ARGs removal was mainly affected by physicochemical parameters and bacterial communities in PM, the ARGs enrichment in KC composting correlated with increased mobile genetic elements (MGEs). In general, thermophilic aerobic composting can inhibit the vertical gene transfer (VGT) of pig manure and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of sludge, but it increases the HGT of kitchen waste, resulting in a dramatic increase of ARGs in KC compost. More attention should be paid to the ARGs risk of kitchen waste composting.

AB  - Raghunandan Hills Reserve is an important protected area in Bangladesh that supports some remnant patches of natural forest and is the habitat of several globally threatened primates including Western Hoolock Gibbon, Northern Pig-tailed Macaque, and Capped Langur. However, deforestation and forest degradation due to anthropogenic factors, such as illegal logging and fuelwood collection are age-old problems at Raghunandan. The areas of the reserve vulnerable to future conversions due to the possible proximate or underlaying causes were unknown. This study analyzed the historical trend of forest and land-use/landcover transitions at Raghunandan Hills Reserve from 1995 until 2015 at a 10-year interval using Monte Carlo spectral unmixing and knowledge-based classification approaches to Landsat satellite images in Claslite and ArcGIS software. Based on the past trend, it then predicted the future trend of forest land-use/landcover transitions for 2025 and 2035 using an artificial multi-layer perceptron neural network with Markov Chain machine learning algorithm integrated into the land change modeler module of IDRISI/TerrSet software. Results indicated that similar to 30 % to 35% of the total area of the reserve was covered by forest, which included patches of natural forest and plantations, whereas the remaining area was occupied by non-forest categories like scattered degraded forests, grasses, and shrubs. Forest cover declined during 1995-2005, and then increased slightly during 2005-2015 due to afforestation activities. This trend is likely to continue in the future with forest cover occupying nearly 40% of the reserve by 2025 and 2035. Along with identifying the areas where the forest is likely to be expanded, the areas of the reserve vulnerable to deforestation (hotspots) were also highlighted and quantified in the form of maps and statistics.

AB  - BackgroundAnimals of many different species, trophic levels, and life history strategies migrate, and the improvement of animal tracking technology allows ecologists to collect increasing amounts of detailed data on these movements. Understanding when animals migrate is important for managing their populations, but is still difficult despite modelling advancements.MethodsWe designed a model that parametrically estimates the timing of migration from animal tracking data. Our model identifies the beginning and end of migratory movements as signaled by change-points in step length and turning angle distributions. To this end, we can also use the model to estimate how an animal's movement changes when it begins migrating. In addition to a thorough simulation analysis, we tested our model on three datasets: migratory ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis) in the Great Plains, barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) in northern Canada, and non-migratory brown bears (Ursus arctos) from the Canadian Arctic.ResultsOur simulation analysis suggests that our model is most useful for datasets where an increase in movement speed or directional autocorrelation is clearly detectable. We estimated the beginning and end of migration in caribou and hawks to the nearest day, while confirming a lack of migratory behaviour in the brown bears. In addition to estimating when caribou and ferruginous hawks migrated, our model also identified differences in how they migrated; ferruginous hawks achieved efficient migrations by drastically increasing their movement rates while caribou migration was achieved through significant increases in directional persistence.ConclusionsOur approach is applicable to many animal movement studies and includes parameters that can facilitate comparison between different species or datasets. We hope that rigorous assessment of migration metrics will aid understanding of both how and why animals move.

AB  - BACKGROUNDGoat milk is considered a nutritionally superior resource, owing to its advantageous nutritional attributes. Nevertheless, it is susceptible to spoilage and the persistence of pathogens. Electron beam irradiation stands as a promising non-thermal processing technique capable of prolonging shelf life with minimal residue and a high degree of automation.RESULTSThe effects of electron beam irradiation (2, 3, 5, and 7 kGy) on microorganisms, physicochemical properties, and protein structure of goat milk compared with conventional pasteurized goat milk (PGM) was evaluated. It was found that a 2 kGy electron beam irradiation reduces the total microbial count of goat milk by 6-logs, and the irradiated goat milk protein secondary structure showed a significant decrease in alpha-helix content. Low irradiation doses led to microaggregation and crosslinking. In contrast, high doses (>= 5 kGy) slightly disrupted the aggregates and decreased the particle size, disrupting the microscopic surface structure of goat milk, verified by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy.CONCLUSIONThe irradiation of goat milk with a 2 kGy electron beam may effectively inactivate harmful microorganisms in the milk and maintain/or improve the physicochemical quality and protein structure of goat milk compared to thermal pasteurization.

AB  - Studies on human-elephant interactions are typically confined to a single country. Since elephants traverse international boundaries, it is critical to comprehend human-elephant interactions along their migration routes and recognize the significance of conserving these animals. A rapid appraisal was conducted to primarily understand the human-elephant dynamics in the transboundary lowlands of the Kangchenjunga landscape, encompassing regions of Bhutan, India, and Nepal, and highlight community-identified options for coexistence between humans and elephants in the shared landscape. Elephant populations in the transboundary landscape faced significant threats due to habitat loss and fragmentation as a result of increasing human settlements, agriculture, and infrastructure development. Habitat reduction and dietary changes were common reasons for the increased raids by elephants on human settlements for food. Conflict prevention and mitigation were hindered by inadequate resources, while waste mismanagement aggravated human-elephant conflicts. Limited expertise among forest personnel and ineffective compensation systems further challenged wildlife conservation. Some potential options identified by communities as vital for human-elephant coexistence included habitat restoration, capacity building, livelihood diversification, cultivation of non-palatable crops, financial incentives for recultivating fallow land, standardization of compensation and insurance practices, transboundary cooperation, and building tolerance through alternative techniques. These strategies were aimed at mitigating conflicts, promoting understanding, ensuring sustainable cohabitation, and emphasizing the importance of collaboration between governments, conservation organizations, and local communities to safeguard elephants and enhance conservation efforts.

AB  - Organic amendments such as biochar and vermicompost have been reported to improve soil and plant properties. However, whether the co-application of the two amendments has a synergistic effect on the alleviation of vegetable continuous cropping obstacles in plastic shed cultivation is still unclear. This study investigated the single and joint effects of biochar and vermicompost on the improvement of soil quality and cucumber yield and quality in plastic shed soil that had been continuously cultivated for 0, 5, and 20 years in northern China. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with four treatments: control, without the addition of biochar (CK); 15 t/ha biochar (BC); 15 t ha? 1 vermicompost (VC); and 7.5 t ha? 1 biochar + 7.5 t ha? 1 vermicompost (BV). The results showed that the single and joint application of biochar and vermicompost generally improved soil properties and increased cucumber yield and quality. Soil pH was most significantly increased (1.24?2.46%) by BC treatments, followed by BV treatments, which generally performed the best in decreasing soil electrical conductivity (EC) and increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the amounts of fungi and bacteria. The BV treatments also most significantly improved the fruit quality and increased cucumber yields by 29.2?56.0%. The results of structural equation modeling showed that soil pH, DOC, available phosphorus, available potassium, and the amounts of fungi and bacteria positively contributed to cucumber fruit yield and quality, whereas soil EC had a negative effect. These properties also interacted with each other (e.g., there were strong correlations among soil EC, pH, DOC, nutrients, and the amounts of fungi and bacteria), thereby indirectly affecting cucumber yield and quality. The co-application of biochar and vermicompost is therefore recommended for the alleviation of continuous cropping obstacles in plastic shed cultivation.

AB  - Potassium-oxygen batteries (KOB) are a promising energy storage technology with high theoretical energy of 935 Wh/kg and long cycle life. Potential applications require the development of affordable cathode materials with high practical capacity. In this article, we show that low-cost polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) treatment increases the discharge performance of a commercial carbon paper cathode. Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy reveals that PTFE alleviates mass transport limitations and facilitates homogeneous deposition of the discharge product potassium superoxide (KO2) within the cathode pore structure. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we found that PTFE, in combination with the appropriate electrolyte volume, can prevent pore flooding by the electrolyte. Free volume permits fast, gaseous oxygen transport throughout the cathode, which lowers mass transfer resistances and improves the rate capability. Moreover, PTFE enables high pore volume filling by KO2 and, in turn, high discharge capacity. Our results demonstrate that controlling the mass transport is essential for high-performance cathodes for KOB.

AB  - Range expansion in plant populations, especially at the colonization front, can be either limited by disproportionately large effects of antagonistic interactions or facilitated by their release. How the strength of antagonistic interactions changes along successional gradients during range expansion is still poorly documented, especially when diverse assemblages of plant antagonists (rodents, invertebrates and birds) combine within interaction networks. We study the changes in individual-based, predispersal seed-pulp predator networks along a colonization gradient in a rapidly expanding Juniperus phoenicea population in Donana National Park (SW Spain). Additionally, we analysed the role of individual plant traits and neighbourhood attributes in network configuration by using Exponential Random Graph Models. Seven seed-pulp consumer animal species varied significantly in their frequency of interaction and prevalence. While invertebrate species were well-established in old and intermediately mature stands, greenfinch Chloris chloris was dominant at the colonization front. Variable species roles and spread of interactions among individual plants generated changes in the configuration of interactions during plant expansion. Individual plant traits strongly determined the topology of these networks, although with differences between stands. Increasing individual crop size and seeds per cone increased the interaction odds of individual plants, while seed viability showed the opposite effect. The network topology at the colonization front appeared less driven by individual traits, possibly because of the short interaction history of this recently established area. The disproportionately large effect of C. chloris in these recently established stands, potentially resulted in large seed losses during range expansion. Synthesis. Turnover of antagonistic interactions, characterized the colonization front, resulting in more heterogeneous interaction strengths among individual plants. We found no evidence for a complete or sizeable antagonistic release of J. phoenicea at the colonization front promoting this rapid expansion. It becomes necessary to explore interactions with seed dispersers to understand how antagonistic and mutualistic plant-animal interactions balance during range expansion. Our study highlights the importance of an individual-based approach in understanding how interactions are structured and driven in natural changing landscapes.

AB  - Historical landings from the Food and Agriculture Organization (1950-2015) were used to estimate the contribution of the Peruvian batoid fishery to the eastern Pacific Ocean, and species-specific landings from Instituto del Mar del Peru (1997-2015) were used to identify the most-landed species, their landings sites and monthly variation throughout the year, and fishing gear types most used. The regulatory and research landscape were evaluated toward identifying potential gaps that may be hindering conservation and management of batoids in Peru. Results showed that in the eastern Pacific, Peru ranked second, after Chile, for batoid landings from 1950 to 2015. Of the twenty-three species of marine batoids that interact with Peruvian fisheries, the most landed taxonomic groups, from 1997 to 2015, were: Myliobatis spp. (i.e., M. chilensis and M. peruvianus; 45% of batoids landings), Mobula spp. (primarily M. mobular, and secondarily M. thurstoni, M. munkiana, M. tarapacana; 28%), Pseudobatos planiceps (6%), and Hypanus dipterurus (6%). Most of these species are landed in northern Peru, where gillnets are the mostused fishing gear to capture them. Batoid landings occurred year-round; yet, for H. dipterurus and P. planiceps landings were highest during the austral summer. Only three management measures exist for batoids fisheries in Peru for three species (i.e., M. birostris, Pristis pristis, Rhinoptera steindachneri) and two taxa (i.e., Mobula and Myliobatis) which are not fully enforced. Batoid research in Peru is limited, with only 25 publications from 1978 to 2022, in which the most studied species are Mobula birostris, M. chilensis and M. peruvianus. This study establishes an information baseline for batoids in Peru that can help guide their management, research, and conservation.

AB  - Camera traps have great potential for generating wildlife insights by providing high resolution site-specific data. Methods of data collection and analysis reliant on these tools for population density estimation can be relatively resource intensive, hindering their mainstream adoption. Here, we explore the potential of population density estimates derived from a distance sampling method based on optics theory, which greatly simplifies the process of setting up camera sites and analysing data. Specifically, we (1) tested the method on human subjects in an artificial environment, (2) compared it to another method relying on virtual grids on images using wild populations of black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) and African civet (Civettictis civetta) in South Africa and (3) deployed it to estimate wild boar (Sus scrofa) population densities in Hungary. The initial human trials resulted in an estimate that was extremely close to true population density. When compared to the virtual grid method, results suggest that our distance sampling method can deliver accurate estimates with increased convenience and robustness against disruptions of the camera sites. The wild boar study resulted in a realistic density estimate, which can be used as a baseline when assessing future fluctuations in population density. As this new approach does not have special requirements for setting up camera sites, it is efficient and widely applicable across other density estimation methods requiring an estimate for effective detection distance. Additionally, the method can be applied in the retrospective analysis of existing datasets.
   Camera traps offer valuable wildlife data but analysis can be resource-intensive. Estimating distance based on animal size could enable efficient, retrospective analysis of diverse datasets. We assess the use of this approach on South African carnivores and Hungarian wild boar.image

AB  - Human settlement and agricultural activities restrict increasingly the range of large mammals in many cases contributing to declining numbers of ungulates. Here, we studied home range size and habitat selection of seven adult female mountain nyalas in the northern end of the Bale Mountains National Park (BMNP) equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars. Home range size was estimated using fixed kernel density and habitat selection was determined by resource selection functions. We found that female mountain nyalas have much smaller (5.7 km(2)) home ranges than the 19 km(2) home range size predicted for a 170 kg, group-living species living in mixed habitats. Home ranges were 30% larger in the night than in the daytime. We suggest that the night extension beyond the park boundaries was caused by high livestock and other ungulates grazing pressure within the protected area which may cause forage-driven excursions out of the park. On the other hand, mountain nyalas are probably attracted by humans as shields against hyena predation. The resource selection index indicates that bushland and forest habitat are the most preferred habitat types, while agriculture and human settlements are the least preferred habitats. The small size of the northern part of the Bale Mountain National Park (31 km(2)) with the current high density of mountain nyala (24 individuals/km(2)) is too small for the predicted home range size of large ungulates. Hence, we suggest that protecting additional area may be needed for the long-term conservation of the endangered mountain nyala.

AB  - SMAD4, SMAD5 and SMAD7 belonging to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily are indispensable for oocyte formation and development, ovarian organogenesis and folliculogenesis. However, only a few studies have investigated the characteristics of SMAD4, SMAD5 and SMAD7 in Tibetan sheep and the effect of their polymorphism on litter size. In this study, we examined the expression of SMAD4, SMAD5 and SMAD7 in 13 tissues of Tibetan sheep by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Further, cDNA of these genes was cloned, sequenced and subjected to bioinformatics analysis. DNA sequencing was also used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, iM-LDR (TM) technology was used for SNP genotyping. Associations between polymorphisms and litter size were analyzed using data from genotyping of 433 Tibetan sheep. The results showed that the expression of SMAD4, SMAD5 and SMAD7 genes was ubiquitous in the tissues of Tibetan sheep, such as the ovary, uterus and oviduct, hypothalamus, hypophysis, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, rumen, duodenum and longissimus dorsi. However, the expression was unbalanced and upregulated in the spleen, lung, ovary and uterus and downregulated in the longissimus dorsi. The bioinformatics analysis showed that SMAD4, SMAD5 and SMAD7 in Tibetan sheep encoded proteins of 533, 465 and 427 amino acids, respectively. Sequence homology analysis of the three proteins among other animals showed that the sequences of SMAD4, SMAD5 and SMAD7 of Tibetan sheep were similar to those in sheep, yak, cattle, dog, human, pig, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey and house mouse. Two synonymous mutations, g.51537A>G and g.319C>T, were detected in SMAD5 and SMAD7, respectively. The associations of these SNPs and litter size were determined, and it was found that both g.51537A>G and g.319C>T have no significant effect on the litter size of Tibetan sheep. The results provided novel insights into the molecular characterization, expression profiles and polymorphisms of SMAD4, SMAD5 and SMAD7 in Tibetan sheep, but our results do not support associations between these genes and the litter size of Tibetan sheep.

AB  - Simple Summary Humans alter how carnivores interact with one another by changing landscapes and inciting fear. We investigated how four mesocarnivores (medium-sized carnivores), the red fox, leopard cat, Asian badger, and hog badger, partition their activity pattern to co-occur under varying human influences in the Taihang Mountains of China. Using camera-trapping data collected from 2016 to 2020, we revealed that the leopard cats and the badgers reduced their activities during the day at sites with high-level human disturbance, possibly a behavioral mechanism to avoid risks while living in human-dominated landscapes. However, the activity pattern overlap did not increase between mesocarnivore pairs, suggesting that they may use strategies other than niche segregation along the temporal dimension to coexist. Mesocarnivores play essential roles in terrestrial ecosystems, but anthropocentric disturbances have profoundly transformed their intraguild interactions worldwide. In this study, we explored how a guild of four mesocarnivores (red fox Vulpes vulpes, leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis, Asian badger Meles leucurus, and hog badger Arctonyx collaris) partition their temporal niche in the temperate montane forests in North China under different human influences. We conducted a systemic camera-trapping survey on the study species in the central Taihang Mountains from 2016 to 2020. With an extensive survey effort of 111,063 camera-days from 187 camera stations, we obtained 10,035 independent detections of the four mesocarnivores and examined the activity patterns of each species under different levels of human disturbance and their overlaps. The results showed that, while the leopard cat and the badgers shifted their activity towards nocturnality, the red fox showed no significant change. The leopard cat's degree of nocturnality varied between growing and non-growing seasons, likely a response to avoid humans and other competitors. However, the activity overlaps between species pairs demonstrated no statistically significant difference, indicating a long-developed coexistence mechanism that is homogenous across the landscape. Demonstrating how mesocarnivores shift activity patterns in response to human risks while partitioning resources, this study enhances our understanding of mesocarnivore behavioral changes and interspecific interactions at human-nature interfaces.

AB  - Background The timing of migration for herbivorous migratory birds is thought to coincide with spring phenology as emerging vegetation supplies them with the resources to fuel migration, and, in species with a capital breeding strategy also provides individuals with energy for use on the breeding grounds. Individuals with very long migration distances might however have to trade off between utilising optimal conditions en route and reaching the breeding grounds early, potentially leading to them overtaking spring on the way. Here, we investigate whether migration distance affects how closely individually tracked Eurasian wigeons follow spring phenology during spring migration. Methods We captured wigeons in the Netherlands and Lithuania and tracked them throughout spring migration to identify staging sites and timing of arrival. Using temperature-derived indicators of spring phenology, we investigated how maximum longitude reached and migration distance affected how closely wigeons followed spring. We further estimated the impact of tagging on wigeon migration by comparing spring migratory timing between tracked individuals and ring recovery data sets. Results Wigeons migrated to locations between 300 and 4000 km from the capture site, and migrated up to 1000 km in a single day. We found that wigeons migrating to more north-easterly locations followed spring phenology more closely, and increasingly so the greater distance they had covered during migration. Yet we also found that despite tags equalling only around 2% of individual's body mass, individuals were on average 11-12 days slower than ring-marked individuals from the same general population. Discussion Overall, our results suggest that migratory strategy can vary dependent on migration distance within species, and even within the same migratory corridor. Individual decisions thus depend not only on environmental cues, but potentially also trade-offs made during later life-history stages.

AB  - In seasonal environments, maintaining a constant body temperature poses challenges for endotherms. Cold winters at high latitudes, with limited food availability, create opposing demands on metabolism: upregulation preserves body temperature but depletes energy reserves. Examining endocrine profiles, such as thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) and glucocorticoids (GCs), proxies for changes in metabolic rate and acute stressors, offer insights into physiological trade-offs. We evaluated how environmental conditions and gestation impact on faecal hormone metabolites (fT3Ms and fGCMs) from late winter to spring in a free -living population of Carneddau ponies. Faecal T3Ms were highest in late February and March, when temperatures were lowest. Then, fT3Ms concentrations decreased throughout April and were at the lowest in May before increasing towards the end of the study. The decline in fT3M levels in April and May was associated with warmer weather but poor food availability, diet diversity and diet composition. On the other hand, fGCM levels did not display a clear temporal pattern but were associated with reproductive status, where pregnant and lactating females had higher fGCM levels as compared to adult males and non -reproductive females. The temporal profile of fT3Ms levels highlights metabolic trade-offs in a changing environment. In contrast, the ephemeral but synchronous increase in fGCM concentrations across the population suggest a shared experience of acute stressors (i.e., weather, disturbance or social). This multi -biomarker approach can evaluate the role of acute stressors versus energy budgets in the context of interventions, reproduction, seasonality and environmental change, or across multiple scales from individuals to populations.

AB  - Camelina sative is commonly called false flax, which is a low-input crop currently researched as an alternate oilseed crop. Different abiotic stress disturbed the physiological and biochemical processes in seeds. Germination or emergence are considered critical phases in the ontogeny of plants. A number of experiments were planned under control conditions to know the response of C. sativa seeds' germination, emergence, and establishment of seedlings to different environmental factors. Results revealed that C. sativa showed maximum germination and seedling growth at 25/15 degrees C day/night temperature; however, decreasing trends were shown at 35/25 degrees C. Camelina sativa germination was influenced by pH ranging from 5 to 10 and sensitive to acidic and saline mediums. Reduction in seed germination was noted when NaCl at 250 mM concentration was applied, while 300 mM NaCl concentration completely inhibited the germination. The effect of osmotic potential from 0 to -0.2 MPa was nontime to start germination, mean germination time, germination index, and seedling establishment of C. sativa are significantly influenced by environmental factors. Seed ecological information of this species will be helpful to determine its potential distribution in new localities, especially in problem soils. Furthermore, understanding the seed ecological preferences of C. sativa enables farmers to identify suitable locations for cultivation. Overall, integrating the germination attributes and seed ecological information into cultivation strategies helps the farmers mitigate risks and achieve more efficient and sustainable C. sativa production.

AB  - Reproductive senescence, the decline in reproductive performance with increasing age, is extensively documented in females but much less investigated in males. However, senescence of secondary sexual traits in males, such as horns or antlers, has been reported across various vertebrate species. Our study investigates reproductive senescence in antler size, a conspicuous precopulatory trait in male deer, by taking advantage of detailed monitoring of a free-ranging population of Fallow Deer (Dama dama) living in a peri-urban area. We focused on 2 metrics utilizing noninvasive photogrammetry to measure antler length and palm width in 127 free-living males. Our results demonstrate clear evidence of reproductive senescence, with both antler length and palm width declining synchronously from approximately 7 years of age onwards. This decline matches previously reported decreases in male mating success from ages 6 to 7, suggesting that antler size may impact sexual competition and mating success. Males older than 7 years of age may experience reduced competitive abilities and diminished attractiveness to females. This study provides new evidence of senescence of antler size in cervids, enhancing our understanding of the eco-evolutionary factors driving male senescence and emphasizing the importance that antler size may have in the reproductive success of Fallow Deer.
   This study provides evidence of antler size senescence in Fallow Deer (Dama dama), starting from approximately 7 years of age, with a simultaneous decline in antler length and palm width. These results align with the senescence previously observed in male mating success, suggesting that antler size may impact mating success and sexual competition in Fallow Deer.

AB  - Oxidation modeling in modern nuclear fuel performance codes is currently limited by the lack of coupling with mechanics, thus preventing proper description of how high-temperature oxidation impacts mechanical properties. This is mostly due to the fact that the finite difference formalism adopted in corrosion models is incompatible with the direct coupling with mechanics in the finite element modeling employed in modern nuclear fuel performance codes. In this study, a physically based zirconium alloy corrosion model called the Coupled-Current Charge Compensation (C4) model, which was initially developed for operating temperature conditions, has been updated to include high-temperature corrosion in order to provide additional critical information (e.g., oxygen concentration profile) under loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) conditions-information lacking in existing empirical models. The C4 model was implemented in the MOOSE finite-element framework developed at Idaho National Laboratory, enabling it to be used in the BISON nuclear fuel performance code based on the MOOSE framework. To precisely track the different interfaces at a relatively low computational cost, the eXtended Finite Element Method (X-FEM) was applied in MOOSE. The model's results were compared to those of existing empirical models as well as metallographic analysis of high-temperature oxidized Zircaloy-4 coupons. Oxygen diffusivities in the alpha and j3 phases resulting from this comparison closely agree with those found in the literature. The C4 model implemented with X-FEM in MOOSE now has the capability to accurately predict oxide, oxygenstabilized alpha, and prior j3 phase layer growth kinetics under isothermal exposure at high temperature (1000-1500 degrees C). Furthermore, in contrast with the empirical models, the C4 model accounts for the finite thickness of the fuel cladding. It can predict the oxygen concentration profile evolution through the whole cladding, enabling evaluation of the remaining ductile thickness-a crucial variable for modeling the mechanical behavior of the fuel cladding under LOCA. This implementation allows direct coupling with mechanics, at a low computing cost, using finite-element-based nuclear fuel performance codes such as BISON.

AB  - This study evaluated the impacts of the mining tailings after the rupture of the Funda & SIM;o dam on fish communities on the Atlantic Ocean southeast coast. Four sample collections were carried out over two years (2018-2020), in seasonal periods. Omnivorous/herbivorous and carnivorous fish were collected for analysis of metal bioaccumulation, multibiomarkers of environmental contamination and histopathology. Metal bioaccumulation was stronger correlated in carnivorous fish in the dry-2018 collection, besides higher activity of antioxidant enzymes, energy metabolism and higher morphological damage; however, there was less oxidative damage and less metallothioneins induction, and these variables were strongly associated with the wet-2020 collection. In a temporal view, it was possible to observe a reduction in metal levels in fish, except in the mouth of the Doce River. These events can be explained by seasonal natural events, which tend the resuspension and boost metal levels, mainly in the mouth region during the rainy season.

AB  - We studied diet and prey preferences of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) inhabiting south-east Poland, based on kills found during GPS-GSM telemetry and opportunistic winter tracking. Among 64 lynx kills were roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) (91%), red deer (Cervus elaphus) (3%) and brown hare (Lepus europaeus) (6%). From the ungulate community, lynx selected roe deer (D = 0.845) and avoided all other ungulates. We recorded one case of surplus and two cases of parallel killing. Lynx visited the same killed roe deer on average for 2.3 days, and for up to six days when surplus or parallel killing occurred. High numbers of the roe deer in south-east Poland supports the persistence of the lynx, but we urge managers to take under consideration food requirements of the lynx when planning game management.

AB  - The root-associated microbiome significantly influences plant health and pest resistance, yet the temporal dynamics of its compositional and functional change in response to Ectropis grisescens Warren (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) infestation remain largely unexplored. The study took samples of leaves, roots, and rhizosphere soil at different times after the plants were attacked by E. grisescens. These samples were analyzed using transcriptomic and high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA techniques. The goal was to understand how the plant's defense mechanisms and the microbial community around the roots changed after the attack. Additionally, bacterial feedback assays were conducted to evaluate the effects of selected microbial strains on plant growth and pest defense responses. By conducting 16S rRNA sequencing on the collected soil samples, we found significant shifts in bacterial communities by the seventh day, suggesting a lag in community adaptation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that E. grisescens attack induced reprogramming of the tea root transcriptome, upregulating genes related to defensive pathways such as phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis. Metagenomic data indicated functional changes in the rhizosphere microbiome, with enrichment in genes linked to metabolic pathways and nitrogen cycling. Network analysis showed a reorganization of core microbial members, favoring nitrogen-fixing bacteria like Burkholderia species. Bacterial feedback assays confirmed that selected strains, notably Burkholderia cepacia strain ABC4 (T1) and a nine-strain consortium (T5), enhanced plant growth and defense responses, including elevated levels of flavonoids, polyphenols, caffeine, jasmonic acid, and increased peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. This study emphasizes the potential of utilizing root-associated microbial communities for sustainable pest management in tea cultivation, thereby enhancing resilience in tea crops while maintaining ecosystem balance.

AB  - This review explores the impact of transport-related stresses on the quality of liquid-preserved artificial insemination (AI) doses in pig reproduction. Transport of boar semen from AI centers to sow farms, the place of application, is an essential part of the production chain with increasing international demand, especially against the background of growing export demand. Understanding how factors such as: a) transport-related vibration emissions; b) temperature fluctuations during transport; c) transport duration; d) duration of storage after transport; and e) the method used for preserving AI doses, affect their quality is, therefore, essential for optimizing fertility outcomes. We provide a review of existing literature on the biological responses of liquidpreserved boar sperm to transport conditions. In addition, we discuss their impact on sperm quality and summarize potential mitigation strategies.

AB  - When facing changes in the available forage fish composition and distribution, seabirds are expected to respond by switching their prey species and/or adjusting their key foraging areas. We studied chick-rearing Rhinoceros Auklets Cerorhincamonocerata at Teuri Island, Japan, across three successive years. We examined inter-annual and seasonal changes in their prey species by sampling bill-loads fed to chicks, and surveyed their foraging areas using GPS data-loggers. In 2020, auklets foraged on sand lance Ammodytes spp. in shallow coastal areas along the mainland, similar to 150 km from the colony. In 2021 however, they foraged on an alternative prey, age-0 Greenling Pleurogrammusazonus, in cool basin deep waters > 150 km away in the early season, and later switched to Herring Clupeapallasii caught in warm coastal waters. In 2022, they foraged on Anchovy Engraulisjaponicus in offshore and coastal waters < 150 km away. These changes in the auklets' foraging areas mirrored the respective habitat of the dominant prey species in each case. In turn, these changes determined their foraging trip duration: the birds made longer trips in 2021 (45.5 h) than in 2020 (30.9 h) or 2022 (22.8 h). Longer overnight trips undertaken when auklets foraged in areas more than 130-180 km away from the colony, likely decreased chick meal frequency in this day-foraging/night-provisioning species. Although they could make longer foraging trips than day-foraging/day-provisioning species, the inter-annual variability of forage fish community might result in more frequent reproductive failure under the unconventional climate regime currently in place around Japan.

AB  - Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) can reflect the balance of resource allocation and trade-offs, as well as the adaptability of plants to the environment. Alterations in environmental conditions across an elevation gradient may impact the carbon balance within leaves. Nonetheless, it remains highly uncertain whether the effect of elevation on NSCs differs among species and sexes. To reveal the response patterns of leaf NSCs in dioecious plants with elevation, Populus cathayana Rehd. and Hippophae rhamnoides L., distributed at four elevations in the subalpine region of western Sichuan, China, were selected, and female and male leaves were sampled and measured for their contents of NSCs, soluble sugar, and starch. Meanwhile, the relationships of NSCs, soluble sugar, and starch with leaf nitrogen and phosphorus were analyzed. The results showed that the elevational patterns of NSCs were mainly dependent on species and were slightly affected by sex. Leaf NSCs in both sexes of P. cathayana did not exhibit significant linear changes, whereas those in H. rhamnoides increased significantly and linearly with elevation. For P. cathayana, a significant increase in leaf starch with elevation was only found in female plants and may benefit from phosphorus deficiency, as it was significantly negatively correlated with phosphorus. However, leaf soluble sugar and starch between sexes of H. rhamnoides showed similar patterns of significant increases with elevation, and they were not correlated significantly with nitrogen and phosphorus. This might be due to H. rhamnoides, which is a nitrogen-fixing plant and thereby did not show deficiencies or limitations in nitrogen and phosphorus, as shown by the decreased or unchanged elevational patterns of nitrogen/phosphorus, starch/phosphorus, and soluble sugar/phosphorus. Overall, our results emphasize that species, rather than sex, is an important factor influencing the elevational pattern of NSCs, but for specific species, such as P. cathayana, in this study, there was a divergence in the elevational response of the allocation of starch and soluble sugar between sexes, reflecting the specific adaptive strategies of different plant species or sexes in response to changes in the growing environment.

AB  - Population characteristics of the Barbary sheep Ammotragus lervia, the only wild caprine in Northwest Africa, were investigated in a captive population located in a 150-ha fenced area within the Amassine reserve, Morocco, created for promoting wildlife watching tourism. We analysed the population trend during 20 years since the introduction of 10 individuals in 1999. Using direct counting in March-April 2016 to 2019, before herd dispersal, we assessed population size, age-sex structure, birth and survival rates. We estimated survival rates from mortality analysis using exponential regression models. The population size exhibited fluctuations over time expressed by significant exponential equations. We observed three successive phases corresponding each to a fast-growing period followed by a sharp decline. Estimated population density ranged from 0.25 to 0.41 ind. ha-1. Adult sex ratio varied from 67 to 91 rams per 100 ewes. Juveniles and subadults comprised 27-43 % of the population, and adults, rams and ewes, represented 26-31 % and, 29-45 %, respectively. Birth rate varied from 14 to 73 lambs per 100 ewes. The survival rate during the postnatal year approximated 35 %. For adult rams, it was around 69 % year-1. Our findings would be helpful for developing a sustainable population management plan, and assessing potential reintroduction/restocking in other areas.

AB  - The effects of heat stress and dietary betaine and zinc on growth, weight of organs and plasma biochemistry in growing Iberian pigs are of special importance. Forty Iberian barrows (43.8 kg BW) were assigned to five treatments for 28-d: 1.-thermoneutral (20 degrees C)-ad libitum fed a control diet (TN-CON); 2.-heat stress (30 degrees C)-ad libitum fed a control diet (HS-CON); 3.-thermoneutral-pair-fed a control diet (TN-CON-PF) on the basis of intake of HS-CON; 4.-heat stress-ad libitum fed a betaine-supplemented diet (HS-BET); 5.-heat stress-ad libitum fed a zinc-supplemented diet (HS-ZN).
   Heat stress increased rectal temperature and decreased feed intake. As a result, weight gain under TN-CON was greater than under heat stress or TN-CON-PF. Temperature did not affect gain to feed ratio. Heat stress decreased empty BW, kidneys and spleen weights, and tended to decrease total viscera weight compared to thermoneutral counterparts fed ad libitum, but when organ weight was related to empty BW, only spleen tended to decrease. At identical intake, heat stress tended to decrease heart weight. Betaine and zinc had no effect on organs weight under heat stress. Heat stress decreased albumin and the homeostasis model assessment index for estimating beta-cell function (HOMA-%B), increased glucose, and tended to increase urea compared with the TN pair-fed group. Betaine and zinc decreased plasma glucose under heat stress and increased HOMA-%B suggesting improved beta-cell function. Insulin, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, homeostasis model assessment index for estimating insulin resistance percentage and the rest of biochemical parameters were not affected by treatments. Decreased intake explained the consistent negative effects on performance of pigs after long-term heat stress. Furthermore, it elicited a glucose sparing effect without affecting insulin concentration and increased protein catabolism. Betaine or zinc supplementation did not prevent the negative effect of heat stress on growth performance of Iberian pigs.

AB  - Thermal imaging technology is a developing field in wildlife management. Most thermal imaging work in wildlife science has been limited to larger ungulates and surface-dwelling mammals. Little work has been undertaken on the use of thermal imagers to detect fossorial animals and/or their burrows. Survey methods such as white-light spotlighting can fail to detect the presence of burrows (and therefore the animals within), particularly in areas where vegetation obscures burrows. Thermal imagers offer an opportunity to detect the radiant heat from these burrows, and therefore the presence of the animal, particularly in vegetated areas. Thermal imaging technology has become increasingly available through the provision of smaller, more cost-effective units. Their integration with drone technology provides opportunities for researchers and land managers to utilize this technology in their research/management practices.
   We investigated the ability of both consumer (<AUD$20,000) and professional imagers (>AUD$65,000) mounted on drones to detect rabbit burrows (warrens) and entrances in the landscape as compared to visual assessment.
   Thermal imagery and visual inspection detected active rabbit warrens when vegetation was scarce. The presence of vegetation was a significant factor in detecting entrances (p < .001, alpha = 0.05). The consumer imager did not detect as many warren entrances as either the professional imager or visual inspection (p = .009, alpha = 0.05). Active warren entrances obscured by vegetation could not be accurately identified on exported imagery from the consumer imager and several false-positive detections occurred when reviewing this footage.
   We suggest that the exportable frame rate (Hz) was the key factor in image quality and subsequent false-positive detections. This feature should be considered when selecting imagers and suggest that a minimum export rate of 30 Hz is required. Thermal imagers are a useful additional tool to aid in identification of entrances for active warrens and professional imagers detected more warrens and entrances than either consumer imagers or visual inspection.

AB  - Resistance genes have been identified as emerging pollutants due to their ability to rapidly spread in the environment through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Microbial community serves as the pivotal factor influencing the frequency of HGT during manure composting. However, the characteristics of HGT in microbial community from different types of manure were unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the potential risk of HGT in bacterial community through the co-composting of chicken manure and pig manure in different proportions. The experimental results showed that the abundance of sulfonamide antibiotic resistance genes and integrase genes was higher during pig manure composting than those during chicken manure composting. In addition, the addition of pig manure also increased resistance genes abundance during chicken manure composting. These results suggested that the potential HGT risk was greater during pig manure composting. Furthermore, microbial analysis of co-composting suggested that bacterial community of pig manure was more competitive and adaptable than that of chicken manure. Ultimately, statistical analysis indicated that compared to chicken manure composting, the potential ability of HGT was greater during pig manure composting. This study provided the vital theoretical support and scientific guidance for mitigating the HGT risk during manure composting.

AB  - Predators must contend with numerous challenges to successfully find and subjugate prey. Complex traits related to hunting are partially controlled by a large number of co-evolved genes, which may be disrupted in hybrids. Accordingly, research on the feeding ecology of animals in hybrid zones has shown that hybrids sometimes exhibit transgressive or novel behaviors, yet for many taxa, empirical studies of predation and diet across hybrid zones are lacking. We undertook the first such field study for a hybrid zone between two snake species, the Mojave rattlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus) and the prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis). Specifically, we leveraged established field methods to quantify the hunting behaviors of animals, their prey communities, and the diet of individuals across the hybrid zone in southwestern New Mexico, USA. We found that, even though hybrids had significantly lower body condition indices than snakes from either parental group, hybrids were generally similar to non-hybrids in hunting behavior, prey encounter rates, and predatory attack and success. We also found that, compared to C. scutulatus, C. viridis was significantly more active while hunting at night and abandoned ambush sites earlier in the morning, and hybrids tended to be more viridis-like in this respect. Prey availability was similar across the study sites, including within the hybrid zone, with kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) as the most common small mammal, both in habitat surveys and the frequency of encounters with hunting rattlesnakes. Analysis of prey remains in stomachs and feces also showed broad similarity in diets, with all snakes preying primarily on small mammals and secondarily on lizards. Taken together, our results suggest that the significantly lower body condition of hybrids does not appear to be driven by differences in their hunting behavior or diet and may instead relate to metabolic efficiency or other physiological traits we have not yet identified.

AB  - Purpose: The substantial use of peat as a nursery substrate leads to the destruction of ecologically important peat bogs, necessitating the search for sustainable and suitable alternatives. In this study, we assessed the suitability of sheep manure-based compost as a potential substrate to either partially or complete replace commercial peat in the production of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seedlings. Methods: Five different substrate treatments were used: 100% peat (100% P) served as the control; 100% compost (100% C); 25% C/75% P; 50% C/50% P; and 75% C/25% P. The study followed a completely randomized design, with sixteen replications for each treatment level. Various parameters, including seedling emergence, seedling survival, seedling growth, seedling vigor index, Dickson's quality index, among other variables, were analyzed. Results: Seedling emergence ranged from 87.5 to 100%, with no significant differences among the substrate treatments, suggesting that seedling emergence and initial establishment can be successfully achieved in sheep manure-based compost. For seedling growth, sheep manure-based compost, whether used alone or in combination with peat, also resulted in similar or even better outcomes as compared to the control. For example, in the 100% compost treatment, seedlings exhibited comparable diameter growth and total seedling biomass to those of the control, or 100% peat. However, seedling height was 7.6% greater in the 100% compost substrate when compared to the control, demonstrating the potential growth-promoting effects of utilizing sheep manure-based compost as a growing medium. Conclusions: During our study we found that the quality of seedlings produced in all tested substrates was similar to that of the control. Therefore, as a compost, sheep manure, a locally and widely available resource, shows promise as a viable nursery substrate, potentially entirely replacing the expensive, non-renewable, and environmentally sensitive peat currently being used in nurseries for producing lettuce seedlings.

AB  - Lions and their prey are threatened across most of their range and especially in West and Central Africa. Prey availability influences carnivore densities, social structure, prey preference and home ranges, and changes in prey are important for carnivore management. Scarcity of large prey in many West and Central African ecosystems has been described as leading to a preference for hunting smaller prey in smaller groups. Here we investigated the changes in prey selection of lions in Zakouma National Park (Chad), a protected area in Central Africa that showed significant recovery in wildlife numbers, by collecting feeding data through observations of lions on kills during monitoring drives and GPS cluster points of lion collars. Compared to similar data collected prior to this significant recovery, lions preferred larger prey and fed in larger groups. Our results show that diet shifts due to prey losses can be reversed with restoration of prey populations thanks to improved management, and we speculate that this may be true across large carnivores and across regions.

AB  - Associational effects, whereby plants influence the biotic interactions of their neighbors, are an important component of plant-insect interactions. Plant chemistry has been hypothesized to mediate these interactions. The role of chemistry in associational effects, however, has been unclear in part because the diversity of plant chemistry makes it difficult to tease apart the importance and roles of particular classes of compounds. We examined the chemical ecology of associational effects using backcross-bred plants of the Solanum pennellii introgression lines. We used eight genotypes from the introgression line system to establish 14 unique neighborhood treatments that maximized differences in acyl sugars, proteinase inhibitor, and terpene chemical diversity. We found that the chemical traits of the neighboring plant, rather than simply the number of introgression lines within a neighborhood, influenced insect abundance on focal plants. Furthermore, within-chemical class diversity had contrasting effects on herbivore and predator abundances, and depended on the frequency of neighboring plant chemotypes. Notably, we found insect mobility-flying versus crawling-played a key role in insect response to phytochemistry. We highlight that the frequency and chemical phenotype of plant neighbors underlie associational effects and suggest this may be an important mechanism in maintaining intraspecific phytochemical variation within plant populations.

AB  - Sperm during the freezing and thawing process is damaged by oxidative stress. Thus, its antioxidant scavenger is essential for sperm survival and death in frozen-thawed semen. We used melatonin and silymarin in experiments after the dose-dependent experiment. Our study aimed to identify the effect of melatonin and silymarin on the motility and viability of sperm, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO) production in frozen-thawed boar semen. Melatonin and silymarin were treated alone and cotreated in the fresh boar semen. Boar semen was collected using the gloved-hand method from ten crossbred pigs, and samples were used in the experiments. We evaluated sperm viability using SYBR-14 and PI kit, and ROS and NO production were detected by DCF-DA and DAF-2, respectively. The sperm motility was not significantly different between non-treatment and treatment. ROS and NO production in frozen-thawed sperm were decreased by melatonin and silymarin. Moreover, silymarin significantly reduced NO production more than melatonin. Melatonin and silymarin enhanced the viability of sperm. We suggest that melatonin and silymarin are essential antioxidants in semen cryopreservation for protecting sperm damage and maintaining sperm viability. Melatonin and silymarin may be useful antioxidants in freezing boar sperm.

AB  - Abiotic variables can influence species distributions, often restricting taxa to an acquired climatic signature or conversely, related species are conserved in the same ecological space over millions of years. An investigation into how abiotic change has shaped geographic distributions of taxa may be key to understanding diversification of lineages, and in the absence of reliable morphological characteristics, such information may support taxonomic units at multiple scales. Here, we examine the historical biogeography and patterns of habitat preference within the North American solifuge family, Eremobatidae. A previous study demonstrated that a major taxonomic revision of Eremobatidae is warranted, however recent studies demonstrate high levels of morphological convergence within the group, thus a re-classification of generic boundaries using additional information must be prioritized before we can formally begin solid revisionary efforts. In this study, we aimed to reconstruct a well-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis of Eremobatidae by filtering UCE loci based on informativeness, by mitigating the effect of cogenic UCE on phylogenetic estimation, and by supplementing our curated UCE loci with mitochondrial information. Using our preferred topology, in conjunction with published estimated divergence dates for Eremobatidae, we inferred a time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis to inform the historical biogeography and patterns of habitat preference. The two major habitat types that were observed for Eremobatidae were warm deserts for early diverging taxa and a subsequent evolution to cold deserts and Mediterranean California ecoregions for later diverging taxa. Eremobatid niche space, determined by temperature and precipitation, has been conserved for at least 25 million years in North America, supporting a warm desert origin, and thus supporting high species richness in the Sonoran and Mexican Plateau. Overall, our study provides support for new generic level designations within Eremobatidae.

AB  - Lipid biomarker analysis focused on steroids has shown to have great potential for discriminating between animal faecal inputs in archaeology. This is particularly interesting when applied to stabling deposits to assess herding strategies and livestock composition. Here we present the results of a sedimentary faecal biomarker study conducted at Belmaco Cave, a pre-European archaeological site in La Palma (Canary Islands). The site was occupied by indigenous pastoralist groups over the course of five centuries prior to the first arrival of the Europeans in the 15th century. Previous soil micromorphological data indicates recurrent sheep and/or goat penning and periodic burning of the pen in the central area of the cave. We selected bulk sediment samples from unburned, charred and ashed dung layers and carried out sterol, stanol and bile acid analysis. Our results suggest that the main source of faecal matter is sheep. We also found that even though charred and dung ash layers contained lower concentrations of the biomarker compounds, these were still sufficient to provide information on the origin of the faecal remains. These data add to our current knowledge of the aboriginal Canary Island pastoralist economy.

AB  - Recent advancements in spatial modelling leverage remote sensing data and statistical species -environment relationships to forecast the distribution of a specific species. Our study focuses on Disko Bay in West Greenland, recognized as a significant marine biodiversity hotspot in the region. We conducted comprehensive analyses using multiple datasets spanning from 2010 to 2019, incorporating shrimp and fish surveys, commercial shrimp fishery catches, high -resolution (25 x 25 m) multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data along with a medium -resolution (200 x 200 m) bathymetric model, measured and modelled oceanographic data, and satellite chlorophyll data. Through multivariate regression analysis, we tested the significance of various physical factors (seafloor depth, sediment class, bottom water temperature, bottom water salinity, bottom current velocity, space, and time), biological factors (chlorophyll a , Greenland halibut ( Reinhardtius hippoglossoides )), and anthropogenic impact (shrimp fishery; standardized catch per unit effort) on the density of northern shrimp in the area. Our results indicate a significant association between northern shrimp density, seafloor depth, and sediment class, explaining 36 % of the variation in shrimp density. Subsequently, we developed a high -resolution (optimized) spatial linear mixed - effect model to map the distribution of northern shrimp across Disko Bay, representing the first model of its kind developed for an Arctic area. The optimal habitat for northern shrimp is characterized by medium -deep waters (approximately 150 - 350 m), turbulent conditions, and mixed sediments, predominantly located in the northern and southern regions of Disko Bay. Notably, the northern region hosts a relatively diverse benthic community, with northern shrimp and sponges as the primary contributors of epibenthic biomass. This novel high -resolution model significantly enhances our understanding of the physical drivers and detailed spatial patterns influencing the distribution of northern shrimp in the Arctic.

AB  - The diamondback moth (DBM) is involved in great amount of predominant gut bacterium Enterococcus mundtii . Radish seedlings and cabbage leaves are natural suitable foods to feed the pest in laboratory. Leaf microbiome could be reshaped by insect herbivory. In this study, phyllosphere bacterial composition on radish seedlings with and without DBM herbivory in the chamber, and on cabbage leaves in the field with no DBM herbivory were investigated by high -throughput sequencing technology. Results showed that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota were two common predominant phyla for both radish seedlings and cabbage leaves, while Firmicutes was only detected in phyllosphere of radish seedlings. Pseudomonas was the only common shared phyllosphere genus; Alkanindiges and Delfti a were the unique dominant bacterial genera in cabbage and in radish, respectively. More bacterial varieties and higher bacterial community diversity was also found in cabbages leaves than that of radish seedlings. The bacterial community diversity and richness in radish seedlings fed by DBM was higher than that of not fed. Gut bacterium Enterococcus was only found on radish seedlings leaves that fed by DBM, while neither in radish seedlings nor in cabbage leaves not fed by the pest. As one survey in origin of predominant gut bacterium Enterococcus from DBM, this study offers new insights into the phyllosphere bacterial composition and diversity from the feeding food of DBM in field cabbage leaves and in laboratory radish seedlings.

AB  - Aims Invasive plants often succeed despite attack by generalist herbivores in the introduced range. Whether invasive plants tolerate herbivory by adjusting functional traits, modulating the rhizosphere bacterial community, or both, and how root exudates of native plants influence these tolerance mechanisms, is yet to be tested.
   Methods We examined the impacts of defoliation (simulated herbivory) and root exudates from a native tree Ailanthus altissima on the growth, functional traits, and rhizosphere bacterial community composition of the invasive tree Rhus typhina. We conducted a greenhouse experiment with three levels of simulated herbivory (0%, 40%, and 80% of leaves removed) and four A. altissima root exudate treatments (none, weakened with activated carbon, natural, and added).
   Results In response to defoliation when grown in monoculture, R. typhina decreased aboveground biomass allocation but increased specific leaf area, whereas rhizosphere bacterial community composition was unaffected. When grown in mixture, defoliation decreased total biomass in the weakened root exudates treatment but not with natural and added root exudates, suggesting that A. altissima root exudates reduced R. typhina biomass but increased R. typhina tolerance of defoliation. Ailanthus altissima root exudates also reduced the negative impact of defoliation on putative keystone bacteria relative abundance.
   Conclusions Our results demonstrate that root exudates of native plants can promote tolerance of invasive plants to simulated herbivory via influencing functional traits and potentially also rhizosphere keystone taxa. Our study adds to evidence that plasticity of functional traits and the rhizosphere bacterial community may contribute to invasive plant tolerance of biotic stressors.

AB  - Simple Summary Chronic wasting disease is increasing across the landscape, and this is threatening other wildlife species in addition to cervids. Our objective was to evaluate the possibility that chronic wasting disease could transmit to beavers. Our results indicate that beavers are susceptible to multiple types of prion diseases, including chronic wasting disease. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a contagious, fatal, neurodegenerative prion disease of cervids. The expanding geographical range and rising prevalence of CWD are increasing the risk of pathogen transfer and spillover of CWD to non-cervid sympatric species. As beavers have close contact with environmental and food sources of CWD infectivity, we hypothesized that they may be susceptible to CWD prions. We evaluated the susceptibility of beavers to prion diseases by challenging transgenic mice expressing beaver prion protein (tgBeaver) with five strains of CWD, four isolates of rodent-adapted prions and one strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. All CWD strains transmitted to the tgBeaver mice, with attack rates highest from moose CWD and the 116AG and H95+ strains of deer CWD. Mouse-, rat-, and especially hamster-adapted prions were also transmitted with complete attack rates and short incubation periods. We conclude that the beaver prion protein is an excellent substrate for sustaining prion replication and that beavers are at risk for CWD pathogen transfer and spillover.

AB  - The Laos borders with China, Myanmar, and Thailand have been identified as vulnerable hubs for illegal wildlife trade. In particular, some special economic zones (SEZs) in Laos are linked to illegal wildlife products, including tiger bones, rhino horn, and ivory for sale. SEZs are zones granted more free market-oriented economic policies and flexible governmental measures. In this study, we conducted on-site observations to identify high-valued wildlife, including (parts of) tigers, rhinos, bears, and pangolins in 2 of the 13 SEZs-the Golden Triangle and Boten SEZs-and conducted semistructured interviews with anonymous participants in 2017 and 2019. The trend regarding illegal wildlife trade in these SEZs seems to fluctuate. In the Golden Triangle SEZ, we found that the illegal trade in wildlife is present but occurs more covertly than previously observed; the trade transformed underground to online social media. In Boten SEZ, we found a decrease in bear bile products and an increase in the volume of tiger products openly for sale. Informants explained that the decrease of openly sold wildlife in the Golden Triangle SEZ has been influenced by media and political attention as well as inspections from local authorities, while in Boten SEZ, illegal wildlife traders diversified into tiger products, due to the decline in bear bile products and the reduction in the opportunity to obtain them.

AB  - Cell death is physiologically induced by specific mediators. However, our power to trigger the process in selected cells is quite limited. The protandric shrimp Hippolyte inermis offers a possible answer. Here, we analyse a de novo transcriptome of shrimp post-larvae fed on diatoms. The sex ratio of diatom-fed shrimps versus shrimps fed on control diets was dramatically altered, demonstrating the disruption of the androgenic gland, and their transcriptome revealed key modifications in gene expression. A wide transcriptomic analysis, validated by real-time qPCR, revealed that ferroptosis represents the primary factor to re-shape the body of this invertebrate, followed by further apoptotic events, and our findings open biotechnological perspectives for controlling the destiny of selected tissues. Ferroptosis was detected here for the first time in a crustacean. In addition, this is the first demonstration of a noticeable effect prompted by an ingested food, deeply impacting the gene networks of a young metazoan, definitely determining its future physiology and sexual differentiation.

AB  - Zoo-archaeological and genetic evidence suggest that pigs were domesticated independently in Central China and Eastern Anatolia along with the development of agricultural communities and civilizations. However, the genetic history of domestic pigs, especially in China, has not been fully explored. In this study, we generate 42 complete mitochondrial DNA sequences from similar to 7500- to 2750-year-old individuals from the Yellow River basin. Our results show that the maternal genetic continuity of East Asian domestic pigs dates back to at least the Early to Middle Neolithic. In contrast, the Near Eastern ancestry in European domestic pigs saw a near-complete genomic replacement by the European wild boar. The majority of East Asian domestic pigs share close haplotypes, and the most recent common ancestor of most branches dates back to less than 20,000 years before present, inferred using new substitution rates of whole mitogenomes or combined protein-coding regions. Two major population expansion events of East Asian domestic pigs coincided with changes in climate, widespread adoption of introduced crops, and the development of agrarian societies. These findings add to our understanding of the maternal genetic composition and help to complete the picture of domestic pig evolutionary history in East Asia. Copyright (C) 2021, The Authors.

AB  - In order to explore the effects of planting two economic crops in Moso plantations on the composition of soil phosphorus-functional microbial community, this study collected soil samples of Persimmon and Tea-oil plantations cultivated on the original bamboo soil for 3 years for comparison. Soil physical and chemical measurements and metagenomic sequencing were used to evaluate the effects of crop cultivation on the diversity of soil phosphorus-functional microorganisms. Results show that (1) Moso forests are converted to different crops after the soil pH values decline, and other physical and chemical properties of soil and microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) content rise. (2) Soil microbial community structure changed with crop planting. The number of phosphorus-functional bacteria in Persimmon soil was higher than Tea-oil and Moso soils, with the total number of phosphorus-functional bacteria and unique phosphorus-functional bacteria in Persimmon soil being the highest. (3) The relative abundance of phoU, phoR, ugpA, ugpB, gcd and ppaC genes was significantly increased, while the abundance of pstA, pstB and pstC genes was decreased by crop replanting. (4) The dominant phosphorus-functional microorganisms under different crop cultivation were closely related to basic soil properties. Bradyrhizobium and Camellia abundances were significantly positively correlated with soil total phosphorus (TP), while Sphingomonas was significantly negatively correlated with soil TP. Soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil MBP were positively correlated with the ppx-gppA gene. AP, EC and TN were positively correlated with the phoB gene, while TN and MBP were negatively correlated with the phoP gene. These results suggested that land use patterns could directly change soil environmental conditions, thereby affecting phosphorus-functional microbial communities. In conclusion, the conversion of Moso plantations to commercial crops is beneficial for the optimization of the soil system, promoting the activation and release of soil phosphorus to maintain the dynamic balance of soil microbial community.

AB  - Simple Summary Trace elements include both essential and non-essential elements, some of which are pollutants, while others occur naturally in the environment. Imbalances among these elements pose health risks. The wild boar serves as a valuable bioindicator, sharing many behavioral traits with the domestic pig, especially with those extensively bred. This study noted minor geographical variations and observed higher levels of specific trace elements in young boars based on age differences. Although sex had no significant impact, distinctions between wild boars and swine highlighted the dietary and environmental influences on element concentrations, underscoring the wild boar's role as a bioindicator of environmental elements.Abstract This study aimed to investigate the exposure of wild boars and swine from semi-extensive farms in the same area to essential and non-essential elements, measuring their concentration in liver and muscle. Furthermore, the study explored the influence of factors such as sex, age, and the sampling location on wild boars. Higher liver element concentrations were observed in both wild boars and swine. Geographical comparisons revealed minor differences. Young wild boars showed significantly higher Cu, Se, Cd, and Cr levels, while older subjects exhibited elevated Mn levels, reflecting age-related element absorption variations. No significant sex-based variations were noted. Comparing wild boars to swine, wild boars had more non-essential elements due to their foraging behavior and a larger home range. Conversely, swine exhibited a greater prevalence of essential elements, potentially resulting from dietary supplementation.

AB  - African antelope diversity is a globally unique vestige of a much richer world-wide Pleistocene megafauna. Despite this, the evolutionary processes leading to the prolific radiation of African antelopes are not well understood. Here, we sequenced 145 whole genomes from both subspecies of the waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), an African antelope believed to be in the process of speciation. We investigated genetic structure and population divergence and found evidence of a mid-Pleistocene separation on either side of the eastern Great Rift Valley, consistent with vicariance caused by a rain shadow along the so-called "Kingdon's Line." However, we also found pervasive evidence of both recent and widespread historical gene flow across the Rift Valley barrier. By inferring the genome-wide landscape of variation among subspecies, we found 14 genomic regions of elevated differentiation, including a locus that may be related to each subspecies' distinctive coat pigmentation pattern. We investigated these regions as candidate speciation islands. However, we observed no significant reduction in gene flow in these regions, nor any indications of selection against hybrids. Altogether, these results suggest a pattern whereby climatically driven vicariance is the most important process driving the African antelope radiation and suggest that reproductive isolation may not set in until very late in the divergence process. This has a significant impact on taxonomic inference, as many taxa will be in a gray area of ambiguous systematic status, possibly explaining why it has been hard to achieve consensus regarding the species status of many African antelopes. Our analyses demonstrate how population genetics based on low-depth whole genome sequencing can provide new insights that can help resolve how far lineages have gone along the path to speciation.

AB  - Early postnatal nicotine exposure, a rodent model of smoking during pregnancy, affects hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory. Here, we investigated the role of alpha 2 nAChR-expressing OLM (alpha 2-OLM) cells in LTP in unexposed and postnatal nicotine-exposed mice. We found that reduced alpha 2 nAChR-dependent activation of OLM cells in alpha 2 heterozygous knockout mice prevented LTP, whereas enhanced alpha 2 nAChR-dependent activation of OLM cells in heterozygous knockin mice expressing hypersensitive alpha 2 nAChRs facilitated LTP. Both optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of alpha 2-OLM cells facilitated LTP as nicotine did. However, in postnatal nicotine -exposed mice, expressing chemogenetic hM3Dq receptors in alpha 2-OLM cells, LTP was facilitated and both nico-tinic and chemogenetic activation of alpha 2-OLM cells prevented rather than facilitated LTP. These results demon-strate a critical role of alpha 2-OLM cell activation in LTP as well as altered alpha 2-OLM cell function in postnatal nicotine -exposed mice. To determine whether nicotine-mediated alpha 2 nAChR activation in developing brains causes facilitated LTP and altered nicotinic modulation of LTP in adolescence, we used homozygous knockin mice expressing hypersensitive alpha 2 nAChRs as a way to selectively activate alpha 2-OLM cells. In the knockin mice, post-natal exposure to a low dose of nicotine, which had no effect on LTP in wild-type mice, is sufficient to cause facilitated LTP and altered nicotinic modulation of LTP as found in wild-type mice exposed to a higher dose of nicotine. Thus, the nicotine-mediated activation of alpha 2 nAChRs on OLM cells in developing brains disrupts the alpha 2-OLM cell-mediated control of LTP in adolescence that might be linked to impaired memory.

AB  - This study assessed the impact of farming systems on aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) content and the prevalence of mastitis-causing bacteria in goat milk. A total of 233 milk samples were collected from two Skopelos goat farms-one intensive and one extensive farm-and analyzed for AFM1 content using a competitive ELISA. An additional 219 samples from goats suspected of subclinical mastitis were tested for bacterial prevalence with microbial culturing. The results showed that AFM1 concentration was significantly higher in the intensive farming system (7.76 +/- 0.76 ng/kg) than in the extensive farming system (3.78 +/- 0.79 ng/kg), though it remained below the legal limit of 50 ng/kg. The main effects of season and year were not significant, though higher levels of AFM1 were observed during winter. The interaction effects of season-farming system and year-season-farming system on AFM1 levels were significant. The prevalence of mastitis-causing bacteria varied by system, with Streptococcus spp. being more common in the extensive farming system, and Staphylococcus aureus was more frequently detected in milk samples from the intensive farming system. Binomial regression indicated that both the farming system and lactation stage significantly influenced Streptococcus spp. prevalence (p = 0.05; OR = 1.9 and 2.7, respectively). It is concluded that the farming system affects those quality parameters in goat milk.

AB  - Giant guitarfishes (Glaucostegidae) and wedgefishes (Rhinidae) are some of the most threatened marine taxa in the world, with 15 of the 16 known species exhibiting global population declines and categorized as Critically Endangered according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. The recent inclusion of all species in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) necessitates more rigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities.
   Challenges in regulating the trade of giant guitarfish and wedgefish products due to difficulties in visual identification of processed products and labelling issues impede enforcement. The aim of this study is to characterize the diversity and origins of associated traded products that were commercially available in Singapore, one of the world's top importers and re-exporters of shark and ray products.
   A total of 176 samples of elasmobranch products were obtained between June and December 2019 from fishery ports and various retailers in Singapore. By applying cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene barcoding, 31 elasmobranch species were detected, with 55% of the species considered threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable) based on the IUCN Red List and 35% of species listed in CITES Appendix II. Four species of giant guitarfishes and wedgefishes were commercially available to consumers in fresh forms of whole fish, fillet, and fin, as well as dried and cooked meats.
   DNA barcoding has proven to be an effective tool for identifying elasmobranch products that are impossible to recognize visually and would aid enforcement of CITES trade regulations. This work underscores the urgent need to step up enforcement of marine wildlife regulations and draw public attention to the elasmobranch trade.

AB  - Herbivorous fish can increase coral growth and survival by grazing down algal competitors. With coral reefs in global decline, maintaining adequate herbivory has become a primary goal for many managers. However, herbivore biomass targets assume grazing behavior is consistent across different reef systems, even though relatively few have been studied. We document grazing behavior of two scarid species in Antigua, Barbuda, and Bonaire. Our analyses show significant differences in intraspecific feeding rates, time spent grazing, and intensity of grazing across sites, which may alter the ecological impact of a given scarid population. We suggest several hypothesized mechanisms for these behavioral variations that would benefit from explicit testing in future research. As managers set targets to enhance herbivory on reefs, it is critical that we understand potential differences in scarid grazing impact. Our findings demonstrate the variability of grazing behavior across different reef sites and call for further investigation of the drivers and ecological implications of these inconsistencies.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion technology is a feasible alternative for wastes environmental treatment, nutrients recovery (as biofertilizer) and biomethane production. In Cuba, several wastes energy potentials have been evaluated, however, other biomass like horse manure (HM), rabbit manure (RM), and goat manure (GM) has been little studied. This study aims to determine the biochemical methane potential contained in herbivorous animal manures (horse, rabbit and goat) for energy purposes in Cuban context. Anaerobic digestion batch assay in 0.5 L reactors, using a mixture of pig and cow manure anaerobic sludge as inoculum, was performed under mesophilic conditions (35 +/- 2 degrees C) during 40 days. The methane yield potentials of 245, 326 and 112 L CH4 kg/VS were obtained for horse, rabbit and goat manures, respectively, influenced by the difference in their digestive system to digest the grass feedstock. The highest rabbit manure methane potential results attractive for domestic digesters, in which experience is very limited. In addition, due to the availability of horse manure in many municipalities of Cuba, the generation of electricity from this manure (128 GWh/year) could replace 1.4% of the electricity consumed by households, making it promising to further exploitation considering the expected 2030 energetic matrix changes using renewable energy.

AB  - Hyperparasitoids are ubiquitous components of terrestrial food webs. They must find their inconspicuous parasitoid host in a complex environment to generate offspring, but their foraging behaviour is poorly understood. Herbivore -induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) induced by parasitized caterpillars have been found to be exploited by hyperparasitoids in the cabbage system. However, the naturally occurring presence of nonhost organisms can interfere in HIPV production. It is unknown how hyperparasitoids respond to this source of variation in their foraging behaviour. We studied how the presence of nonhost herbivores affected foraging decisions of the hyperparasitoid Lysibia nana. In Y -tube olfactometer bioassays, we compared the preference of hyperparasitoids for volatiles from cabbage plants induced by single herbivory (host or nonhost), dual herbivory (host thorn nonhost) or uninfested cabbage plants. Following this, we conducted a common -garden experiment to study whether preferences observed in the laboratory are also apparent in the field. We found that L. nana preferred plants that were induced by its host, Cotesia glomerata-parasitized Pieris brassicae caterpillars. However, the volatiles of nonhostinduced plants hampered the hyperparasitoids' ability to locate host -induced plants in the Y -tube olfactometer. In particular, HIPVs induced by the nonhost caterpillar Mamestra brassicae in both single and dual herbivory hampered the hyperparasitoids' ability to locate host -induced plants. The presence of other nonhost herbivores feeding simultaneously on the same plants as host -containing herbivores did not interfere in L. nana's preference. In the field, hyperparasitoids could locate their host despite nonhost presence. Overall, these results indicate that host location errors by hyperparasitoids may occur during HIPV-guided foraging steps, which can be corrected by using more reliable cues after landing on the plant. This demonstrates the ability of higher trophic level organisms to exploit the scarce amount of available information to locate their host.

AB  - Consumers respond differently to external nutrient changes than producers, resulting in a mismatch in elemental composition between them and potentially having a significant impact on their interactions. To explore the responses of herbivores and omnivores to changes in elemental composition in producers, we develop a novel stoichiometric model with an intraguild predation structure. The model is validated using experimental data, and the results show that our model can well capture the growth dynamics of these three species. Theoretical and numerical analyses reveal that the model exhibits complex dynamics, including chaotic-like oscillations and multiple types of bifurcations, and undergoes long transients and regime shifts. Under moderate light intensity and phosphate concentration, these three species can coexist. However, when the light intensity is high or the phosphate concentration is low, the energy enrichment paradox occurs, leading to the extinction of ciliate and Daphnia. Furthermore, if phosphate is sufficient, the competitive effect of ciliate and Daphnia on algae will be dominant, leading to competitive exclusion. Notably, when the phosphorus-to-carbon ratio of ciliate is in a suitable range, the energy enrichment paradox can be avoided, thus promoting the coexistence of species. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of species coexistence and biodiversity.

AB  - AimThuridilla Bergh, 1872, is a lineage of herbivorous sea slugs externally distinguished by bright colours and distinctive patterns of lines and spots. Recent work revealed an exceptionally rapid, cryptic radiation of 13 species in the Indo-Pacific, raising questions about mechanisms of speciation in this group. Here, we (i) study the diversification and historical biogeography of Thuridilla in a phylogenetic context and (ii) assess the role of dispersal and vicariance as the predominant mode of speciation in the genus. LocationTropical and temperate regions of the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. Major Taxa StudiesGastropoda, Sacoglossa. MethodsA nearly complete taxon set with 28 out of 32 recognised species of Thuridilla was used, in a total sample of 172 specimens, together with sacoglossan outgroups. Phylogenetic relationships were determined using a multi-locus approach combining two mitochondrial (COI and 16S) and one nuclear gene (H3). Species relationships, diversification times, and ancestral geographical ranges were inferred using relaxed-clock methods together with Bayesian discrete phylogeographic methods under three calibration scenarios using the oldest known fossil of Sacoglossa, Berthelinia elegans Crosse, 1875, and tectonic events. ResultsThuridilla species branched off into four major clades in all calibration scenarios: two groups from the Atlantic plus Indo-West Pacific (5 and 6 species) and two clades from the Indo-West Pacific (4 and 17 species). The highest diversity of the genus is in the Western Pacific (14 spp.) with a peak in the East Indies Triangle (18 spp.), whereas the Atlantic is depauperate with only four species occurring in this ocean basin. Divergence between Atlantic and Indo-West Pacific lineages occurred in two main temporal periods: the Miocene and the Pliocene. Speciation events within the 13 cryptic species-complex fell mostly within Plio-Pleistocene times. Main ConclusionsThe best supported hypothesis was an Indo-West Pacific origin of Thuridilla between 28 and 18 Mya during the Early Miocene. In the western Pacific, speciation likely occurred during transient allopatry during Plio-Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations. Under the three tested calibration scenarios, the limited diversity of the Atlantic Ocean is hypothesized to be derived from Miocene vicariant events associated with the closure of the Tethys Sea, dispersal across southern Africa, or long-distance dispersal across the East Pacific Barrier prior to the uplift of the Isthmus of Panama. Thuridilla is absent in the Eastern Pacific, potentially resulting from the extinction of ancestral lineages following the uplift of the Isthmus of Panama. Near-complete sampling of diversity and reconstruction of historical biogeography thus yielded new insight into the relative contributions of dispersal versus vicariance during speciation over the history of this widely distributed, colourful genus.

AB  - Proposed in 1849 by Charles Morren to depict periodical phenomena governed by seasons, the term 'phenology' has spread in many fields of biology. With the wide adoption of the concept of phenology flourished a large number of metrics with different meaning and interpretation. Here, we first a priori classified 52 previously published metrics used to characterise the phenology of births in large herbivores according to four biological characteristics of interest: timing, synchrony, rhythmicity and regularity of births. We then applied each metric retrieved on simulation data, considering normal and non-normal distributions of births, and varying distributions of births in time. We then evaluated the ability of each metric to capture the variation of the four phenology characteristics via a sensitivity analysis. Finally, we scored each metric according to eight criteria we considered important to describe phenology correctly. The high correlation we found among the many metrics we retrieved suggests that such diversity of metrics is unnecessary. We further show that the best metrics are not the most commonly used, and that simpler is often better. Circular statistics with the mean vector orientation and mean vector length seems, respectively, particularly suitable to describe the timing and synchrony of births in a wide range of phenology patterns. Tests designed to compare statistical distributions, like Mood and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, allow a first and easy quantification of rhythmicity and regularity of birth phenology respectively. By identifying the most relevant metrics our study should facilitate comparative studies of phenology of births or of any other life-history event. For instance, comparative studies of the phenology of mating or migration dates are particularly important in the context of climate change.

AB  - Here, we constructed a novel bacterial deodorant (BD) composed of Delftia tsuruhatensis, Paracoccus denitrificans, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Bacillus velezensis. The BD alone removed 64.84 % of NH3, 100 % of H2S, and 63.68 % of comprehensive odor (OU) during a five-day fermentation of pig manure. The effect was enhanced by introducing Camellia sinensis in the composite bacterial deodorant (CBD) treatment, with the removal efficiency (RE) of NH3 and OU being 88.68 % and 88.14 %, respectively. In prolonged trials, maximum RE of NH3, H2S and OU RE reached 90.16 %, 92.32 % and 100 % in CBD group. Bacterial composition of manure revealed that the abundance of odor-producing microbes (Kurthia, Solibacillus, Proteiniphilum and Acholeplasma) and potential pathogens decreased after CBD application. Functional prediction and correlation analyses indicated that the process of nitrification, denitrification and S/N assimilation were facilitated, while S/N mineralization and methanogenesis processes might be inhibited. This deodorant promoted the conversion of malodorous substances into non-odorous forms, establishing an efficient odor removal system in hoggery. Therefore, the bacterial deodorant compounded with C. sinensis has been shown to be an effective method for deodorizing pig farms. This approach will advance the livestock industry toward greener practices and environmental protection, contributing positively to the development of a sustainable agro-ecosystem.

AB  - Simple Summary In the local populations, the increase in inbreeding is a relevant problem for the reduction in production, reproduction, and adaptive traits. The application of genomic technologies has facilitated the assessment of inbreeding in these populations. The current study aims to investigate the patterns of homozygosity in five Italian local goat populations. The results showed the different selection histories and breeding schemes of these goat populations. The analysis also indicated the importance of this information to avoid future loss of diversity and to produce information for designing optimal breeding and conservation programs. The application of genomic technologies has facilitated the assessment of genomic inbreeding based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this study, we computed several runs of homozygosity (ROH) parameters to investigate the patterns of homozygosity using Illumina Goat SNP50 in five Italian local populations: Argentata dell'Etna (N = 48), Derivata di Siria (N = 32), Girgentana (N = 59), Maltese (N = 16) and Messinese (N = 22). The ROH results showed well-defined differences among the populations. A total of 3687 ROH segments >2 Mb were detected in the whole sample. The Argentata dell'Etna and Messinese were the populations with the lowest mean number of ROH and inbreeding coefficient values, which reflect admixture and gene flow. In the Girgentana, we identified an ROH pattern related with recent inbreeding that can endanger the viability of the breed due to reduced population size. The genomes of Derivata di Siria and Maltese breeds showed the presence of long ROH (>16 Mb) that could seriously impact the overall biological fitness of these breeds. Moreover, the results confirmed that ROH parameters are in agreement with the known demography of these populations and highlighted the different selection histories and breeding schemes of these goat populations. In the analysis of ROH islands, we detected harbored genes involved with important traits, such as for milk yield, reproduction, and immune response, and are consistent with the phenotypic traits of the studied goat populations. Finally, the results of this study can be used for implementing conservation programs for these local populations in order to avoid further loss of genetic diversity and to preserve the production and fitness traits. In view of this, the availability of genomic data is a fundamental resource.

AB  - Ornithobacterium rhinotrachealis (ORT) and Pasteurella multocida (PM) are two major bacterial pathogens affecting the United States (US) commercial turkey industry. This retrospective observational case-case study aimed to investigate the association between land cover and confirmed disease occurrences attributed to PM or ORT in commercial turkey sites located in the Midwestern US A total of 65 farms from one poultry production company were included, where 28 had PM disease occurrences and 37 had ORT disease occurrences between 2014 and 2021. Risk factors of interest included land cover types (wetlands, forest, urban, pasture, herbaceous, barren, shrub), poultry-farm density in the area, and season and year of confirmed outbreak(s). A multivariable logistic regression model revealed that for every 1 m increase in distance from a farm to the nearest wetland, the odds of a confirmed disease occurrence related to PM decreased by approximately 0.24% compared to an ORT-related disease occurrence (p = 0.004). Meanwhile, PM occurrence during 2014-2017 was 98.5% higher than 2018-2019 and 93.2% higher than in 2020-2021. Broadly, the findings contribute to the dearth of research on land cover and turkey respiratory diseases and demonstrate that land cover is an important consideration for farm management and future study.

AB  - Artificial insemination (AI), as an efficient assisted reproduction technology, can help the livestock industry to improve livestock and poultry breeds, optimize production performance and improve reproductive efficiency. AI technology has been widely used in pig production in China, but boar fertility affects the effectiveness of AI, and more and more studies have shown that there are significant differences in the fertility of boars with similar semen quality indicators. Therefore, this study aimed to identify biomarker molecules that indicate the level of boar fertility, which is important for improving the efficiency of AI. In this study, we collected 40 mL of ejaculates per boar used for extracellular vesicle (EV) characterization in 20 boars and identified 53 differentially expressed miRNAs by small RNA sequencing, of which 44 miRNAs were up-regulated in the high-fertility seminal EVs compared with low-fertility seminal EVs, and nine miRNAs were down-regulated. miR-26a was most significantly down-regulated in the high-fertility group compared to the low-fertility group, and it was hypothesized that this miRNA could be used as a biomolecular marker of semen reproductive performance. To further determine the effect of miR-26a on sperm function, we successfully established a miR-26a overexpression model and found that miR-26a reduced sperm viability, motility, acrosome integrity, plasma membrane integrity and ATP levels. Bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase reporter analysis revealed that miR-26a directly targets High mobility group A1 (HMGA1). In conclusion, miR-26a can be used as a biomarker to identify high and low fertility in boar semen.

AB  - Dysregulation of GABAergic neurotransmission has long been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders. Alpha 5 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors (alpha 5GABA(A)R), which are expressed mainly by pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, have been proposed as a potential target to treat these psychiatric disorders. Here, we evaluated the effects produced by GL-II-73 and SH053-2' F-R-CH3 (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg), two positive allosteric modulators of alpha 5-GABAAR in behavioral tests sensitive to drugs with anxiolytic, antidepressant, and antipsychotic properties in male and female C57BL/6 mice. In both males and females, GL-II-73 produced an anxiolytic-like effect in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and novelty-suppressed feeding and a rapid and sustained antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim test. GL-II-73 also induced antipsychotic-like effects in males indicated by attenuating MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion and prepulse inhibition (PPI) disruption. However, GL-II-73 per se increased locomotor activity and impaired fear memory extinction in males and females and PPI in males. On the other hand, SH-053-2' F-R-CH3 induced anxiolytic-like effects in the EPM and facilitated fear memory extinction in males. Contrary to GL-II-73, SH053-2' F-R-CH3 attenuated MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion and PPI disruption in females but not in males. Neither of these drugs induced rewarding effects or impaired motor coordination. These findings suggest that GL II-73 and SH-053-2' F-R-CH3 cause distinct sex-dependent behavioral responses and support continued preclinical research on the potential of positive allosteric modulators of alpha 5-GABA(A)R for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Prolonged and repetitive COVID-19 facility closures have led to an abrupt cessation of visitors within UK and Irish zoos for variable periods since March 2020. This study sought to increase understanding of the impact of closures and reopenings on animal behaviour, thereby broadening understanding of whether zoo animals habituate to visitors. Data were collected from June to August 2020 at two UK facilities on eight species (n = 1 Chinese goral, n = 2 Grevy's zebra, n = 11 swamp wallaby, n = 2 Rothschild's giraffe, n = 2 nyala, n = 4 Chapman's zebra, n = 2 snow leopard and n = 3 Amur leopard). Behaviour change and enclosure use was variable across species but most changes were non-significant. Grevy's zebra engaged in more comfort behaviour during closure periods than post-closure (p < 0.05). Chinese goral engaged in more environmental interactions during closure periods (p < 0.05). Grevy's zebra spent longer than would be expected by chance closest to public viewing areas during closure periods (p < 0.008). These results suggest variable impacts of covid-19 closures and reopenings, mirroring human-animal interaction literature. We highlight the potential for some species to take longer to re-habituate to the presence of zoo visitors. As facility closures/reopenings are ongoing, we advocate a longitudinal monitoring approach. Furthermore, we recommend incorporation of physical and physiological measures of welfare where possible, alongside behavioural responses, to enable a holistic approach to answering fundamental questions on whether zoo animals habituate to visitors.

AB  - Climate and land-use change are modifying the availability of food and water resources, which is driving more wildlife to the wildland-urban interface. For many wildlife populations, use of these areas still requires habitat connectivity both within the interface and/or to wildland habitats. However, navigating these areas can be difficult due to human development and sensory pollutants, such as artificial night light. Determining how these components of urbanization influence the behaviors and functional connectivity of species is important for managing wildlife within these mixed-use landscapes. Here we used a movescape approach based on graph theory to characterize functional uses of the landscape using metrics for behavior, connectivity, and space use intensity. We found that mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus; n = 43) functional uses of anthropogenic landscapes in the Intermountain West, USA, were dependent not only on physical barriers, terrain, and sensory factors, but also the local levels of light exposure and vegetative greenness. Remotely sensed artificial light levels had a strong influence on how mule deer used the landscape by reducing the intensity of use in the most illuminated areas given forage availability. In contrast, relatively high local light levels were associated with increased use in-tensity within less developed areas-highlighting the foraging tradeoffs for species using the wildland-urban interface. Corridor use was reduced in areas where road and housing density were higher, and within-corridor movement was faster when artificial light was high and vegetative greenness was low. Developing a more mechanistic understanding of how species functionally use the landscape in relation to features of urbanization can enhance conservation by delineating areas important for connectivity and foraging, while providing insights into how future development and climate change may alter movement and behavior. Spatially-explicit estimates of functional uses can directly guide management decisions to maintain species resiliency and improve land-use planning.

AB  - Background: Impaired contextual fear inhibition is often associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our previous work has demonstrated that more hippocampal activation during a response inhibition task after trauma exposure was related to greater resilience and fewer future PTSD symptoms. In the current study, we sought to extend our previous findings by employing a contextual fear conditioning and extinction paradigm to further determine the role of the hippocampus in resilience and PTSD in the early aftermath of trauma.
   Methods: Participants (N = 28) were recruited in the Emergency Department shortly after experiencing a traumatic event. A contextual fear inhibition task was conducted in a 3 T MRI scanner approximately two months post-trauma. Measures of resilience (CD-RISC) at time of scan and PTSD symptoms three months post-trauma were collected. The associations between hippocampal activation during fear conditioning and during the effect of context during extinction, and post-trauma resilience and PTSD symptoms at three-months were assessed.
   Results: During fear conditioning, activation of the bilateral hippocampal region of interest (ROI) correlated positively with resilience (r = 0.48, p = 0.01). During the effect of context during extinction, greater bilateral hippocampal activation correlated with lower PTSD symptoms three months post-trauma after controlling for baseline PTSD symptoms, age and gender (r=-0.59, p=0.009).
   Conclusions: Greater hippocampal activation was related to post-trauma resilience and lower PTSD symptoms three months post-trauma. The current study supports and strengthens prior findings suggesting the importance of hippocampus-dependent context processing as a mechanism for resilience versus PTSD risk, which could be a potential mechanistic target for novel early interventions.

AB  - Antipredator responses could affect nutrient intake, which could lead to nutritional deficits. However, little is known about the antipredator response of small herbivores because most are nocturnal or crepuscular and therefore very difficult to study in the field. Therefore, we experimentally assessed the effect of a reactive response to predation risk on the nutrient (i.e., phosphorous) intake of the European hare (Lepus europaeus) using three different playback sounds. Additionally, we studied the time spent being costly vigilant, the time spent foraging, and the vegetation height in which the hares were present using accelerometers and GPS. Our results showed that elevated predation risk from our playback experiment did not affect the (1) phosphorus intake, (2) time spent being costly vigilant, and (3) time spent in tall vegetation. However, elevated predation risk did increase the time spent foraging. Possibly hares spent more time foraging with an increased predation risk because hares cannot seek refuge from predators. Additionally, the effect on phosphorus intake could be weak because phosphorous intake does not benefit a flight escape, while the reactive response acts late in the predation sequence limiting the effect on hare ecology. Prey anti-predator responses seem strongly related to the escape tactics of prey species that can differ between different habitats and the time of the day. More detailed field studies are necessary to get a better insight into species' anti-predator-food tactics.

AB  - The wastewater treatment processes (WTP) on pig farms are heavily contaminated by antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) play an important role in shaping ARG profiles. Here we first employed metagenomic sequencing to follow the diversities and shifts of ARG associated mobile genetic elements (AAMGEs) including insertion sequences (ISs) and plasmids along the WTP for three pig farms in southeast China. The IS average relative abundance rose from the initial pig feces source to the wastewater storage lagoon (WSL) but decreased in the influent and rose in the effluent of the anaerobic digestor (AD). In contrast, plasmids were eliminated rapidly along this process. These results indicated that the AD reduced plasmid copies while IS abundance increased. We found a great diversity ISs, including IS91, ISNCY, IS630 and IS701, were large contributors to the transfer of multidrug resistance. In addition, the tetracycline resistance genes co-occurred with a greater diversity of ISs than other ARG classes and this likely contributed to the high abundance of tetracycline resistance genes we found. The transfer of ARGs mediated by MGEs along the WTP of pig farms was a key contributor for the ARGs persistence in the environment of pig farms. Collectively, our findings demonstrated different fates for ISs and plasmids along the WTP for pig farms and suggested that AAMGE monitoring served as an important role in controlling ARGs in pig waste.

AB  - Bats represent an important, but poorly known component of mammal diversity in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Our surveys in two altitudinal rainforest gradients recorded 43 bat species of which six (Dobsonia minor, D. praedatrix, Hipposideros calcaratus, H. maggietaylorae, Miniopterus australis, Miniopterus sp.) fell outside of their known altitudinal ranges. This enlargement could reflect the lack of past sampling, or a genuine range extension, potentially in response to climate change. Our study highlights the importance of baseline data on the altitudinal distribution of vertebrates, including bats, in PNG for the monitoring of their response to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance.

AB  - We present an updated systematic checklist of fishes from the Bahia Magdalena-Almejas lagoon system (Mexico), including notes on taxonomy, zoogeography, and conservation status, supported by field samplings and the critical review of published and online data. The ichthyofauna is composed by 2 classes, 30 orders, 104 families, 240 genera and 416 species, mainly represented by the class Actinopterygii. Zoogeographically, the fishes showed highest affinity to the San Diego (87.2%), Cortez (81.4%) and Mexican (70%) provinces, reflecting the ancient relationship between the Californian and Tropical Eastern Pacific regions and the existence of a transitional zone in the Baja California Peninsula for fish assemblages from boreal-temperate and warm-tropical derivation, standing out the presence of the endemic Paraclinus magdalenae . The 91% of the ichthyofauna is included by the IUCN Red List as Lower Concern, Data Deficient and Not Evaluated, while Holacanthus clarionensis and Hippocampus ingens , are under Special Protection by the Mexican regulation. Ecologically, 233 species are marine-euryhaline and 177 marine-stenohaline, which preferentially inhabit soft (57%) and rocky (27.5%) bottoms; most species are demersal (60%), benthic (25%) and pelagic (14.4%). The updated checklist could improve the design and implementation of effective fishing regulation strategies and conservation programs for fishes inhabiting this coastal ecosystem.

AB  - Human-dominated environments are growing worldwide, forcing animals to adapt to new conditions characterized by increased risks and/or anthropogenic resources availability. While numerous studies have compared behavioural patterns of rural and urban populations, little is known about plastic behavioural responses to temporal variations in human presence. We modelled the behaviour-specific resource selection of 15 wild boars (Sus scrofa) GPS-tracked between 2017 and 2019 in a tourist area in Italy characterized by high seasonal variability of human presence. By means of activity sensor data, we differentiated between two behavioural states with different ecological needs: resting (safe shelter) and activity (food intake). We investigated the variability of selection/avoidance of infrastructures and beaches, across seasons and behavioural states. We expected human-built landscape features to be avoided for resting and selected for activity, with a strength proportional to the seasonal level of human presence. Instead, wild boars selected locations near infrastructures and away from beaches, both for resting and while being active. We showed that the similarity of behavioural patterns exhibited during the resting and active phases was accountable to the wild boar activities being spatially constrained by the proximity with their previous resting location. As expected, the selection for infrastructure proximity and avoidance of beaches peaked in summer (maximum human presence) and was negligible in winter (least human presence), showing that a variable human presence elicits intra-individual plastic responses in animal populations. Our results suggest the behavioural flexibility of wild boars as a key factor enabling them to rapidly colonize human-dominated environments.

AB  - Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) are nonnative, herbivorous freshwater fish that represent an ecological threat in North American waters. However, data are limited on reproductive biology specific to wild populations in midwestern North America, despite recent concern for grass carp establishment within the Great Lakes. Basic information on reproductive traits could be useful to determine reproductive potential, inform future population modelling and provide information to aid control efforts. Our objectives were to evaluate grass carp age-at-maturity, spawning season timing, fecundity type, developmental timing and spawning strategy. Additionally, we evaluated the reliability of the gonadosomatic index (GSI) as a proxy for identifying mature grass carp and compared body condition across study areas. We sampled grass carp in portions of the Mississippi River watershed within the state of Missouri and within the Lake Erie basin. Based on gonad histological samples (n = 274), grass carp are batch spawners with indeterminate fecundity and asynchronous ovarian developmental timing. This allows flexibility in their spawning, exemplified by a protracted spawning season in Lake Erie (April to November) in temperatures ranging from 12.3 to 27.3 degrees C. Minimum observed age-at-maturity for females in Missouri and for both males and females in the Lake Erie population was age-3 and age-2 for males in Missouri. Accuracy of GSI as a measure of maturity during the spawning season was 89.7% and 87.5%, for females and males, respectively. Compared to Missouri, grass carp in Lake Erie had a significantly higher body condition, and females ready to spawn had significantly higher GSI values, suggesting that the grass carp in Lake Erie are healthier and more fecund relative to Missouri and, if left uncontrolled, potentially have a high probability of establishment within the Great Lakes. The results of this study will allow managers to identify the reproductive status of grass carp in the field and more accurately estimate populations and reproductive potential.

AB  - The Upper Jurassic deposits of the Lastres Formation crop out on the Asturian coast (northwest of the Iberian Peninsula), in the so-called "The Dinosaur Coast". This formation presents a high abundance of dinosaur remains and other vertebrates. Despite the deep knowledge about its fauna and environment, practically nothing is known about the plant communities that formed the landscape of the region at the end of the Jurassic. We present here the first palynological data of the Lastres Fm., identifying a rich and abundant palynological assemblage formed by more than 60 different taxa. The presence of some taxa with biostratigraphic value suggests a Kimmeridgian-Tithonian age for this formation. On the other hand, the botanical affinities of the taxa found indicate that the vegetation of the "The Dinosaur Coast" of Asturias would not be homogeneous, but would be formed by a mosaic of different plant communities that would adapt to the variety of environments present in the region. The presence of forest areas probably represented a protected environment as well as a food source for herbivorous dinosaurs. Analysis of charcoalified wood remains suggests that palaeofires were relatively recurrent in the study area.
   Abundant fossils of vertebrates (mainly footprints and bones of dinosaurs) and numerous invertebrates occur in the Upper Jurassic deposits of the Lastres Formation in the Asturias region, North of Spain. However, no palynological study has been published from this geological formation; therefore, much palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological information is still unknown. In this study, a total of 62 morphospecies, belonging to 49 different morphogenera were identified, including pollen, spores, algae remains, fungi spores, dinoflagellates, foraminifera, and scolecodonts from four different locations on the Asturian coast. Spores are the dominant group of palynomorphs, both in diversity and abundance, contrasting with the minor diversity of pollen grains. The age of some key taxa indicates that the palynological assemblage cannot be older than the Kimmeridgian, suggesting a Kimmeridgian-Tithonian age. The botanical and environmental affinities of the pollen and spores indicate the presence of different plant assemblages, including plant communities from humid areas such as the margin of rivers and small freshwater ponds that were dominated by bryophytes and ferns, and a coastal plant community that would inhabit arid areas and would be dominated by gymnosperms and some pteridophytes. The SEM analyses of wood remains show the abundance of charcoalified remains suggesting that wildfires were usual in "The Dinosaur Coast" of Asturias during the Kimmeridgian.

AB  - Managing a milk zone in the dairy industry is demanding. Data necessary for efficient management are difficult to acquire because they usually must be collected in organized and standardized ways. On the other hand, software practices constantly provide new tools that can go beyond simple record-keeping practices and add value to the data. In this work, FarmDain is a novel web-based application for sheep and goat management. It aims to improve milk production and processing by digitizing the value chain in data acquisition, processing and visualization between dairy production businesses and their milk suppliers. FarmDain uses state-of-the-art software technologies to model the data collection process and provides a straightforward user interface to facilitate data processing and visualization. Using the app in a case study carried out for 12 months in a dairy sheep farm resulted in lower feeding cost per milked ewe by 5.5% when ewes were allocated into high and low milk production groups compared to the scenario of remaining in one single group. Furthermore, based on reports provided by the app, culling and genetic selection decisions were made to improve the overall farm performance. Similar practices were applied in all farms optimizing their productivity, which led to increased profitability for farms and the Dairy Factory.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Diets with a lower dietary cation-anion difference could prevent hypocalcemia, enhance health, and extend the economic life of transition mammary animals. However, there is less information on rumen fermentation, cellulolytic bacteria populations, and microbiota for female goats fed a negative dietary cation-anion difference diet. We speculate that a negative dietary cation-anion difference would not affect the rumen fermentation parameters. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a negative dietary cation-anion difference diet on rumen pH, buffering capability, volatile fatty acids of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, total volatile fatty acid and acetic acid/propionic acid profiles, ruminal cellulolytic bacteria populations, and microbiota. These results provide a further evaluation on the feasibility of feeding a negative dietary cation-anion difference diet to goats.
   The dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) has been receiving increased attention in recent years; however, information on rumen fermentation, cellulolytic bacteria populations, and microbiota of female goats fed a negative DCAD diet is less. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of feeding a negative DCAD diet for goats with emphasis on rumen fermentation parameters, cellulolytic bacteria populations, and microbiota. Eighteen female goats were randomly blocked to 3 treatments of 6 replicates with 1 goat per replicate. Animals were fed diets with varying DCAD levels at +338 (high DCAD; HD), +152 (control; CON), and -181 (low DCAD; LD). This study lasted 45 days with a 30-d adaption and 15-d trial period. The results showed that the different DCAD levels did not affect the rumen fermentation parameters including pH, buffering capability, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, sum of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, or the ratio of acetic acid/propionic acid (p > 0.05). The 4 main ruminal cellulolytic bacteria populations containing Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and Ruminococcus albus did not differ from DCAD treatments (p > 0.05). There was no difference in bacterial richness and diversity indicated by the indices Chao, Abundance Coverage-based Estimator (Ace), or Simpson and Shannon, respectively (p > 0.05), among 3 DCAD levels. Both principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) weighted UniFrac distance and unweighted UniFrac distance showed no difference in the composition of rumen microbiota for CON, HD, and LD (p > 0.05). At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes was the predominant phylum followed by Firmicutes, Synergistetes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetae, and Tenericutes, and they showed no difference (p > 0.05) in relative abundances except for Firmicutes, which was higher in HD and LD compared to CON (p < 0.05). At the genus level, the relative abundances of 11 genera were not affected by DCAD treatments (p > 0.05). The level of DCAD had no effect (p > 0.05) on growth performance (p > 0.05). Urine pH in LD was lower than HD and CON (p < 0.05). Goats fed LD had higher plasma calcium over HD and CON (p < 0.05). In summary, we conclude that feeding a negative DCAD has no deleterious effects on rumen fermentation and rumen microbiota and can increase the blood calcium level, and is therefore feasible for female goats.

AB  - Plastic behavioural adjustments represent a powerful mechanism for animals to respond to severe environmental changes. For instance, animals may use distinct resources, which could enhance their fitness, because of increased temperatures. Such shifts in resource use may be observed in egg laying female insects, modifying host plant preference under challenging conditions. Indeed, females are expected to increase their selectivity towards high-quality host plants when experiencing high compared with benign temperatures. In this study, we examined whether female Bicyclus anynana butterflies can enhance their reproductive performance by modifying host plant use in response to challenging temperature regimes. Towards this end, we investigated (1) whether exposure to variable thermal conditions affected reproductive output when females had access to only one host plant, and (2) whether this in turn affected the oviposition preference for host plants of different quality under laboratory conditions. We expected hot conditions to reduce the reproductive performance (egg number, offspring survival and performance) of butterflies. Such deleterious effects may, however, be counterbalanced by a higher selectivity for high-quality plants when females have simultaneous access to plants of different quality. We found that the reproductive performance of butterflies was indeed reduced when they experienced hot conditions. These temperature effects were only observed when butterflies only had access to a lowquality plant. However, individuals did not increase their selectivity towards the higher-quality host plant in response to hot conditions, possibly because of fecundity costs associated with increased choosiness. Our results illustrate the limits of plastic behavioural adjustments in response to changing environmental conditions under laboratory conditions. Further studies are, however, necessary to clarify whether this lack of plasticity is also observed in wild animals, which may limit their adaptability in the face of climate change. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - In species with marked sexual dimorphism, the classic prediction is that the sex which undergoes stronger intrasexual competition ages earlier or quicker. However, more recently, alternative hypotheses have been put forward, showing that this association can be disrupted. Here, we utilize a unique, longitudinal data set of a semi-captive population of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), a species with marked male-biased intrasexual competition, with males being larger and having shorter lifespans, and investigate whether males show earlier and/or faster body mass ageing than females. We found evidence of sex-specific body mass ageing trajectories: adult males gained weight up to the age of 48 years old, followed by a decrease in body mass until natural death. In contrast, adult females gained body mass with age until a body mass decline in the last year of life. Our study shows sex-specific ageing patterns, with an earlier onset of body mass declines in males than females, which is consistent with the predictions of the classical theory of ageing.

AB  - Zooplankton plays a pivotal role in lentic water bodies, linking planktonic primary producers to higher trophic levels and being a cornerstone of the planktonic food web of ponds and lakes. Because of its ease of culture, large size, rich ecology, abundance in northern temperate lakes where limnology is rooted, and the ability to work with clones, Daphnia has, in the last centuries grown to become a key model system in ecology, evolution, and ecotoxicology. Consequently, a vast majority of freshwater zooplankton ecology focuses on the role of Daphnia. While generating essential insights, this has also deviated attention from the broad ecological impact of other zooplankton. Here, we emphasize how other zooplankton taxa have an important impact in nature - often in qualitatively different ways than Daphnia. We illustrate this point by focusing on two key zooplankton functions (herbivory and stoichiometry) and suggest research to capitalize on the success story of mechanistic ecological, eco-evolutionary, and genomic Daphnia work to develop a richer set of model organisms. We currently have the tools to do so and integrating mechanistic insights in multispecies settings would foster a better understanding of the rich diversity and ecology of freshwater zooplankton.

FX  - This perspective was written in honor of the 80th anniversary of Henri Dumont, who mentored LDM and SAJD when they started to explore the rich world of research and interacted with KAG at a somewhat later stage. We were inspired to write this piece because Henri is both enthusiastic about Daphnia as a model system while always having shown a very broad interest in research on all zooplankton.

AB  - Livestock manure is a major source of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The emissions can be mitigated by production of biogas through anaerobic digestion (AD) of manure, mostly together with other biowastes, which can substitute fossil energy and thereby reduce CO2 emissions and postdigestion GHG emissions. This paper presents GHG balances for manure and biowaste management as affected by AD for five Danish biogas scenarios in which pig and cattle slurry were codigested with one or more of the following biomasses: deep litter, straw, energy crops, slaughterhouse waste, grass-clover green manure, and household waste. The calculated effects of AD on the GHG balance of each scenario included fossil fuel substitution, energy use for transport, leakage of CH4 from biogas production plants, CH4 emissions during storage of animal manure and biowaste, N2O emissions from stored and field applied biomass, N2O emissions related to nitrate (NO3-) leaching and ammonia (NH3) losses, N2O emissions from cultivation of energy crops, and soil C sequestration. All scenarios caused significant reductions in GHG emissions. Most of the reductions resulted from fossil fuel substitution and reduced emissions of CH4 during storage of codigestates. The total reductions in GHG emissions ranged from 65 to 105 kg CO2-eq ton(-1) biomass. This wide range showed the importance of biomass composition. Reductions were highest when straw and grass-clover were used as codigestates, whereas reductions per unit energy produced were highest when deep litter or deep litter plus energy crops were used. Potential effects of iLUC were ignored but may have a negative impact on the GHG balance when using energy crops, and this may potentially exceed the calculated positive climate impacts of biogas production. The ammonia emission potential of digestate applied in the field is higher than that from cattle slurry and pig slurry because of the higher pH of the digestate. This effect, and the higher content of TAN in digestate, resulted in increasing ammonia emissions at 0.14 to 0.3 kg NH3-N ton(-1) biomass. Nitrate leaching was reduced in all scenarios and ranged from 0.04 to 0.45 kg NO3-N ton(-1) biomass. In the scenario in which maize silage was introduced, the maize production increased leaching and almost negated the effect of AD. Methane leakage caused a 7% reduction in the positive climate impact for each percentage point of leakage in a manure-based biogas scenario.

AB  - Primary producer communities are often growth-limited by essential nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). The magnitude of limitation and whether N, P or both elements are limiting autotroph growth depends on the supply and ratios of these essential nutrients. Previous studies identified single, serial or co-limitation as predominant limitation outcomes in autotroph communities by factorial nutrient additions. Little is known about potential consequences of such scenarios for herbivores and whether their growth is primarily affected by changes in autotroph quantity or nutritional quality. We grew a community of phytoplankton species differing in various food quality aspects in experimental microcosms at varying N and P concentrations resulting in three different N:P ratios. At carrying capacity, N, P, both nutrients or none were added to reveal which nutrients were limiting. The nutrient-supplied communities were fed to the generalist herbivorous rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus to investigate how changing phytoplankton biomass and community composition affect herbivore abundance. We found phytoplankton being growth-limited either by N alone (single limitation) or serially, i.e. primarily by N and secondarily by P, altering available food quantity for rotifers. Rotifer growth showed a different response pattern compared to phytoplankton, suggesting that apart from food quantity food quality aspects played a substantial role in the transfer from primary to secondary production. The combined addition of N and P to phytoplankton had generally a positive effect on herbivore growth, whereas adding non-limiting nutrients had a rather detrimental effect probably due to stoichiometrically imbalanced food in terms of nutrient excess. Our experiment shows that adding various nutrients to primary producer communities will not always lead to increased autotroph and herbivore growth, and that differences between autotroph and herbivore responses under co-limiting conditions can be partly well explained by concepts of ecological stoichiometry theory.

AB  - Merapoh, Pahang, is an area rich with limestone karst located within the Lipis National Geopark and home to the Sungai Relau gate of Taman Negara Pahang, a totally protected rainforest in Malaysia. Much of the research conducted here is mainly inside the National Park, with few published faunal records for the Merapoh caves. This study compiled the data on the bat species diversity of eight Merapoh caves (March 2020 to March 2022) using mist nets and harp traps. Our results indicate that Chiroptera diversity at Merapoh caves is rich, with a total of 32 species recorded from 865 individuals and four new locality records for the State of Pahang, namely Rousettus leschenaultii, Lyroderma lyra, Rhinolophus coelophyllus and Hipposideros pomona. Gua Gunting has the highest diversity of bats recorded in this study (19 species). Significant Merapoh caves with bat colony roosts in Merapoh include Gua Jinjang Pelamin ( Eonycteris spelaea & Rousettus leschenaultii), Gua Tahi Bintang ( Hipposideros larvatus) and Gua Pasir Besar ( Miniopterus medius). Rhinolophus convexus, previously recorded only in upper montane rainforests, was also recorded in Merapoh caves indicating that this species can also be found in lower elevations than previously thought. Based on the findings of the current study and additional records from two previous studies, the Merapoh bat species diversity checklist totalled up to 38 species. On the whole, the rich bat diversity in Merapoh is reflective of its immense limestone karst landscape, which highlights the reason Lipis National Geopark has been recently gazetted. Future bat research should continue here and in other karsts within Lipis Geopark to sustainably conserve biological diversity, manage geological structures and raise awareness amongst the locals to appreciate their national heritage.

AB  - The function of a mammal is impacted by heat stress. This review considers the signs, symptoms, therapies, molecular reactions, histological changes, and effects of heat on protein metabolism in mammals. Heat stress is considered as a thermal injury model to the central nervous system (CNS), this review discusses the histopathological changes caused by heat stress on the CNS. Heat stress lowers metabolic rates, reduces feed intake and changes post-absorptive metabolism Heat stress disturbs the steady-state levels of free radicals, which in turn causes oxidative damage to both the mitochondria and the cells. Traditional and cutting-edge cooling techniques are covered in the management of heat stress.

AB  - Ungulates held in captivity often face challenges in their health and well-being due to the constraints of their artificial environments. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as blood sampling, can induce stress and discomfort in these animals, potentially affecting the accuracy of results and overall welfare. This study explores the protocol establishment of urinalysis as a stress-free alternative diagnostic technique for assessing health and stress levels in captive ungulates. Ethical considerations were followed throughout the study as samples of captive animals, including Zebra, Mouflon, Punjab Urial, and cattle, were collected from Lahore Zoological Garden, Lahore Safari, and Jallo Forest and Wildlife Park. Urinalysis utilized non-invasive techniques to determine the urinary standard values in ungulates, including the urinary proteins. Results indicated that urinalysis provided reliable indicators of health and stress levels in captive ungulates without causing additional stress. The reference standards for urine proteins, specific gravity, creatinine, and urine protein to creatinine ratios have been provided as 13.39 mg/dL,1.009, 57.89 mg/dL, and 0.23. Bradford Assay revealed a concentration of proteins in cattle, Punjab Urial, Mouflons, and zebra with a mean value of 58.56 mu g/ml, 40.81 mu g/ml, 48.39 mu g/ml, and 40.34 mu g/ml, respectively. It has been hypothesized that the presence of these concentrations of proteins in captive animals might be responsible for renal dysfunction. Furthermore, urinalysis may be an effective instrument for assessing renal activity and alterations in physiological conditions in ungulates.

AB  - Lhasa is located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with an altitude of 3,650 m, and a unique geography. Its climate is dry and cold all year round. Forensic entomological studies of the region are scarce. In this study, the diversity and seasonality of necrophagous flies in eight counties among Lhasa region were determined, and succession of necrophagous flies colonizing on rabbits in the Chengguan area of Lhasa was studied, so as to provide reference data for estimating postmortem interval (PMI) and location of death. In total, 22 species of necrophagous flies, belonging to six families were identified in Lhasa. Protophormia terraenovae (Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) was the dominant species throughout the year, the diversity index (4.5834) indicated that the study on necrophagous flies in the Lhasa region is representative.

AB  - Climate change is one of the hot topics of this decade and seriously affects all economic production sectors including the livestock farming sector. In many scenarios, the Mediterranean region is expected to experience unconventional and severe climate change that necessitates adopting effective strategies to improve the resilience of the livestock farming sector, particularly for smallholders. Here, we performed a cross-sectional survey of 277 smallholder livestock farmers in Egypt and 223 in Spain in order to (1) assess smallholder livestock farmers' awareness of climate change and its potential impacts on animal performance, (2) identify climate change factors affecting animal productivity, and (3) identify the resilience of small-scale livestock farms in the region to the effects of climate change on animal productivity and existing and future needed adaptive measures. The results showed that just over 90% of respondents were aware of climate change and its potential effects on animal productivity, and just over 60% of smallholders in Spain obtained relevant knowledge through their own direct observation, while most smallholders in Egypt obtained knowledge through communication with other farmers and from the media. The role of extension advisors has diminished in the two countries, recording 0.36% in Egypt and 1.35% in Spain. The survey responses suggest that heat waves, humidity, and drought are the major climatic changes affecting smallholding animal production, representing 68.65, 16.34, and 15.01%, respectively. Climatic change appears to have affected primarily milk yield, wool production, and reproductive performance on the smallholding farms in our survey, while affecting meat production, mortality rate, and egg production to a smaller extent. As measures to buffer the effects of climate change, 25% of respondents in Egypt indicated that they have adopted nutritional strategies, 36% indicated that they manage housing conditions, and 6% indicated that they use genetically improved animal breeds. The corresponding percentages among respondents in Spain were 15%, 28%, and 4%, respectively. In conclusion, awareness about climate change as well as adaptation measures are the major axes to sustaining the growing demand for livestock products. Furthermore, mitigation strategies are keys to limiting the upcoming extent of climate change, and there are several adaptation strategies.

AB  - Climate change may exacerbate alien species expansion into previously unsuitable areas. This shift in species distributions can lead to mismatches between interacting species. We evaluated the potential worldwide distribution of the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides, and its specialist herbivore, the flea beetle Agasicles hygrophila, under future global warming scenarios to identify overlapping and non-overlapping areas. We used species distribution models (SDMs) to predict the potential global distribution of both species in current, and in moderately optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. Climate change is expected to significantly expand A. philoxeroides toward higher latitudes, increasing its global range and climatic suitability. Agasicles hygrophila is also predicted to expand, albeit to a lesser extent, with some loss of currently suitable areas and a decrease in suitability. The overlapping area between their distributions is projected to increase globally, except in the USA. This suggests promising biocontrol potential for alligator weed in many regions in the future, but portions of its distribution may remain unsuitable for the flea beetle, particularly at higher latitudes. The northward expansion of the plant beyond the flea beetle's range may create zones with low control efficiency. These findings can help management strategies for this invasive plant under its future potential distribution.

AB  - The demand for small ruminants is increasing, but livestock production is not very market oriented. Understanding buyers' preferences allows breeders to orient their production and make more profit. This research aimed to determine the attributes of small ruminants and other specific factors that explain price variations of small ruminants in ordinary period. Twenty-one markets were selected using stratified sampling. Data were collected in these markets on September 2020 from 432 small ruminant transactions between sellers and buyers and analysed with the hedonic regression model. Results showed that the price of goats purchased for slaughter and breeding were respectively 9.4 % and 7.2 % higher than those bought for trade. At the same time, when sheep were purchased for breeding, consumption and catering, their prices were respectively 14.5 %, 10.3 % and 9.4 % higher than those purchased for trade. The attributes weight, age (2-4 years old), sex (female), coat colour (white), body condition (good), breed (sahelian breeds for sheep and djallonke breed for goats) and absence of horn determined significantly and positively the small ruminant's price. In addition to these attributes, the small ruminant prices varied according to type of market and seller, but the buyer had less control over these factors. Thus, it is important to improve attributes preferred by buyers through training for breeders on the control of small ruminant reproduction. These attributes should also be considered when developing strategies to improve the small ruminant sector to transform traditional livestock farming into market-oriented livestock farming. Facilitating access to information through the establishment of functional market information systems will enable breeders to move towards market-oriented livestock systems.

AB  - This study provides the first analysis and quantification of MPs in salt products in Sri Lanka. Commercial table salt brands, rock salt, lab-grade NaCl and raw salt from three salterns were analysed using microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. All salt samples were contaminated with MPs: in commercial salts products it ranged from 11 to 193 items/kg, rock salts had 64 items/kg and lab grade NaCl had 253 +/- 8.9 items/ kg. The MP levels in salterns varied significantly: Hambantota 3345.7 +/- 311.4 items/kg, Puttalam 272.3 +/- 10.6 items/kg, and Elephant Pass 36.3 +/- 4.5 items/kg. Predominantly, MPs were presented as fibres, followed by fragments. Of the 23 polymer types identified; low-density polyethylene (LDPE; 17%), resin dispersion (15%) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE; 12%) were notable. This study provides the first comparison of MPs in raw salt and commercial salt. This information is important to trace the pollutant sources and then to take steps to eliminate MPs in food products consumed.

AB  - Human distress vocalizations elicit an increase in dogs' stress responses. This modulation of behaviour to match one's emotional state to that of another individual is often described as emotional contagion. Whether this phenomenon is promoted by the dogs' selection for cooperation with humans or is rooted more generally in the universal vocal signals of emotion is unclear. To test this, we compared the reactions of companion dogs, Canis familiaris, and companion pigs, Sus scrofa domesticus (which are popular companion animals but whose domestication history lacks selection for cooperation), to human sound playbacks of crying, a high-arousal, negatively valenced sound, and humming, a low-arousal, less emotionally valenced sound, in a citizen science study. Dogs exhibited higher levels of behaviours associated with increased arousal and negative emotional states and vocalized more in response to crying compared to humming. In contrast, pigs showed more negative and high-arousal behaviours in response to humming than to crying. The fact that dogs seemed to have been affected by and reacted accordingly to the emotional content of human vocal sounds is in line with previous works and the emotional contagion account. In contrast, pigs' elevated stress to the low-arousal humming sound compared to the negative and high-arousal crying sound, cannot be fully explained by emotional contagion but rather by the novelty of the sound (neophobia). Selection for cooperation with humans may thus be key for promoting human sound-induced emotional contagion in domestic mammals. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Agathis (Araucariaceae) is a genus of broadleaved conifers that today inhabits lowland to upper montane rainforests of Australasia and Southeast Asia. A previous report showed that the earliest known fossils of the genus, from the early Paleogene and possibly latest Cretaceous of Patagonian Argentina, host diverse assemblages of insect and fungal associations, including distinctive leaf mines. Here, we provide complete documentation of the fossilized Agathis herbivore communities from Cretaceous to Recent, describing and comparing insect and fungal damage on Agathis across four latest Cretaceous to early Paleogene time slices in Patagonia with that on 15 extant species. Notable fossil associations include various types of exter-nal foliage feeding, leaf mines, galls, and a rust fungus. In addition, enigmatic structures, possibly armored scale insect (Diaspididae) covers or galls, occur on Agathis over a 16-million-year period in the early Paleo-gene. The extant Agathis species, throughout the range of the genus, are associated with a diverse array of mostly undescribed damage similar to the fossils, demonstrating the importance of Agathis as a host of diverse insect herbivores and pathogens and their little-known evolutionary history.

One bull possessed the chromosomal complement 2n = 60, consisting of 58 acrocentric autosomes, one large sub-metacentric X-chromosome, and one small acrocentric Y-chromosome with a small visible p-arm, which was further confirmed using CBG- and GTG-banding. This polymorphism was attributed to a heterochromatin variation of the acrocentric Ychromosome routine in the Bos indicus Linnaeus, 1758 cattle.

AB  - Field boundaries are important habitat for bats in agricultural landscapes, serving as commuting and foraging areas for many species. The goal of our study was to better understand the drivers of bat activity in agricultural landscapes to inform conservation policy and make specific recommendations for habitat management. We placed sixty-four full spectrum bat detectors at random recording locations, weekly, along field boundaries in North Somerset between July and October 2020. We used an automated classifier to analyse recordings and performed error rate modelling to account for and remove the majority of error in automated classifications. We used generalised additive models to explore bat response to recording location metrics, controlling for spatial-autocorrelation and temporal differences in sampling. We validated our models with k-fold cross-validation and explored the utility of our models for predicting bat activity at new sites. We found that field boundary characteristics better describe bat activity than adjacent field characteristics or measures of local landscape for the majority of species studied. Bat activity was higher along tall, wide, vegetated field boundaries containing trees; there was lower activity at arable recording locations. Still, bat activity was highly variable and predictive error was high. We found a large spatial effect driving activity patterns, meaning models are not able to predict activity beyond the extent of the study area. We recommend management strategies that give incentives to farmers for replacing fences with hedgerows, planting hedgerow trees, and maintaining tall and outgrown field boundaries.

AB  - The analysis of polymorphism of the cytochrome b gene (1140 bp) of mtDNA of 20 Cervus elaphus samples from the Caucasian Reserve was carried out. The described haplotypes were included in three haplogroups, two of which belong to the western and one to the eastern lineages. Among the western lineage, a haplotype was identified that, together with ancient haplotypes from Greece, Krasnodar Krai and postglacial samples from Crimea, forms a haplogroup distanced from other haplogroups of the western lineage. The age of this haplogroup is about 28-37 thousand years with a mutation rate of 5.14% per million years. The approximate age of the haplogroup of the Asian lineage, which included one of the samples, is 23-30 thousand years with the same mutation rate. Based on the results obtained, it can be preliminarily concluded that in the Caucasus, in particular in the Western Caucasus, more than 20 thousand years ago, representatives of both lines-western and eastern-lived symbiotopically, at least in the late (upper) Pleistocene.

AB  - The effects of bean dregs (BD), tea residue (TR), and biochar (BC) as additives on the organic matter (OM) degradation, humification, and maturity of green waste (GW) composting was examined. A 30-day aerobic composting study was conducted using six combinations of GW, BD, TR, and BC [GW, GW+BD, GW+TR, GW+BD+TR, GW+BD+BC, GW+BD+TR+BC]. The results showed that the additive treatments promoted OM degradation. The OM degradation of the additive groups was 28.75%-51.81% higher than that of the control group (GW as the control), and the degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose was 9.48%-25.39% and 10.12%-21.19% higher, respectively. Meanwhile, the synthesis of humic substances (HS) was significantly better than that of the control treatment. Bacterial community analysis showed that optimized composting increased bacterial community diversity. In addition, the amended composting enhanced maturity indices, including the C/N ratio, cation exchange capacity (CEC), germination index (GI), and electrical conductivity (EC). Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) suggested that the GI and CEC were positively correlated with HS but negatively correlated with the OM concentration. The evaluations of OM degradation, humification, bacterial dynamics, and maturity indicated that the GW+BD+TR+BC treatment was the best for improving GW composting and achieved an optimal maturity and stability.

AB  - Illegal hunting represents a major threat to the conservation of predators, but its impact remains difficult to assess as there are strong incentives to conceal this criminal activity. Attributing declines of carnivores to poaching is therefore an important conservation challenge. We present a case study of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in the Swiss Alps (Valais) where the current distribution range is smaller than in the recent past and population density is by =80% lower than in the adjacent Swiss Prealps. We tested four hypotheses to explain this lower density: (1) a too low density of camera-traps deployed for lynx surveys in Valais compared to the Prealps (methodological artifact); (2) less favorable environmental conditions around the camera-trap sites; (3) lower densities of the main prey; and (4) poaching. We estimated lynx and ungulate densities and environmental conditions at trail camera sites and could clearly reject the first three hypotheses because: (1) the survey protocol was similarly effective; (2) environmental conditions around the trapping sites in Valais were even more favorable for lynx detection than in the Prealps; and (3) prey supply was even larger in Valais. Concerning hypothesis 4, we discovered a network of illegal lynx traps (neck snares) in the main immigration corridor into Valais from the thriving adjacent lynx population in the Prealps, suggesting intense local poaching. Our findings substantiate the suspicions of long-lasting lynx poaching as a threat to the establishment and survival of the Valais population. The fact that instances of poaching were publicly known since 1995 but remained unabated for at least two decades, until the first conviction occurred, questions the commitment of local authorities to address this case of wildlife crime. Our study demonstrates the need for inquiries about poaching of top predators to be carried out at the highest levels of jurisdiction to avoid any risk of collusion between law enforcement agents and poachers.

AB  - The longsnout seahorse (Hippocampus reidi) is a vulnerable species found along most of the Brazilian coastline, such as semi-arid estuaries with strong rainfall seasonality, hypersalinity, and low depth. To evaluate the population structure of H. reidi over time, we monitored the seahorse population in the Pacoti estuary (Brazil) for one year, based on 248 registered specimens. Salinity, water transparency, sex, pregnancy, body height, and holdfast use were registered. Mixed linear models revealed that sampling month, salinity, and transparency had no influence on population density in the lower zone of the estuary. Pregnant individuals were more frequent in the dry season and at higher salinities. Mean body height (12.7 cm) increased in the dry season. Bright colors were predominant. The seahorses employed nine types of holdfasts, most often mangrove roots, and were found to reproduce throughout the year, peaking in the dry season. Salinity and transparency did not impact population density. In Brazilian semi-arid estuaries, the longsnout seahorse is strongly associated with mangrove vegetation, used as holdfast. Therefore, the conservation of seahorse populations depends on the conservation of the local mangrove forests.

AB  - Mapping habitats is essential to assist strategic decisions regarding the use and protection of coral reefs. Coupled with machine learning (ML) algorithms, remote sensing has allowed detailed mapping of reefs at meaningful scales. Here we integrated WorldView-3 and Landsat-8 imagery and ML techniques to produce a map of suitable habitats for the occurrence of a model species, the hydrocoral Millepora alcicornis, in coral reefs located inside marine protected areas in Northeast Brazil. Conservation and management efforts in the region were also analyzed, integrating human use layers to the ecological seascape. Three ML techniques were applied: two to derive base layers, namely geographically weighted regressions for bathymetry and support vector machine classifier (SVM) for habitat mapping, and one to build the species distribution model (MaxEnt) for Millepora alcicornis, a conspicuous and important reef-building species in the area. Additionally, human use was mapped based on the presence of tourists and fishers. SVM yielded 15 benthic classes (e.g., seagrass, sand, coral), with an overall accuracy of 79%. Bathymetry and its derivative layers depicted the topographical complexity of the area. The Millepora alcicornis distribution model identified distance from the shore and depth as topographical factors limiting the settling and growth of coral colonies. The most important variables were ecological, showing the importance of maintaining high biodiversity in the ecosystem. The comparison of the habitat suitability model with species absence and human use maps indicated the impact of direct human activities as potential inhibitors of coral development. Results reinforce the importance of the establishment of no-take zones and other protective measures for maintaining local biodiversity.

AB  - Understanding the activity patterns of a species is essential for developing sound conservation and management plans. In this study, we used a camera-trapping technique to determine the activity patterns of bharal (Pseudois nayaur) in a marginal population in Wolong National Nature Reserve, Sichuan, China. Our results showed that these animals preferred to be active in the daytime from 08:00 to 20:00, with an activity peak between 10:00 and 14:00. In addition, we found that the species had a seasonal activity pattern with higher activity frequency in summer than in winter and that bharal were most active in a temperature range of 3-11 degrees C and at night with a waxing crescent moon, implying that the activity rhythm of the species is an adaptation to a subtropical high-altitude alpine area with vertical zonation in temperature. The pattern of movement and activity was also correlated with the moon phase.

AB  - Simple Summary Wild game can host pathogens capable of infecting humans, livestock, and companion animals or accumulate environmental chemicals that may be transferred via food of animal origin. For food safety research, as well as for various other scientific purposes, the provision of a sufficient number of samples without unnecessary disturbance or killing of animals is a major limitation. With the presented approach, it was possible to obtain samples from game animals killed as part of standard ungulate management practice. Examples of organs, tissues, and other matrices that have been used in wild ungulate studies in Europe and that may be obtained through this approach are summarised as well. The basis of this approach was a framework agreement with the BImA, whereby federal forest officials carried out sampling with the help of hunters at drive hunts from 2017/18 to 2020/21 in Brandenburg, Germany. Numerous samples from four ungulate species were obtained. The number of sampled animals per hunt differed between hunting districts and hunting seasons. Districts with higher hunting bags also promise higher sampling success. This approach can serve as the basis for long-term monitoring of animal and public health threats associated with wildlife and is adaptable to other regions. Wildlife may host pathogens and chemicals of veterinary and public health relevance, as well as pathogens with significant economic relevance for domestic livestock. In conducting research on the occurrence and distribution of these agents in wildlife, a major challenge is the acquisition of a sufficient number of samples coupled with efficient use of manpower and time. The aim of this article is to present the methodology and output of a sampling approach for game animals, which was implemented from 2017/18 to 2020/21 at drive hunts in Brandenburg, Germany. The central element was a framework agreement with the BImA, whereby federal forest officials and other hunters collected most of the samples during field dressing. Further samples of game carcasses were obtained by scientists during subsequent gathering at a collection point. Altogether, 3185 samples from 938 wild ungulates of four species were obtained for various studies analysing-in this case-food-borne agents in game animals. Sampling was representative and reflected the proportional distribution of ungulate species hunted in Brandenburg. Hunting district and hunting season strongly influenced hunting bag and hence sampling success. This sampling approach was demonstrated to be a suitable basis for monitoring programs, that can be adapted to other regions.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can be transmitted between pigs and humans on farms. Hence, the reduction of MRSA carriage in pigs could decrease the risk of zoonotic transmission. Recently, straw bedding has been found to significantly reduce MRSA carriage in pigs. The mechanisms behind this effect remain unclear but changes in the nasal microbiome may play a role. In this exploratory study, the nasal microbiota of pigs kept on straw was examined using V1/V2 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Nasal swabs were collected from 13 pigs at six different time points during the course of a full fattening cycle resulting in 74 porcine samples. In addition, straw samples were collected at each time point. Eleven out of 13 pigs were MRSA positive at housing-in. We found a strong temporal pattern in the microbial communities. Both microbial diversity and abundance of Staphylococcus species peaked in week 5 after introduction to the straw stable decreased in week 10, when all pigs turned MRSA-negative, and increased again toward the end of the fattening period. These findings show that the introduction of pigs into a new environment has a huge impact on their nasal microbiota, which might lead to unfavorable conditions for MRSA. Moreover, other Staphylococcus species may play a role in eliminating MRSA carriage. We designed a follow-up study including two different husbandry systems to further assess these effects.

AB  - In the evolutionary arms race between plants and herbivores, sophisticated mechanisms of indirect plant defense play a pivotal role. This study investigated the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in attracting the parasitoid Ooencyrtus spp. to Aristolochia contorta, while also providing insights into the interactions among A. contorta, the herbivore Sericinus montela, and Ooencyrtus spp. in a tritrophic context. This study utilized field surveys, olfactometer experiments, and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to investigate the role of VOCs. Field surveys showed a 54.6% egg parasitism rate, with quadrats containing A. contorta and larvae attracting more Ooencyrtus spp. than those with the plant alone. In olfactometer bioassays, Ooencyrtus spp. preferred leaves damaged by a pattern wheel simulating herbivore damage, with 46.8% choosing these leaves over undamaged controls. Leaves treated with larval saliva were similarly attractive, drawing in 48.7% of Ooencyrtus spp.; however, the difference in attraction between saliva-treated and untreated leaves was not statistically significant, suggesting saliva may not be central to Ooencyrtus spp. attraction. GC-MS analysis identified VOCs in damaged leaves, including hexyl acetate, cyclohexene, delta-cadinene, alpha-pinene, and beta-caryophyllene, while saliva-treated leaves showed minimal amounts of exo-isocitral and beta-pinene. Despite complex responses, our analysis suggests these saliva-induced compounds do not significantly boost Ooencyrtus spp. attraction. This finding implies that while the VOC response to damage and saliva application is multifaceted, serving multiple defensive functions, the amount of these saliva-induced compounds may be insufficient to substantially influence the behavior of Ooencyrtus spp. toward damaged leaves. Our results emphasize the role of VOCs in A. contorta's indirect defense mechanisms and contribute to understanding the ecological dynamics within plant-parasitoid-herbivore interactions. Moreover, our findings suggest new avenues for exploring the ecological and evolutionary roles of chemical signals, highlighting the complex interactions facilitated by these cues in plant defenses.

AB  - Vermicomposting is a resource technology for managing animal excreta, whereas the internal relationships of the process are vital for its wide applications. The present study examined how macronutrient and micronutrient concentrations, microbial communities, and enzymatic activity of pig manure (PM) changed during the com-posting and vermicomposting processes and their internal interactions. The vermicomposting process increased macronutrients more significantly than composting (32.40% of total available nitrogen, 21.70% of total available phosphorous, and 12.70% of total available potassium). The vermicomposting reduced total organic carbon (7.91%), C/N ratio (61.35%), and humification index (56.47%) more than composting due to the quick decomposition of PM. After continual fertility optimization, the total microbial population, with the exception of total fungi, rose significantly to accelerate organics mineralization and improve macronutrients in vermi-composting compared to composting. Moreover, earthworm addition favored the stabilization of the PM con-taining higher concentrations of micronutrients after being catalyzed by the enhanced catalase activity and reduced sucrase activity after 90 days of vermicomposting. Principal component analysis and chord plots found that the generated vermicomposting products had higher fertility properties and biological activities induced by the synergistic effect of microorganisms and earthworms. These findings highlight vermicomposting is an eco-friendly management technology for processing PM and can be scaled up for agricultural applications.

AB  - In China, wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are primarily distributed in three prefectures in Southwest Yunnan, along the border with Laos and Myanmar. These elephants occur in small, fragmented populations and face significant threats from habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we successfully retrieved 48 mitochondrial genomes, including those from 35 wild Asian elephants in China and those from 13 captive Asian elephants, based on whole genome sequencing data to analyze their maternal population structure and genetic diversity. In addition, we extracted approximately 600 kb of non-coding genomic regions for a comparative analysis of the genetic structure between the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Wild Asian elephants in China exhibited extremely low genetic diversity compared to global populations, with only two haplotypes detected in the Chinese population. Despite limited mitochondrial haplotypes, the Xishuangbanna population maintains gene flow with external populations. In contrast, the genetic diversity in the Cangyuan population was even more severely limited, with no evidence of gene flow with the nearest populations in Myanmar. Given the close genetic relationship between the Cangyuan population and populations in other countries, the most promising strategy for introducing genetic diversity to rescue the Cangyuan population may involve translocating Asian elephants from other countries. This study provides a deeper understanding of the genetic status of wild Asian elephants in China and offers important insights for future conservation efforts in China and elsewhere.

   Fly families such as Calliphoridae and Muscidae contribute to the decomposition of cadavers and play an important role in courtroom proceedings, in part because of the clues they provide to help determine the time of death. In forensic entomology studies, they are often sampled using small bait traps containing a small amount of decomposing animal tissue. To determine whether the fly assemblages recovered by small bait traps are similar to those found on whole remains, we simultaneously documented the flies found on domestic pig carcasses and within small traps baited with pork liver. Results indicated that the fly assemblages found in the small bait traps and on the carcasses were different and reinforced the fact that caution should be exercised when data obtained from small bait traps are used in court.
   Small bait traps are beginning to emerge in forensic entomology as a new approach to sample early-colonizing necrophagous Diptera species while reducing the investment in time and energy in obtaining information. To test the hypothesis conveyed by the literature that these traps can be a substitute for whole carcasses, we simultaneously documented the Diptera assemblages visiting and colonizing domestic pig carcasses and small traps baited with pork liver. Results indicated that Diptera species occurrence and assemblage composition in the small bait traps and on the carcasses differed, while they were similar when comparing only the pig carcasses. These results are in agreement with the literature that examined insect colonization of other decaying substrates. Although small bait traps can be useful tools to document the communities of necrophagous Diptera in a given area, we stress that caution must be exercised when extending the data obtained by these traps to courtroom proceedings.

AB  - Simple Summary The TSSK1B gene has been demonstrated to play pivotal roles during spermatogenesis and is associated with male fertility. However, the potential mechanism on whether and how TSSK1B disrupts the fertility of yaks remains unknown. In this study, TSSK1B was found to be specifically expressed in the testes of yaks and especially highly expressed in adults. In contrast, it was rarely expressed in the testes of male cattle-yak, the hybrid F1 generation of the yak. The promoter region of TSSK1B in the adult cattle-yak testis was hypermethylated compared with that in the yak, which may be related to male cattle-yak infertility. This study provides the basis for further study of yak reproduction and male cattle-yak sterility. This study aimed to investigate the spatially and temporally expressed patterns and biological characteristics of TSSK1B in male yaks and explore the potential correlation between TSSK1B and male sterility of the yak hybrid offspring (termed cattle-yak). First, the coding sequence (CDS) of TSSK1B was cloned by RT-PCR, and bioinformatics analysis was conducted with relevant software. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was employed to detect the expression profile of TSSK1B in various tissues of male adult yaks, the spatiotemporal expression of TSSK1B in different stages of yak testes, and the differential expression of TSSK1B between yak and cattle-yak testes. The cellular localization of TSSK1B was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, the methylation status of the TSSK1B promoter region was analyzed by bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP). The results showed that TSSK1B was 1235 bp long, including 1104 bp of the CDS region, which encoded 367 amino acids. It was a conserved gene sharing the highest homology with Bos mutus (99.67%). In addition, the bioinformatics analysis revealed that TSSK1B was an unstable hydrophilic protein mainly containing the alpha helix of 34.06% and a random coil of 44.41%, with a transmembrane structure of 29 amino acids long. The RT-qPCR results demonstrated that TSSK1B was specifically expressed in yak testes compared with that in other tissues and especially highly expressed in adult yak testes. On the contrary, TSSK1B was hardly expressed in the testis of adult cattle-yak. IHC confirmed that TSSK1B protein was more strongly expressed in the testes of adult yaks than in their fetal and juvenile counterparts. Interestingly, nearly no expression was observed in the testes of cattle-yak compared with the corresponding testes of yak. Bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP) revealed that the methylated CpG sites in the TSSK1B promoter region of cattle-yak was significantly higher than that in the yak. Taken together, this study revealed that TSSK1B was specifically expressed in yak testes and highly expressed upon sexual maturity. Moreover, the rare expression in cattle-yak may be related to the hypermethylation of the promoter region, thereby providing a basis for further studies on the regulatory mechanism of TSSK1B in male cattle-yak sterility.

AB  - Understanding natural movement patterns and ecological roles of marine megafauna is a research priority best studied in areas with minimal human impact. The spatial distribution patterns specifically for immature turtles at foraging grounds have been highlighted as a research gap for effective management and conservation strategies for sea turtle populations. Capture-mark-recapture (CMR) records (n = 2287) of 1672 immature green (Chelonia mydas) (n = 1158) and hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) (n = 514) from a long-term (1981-2021) in-water CMR program at Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles, were analyzed for 10 sites (0.35-25 km apart). Site fidelity was not correlated with either season or turtle size. Green turtles had lower site fidelity than hawksbill turtles. Green turtles showed avoidance (i.e., opposite of fidelity) of three sites, while hawksbill turtles displayed high fidelity to two sites. Sites displaying non-random behavior (avoidance and/or fidelity) did not share the same benthic habitat types. Results indicate that fidelity can be detected at a fine scale with CMR, but that further exploration into the habitat characteristics of the sites and the ecological roles of both species at the atoll is needed.

AB  - Antibiotic overuse and the subsequent environmental contamination of residual antibiotics poses a public health crisis via an acceleration in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) through horizontal gene transfer. Although the occurrence, distribution, and driving factors of ARGs in soils have been widely investigated, little is known about the antibiotic resistance of soilborne pathogens at a global scale. To explore this gap, contigs from 1643 globally sourced metagnomes are assembled, yielding 407 ARG-carrying pathogens (APs) with at least one ARG; APs are detected in 1443 samples (sample detection rate of 87.8%). The richness of APs is greater in agricultural soils (with a median of 20) than in non-agricultural ecosystems. Agricultural soils possess a high prevalence of clinical APs affiliated with Escherichia, Enterobacter, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus. The APs detected in agricultural soils tend to coexist with multidrug resistance genes and bacA.

AB  - To improve the estimate of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from tropical rangelands in sub-Saharan Africa, we measured GHG emissions from sheep excreta over two periods of 51 days on a Kenya rangeland. In addition, we measured GHG emissions from potential hotspots in the landscape linked to sheep grazing: overnight enclosures ("bomas"), where sheep are kept at night to protect them from theft and predators, the areas surrounding sheep bomas, and areas surrounding watering troughs. Results showed a short pulse of CO2 fluxes after sheep urine application and a rapid increase of CH4 fluxes following sheep dung application in both rainy and dry season. However, only small increases of N2O fluxes were observed after dung and urine applications compared to controls without excreta. Elevated N2O fluxes mainly coincided with heavy rainfall. Overall, N2O emission factors (EFs) did not vary across excreta type or seasons, but mean N2O EFs for dung (0.01%) and urine patches (0.02%) were only one tenth of the default EFs from the 2019 IPCC Refinement for dry climate. We did, however, find that bomas and watering troughs are sites of herd concentration that are important sources of GHG emis-sions in the landscape, and that emissions in these locations can remain elevated for months to years, especially when soil moisture is high. This study contributes to more robust estimates of GHG emissions from African livestock systems, which are fundamental to develop targeted mitigation strategies.

AB  - Plants are well known to enhance leaf microstructure to respond to insect herbivory. Herbivory signalling molecules can be transferred through vascular systems to alert distant undamaged leaves. Here, we found that leaf anatomical structure and vasculature of Bouteloua dactyloidesmother ramets were enhanced when interconnected daughter ramets experienced medium defoliation, but not heavy defoliation. Likewise, clonal integration enhanced leaf microstructure of daughter ramets in the medium defoliation treatment and reduced support for daughter ramets when they were grown in the heavy defoliation treatment. Leaf vasculature was more responsive to remote defoliation and clonal integration than leaf anatomical structure.
   Stolon connection of clonal plants can translocate resources and signalling molecules between interconnected ramets to enhance resistance. Plants are well known to enhance leaf anatomical structure and vein density to respond to insect herbivory. Herbivory signalling molecules are transferred through vascular system to alert distant undamaged leaves, which is called systemic defence induction. Here, we investigated how clonal integration modulates leaf vasculature and anatomical structure of Bouteloua dactyloides ramets to cope with different levels of simulated herbivory. Ramet pairs were subject to six treatments, daughter ramets were exposed to three defoliation levels (0 %, 40 % or 80 % leaf removal) and their stolon connections to mother ramets were either severed or kept intact. Local 40 % defoliation increased vein density and adaxial/abaxial cuticle thickness, decreased leaf width and areolar area of daughter ramets. However, such effects of 80 % defoliation were much smaller. Compared with remote 40 % defoliation, remote 80 % defoliation increased leaf width and areolar area and decreased vein density of interconnected undefoliated mother ramets. Without simulated herbivory, stolon connection negatively affected most leaf microstructural traits of both ramets except from denser veins of mother ramets and more bundle sheath cells of daughter ramets. The negative effect of stolon connection on leaf mechanical structures of daughter ramets was ameliorated in the 40 % defoliation treatment, but not in the 80 % defoliation treatment. Stolon connection increased vein density and decreased areolar area of daughter ramets in the 40 % defoliation treatment. In contrast, stolon connection increased areolar area and decreased bundle sheath cell number of 80 % defoliated daughter ramets. Defoliation signals were transmitted from younger ramets to older ramets to change their leaf biomechanical structure. Clonal integration can adjust leaf microstructure of younger ramets according to the degree of herbivory stress, especially leaf vasculature.

AB  - Simple Summary: Dietary selection affects the survival and health of mammals under winter, high-energy supplemental feeding (SF) is one of the commonly used strategies for captive wildlife, however, how gut microbiota respond to high-energy dietary in winter remains poorly understood. 16S rRNA gene analysis was employed to determine gut microbiota in red deer (Cervus elaphus) in winter. High-energy feed affects the gut microbial composition and function in red deer. During SF, the gut microbes in red deer were enriched in microorganisms associated with butyrate and lipid metabolism, such as R. microfusus, M. intestinale, and Papillibacter cinnamivorans. These gut microbes may be involved in ameliorating obesity associated with high-energy diets. Our findings indicate effectiveness of high-energy supplementary feeding. Winter supplemental feeding (SF) is commonly used to improve the survival of captive wildlife. To investigate the impact of winter supplementation on the gut microbiota of wildlife, we assessed changes in the gut microbiota of red deer (Cervus elaphus) during the supplementary and non-supplementary feeding (NSF) groups using 16S rRNA sequencing technology. We found no significant differences in the diversity of the gut microbiota between SF and NSF except for the Simpson's index. However, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Lentisphaerae, and Proteobacteria in the gut microbiota was significantly higher during SF. Further, genera such as Intestinimonas, Rikenella, Lawsonibacter, Muribaculum, and Papillibacter were more abundant during SF. Beta diversity analysis showed significant differences between SF and NSF. The microbes detected during SF were primarily associated with lipid metabolism, whereas those detected during NSF were linked to fiber catabolism. High-energy feed affects the gut microbial composition and function in red deer. During SF, the gut microbes in red deer were enriched in microorganisms associated with butyrate and lipid metabolism, such as R. microfusus, M. intestinale, and Papillibacter cinnamivorans. These gut microbes may be involved in ameliorating obesity associated with high-energy diets. In summary, SF is a reasonable and effective management strategy.

AB  - Lamb survival is influenced by the culmination of a sequence of often interrelated events including genetics, physiology, behaviour and nutrition, with the environment providing an overarching complication. Machine learning algorithms offer great flexibility with regard to problems of complex interactions among variables. The objective of this study was to use machine learning algorithms to identify factors affecting the lamb survival in high altitudes and cold climates. Lambing records were obtained from three native breed of sheep (Awassi = 50, Morkaraman = 50, Tuj = 50) managed in semi intensive systems. The data set included 193 spring born lambs out of which 106 lambs were sired by indigenous rams (n = 10), and 87 lambs were sired by Romanov Rams (n = 10).
   Factors included were dam body weight at lambing, age of dam, litter size at birth, maternal and lamb be-haviors, and lamb sex. Individual and cohort data were combined into an original dataset containing 1351 event records from 193 individual lambs and 750 event records from 150 individual ewes. Classification algorithms applied for lamb survival were Bayesian Methods, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine and Decision Trees. Variables were categorized for lamb survival, lamb behavior, and mothering ability. Random-Forest performed very well in their classification of the mothering ability while SMO was found best in predicting lamb behavior. REPtree tree visualization showed that grooming behavior is the first determinant for mothering ability. Classification Trees performed best in lamb survival. Our results showed that Classification Trees clearly outperform others in all traits included in this study.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are root symbionts that can facilitate plant growth and influence plant communities by altering plant interactions with herbivores. Therefore, AM fungi could be critical for the conservation of certain rare plants and herbivores. For example, North American milkweed species are crucial hosts for monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus). Understanding how mycorrhizal composition affects milkweeds will have direct impacts on the conservation and restoration of both increasingly threatened guilds. We present data from three studies on the effect of AM fungal composition on milkweed growth, latex production, and establishment. First, we grew seven milkweed species with and without a mixture of native mycorrhizal fungi. We assessed how important fungal composition is to milkweed growth and latex production by growing four milkweed species with seven fungal compositions, as single-species inoculations with four native fungi, a mixture of native fungi, a single commercial fungus of presumably non-native origin, and noninoculated controls. Finally, we assessed the field establishment of two milkweed species with and without native mycorrhizal inoculation. Milkweed species grew 98% larger and produced 82% more latex after inoculation with native mycorrhizae. Milkweeds were strongly affected by fungal composition; milkweeds were inhibited by commercial fungi (average of -14% growth) and showed variable but positive responses to native fungal species (average of +3% to +38% biomass). Finally, we found that restoration establishment was dependent on inoculation with native fungi and milkweed species. Overall, our findings indicate that some milkweed species (i.e., Asclepias syriaca and A. incarnata) are not responsive to mycorrhizal fungal presence or sensitive to mycorrhizal composition while others are, including endangered species (A. meadii) and species of high conservation value (A. tuberosa). We conclude that the reintroduction of native AM fungi could improve the establishment of desirable milkweed species and should be considered within strategies for plantings for monarch conservation.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) volatilization and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission are important environment pollution sources in upland agro-ecosystems. Vermicompost was used for amending purple soil and comparing NH3 and GHG emissions. A field experiment was conducted with a comparison of organic and inorganic fertilizers in a wheat-maize rotation system in the Sichuan Basin, China. The five treatments were conventional inorganic fertilizers, NPK as control; vermicompost prepared with cow dung (VCM); and pig manure (VPM); cow dung and pig manure vermicompost, re-spectively (VCMNPK, VPMNPK). Total nitrogen rates of all treatments were the same. Soil NH3 volatilization and GHG emissions were monitored with the static chamber method. The results showed that NH3 volatilization occurred in the first two weeks following nitrogen (N) fertilization. The cumulative fluxes of NH3 recorded in the NPK, VCM, VPM, VCMNPK, and VPMNPK treatments were 15.4, 5.7, 6.3, 10.32, and 10.29 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively, in the winter and 4.8, 5.5, 19.83, 12.8, and 11.9 kg N ha-1 yr-1 respectively, in the summer. The global warming potential (GWP) 773.6 and 803.9 g CO2-eq m-2 in VCM and VPM, respectively, during the wheat season 540.6 and 576.2 g CO2-eq m-2, respectively, during the maize season. The GWPs in NPK treatment were 1032.4 and 570.7 g CO2-eq m-2 during the wheat and maize seasons, respectively. The increasing effects of nutrient loops, particularly 18 % soil total nitrogen (TN) and 31 % soil organic carbon (SOC) in VCM, and crop productivity of vermicompost treatments during the wheat-maize rotation had been evaluated. This study recommends that VCM can be considered as a better organic amendment, promoting plant growth while decreasing the environmental costs of gas emissions.

AB  - Environmental conflicts, particularly within the pig industry in Chile, pose serious ecological, social, and economic challenges. This study focuses on analyzing the bioethical aspects of the ongoing environmental conflicts at an industrial pig farm in the Maule Region's rural localities. Employing heuristic and hermeneutic methodologies, the research analyzed over 790 documents, such as environment agency reports, legislation, and community testimonials. The findings underscore severe environmental harm, highlighted by air and water pollution caused by waste and emissions from pig farms. These environmental issues correlate with significant health problems in the community, including respiratory diseases and psychological stress. Furthermore, the study outlines the socio-economic repercussions, such as unsustainable water use and the detrimental impacts on local agriculture and livelihoods. The findings advocate for the enhanced management of natural resources, further scientific investigation, and the adoption of sustainable practices to ensure environmental justice and improve the well-being of impacted communities.

AB  - Little is known about limits to reproduction in plants, especially as to how their other life history functions (growth and defense) may constrain reproductive investment. Understanding these constraints can help researchers refine best practices for cultivating species like Rubus (Rosaceae) that produce nutritious fruits as well as for controlling invasive species. Here, we sought to elucidate potential trade-offs between growth, defense, and reproduction in native Rubus allegheniensis Porter (common blackberry) and invasive Rubus phoenicolasius Maxim. (wineberry) while accounting for the effects of varying insect herbivory and resource availability levels. We observed traits related to physical defense (e.g., prickle intensity), growth (e.g., cane length), and floral reproduction (e.g., ripe fruits), as well as carbon availability ( e. g., canopy cover). We then used multiple regressions to characterize relationships between these variables for both species. We found potential evidence for 2 induced defenses in the invasive wineberry. Also, 5 models returned significant results indicative of trade-offs between reproduction and growth, reproduction and defense, and defense and growth in a single or both species. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the defensive strategies utilized by these species because inducible defenses may result in trade-offs that could reduce yields and (or) increase the invasive potential of Rubus species.

AB  - The elimination of ejaculates and males with low fertility despite good sperm motility and morphology is crucial to maintain high pregnancy rates after artificial insemination (AI) in farm animals. The ability of sperm to survive in the female tract is particularly crucial in pigs due to the large variation in the timing between AI and ovulation and the high number of oocytes to fertilise. The objective of this study was to characterise a new in vitro model of oviduct sperm reservoir using porcine oviduct epithelial spheroids (OES) and to assess the variability in sperm binding to OES among gilts, boars and their ejaculates. Isthmic mucosa fragments were collected from gilt oviducts at a slaughterhouse, and after 48 h of culture, the OES that had spontaneously formed were sorted according to their vesicle shape and size (150-200 mu m in diameter) for characterisation and sperm binding assays. The OES contained viable, cytokeratin-positive and vimentin-negative cells, of which 36.4 +/- 2.0% were multiciliated. The average proportion of multiciliated cells per OES did not change among culture replicates. After co-incubation with boar fresh semen, only sperm of normal morphology were found to bind, by their head, to cilia of OES. The density of sperm bound to the OES surface increased linearly with sperm concentration. The bound sperm density on OES was used to assess the binding capacity of fresh ejaculates collected from Pietrain boars. For a given ejaculate, the bound sperm density did not vary among pools of OES female donors. The analysis of five successive ejaculates from nine boars indicated significant differences in bound sperm densities on the OES among individual boars and their ejaculates (P < 0.01). There was no correlation between the sperm bound density and sperm parameters measured by computer-assisted sperm analysis or the initial dilution of the ejaculate. In conclusion, the OES characterised in this study offered physiological conditions to study sperm binding to the isthmic reservoir and evidenced that sperm from different ejaculates and different boars vary in their ability to bind to these oviduct spheroids despite homogeneous motility and morphology.

AB  - In water-limited ecosystems, soil water regulates root water uptake (RWU) strategies. However, RWU responses to soil water changes under different species are not well-understood. We assessed RWU responses of three revegetation species [shrub (Hippophae rhamnoides Linn.), coniferous forest [Platycladus orientalis (L.) Franco], and broad-leaved forest (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) during the dry (May to June) and rainy (July to August) seasons in 2020 on the Loess Plateau using stable isotope methods. We sampled soil and xylem for each species at approximately weekly intervals and used the MixSIAR model to quantify RWU contribution with stable water isotopes. The results indicated that soil water in the shallow (0-40 cm) and middle (40-200 cm) soil layers fluctuated more strongly than the deep soil layer (200-300 cm) due to precipitation and evapotranspiration. Before precipitation in the dry season, most of the RWU for H. rhamnoides and R. pseudoacacia (97% and 98%) came from the middle layer under limited soil water. After precipitation in the dry season, the three species had similar RWU responses to soil water changes. After precipitation in the rainy season, the RWU change of H. rhamnoides and R. pseudoacacia with deep soil drying was more sensitive to soil water change than P. orientalis with sufficient deep water on August 3 and 11, while, the RWU of H. rhamnoides was more sensitive to soil water change than R. pseudoacacia on August 11 and 19. Thus, by switching its water-use strategy, H. rhamnoides adapted better to the soil water environment than P. orientalis and R. pseudoacacia. This finding will help in selecting the optimal revegetation species for water use in a changing climate environment.

AB  - Although nanoparticles have gained attention as efficient alternatives to conventional agricultural chemicals, there is limited knowledge regarding their effects on herbivorous insect behavior and plant physicochemistry. Here, we investigated the effects of foliar applications of nano-silica (SiO2NPs) and nano-selenium (SeNPs), and bulk-size silica (SiO2) on the choice behavior of the arrowhead scale insect on mandarin orange plants. One leaf of a bifoliate pair was treated with one of the three chemicals, while the other was treated with water (control). The respective SiO2, SeO2, calcium (Ca), and carbon (C) content levels in the leaf epidermis and mesophyll were quantified using SEM-EDX (or SEM-EDS); leaf toughness and the arrowhead scale density and body size were measured. First-instar nymphs preferred silica-treated leaves and avoided SeNP-treated leaves. SiO2 content did not differ between control and SiO2NP-treated leaves, but was higher in bulk-size SiO2-treated leaves. The SiO2 level in the control leaves was higher in the SiO2NP treatment compared with that in the control leaves in the bulk-size SiO2 treatment. Silica-treated leaves increased in toughness, but SeNP-treated leaves did not; leaf toughness increased with mesophyllic SiO2 content. The insect density per leaf increased with leaf toughness, SiO2 content and, in the SiO2NP treatment, with epidermal C content. There was no correlation between SeO2 content and insect density. This study highlights the potential uses of SeNPs as an insect deterrent and of silica for enhancing leaf toughness and attracting scale insects.

AB  - Reef fish communities are shaped by historical and ecological factors, including abiotic and biotic mechanisms at different spatial scales, determining species composition, abundance and biomass. The oceanic islands in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (St. Peter and St. Paul's Archipelago - SPSPA, Ascension, and St. Helena), exhibiting differences in community structure along a 14-degree latitudinal and a 10 degrees C thermal gradient. We investigate the influence of sea surface temperature, area, age, isolation and phosphate on reef fish community structures. Reef fish trophic structure varies significantly across the islands, with planktivores and herbivore-detritivores showing the highest abundances in SPSPA and Ascension, while less abundant in St. Helena, aligning with the thermal gradient. Variations in reef fish community structures were predominantly influenced by thermal regimes, corroborating the expansion of species' thermal niche breadth at higher latitudes and lower temperatures. This study highlights that in addition to biogeographic factors, temperature is pivotal on shaping oceanic island reef fish community structure.

AB  - Simple Summary Existing studies have paid attention to the effect of light-controlled conditions on the increase in cashmere production but changes in the environmental parameters of goat houses have been ignored. In this study, we monitored concentrations of CO2 and NH3 in a light-controlled goat house while evaluating the effect of light-controlled conditions on the increase in cashmere production. The results show that the concentrations of harmful gases under short photoperiod treatment are harmful to the health of goats. This study will provide a reference for the formulation of ventilation schemes in light-controlled goat houses. The quality and yield of cashmere closely affect the economic benefits of cashmere goat farming. Studies have shown that controlling light can have an important impact on cashmere but can also affect the concentration of harmful gases. In order to explore the impact of a short photoperiod on the growth of cashmere and harmful gases in goat houses, 130 female (non-pregnant) Shanbei white cashmere goats, aged 4-5 years with similar body weights, were randomly divided into a control group and a treatment group, with 65 goats in each group. The dietary nutrition levels of the experimental goats were the same, and completely natural light was used in the control group; the light control group received light for 7 h every day (9:30-16:30), and the rest of the time (16:30-9:30 the next day) they did not receive light. The light control treatment was carried out in a control house, and the gas content was analyzed. It was found that a shortened period of light exposure could increase the annual average cashmere production by 34.5%. The content of each gas has a certain functional relationship with the measurement time period, but at the same time, we found that the content of NH3 also changes seasonally. In summary, the use of shortened light periods when raising cashmere goats can significantly increase cashmere production and quality, but at the same time, it will increase the concentration of harmful gases in the goat barn, and ventilation should be increased to ensure the health of the goats and the air quality in the barn.

AB  - Spatial modeling of wildlife diseases can be used to describe patterns of disease risk, understand biological mechanisms of disease occurrence, and for spatial prediction. Risk of wildlife disease occurrence in relation to environmental variables is often modeled and predicted using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which are unsuitable for large datasets and those covering large spatial extents. Integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and INLA using the stochastic partial differential equation (INLA-SPDE) approach have become popular alternatives to MCMC for Bayesian inference because of their fast computational time and ability to process large datasets. Studies investigating risk of disease occurrence in wildlife, to our knowledge, have not yet compared Bayesian hierarchical spatial models over large spatial extents using real world data. Using chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance data from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) collected in Pennsylvania, United States, as a case study, we first demonstrate how parameter estimates compare among MCMC, INLA, and INLA-SPDE modeling frameworks. We then model CWD (detected/non-detected) using INLA-SPDE over a much larger spatial extent than has been conducted previously for this disease to determine how surveillance type (e.g., hunter harvest, roadkill, or all surveillance) influences model parameters and predicted risk of CWD occurrence at locations not sampled. Fixed effects considered in the models included deer age and sex, elevation, slope, distance to streams, percent clay, and proportion of two habitat classes (forest and open) known to influence deer movements. We found INLA to produce comparable estimates to MCMC and permit modeling large datasets covering expansive spatial extents much faster and more efficiently than MCMC. We identified potential biases in surveillance types, indicating the value of including all surveillance in models rather than only a single type. Comparing modeling tools available for mapping diseases of wildlife in relation to ecological variables at large spatial extents will guide future modeling efforts for CWD and other wildlife diseases. Understanding spatial patterns of CWD using different surveillance types can help improve understanding of CWD disease outbreaks, assist with control of CWD through geographical targeting, and inform future CWD surveillance efforts.

AB  - The subregion of La Mojana is a national geostrategic region. It includes the basins of the rivers Magdalena, Cauca, and San Jorge. This location has abundant wetlands, zapales (particular marshes from the region), and swamps where there are cyclical floodings and droughts. This region is also considered to be a great reservoir of freshwater, very rich in biodiversity and a place with productive wetlands. It is considered a food reservoir, and despite its cattle-raising tradition, 20% of the rice consumed in Colombia is cultivated here. In addition, it consists of water and land ecosystems that stimulate an agricultural, cattle raising and fishery base: productive fields which generate 90% of the economic productivity of the area. Between 2021 and 2022, frequent and historical floodings affected 24253 acres of agricultural land, especially the 9633.2 acres of rice crops. There has also been registered some damage to other production units such as corn (645.2 acres), plantain (194.5 acres), cows (6757), pigs (6083), horses (603), poultry (40287), and more than 550000 fish. According to the Register of Victims ( Registro & Uacute;nico de Damnificados, in Spanish), no less than 45000 people were affected by the winter wave in 2021. In order to achieve the objectives stated in this article, three phases will be developed: the first one involves the construction of the conceptual framework, explaining the nature of the community water resilience category and the pre-identification of the categories and dimensions that are going to be used in the construction of the indicators. In the second phase, a methodological description is established. Finally, in the third phase, an estimation of the qualitative indicators is formulated. The results will help decision makers to generate projects that minimize the damages caused by the flooding.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Boar taint is characterized by an off-odor or off-flavor in heated pork products that is caused by the accumulation of androstenone in the fat. We have previously demonstrated that androstenone is transported to the fat bound by the plasma protein albumin; however, it is unclear if androstenone sulfate, which is more abundant in the circulation, is transported in the same manner and if the transport of androstenone in the plasma influences the degree of accumulation in the fat. In this article, we determined that androstenone sulfate bound minimally in the plasma of the boar and suggested that this may leave it readily available to enter peripheral tissues, such as the fat where it may enzymatically return free androstenone. Additionally, we demonstrated that the binding of androstenone in the plasma varies significantly between boars with high and low concentrations of androstenone in the fat. This suggests that the binding of androstenone to albumin in the plasma affects the transport and distribution of androstenone within the boar.
   Androstenone circulates in the plasma bound to albumin before accumulating in the fat, resulting in the development of boar taint. Androstenone sulfate is more abundant in the circulation than free androstenone; however, it is unclear how androstenone sulfate is transported in the plasma and if steroid transport affects the development of boar taint. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize the binding of androstenone sulfate in boar plasma and determine if variability in steroid binding affects the accumulation of androstenone in the fat. [H-3]-androstenone sulfate was incubated with plasma and the steroid binding was quantified using gel filtration chromatography. Inter-animal variability was assessed by quantifying androstenone binding specificity in plasma obtained from boars that had high or low fat androstenone concentrations at slaughter. Androstenone sulfate bound minimally in the plasma and to isolated albumin, which suggests that it is transported primarily in solution. The specific binding of androstenone quantified in plasma and isolated albumin from low fat androstenone animals was significantly higher (p = 0.01) than in high fat androstenone boars. These results indicate that the binding of androstenone to albumin varies amongst individual animals and affects the transport of androstenone in the plasma and accumulation in the fat of the boar.

AB  - Due to its favorable properties, soybean meal (SBM) is used especially in young growing animals. In terms of sustainability, there are various efforts to reduce the amounts of SBM in compound feeds and to increase the use of regional protein sources. This paper focuses on the effects of a partial to total substitution of SBM by regionally produced rapeseed meal (RSM) in different piglet diets regarding 10 important factors having an impact on the environment. Four diets, characterized by different shares (%) of both protein-rich ingredients (SBM/RSM: 18.1/0; 13.6/6.70; 8.10/16.1; 0/28.0), were fed to four groups of 10 piglets each in two runs. The impact was calculated related to feed (per t) and was performance-based for every piglet (impact center dot kg weight gain(-1)) for each factor using methods according to life-cycle-analyses (LCA). Although feed intake and weight gains were not affected negatively, higher feed conversion ratios occurred, with high amounts of rapeseed inclusion. Nevertheless, the performance-based negative influence on climate change (kg CO2 eq center dot kg weight gain(-1)) was nearly halved when SBM was replaced by RSM. Since performance was not negatively affected, the use of RSM instead of SBM in piglet diets could be a viable tool for markedly reducing the negative impact on climate change.

AB  - This study examines prey-carrying behavior in culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus) and chilla (L. griseus) foxes within Chilean Patagonia's sheep farming lands. We used camera traps to register prey transportation. This behavior was more frequent during the reproductive season compared to the non-reproductive season, suggesting an association with pup-rearing activities. The presence of livestock guardian dogs and other predation control measures may also influence prey-carrying behavior, particularly in L. culpaeus, as foxes might adjust their activities in response to perceived risks. This research provides initial evidence of prey transport in these fox species and highlights the need for further study to understand its ecological implications and interactions with livestock management practices.

AB  - Fertilization is a pervasive approach to agricultural production enhancing vegetable nutrients such as phosphorus (P) absorption. However, unreasonable fertilization strategies result in high levels of residual P in vegetable planting systems. To better understand the mechanisms of soil phosphorus dynamics responding to inorganic/organic fertilization, we conducted a 3-year field experiment in two newly reclaimed vegetable fields in southern China. The results revealed that soil Olsen-P in CF (mineral fertilization) and OF (Combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers) increased by approximately 210.6 % and 183.6 %, respectively, while stable P proportion decreased by approximately 9.2 % and 18.1 %, respectively, compared with CK. Combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizer increased the proportion of moderately labile P (NaOHP) by 1-6 % in comparison with chemical fertilizer and facilitated the conversion from diester-P to monoester-P, indicating that applying pig manure enhanced the potential soil P bioavailability. Besides, organic-inorganic fertilization shaped a bacterial community with more connectivity and stability and changed keystone taxa related to the P transformation of the network. Phenylobacterium, Solirubrobacter, and Modestobacter were regarded as core genera for mobilizing soil phosphorus. However, residual P content in newly reclaimed soils under fertilization, especially for chemical fertilizer, remained non-negligible and may cause potential environmental risks. The partial least squares path modeling results demonstrated that fertilization management had both direct and indirect positive effects on P fraction through the improvement of soil nutrients e.g. total N and soil organic carbon, and bacterial community, while soil properties mainly determined the variation of soil P species. Our results provide comprehensive insights into the current status of legacy P forms and the vital role of fertilizer, key soil properties and bacteria in P dynamics in newly reclaimed vegetable field.

AB  - As a relatively nascent discipline, conservation physiology has struggled to deliver science that is relevant to decision-makers or directly useful to practitioners. A growing body of literature has revealed that co-produced research is more likely to generate knowledge that is not only relevant, but that is also embraced and actionable. Co-production broadly involves conducting research collaboratively, inclusively, and in a respectful and engaged manner-spanning all stages from identifying research needs to study design, data collection, interpretation and application. This approach aims to create actionable science and deliver meaningful benefits to all partners involved. Knowledge can be co-produced with practitioners/managers working for regulators or stewardship bodies, Indigenous communities and governments, industry (e.g. fishers, foresters, farmers) and other relevant actors. Using diverse case studies spanning issues, taxa and regions from around the globe, we explore examples of co-produced research related to conservation physiology. In doing so, we highlight benefits and challenges while also identifying lessons for others considering such an approach. Although co-production cannot guarantee the ultimate success of a project, for applied research (such as what conservation physiology purports to deliver), embracing co-production is increasingly regarded as the single-most important approach for generating actionable science to inform conservation. In that sense, the conservation physiology community would be more impactful and relevant if it became commonplace to embrace co-production as demonstrated by the case studies presented here.
   This article aims to highlight successful applications of co-production within the realm of conservation physiology. Relying on the diverse experiences of co-authors, we also offer guidance to those embracing co-production in their conservation physiology projects.

AB  - Novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) have been of great concern in the past few years due to their ubiquity in the environment and potential bioconcentration characteristics. This study takes Xilingol grassland in Inner Mongolia as the research area to analyze the pollution characteristics of NBFRs (pTBX, HBB, PBT, PBBz, and PBEB) in the grassland food chain. pTBX was more likely to be biomagnified in the food chain of amphibians, reptiles, and birds, whereas PBT and HBB were more likely to be biomagnified in the food chain of mammals. This may be because these animals have different diets and metabolic patterns. According to the concentration distribution of NBFRs in sheep organs and tissues, PBT, HBB, and PBBz easy bioaccumulated in sheep. The biomagnification effect of sheep adipose tissue and internal organs on NBFRs was inconsistent, so the biomagnification of chemicals in organisms cannot be determined only by the biomagnification of adipose tissue.

AB  - The formation and development of blowouts is an important surface indication of sand drift activity in the Hulun Buir sandy grassland and the main cause of landscape pattern heterogeneity. In this study, dynamic changes and determinants of blowouts in this region were studied via analysis of multi-period high-resolution remote sensing data from 1959 to 2018. The different stages of activity and dominant factors of the fixation and activation of blowouts were analysed with Lancaster's M-index. The results show that the activity of blowouts in Hulun Buir sandy grassland can be divided into three stages from 1959 to 2018: (I) growth and expansion stage, from 1959 to 2004; (II) fixation and grassland recovery stage, from 2005 to 2010; (III) redevelopment stage, from 2011 to 2018. The two geomorphic units of depressions and depositional lobes exhibit different responses to changes in climatic factors. The depositional lobes are more sensitive to the change in external factors with better feedback and their areas and numbers change with the variation of stage, while depressions exhibit relatively slow changes. The wind regime is the dominant factor explaining the variation of activity of blowouts, with precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as secondary factors for this region. Roads have little effect on the development and deformation of blowouts, but the movement of cattle and sheep across the region has a big influence. Therefore, the desertification process of Hulun Buir grassland is driven by both natural and human factors.

AB  - This study investigated the interactive effect of glucocorticoid and beta-adrenoceptors in the infralimbic (IL) cortex on the acquisition and consolidation of fear extinction in rats' auditory fear conditioning (AFC) task. On day 1, rats underwent habituation for 9 min (12 tones, 10 s, 4 kHz, 80 dB, without footshock). On day 2 (conditioning), rats received 3 mild electrical footshocks (US; 2 s, 0.5 mA) paired with the auditory-conditioned stimulus (CS; tone: 30 s, 4 kHz, 80 dB). On days 3-5 (Ext 1-3), rats received 15 tones with no footshock in the test box. Intra-IL injection of corticosterone (CORT, 20 ng/0.5 mu l per side) before Ext 1 and after Ext 1-2, respectively, facilitated the acquisition and consolidation of fear memory extinction. Intra-IL injection of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol (CLEN, 50 ng/0.5 mu l per side) inhibited, but the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (PROP, 500 ng/0.5 mu l per side) enhanced the facilitatory effects of CORT on fear memory extinction. CORT injection before the acquisition of fear extinction increased p-ERK levels in the IL. Co-injection of CORT with CLEN increased, but PROP decreased p-ERK activities. CORT injection after the consolidation of fear extinction increased p-CREB in the IL. Co-injection of CORT with CLEN increased, but PROP reduced p-CREB activities. Our findings show that corticosterone facilitates the acquisition and consolidation of fear memory extinction. GRs and beta-adrenoceptors in the IL jointly regulate fear memory extinction via ERK and CREB signaling pathways. This pre-clinical animal study may highlight the effect of GRs and beta-adrenoceptors of the IL cortex in regulating fear memory processes in fear-related disorders such as PTSD.

AB  - The African savannah elephant (Loxodonta Africana) migrate in response to limiting environmental factors in arid areas. Using global positioning systems (GPS) telemetry data, we determined: (i) the dominant vegetation types used by African savannah elephants and (ii) the differences in the area occupied by dominant vegetation types in Gonarezhou National Park (GNP) in Zimbabwe. Significant spatiotemporal differences (p < 0.05) detected in vegetation types utilised by the African savannah elephant, and in the area covered by vegetation types induced a determinate foraging pattern. Global positioning system telemetry is a smart conservation tool for surveillance of movement patterns of African savannah elephants in protected areas.

AB  - Is the increased use in wildlife conservation of techniques derived from military and security services appropriate? One aspect of this issue that remains poorly considered is whether all actors engaged in conservation projects that have a security orientation are engaged primarily in conservation. Western intelligence agencies are known to have used non-government aid organizations (NGOs) as cover for clandestine operations. Does this happen in conservation? In one example, a previous US President expressed concern that ivory trafficking represented a national security threat to the USA, following a report claiming that ivory trafficking was funding terrorist networks in Africa. Coincident with this new reason for concern regarding elephant poaching, a US-based conservation NGO employed staff from US military intelligence to develop and run an intelligence fusion center with the Kenya Wildlife Service. After a few years, the head of the operation left the NGO and returned directly to her career in military intelligence. Without access to classified information, it is impossible to determine if this was coincidence. Analytical tools, including some developed by the intelligence community, could be used to better assess whether some conservation programs are cover for clandestine operations. In the meantime, conservation professionals need to consider the possibility that there could be serving officers of intelligence agencies inside conservation NGOs. In order to ensure the security of conservation workers and the acceptance of conservation programs worldwide, all national governments should offer unequivocal guarantees that conservation NGOs are not being used for covert intelligence operations.

AB  - The prickly pear (Opuntia megasperma var. orientalis), a pivotal species for the ecological balance of Espanola Island in Galapagos, has witnessed a severe decline in its population due to the enduring presence of introduced feral goats over several decades. Additionally, the inherent slow recovery of this species, requiring several years of development, has contributed to its population decline. Several attempts were carried out to restore this species, but they were not successful due to the island's extreme arid conditions. Subsequently, innovative water-saving technologies were introduced to ensure the survival and growth of the Opuntia species. Two water-saving technologies, Groasis Waterboxx (R) and Hydrogel, were applied in two distinct treatments, the first involving Waterboxx solely, and the second combining Waterboxx with Hydrogel, alongside a control group. Planting involved two types of cacti: cladodes and seedlings. To safeguard against potential damage from giant tortoises and local birds, protective mesh fencing was installed around the plants. Each monitoring session recorded plant survival and growth, evaluating the impact of water-saving technologies on cactus survival, maximum plant height reached, age at the time of plant death, and growth achieved since planting. Additionally, the study assessed the influence of climate on plant survival and growth. Unfortunately, the employment of protective mesh fences and Waterboxx containers resulted in the unintended loss of specific bird species. Consequently, a decision was taken to remove these protective measures, resulting in a substantial rise in herbivorous activity, and the subsequent mortality of nearly all plants. Our findings underscore the efficacy of water-saving technologies in Opuntia restoration. However, successful application necessitates a better understanding of these technologies within the unique conditions of the island. Future endeavors should focus on refining these techniques to minimize avian mortality while fostering biodiversity and restoring ecological equilibrium.

AB  - Environmental contamination is one of the major drivers of ecosystem change in the Anthropocene. Toxic chemicals are not constrained to their source of origin as they cross ecosystem boundaries via biotic (e.g., animal migration) and abiotic (e.g., water flow) vectors. Meta-ecology has led to important insights on how spatial flows or subsidies of matter across ecosystem boundaries can have broad impacts on local and regional ecosystem dynamics but has not yet addressed the dynamics of pollutants in recipient ecosystems. Incorporating meta-ecosystem processes (i.e., flux of materials across ecosystem boundaries) into contaminant dynamics can elucidate how contaminants may reverberate among local food chains. Here, we derive a modeling framework to predict how spatial ecosystem fluxes can influence contaminant dynamics and how this influence is dependent on the type of ecosystem flux (e.g., herbivore movement vs. abiotic chemical flows). We mix an analytical and numerical approach to analyze our integrative model which couples two subcomponents that have previously been studied independently of each other-an ecosystem model and a contaminant model. We observe an array of dynamics for how chemical concentrations change with increasing nutrient input and loss rate across trophic levels. When we tailor our range of chemical parameter values (e.g., environmental uptake of contaminant and assimilation efficiency of the contaminant) to specific organic chemicals, our results demonstrate that increasing nutrient input rates can lead to trophic dilution in pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls across trophic levels. However, increasing nutrient loss rate causes an increase in the concentrations of chemicals across all trophic levels. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that nutrient recycling is an important ecosystem process impacting contaminant concentrations, generating predictions to be addressed by future empirical studies. Importantly, our model demonstrates the utility of our framework for identifying drivers of contaminant dynamics in connected ecosystems including the importance that (1) ecosystem processes and (2) movement, especially movement of lower trophic levels, have on contaminant concentrations.

AB  - Climate change leads to more frequent droughts that may alter multitrophic networks in agroecosystems by changing bottom-up and top-down effects on herbivorous insects. Yet, how bottom-up effects of drought alter tritrophic interactions remains poorly understood. This study investigated two intensities of drought stress in the tritrophic system consisting of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris), an aphid (Aphis fabae), and its parasitoid (Aphidius colemani). We thoroughly investigated each trophic level, examining the performance of plants, pest insects, and parasitoids, as well as the attraction of parasitoids to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Drought stress negatively affected plant growth but benefited A. fabae, leading to faster development and a higher reproduction rate. Drought-stressed plants also emitted less plant volatiles, which resulted in reduced attraction of A. colemani to aphid-infested plants. Drought indirectly affected parasitoid performance, as evidenced by lower emergence rates and production of fewer females, although mummification rates were higher on drought-stressed plants. Reduced parasitoid attraction and performance on drought-stressed plants may exert lower top-down pressure on aphid populations. Combined with increased aphid performance, this may facilitate aphid outbreaks, which could further weaken drought-stressed plants. Our findings highlight the need to study multiple trophic levels and emphasize the importance of incorporating HIPVs and parasitoid attraction when assessing combined abiotic and biotic stresses in crops.

AB  - Naked carp (Gymnocypris przewalskii) is a migratory fish endemic to the Qinghai Lake, the largest inland saline-alkaline lake in China. Based on our previous results of comparative transcriptome sequencing, we found that pathways related to regulation of actin cytoskeleton, plasma membrane damage, and inflammation-related signaling were significantly enriched during saline-alkaline stress, suggesting involvement of annexin (ANN) family proteins in stress adaption in naked carp. Herein, to explore the role of annexin family in naked carp under saline-alkaline stress, twenty GpANNs family members were identified at the genome-wide scale, and bioinformatics and expression analysis under saline-alkaline stress were performed. The predicted subcellular localization showed that most members of GpANNs were distributed in the cytoplasm, and the rest were localized in the cytoskeleton, nucleus, or mitochondria, respectively. GpANNs family proteins contained specific type II Ca2+- binding motifs, actin-binding motifs, GTP-binding motifs, etc. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the annexin homologues from naked carp, carp (Cyprinus carpio), zebrafish (Danio rerio), and chinese cavefish (Sinocy-clocheilus rhinocerous) were divided into eight groups, i.e. ANN1 -6, ANN11 and ANN13. But homologues of ANN7 -10 groups were not found in these three fish species. Twenty-eight, nineteen and twenty-nine orthologous gene pairs were identified between naked carp and carp, zebrafish and chinese cavefish, respectively. Six paralogous gene pairs were identified in naked carp, all of which had a Ka/Ks ratio less than one, suggesting that the GpANNs family may have undergone purifying selection pressure during evolution. Expression of GpANN3 was significantly up-regulated in the kidney tissue under saline-alkaline stress, while GpANN2 was significantly down-regulated. Similar trends of protein expression were also observed by Western blot, suggesting involvement of GpANN3 and GpANN2 in stress response. Confocal microscopy revealed that GpANN2 was localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus, but GpANN3 was preferentially localized in the cytoplasm. Our study demonstrated the role of annexins in stress adaption, and provided the basic information required for further function analyses in naked carp.

AB  - Climate change has led to global biodiversity loss, severely impacting all species, including essential pollinators like bees, which are highly sensitive to environmental changes. Like other bee species, A. dorsata is also not immune to climate change. This study evaluated the habitat suitability of A. dorsata under climate change in Pakistan by utilizing two years of occurrence and distribution data to develop a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model for forecasting current and future habitat distribution. Future habitat projections for 2050 and 2070 were based on two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP245 and SSP585) using the CNRM-CM6-1 and EPI-ESM1-2-HR-1 global circulation models. Eight bioclimatic variables (Bio1, Bio4, Bio5, Bio8, Bio10, Bio12, Bio18, and Bio19) were selected for modeling, and among the selected variables, the mean temperature of the wettest quarter (Bio8) and precipitation of the warmest quarter (Bio18) showed major contributions to the model building and strongest influence on habitat of A. dorsata. The model estimated 23% of our study area as a suitable habitat for A. dorsata under current climatic conditions, comprising 150,975 km2 of moderately suitable and 49,792 km2 of highly suitable regions. For future climatic scenarios, our model projected significant habitat loss for A. dorsata with a shrinkage and shift towards northern, higher-altitude regions, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Himalayan foothills. Habitat projections under the extreme climatic scenario (SSP585) are particularly alarming, indicating a substantial loss of the suitable habitat for the A. dorsata of 40% under CNRM-CM6-1 and 79% for EPI-ESM1-2-HR-1 for the 2070 time period. This study emphasizes the critical need for conservation efforts to protect A. dorsata and highlights the species' role in pollination and supporting the apiculture industry in Pakistan.

AB  - Among gastrointestinal nematodes, Haemonchus contortus (Rudolphi) Cobb (order Strongylidae; family Trichostrongylidae) is one of pathogenic and economic importance in domestic and wild ruminants, including the European bison, Bison bonasus Linnaeus (order Cetartiodactyla; family Bovidae); a species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. Carabus granulatus Linnaeus (order Coleoptera; family Carabidae) is one of the most prevalent species of ground beetle, inhabiting a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems in Poland. Twenty-six ground beetles of this species inhabiting the Bialowieza Primeval Forest in eastern Poland were screened for the presence of DNA of pathogenic gastrointestinal nematodes of ruminants. Extracted DNA was sequenced and compared to reference sequences. In six insects, the presence of H. contortus DNA was detected. The obtained nucleotide sequences were homologous to each other and to the majority of the published DNA sequences of H. contortus isolates. The sequences were also identical to a sequence of H. contortus isolated from European bison in Poland. The study provides the first molecular evidence of the presence of H. contortus DNA in C. granulatus. The finding suggests that ground beetles may play a role in the transmission dynamics of this parasite.

AB  - Populations of the South American sea lion (SASL, Otaria byronia) have been intensely exploited for leather and oil in different parts of its distribution range throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, generating large changes in abundance. In Patagonia, the SASL population was reduced by more than 90% of its original abundance, and it began to recover after sealing ended. The aim of this work was to assess changes in size and shape of the skull related to changes in population abundance during the last 100 years. Using geometric morphometry techniques, we analyzed 145 individuals (68 males and 77 females) from Patagonia. Skulls were classified by sex, time period (harvest vs. postharvest), and decades of individual's birth. Results indicated that there were differences in skull size but not in shape discriminated by time period. Moreover, individuals of the postharvest period showed a decrease in the skull size during the last two decades, coinciding with the recovery in population abundance. Our results suggest the existence of a density-dependence response in somatic growth of SASL population of Patagonia.

AB  - The theory of niche differentiation implies some extent of specialization of species with regard to key resources, notably food. Coprophagous (dung-eating) insect larvae play a critical role in the decomposition of livestock dung in modern and traditional agricultural grasslands. The yellow dung fly (Scathophaga stercoraria L.; Diptera: Scathophagidae) is one of the largest, most common and abundant dung decomposers on pastures in cold-temperate regions across the entire northern hemisphere. As this fly is often associated with domesticated cattle or dairy cows, which are commonly kept for human nutrition worldwide (beef, milk, cheese, etc.), it is sometimes suspected to be a cow dung specialist. However, yellow dung flies are regularly active on and around other dung types, and must have reproduced on dung of wild vertebrates before the domestication of cattle. We therefore experimentally studied the performance of yellow dung fly larvae on dung of various large domestic vs. wild mammals (cow, horse, wild boar, red deer) in the laboratory in Switzerland. Larval performance in terms of juvenile survival, egg-to-adult development time, growth rate, and final adult body size, the major life history indicators of individual reproductive success, did not vary greatly among the various dung types tested. Thus, yellow dung flies can successfully reproduce on multiple types of mammal (vertebrate) dung, wild and domestic, and are therefore dung generalists rather than specialists. We conclude that yellow dung flies are common in European low- and highlands because they could plastically shift to dung of common herbivorous livestock after their domestication without losing the ability to reproduce on dung of common wild mammals.

AB  - Many plant species have seeds embedded in their fleshy pulp to attract frugivores, which enhances the chance of seed dispersal. However, some tropical plants are evolved with sharp spines to avoid herbivores and/or to prevent water loss, which makes foraging by frugivores difficult. Such plants receive frugivores' attention, either because of resource scarcity or adaptive behavioural plasticity. We have a limited understanding of how fruit-eating animals access fruits protected by spines. In this 1-year study, we describe bat foraging on a spiny tropical shrub, Ziziphus mauritiana (Rhamnaceae) whose dried branches are often used by the local people to capture bats in caves that inevitably damage their wing membranes. The greater short-nosed fruit bat, Cynopterus sphinx was the only visitor to this spiny plant during its fruiting season and predominantly extracted fruits using a hovering tactic (on 81% observations) without damaging wing membranes. The hovering enabled them to extract fruits quicker than when alighting on the tree. Bats carried all the fruits away from the parent tree to feeding roosts for consumption. Bat foraging has thus effectuated short-distance seed dispersal (range 11-70 m radii) in which most seeds (30.73%) were found at the distance of 31-40 m in our search up to 150 m. Although bats extracted both ripe and unripe fruits, ripe-fruit extraction was 4.5 x higher than the unripe fruits. This study shows the tradeoff between getting a good meal and contending with spines in a resource-scarce habitat. Besides, this study describes the adaptive foraging tactics of greater short-nosed fruit bats that facilitate short-distance seed dispersal.

AB  - Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have proven to be successful tools for ecological monitoring, providing excellent visual resolution and the ability to cover large areas with spatial accuracy. Artificial Intelligence has further improved the capabilities of UAVs vision through object detection. While deep learning has shown significant success in pattern recognition, it still faces challenges in real-world scenarios. In this study, we focused on enhancing the potential of UAVs for wildlife detection and monitoring, specifically focusing on the globally threatened swamp deer (Rucervus duvaucelii). To improve the accuracy of animal recognition with UAVs, we used single-stage detectors YOLO (You Only Look Once) V3, V5, V7, V8, Object detection V3 and DETR (DEtection TRansformer). We trained our model using 48,957 augmented images derived from a dataset of 8210 original true dataset. The result shows the superior performance of Object Detection 3.0 and YOLO V8, achieving a precision score of more than 92 % and a F1 score of more than 85 %, compared to DETR, YOLO V7, V5, and V3. Overall, our study provides an efficient, cost-effective, and accurate detection framework for ecological monitoring that can be non-invasively and least distractively used in various demographic studies of cervids in different regions and habitat types. We have also developed a UAV-based real-time object detection framework that seamlessly integrates with front-end technologies, enabling live detection results regardless of connectivity. This framework operates on a local server, synchronizing with consumer-grade UAVs at a rate of 32 frames per second (fps) with 320 pixel resolution using a frame sampling technique, notably without requiring a dedicated Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). This deliberate choice of not using GPU underscores the commitment to costeffectiveness and aligns with the research's purpose, prioritizing accessibility and affordability for broader scientific exploration. A least distractive ecological sampling technique was optimized and a maximum of 77 deer were detected and counted in real time within Haiderpur wetland in the Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary. This methodology can be replicated and fine-tuned to study other threatened species of conservation priority. This study exemplifies how combining UAVs with deep learning can facilitate species monitoring and population count estimation and be adopted by forest managers to support conservation decisions.

AB  - The classic paper by Ehrlich and Raven on coevolution will soon be 60 years old. Although they were not the first to develop the idea of coevolution, their thought-provoking paper certainly popularized this idea and inspired several generations of scientists interested in coevolution. Here, we describe some of their main contributions, quantitatively measure the impact of their seminal paper on different fields of research, and discuss how ideas related to their original paper might push the study of coevolution forward. To guide our discussion, we explore their original hypothesis into three research fields that are associated with distinct scales/levels of organization: (1) the genetic mechanisms underlying coevolutionary interactions; (2) the potential association between coevolutionary diversification and the organization of ecological networks; and (3) the micro- and macroevolutionary mechanisms and expected patterns under their hypothesis. By doing so, we discuss potentially overlooked aspects and future directions for the study of coevolutionary dynamics and diversification.

AB  - Understanding trophic niche differentiation is critical for exploring interspecific competition and stable coexistence among morphologically similar sympatric species. Bats are an ideal model for studying trophic niche differentiation among species because of their high taxonomic and ecological diversities, as well as their special life history traits. Although many factors can affect bat trophic niches, few studies have combined multiple factors to investigate the influences on bat trophic niches. In this study, we analyzed the summer diet and potential influencing factors of five sympatric rhinolophid bats in southwestern China: Rhinolophus macrotis, Rhinolophus osgoodi, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus affinis, and Rhinolophus pusillus. All five species mainly fed on Lepidopteran and Dipteran insects, with a large trophic niche breadth for each species and a low degree of dietary overlap. With the exception of R. affinis and R. pusillus, significant differences in diet composition were detected among species, which indicated relatively low interspecific competition. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that both echolocation calls and body size significantly affected interspecific diet differentiation, while wing morphology and bite force had relatively weak effects. This study suggests that the combined effects of multiple factors may drive trophic niche differentiation among five rhinolophid bat species in the study area.

AB  - This study examines the ecological sustainability of the Velika Morava River Basin (Serbia, Central Balkans) under modern conditions of multiple freshwater stressors, including climate change. The impact of stressors on the ecological services of the river basin is considered, including: drinking water, irrigation, recreation, tourism, ecotourism, and fishing. In order to assess the ecological sustainability of the river basin, a modification of the ESHIPPO model was performed. The essence of the modification is a change to the ES component, which, in the basic model, assesses the degree of ecological specialization of a taxon; and in the modified assessment of the ecological stability of the ecosystem (ESE). The structure of ichthyocenosis is used as the basic biological indicator for the assessment of ESE. The assessment of river basin sustainability was obtained as the difference between ESE and the impact of multiple factors, including: habitat change, invasive species, pollution, human population growth (social factors), and the over-exploitation of resources (HIPPO). The statistical analysis (SOM-Self Organizing Map) highlights the most reliable indicators of both biotic (ichthyocenosis structure elements) and the indicators that best detect the influence of HIPPO factors. The structure of the model is based on general and easily measurable indicators, which enables its application in any river basin in the world. The results of the model indicate that 80% of the studied basin is ecologically unsustainable and that its potential environmental services are greatly reduced.

AB  - Aim of study was to evaluate the effects of Nigella sativa seeds (NSS) supplementation on growth performance, digestibility and selected blood metabolites of male Beetal goats. Fifteen male Beetal goats were randomly divided into three groups A, B and C according to Completely Randomized Design. Group A male Beetal goats served as control and fed basal diet only whilst group B and C male Beetal goats were fed separately 5 and 10 g NSS respectively in form of total mixed ration having a crude protein 15.6% and ME 2.63 Mcal / kg, along with the basal diet for a period of sixty days. Data were statistically analyzed through one-way ANOVA followed by least significant difference test. Average daily gain (ADG), feed efficiency (FE) and dry matter intake (DMI) were affected by NSS. Male Beetal goats fed C and B (NSS based diet) had greater ADG and FE than the male Beetal goats fed A (control diet). Male Beetal goats fed C had greater DMI than the male Beetal goats fed A. Total tract DM, CF and CP digestibility were also affected by NSS. Male Beetal goats fed C and B had greater DM and CP digestibility than the male Beetal goats fed A. For CF, male Beetal goats fed C had greater digestibility than the male Beetal goats fed A. Blood plasma cholesterol and triglyceride were both affected by NSS. Male Beetal goats fed B and C had lesser plasma cholesterol and triglyceride than the Male Beetal goats fed A. In conclusion, 10 g NSS can be used in male Beetal goats' diet to improve their growth performance and digestibility.

AB  - Cichlid fishes of the tribe Tropheini are a striking case of adaptive radiation, exemplifying multiple trophic transitions between herbivory and carnivory occurring in sympatry with other established cichlid lineages. Tropheini evolved highly specialized eco-morphologies to exploit similar trophic niches in different ways repeatedly and rapidly. To better understand the evolutionary history and trophic adaptations of this lineage, we generated a dataset of 532 targeted loci from 21 out of the 22 described Tropheini species. We resolved the Tropheini into seven monophyletic genera and discovered one to be polyphyletic. The polyphyletic genus, Petrochromis, represents three convergent origins of the algae grazing trophic specialization. This repeated evolution of grazing may have been facilitated by adaptive introgression as we found evidence for gene flow among algae grazing genera. We also found evidence of gene flow among algae browsing genera, but gene flow was restricted between herbivorous and carnivorous genera. Furthermore, we observed no evidence supporting a hybrid origin of this radiation. Our molecular evolutionary analyses suggest that opsin genes likely evolved in response to selection pressures associated with trophic ecology in the Tropheini. We found surprisingly little evidence of positive selection in coding regions of jaw-shaping genes in this trophically diverse lineage. This suggests low degrees of freedom for further change in these genes, and possibly a larger role for regulatory variation in driving jaw adaptations. Our study emphasizes Tropheini cichlids as an important model for studying the evolution of trophic specialization and its role in speciation.

AB  - The Daba Mountain area is recognized as one of the global biodiversity hotspots. In recent years, human-wildlife conflicts (HWCs) in this region have intensified significantly. Understanding and mitigating the damage caused by wildlife is crucial for maintaining ecological balance and enhancing public welfare. We analyzed the current status of HWCs in the southern foothills of the Daba Mountains through semi-structured interviews and field surveys. Additionally, using the collected data on HWC occurrences, we predicted HWC hotspots using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model. The results: (1) A total of 449 cases of actual HWC incidents were investigated, primarily involving wild boars (Sus scrofa; 81.96%) and Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus; 18.04%). The main types of HWC included crop destruction and attacks on beehives. (2) Incidents of damage caused by wild boars and Asiatic black bears were concentrated in the summer months, particularly from June to August. (3) In the study area, 21 out of 25 townships reported HWC cases. Notably, the townships of Fuxing, Gaoyan and Gaoguan were identified as the most affected, with Gaoyan and Fuxing experiencing the highest amounts of loss. (4) The variable of DTP (Distance to Protected Area) was found to have the greatest influence on the hotspot distributions of HWCs. The hotspot zone exhibited a strip-like distribution along the northwest-southeast axis in the central part of the study area. The total area of the HWC hotspots was 1352.56 km2. The largest hotspot areas were located in Xiuqi Town, Gaoyan Town, and Houping Township, accounting for 13.26%, 12.01%, and 7.83% of the total hotspot area, respectively. HWC hotspots require robust management measures to mitigate wildlife damage to local communities and enhance indigenous people's engagement in wildlife conservation. Implementation of physical measures and compensation schemes may be necessary in these hotspots to alleviate the financial burden on indigenous populations. Our findings may provide valuable insights for the future formulation of biodiversity conservation policies and HWC mitigation strategies in the Daba Mountains.

AB  - Genetic methods provide the ability to assess key aspects of population biology. Recent advances in high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequencing are providing opportunities to study species with limited genetic diversity. In particular, microhaplotype genetic markers have exponentially increased our ability to elucidate kin relationships and social structure through accurate pedigree reconstruction. Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) have extraordinarily low genetic variation-among the most depauperate of any mammal species-making it challenging to discern familial relationships with genetic methods. Here, we describe the discovery of a panel of 122 microhaplotype markers for the species, validated by genotyping population samples with a standard amplicon-sequencing approach. Additionally, we correctly assigned known mother-offspring pairs with high confidence in the inferred relationships, successfully overcoming historical obstacles to the use of genetic tools for relationship inference in pedigree studies of northern elephant seals. This work enables key conservation questions to be addressed for this species and provides an example of how to advance understanding of the ecology, behavior, and reproduction of other mammals with very low genetic diversity.

AB  - In order to enhance breeding programs and boost genetic features related to disease resistance, productivity and adaptability, it is essential to predict harmful mutations in livestock animals. The genetic adaptations enabling Changthangi goats to thrive in high-altitude environments are essential for their survival in conditions marked by hypoxia, extreme temperatures and oxidative stress. Therefore, in this study, missense mutations were mined within key candidate genes, namely CXCL9, MRPL22 and SDS involved in hypoxic stress, in Changthangi goats to assess their potential effects on the structural integrity of the proteins. Two SNPs (rs653275315, rs654804090) were identified with significant impacts on protein structure and stability, while one SNP (rs644425445) was categorized as benign. The SNP rs654804090 introduced changes in hydrophobicity, impairing protein stability, whereas rs653275315 affected conserved domains critical for function. Structural analyses revealed that the identified mutations disrupted protein folding, stability and molecular interactions, particularly in highly conserved residues, underscoring their evolutionary significance. Phylogenetic conservation analysis further highlighted the adaptive relevance of these mutations, particularly in regions subjected to environmental stressors. Our findings reveal potentially detrimental mutations in the genes CXCL9, MRPL22 and SDS, which may contribute to the development of genetic screening tools for selective breeding initiatives especially in high-altitude settings where genetic resistance to environmental stress is essential.

AB  - Simple Summary: People who use hiking trails may be exposed to blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis, also known as deer ticks), some of which are infected with the pathogens that cause Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. In areas that also have lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum), an added concern is acquiring the alpha-gal red meat allergy. Here, we describe an example of how such tick-related risks can be assessed at the scale of a local community, while providing a baseline for further monitoring. We used drag sampling along public trails to quantify tick abundance in June 2020-2022 at 12 study sites in the town of Nantucket, Massachusetts, USA. One of these sites was located on nearby Tuckernuck Island. Blacklegged nymphs were common at sites with moist deciduous woodlands and rare in open grasslands. For several sites, we carried out pathogen testing and found that similar to 10-20% of blacklegged nymphs on Nantucket were infected with the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Lone star ticks were extremely common on Tuckernuck Island and rare on Nantucket Island, where they are expected to become more widespread in the future. Both tick species represent a significant threat to public health and mitigating their impact is an ongoing challenge.
   Tick-borne diseases and a tick-induced red meat allergy have become increasingly common in the northeastern USA and elsewhere. At the scale of local communities, few studies have documented tick densities or infection levels to characterize current conditions and provide a baseline for further monitoring. Using the town of Nantucket, MA, as a case study, we recorded tick densities by drag sampling along hiking trails in nature preserves on two islands. Nymphal blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis Say) were most abundant at shadier sites and least common in grasslands and scrub oak thickets (Quercus ilicifolia). Lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum L.) were common on Tuckernuck Island and rare on Nantucket Island, while both tick species were more numerous in 2021 compared to 2020 and 2022. We tested for pathogens in blacklegged nymphs at five sites over two years. In 2020 and 2021, infection levels among the four Nantucket Island sites averaged 10% vs. 19% for Borrelia burgdorferi, 11% vs. 15% for Babesia microti, and 17% (both years) for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, while corresponding levels were significantly greater on Tuckernuck in 2021. Our site-specific, quantitative approach represents a practical example of how potential exposure to tick-borne diseases can be monitored on a local scale.

AB  - Potential toxic elements, such as Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu), Lead (Pb), and Zinc (Zn) are commonly left behind after mining operation. Being non -biodegradable, these elements serve as source of contamination for the soil and water ecosystems and create hazards to human health. This research work evaluated the phyto extracting ability for potential toxic elements by four endemic tree species, such as Betula pendula (Birch), Carpinus betulus (Hornbean), Fagus sylvatica (Beech), and Salix caprea (Goat willow). These tree species are predominantly growing in an abandoned mining spoil sites in Matra Mountains, Hungary. Plant and soil samples were collected in the field and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) method. The soil was highly contaminated with heavy metals, such as Pb, As, and Zn which were 10 to 60 times more than the typical non-contaminated Hungarian soil. Among the trees evaluated, Carpinus betulus showed the highest potential for Pb dendroremediation, with a mean concentration value of 4071.67 & PLUSMN;45.71 mg kg(-1) dry weight in roots, 439.05 & PLUSMN;1.06 mg kg(-1) dry weight in stems and 92.53 & PLUSMN;0.73 mg kg(-1) dry weight in leaves. Betula pendula and Salix caprea bioaccumulated 475.575 & PLUSMN;2.219 and 395.97 & PLUSMN;1.43 mg kg(-1) dry weight of Zn in their leaf biomass. Both trees had a Bio-concentration Factor (BCF) value of greater than 1.0 but less than 10 which classified them as potential phytoextractors of Zn. Salix caprea gave the highest Translocation Factor (Tf) for Cd while Betula pendula gave the highest Tf for Zn.

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is essential for food digestion, nutrient absorption, waste elimination, and microbial defense. Single-cell transcriptome profiling of the intestinal tract has greatly enriched our understanding of cellular diversity, functional heterogeneity, and their importance in intestinal tract development and disease. Although such profiling has been extensively conducted in humans and mice, the single-cell gene expression landscape of the pig cecum remains unexplored. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on 45 572 cells obtained from seven cecal samples in pigs at four different developmental stages (days (D) 30, 42, 150, and 730). Analysis revealed 12 major cell types and 38 subtypes, as well as their distinctive genes, transcription factors, and regulons, many of which were conserved in humans. An increase in the relative proportions of CD8+ T and Granzyme A (low expression) natural killer T cells (GZMAlow NKT) cells and a decrease in the relative proportions of epithelial stem cells, Tregs, RHEX+ T cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were noted across the developmental stages. Moreover, the post-weaning period exhibited an up-regulation in mitochondrial genes, COX2 and ND2, as well as genes involved in immune activation in multiple cell types. Cell-cell crosstalk analysis indicated that IBP6+ fibroblasts were the main signal senders at D30, whereas IBP6- fibroblasts assumed this role at the other stages. NKT cells established interactions with epithelial cells and IBP6+ fibroblasts in the D730 cecum through mediation of GZMA-F2RL1/F2RL2 pairs. This study provides valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity and function in the pig cecum at different development stages.

AB  - There is insufficient understanding of interspecific interactions with the eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) and wild pigs (Sus scrofa). Wild pigs compete with wild turkeys and predate nests and adults; however, population-level effects on wild turkeys are not clear. Using cameras, we assessed responses of wild turkey populations to wild pig removal in central Alabama, USA, from 2018-2021. We compared wild turkey relative abundance and occupancy on 3 large-scale pig-removal treatment sites (3,407-5,531 ha) relative to a control site (2,510 ha) during 1 pre-treatment year and 2 post-treatment years, with analyses including a covariate expressing the cumulative number of pigs removed from each site standardized by the initial pig abundance on the site. We removed 1,851 wild pigs from the 3 treatment sites over 22 months. Based on N-mixture modeling, when the number of pigs removed was equal to our baseline population estimates (i.e., 100% removal relative to initial population), there were 1.50 (95% CL = 1.01-2.23) times as many wild turkeys, and detection of wild turkeys was 2.01 (95% CL = 1.49-2.70) times as likely. Additionally, poults were 3.49 (95% CL = 1.12-10.89) times as likely to occupy an area when the number of pigs removed was equal to our baseline population estimates compared with poult occupancy at baseline pig abundance. Our data suggests that reduction of wild pig populations may lead to a localized increase in populations of wild turkeys.

AB  - Globally, collisions with vehicles result in millions of animal deaths every year, representing a major issue for wildlife conservation and management. Consequently, and importantly, much research has focused on understanding patterns of animal-vehicle collisions with the aim to reduce roadkill of wildlife. However, existing data on animal-vehicle collisions might also represent a novel opportunity to monitor wildlife populations. For this purpose, we compared data of >1.2 million hunter-shot deer and >40,000 deer-vehicle collisions collected over 11 years in Denmark. We show that deer-vehicle collision data can be useful for population monitoring of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), fallow deer (Dama dama), and red deer (Cervus elaphus). Roe deer was the most numerous species, representing 90% of observations based both on deer-vehicle collisions and on hunting bag statistics. After accounting for factors related to road infrastructure (road length and density, traffic volume), local (municipality) deer-vehicle collisions were highly correlated with hunting bag data for roe and red deer (Pearson's r > 0.7) but not fallow deer, likely due to biases in hunting bags. Moreover, we used deer-vehicle collision data to map spatiotemporal changes in the distribution of fallow and red deer, and demographic changes in all species. Combined, our results suggest that animal-vehicle collision data can be a useful tool to supplement existing methods for monitoring wildlife populations, which will be relevant for the management of these populations. We point to important shortcomings in both animal-vehicle collision and hunting bag data and provide recommendations on how to improve their accuracy in the future, to be applicable for a broader range of species.

AB  - Researchers generally ascribe demographic drivers in a single sub-population and presume they are representative. With this information, practitioners implement blanket conservation measures across metapopulations to reverse declines. However, such approaches may not be appropriate in circumstances where sub-populations are spatiotemporally segregated and exposed to different environmental variation. The Greenland White-fronted Goose, Anser albifrons flavirostris, is an Arctic-nesting migrant that largely comprises two sub-populations (delineated by northerly and southerly breeding areas in west Greenland). The metapopulation has declined since 1999 but this trend is only mirrored in one sub-population and the causes of this disparity are unclear. Here we compare the drivers and trends of productivity in both sub-populations using population- and individual-level analysis. We examined how temperature and precipitation influenced population-level reproductive success over 37 years and whether there was a change in the relationship when metapopulation decline commenced. In addition, we used biologging devices to remotely classify incubation events for 86 bird-years and modelled how phenology and environmental conditions influenced individual-level nest survival. Correlations between reproductive success and temperature/precipitation on the breeding grounds have weakened for both sub-populations. This has resulted in lower reproductive success for the northerly, but not southerly breeding sub-population, which at the individual-level appears to be driven by lower nest survival. Earlier breeding ground arrival and less precipitation during incubation increased nest survival in the northerly breeding population, while no factors examined were important for the southerly breeding sub-population. This suggests reproductive success is driven by different factor(s) in the two sub-populations. Demographic rates and their environmental drivers differ between the sub-populations examined here and consequently we encourage further decomposition of demography within metapopulations. This is important for conservation practitioners to consider as bespoke conservation strategies, targeting different limiting factors, may be required for different sub-populations.

AB  - There is increasing consensus of the need for ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), which accounts for trophic interactions and environmental conditions when managing exploited marine resources. Continued development and testing of analytical tools that are expected to address EBFM needs are essential for guiding the management of fisheries resources in achieving and balancing multiple social, economic, and conservation objectives. To address these needs, we present and compare alternative climate-informed multi-species statistical catch-at-age models to account for spatio-temporal differences in stock distributions, with application to four groundfish species (walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, and Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis) in the Gulf of Alaska, USA. We integrate across multiple forms of uncertainty regarding the data and distribution of Pacific halibut using an ensemble modelling approach. Models developed here can be used to supplement current tactical fisheries management and inform on the trade-offs between harvesting across groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska. This approach may be applicable for other situations where spatial and temporal overlap is extensive among closely coupled species.

AB  - Knowledge of the utilization by mosquito species of different habitats is critical for determining risk for the transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens. The Great Plains region of the United States is experiencing a biome-level change as grasslands are being converted to forests through the process of woody plant encroachment by eastern redcedar (ERC). There is a need to evaluate how mosquitoes respond to fine scale habitat characteristics within areas experiencing ERC encroachment. This study examined the influence of fine-scale vegetation differences on mosquito abundance, bloodmeal hosts, and infection with West Nile virus (WNV) in eight ERC-encroached sites across Oklahoma. Mosquito traps were placed in three unique habitats in ERC-encroached sites. Ae. albopictus, Ae. vexans, An. punctipennis, Cx. erraticus, and Cx. tarsalis were most abundant in the ecotone and/or forested areas of ERC trees compared with grass. Ps. columbiae was more abundant in grassland than in forest. Blood meal analysis indicated that mosquitoes fed primarily on mammals, and we detected Anaplasma species in several blood meals. These results suggest that important mosquito vectors may occur throughout much of ERC-encroached areas, a finding that has consequences for blood meal acquisition, pathogen transmission, and thus public health and land management programs throughout the Great Plains.

AB  - In order to protect the prairie ecological environment, intensive farming has become a prevalent method of sheep stocking. However, the link between captivity stocking mode and ecological risk of sheep feces is still poorly understood. In this study, metagenomics was used to identify the environmental risk of sheep feces among three stocking modes. Our results showed that captivity mode (C) elevated antibiotic resistance in feces, with the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (5.381 copies/cell) higher than that of half-pen stocking (Fh) (1.093 copies/cell) and grazing mode (Fr) (0.315 copies/cell) (Duncan's test, P < 0.05). Virulence factor genes (VFGs) analysis showed offensive virulence factors had the highest abundance in captivity feces (C: 3.826 copies/ cell, Fh: 0.342 copies/cell, Fr: 0.163 copies/cell) (Duncan's test, P < 0.05). 15 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were identified as potential pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria (PARB) and revealed that Escherichia, Klebsiella may be the main host of ARGs and VFGs in sheep feces. Furthermore, the minimal inhibition con-centrations (MIC) of tetracycline of E. coli in the captivity feces was 8.6 times and 4.7 times than that of grazing and half-pen stocking samples, respectively. The Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed that high stocking density leads to feces causing increased harm to the environment. Although feces from sheep raised in captivity and half-pen stocking modes are easier to collect, they are more harmful to the environment and aerobic composting should be done before their application to farmland. This work provides a guideline for better control of the environmental risk of sheep feces from different stocking modes.

AB  - Behavioural needs are highly motivated actions critical to a species survival and reproduction. Prolonged restriction of these behaviours can lead to stereotypic behaviours (SB) in captive animals, and this is particularly common in ungulate species. While risk factors for SB have been suggested for some ungulates, no study has integrated these findings to identify which aspects of ungulates' wild behavioural biology and captive husbandry are potential drivers for SB across this clade. We collated SB data from 15 236 individuals across 38 ungulate species from 95 sources, and determined species wild/free-ranging behaviour from 559 additional studies. Bayesian-phylogenetic statistical methods showed that ungulate behavioural needs relating to foraging and mating are particularly affected by captive environments, with promiscuous and browsing species showing the greatest prevalence of SB. Concentrate-only diets and lack of ad libitum feed substrates were also associated with high SB prevalence. This study identifies which ungulates are better suited to captive environments and which species require targeted husbandry, enrichment and breeding protocols in order to meet their behavioural needs. Our approach of applying Bayesian-phylogenetic inference to factors influencing SB within a clade can be used to identify other intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors of reduced animal health and welfare.

AB  - Innovative problem solving is considered a hallmark measure of behavioral flexibility as it describes behavior by which an animal manipulates its environment in a novel way to reach a goal. Elephants are a highly social taxa that have demonstrated a remarkable capacity for adapting to changing environments. To understand how individual differences in behavior impact expressions of innovation, we used a novel extractive foraging device comprised of three compartments to evaluate innovation in 14 captive Asian elephants. In the first phase of testing, elephants had an opportunity to learn one solution, while the second phase gave them an opportunity to innovate to open two other compartments with different solutions. We measured the behavioral traits of neophilia, persistence, motivation, and exploratory diversity, and hypothesized that higher levels of each would be associated with more success in the second phase. Eight elephants innovated to solve three compartments, three solved two, and two solved only one. Consistent with studies in other species, we found that higher success was associated with greater persistence, but not with any other behavioral traits when analyzed per test session. Greater persistence and, unexpectedly, lower exploratory diversity, were associated with success when analyzed at the level of each individual door. Further work is needed to understand how innovation varies both within and between species, with particular attention to the potential impact of anthropogenic changes in wild environments.

AB  - Retaliatory killing due to livestock depredation is a major threat to snow leopard (Panthera uncia) conservation. To devise management actions that reduce livestock losses and the consequent retaliatory killing, we need to understand the factors that influence the snow leopard's diet and depredation on livestock. Here, we studied snow leopard diet and ecological determinants of livestock depredation in Bhutan by semi-systematically collecting scat samples and analysing prey hair structure using a micro-histological method. We identified five prey species. Most of the snow leopard diet consisted of wild ungulates (85.8%), mostly bharal (60.8%). Yak (14.2%) was the only livestock species in the scats. Livestock depredation was higher during summer and differed markedly among four protected areas characterized by various wildlife densities and human activities. These findings will help develop a site-based management plan to ensure the long-term persistence of the snow leopard in Bhutan.

AB  - Climate change is increasing insect pressure and forcing plants to adapt. Although chemotypic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity in spatially separated tree populations are known for decades, understanding their importance in herbivory resistance across forests remains challenging. We studied four oak forest stands in Germany using nontarget metabolomics, elemental analysis, and chemometrics and mapped the leaf metabolome of herbivore-resistant (T-) and herbivore-susceptible (S-) European oaks (Quercus robur) to Tortrix viridana, an oak pest that causes severe forest defoliation. Among the detected metabolites, we identified reliable metabolic biomarkers to distinguish S- and T-oak trees. Chemotypic differentiation resulted in metabolic shifts of primary and secondary leaf metabolism. Across forests, T-oaks allocate resources towards constitutive chemical defense enriched of polyphenolic compounds, e.g. the flavonoids kaempferol, kaempferol and quercetin glucosides, while S-oaks towards growth-promoting substances such as carbohydrates and amino-acid derivatives. This extensive work across natural forests shows that oaks' resistance and susceptibility to herbivory are linked to growth-defense trade-offs of leaf metabolism. The discovery of biomarkers and the developed predictive model pave the way to understand Quercus robur's susceptibility to herbivore attack and to support forest management, contributing to the preservation of oak forests in Europe.

AB  - Endemic to the south-west Atlantic Ocean, the shortnose guitarfish (Zapteryx brevirostris) is a small species, classified as endangered by the IUCN. Although reproduction in captivity has been successful for some species, a range of factors can limit the success of captive breeding programmes for elasmobranchs. In Brazil, the Ubatuba Aquarium was the first public aquarium to reproduce small-sized elasmobranchs. Since 2018, at least five parturition events have been recorded for Z. brevirostris at the institution. From a total of 13 live neonates that rearing was attempted, the mean +/- standard error of weight, total length (TL) and disc width at birth were 17.47 +/- 1.6 g, 13.25 +/- 0.7 cm and 6.53 +/- 0.2 cm, respectively. The mean weight as well as mean TL were higher for females at all births, with 26.15 g and 15.07 cm for females in comparison with 17.09 g and 13.94 cm for males. Considering the increasing risk of extinction that the species is facing, age and growth studies are fundamental for the success of conservation, improving the knowledge of Z. brevirostris life cycle so that a more efficient and sustainable management can be carried out. This study provides important data, as well as directions for captive breeding of the species.

AB  - Siblings often compete for limited resources, such as food provided by their parents. However, although several functions of nonlethal sibling (nonsiblicidal) aggression have been proposed, there is currently little empirical evidence for these, apart from food monopolization. Here, we investigated the functions of nonlethal sibling aggression in the biparental-caring territorial herbivorous cichlid Varibilichromis moorii. We found that the juveniles of this species are highly aggressive and that larger juveniles are more aggressive toward their smaller siblings. Larger juveniles feed on algae more frequently than smaller siblings, thereby indicating a dominance hierarchy. Sibling aggression decreased when algae in the nest was experimentally removed. Furthermore, the removal of smaller juveniles decreased sibling aggression among the remaining larger juveniles, whereas the removal of larger juveniles increased aggression among smaller juveniles. The algal feeding rate of juveniles only increased when larger individuals were removed from the nest. Moreover, larger juveniles attained higher growth rates and remained in natal nests longer than smaller individuals. Our results indicate that sibling aggression may facilitate the monopolization of resources by larger juveniles and extend the parental care period. Interestingly, a small subset of juveniles was observed to migrate to other nests. These juveniles were larger than those of the host brood, and their growth rate increased within the new nests. We suggest that subordinate juveniles may disperse from natal nests and sneak into new nests to enhance their rank, which may represent a novel example of a "best of a bad job" strategy associated with sibling competition.

AB  - Background Standing genetic variation is important especially in immune response-related genes because of threats to wild populations like the emergence of novel pathogens. Genetic variation at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which is crucial in activating the adaptive immune response, is influenced by both natural selection and historical population demography, and their relative roles can be difficult to disentangle. To provide insight into the influences of natural selection and demography on MHC evolution in large populations, we analyzed geographic patterns of variation at the MHC class II DRB exon 2 locus in mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) using sequence data collected across their entire broad range. Results We identified 31 new MHC-DRB alleles which were phylogenetically similar to other cervid MHC alleles, and one allele that was shared with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We found evidence for selection on the MHC including high dN/dS ratios, positive neutrality tests, deviations from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) and a stronger pattern of isolation-by-distance (IBD) than expected under neutrality. Historical demography also shaped variation at the MHC, as indicated by similar spatial patterns of variation between MHC and microsatellite loci and a lack of association between genetic variation at either locus type and environmental variables. Conclusions Our results show that both natural selection and historical demography are important drivers in the evolution of the MHC in mule deer and work together to shape functional variation and the evolution of the adaptive immune response in large, well-connected populations.

AB  - Variation in climatic conditions is expected to impact the distribution and abundance of herbivore species, which may, in turn, influence African lions (Panthera leo) ranging behaviour. This necessitates proactive management of lion populations, as ecosystems may exhibit site-specific responses to these variations. Using satellite and GPS-GSM data from 10 lions collared in three different national parks in Kenya-Meru, Nairobi, and Lake Nakuru-we calculated monthly home ranges and distance moved and studied how these were influenced by rainfall. Across all parks, lions increased their distance moved with an increase in rainfall, and male lions covered larger distances than females. Model comparisons revealed that lions in Lake Nakuru significantly expanded their home ranges with higher rainfall compared to those in Nairobi; however, lions in Nairobi covered larger distances than those in Lake Nakuru. Lions in Meru had larger home ranges compared to the other two parks, but the effect of rainfall on their home range size and movement was not significantly different from the other two parks. Our results give insight into the site-specific influence of rainfall on lion home range and movement across the parks. We call for prioritisation of conservation efforts and a site-specific, tailored approach to lion conservation and management.

AB  - In this study, we focus on threatened flora in Spain to analyze the role of various drivers of herbivory in the process by which plants become endangered, attempting to identify patterns in the drivers and threats. Thus, using Hurdle negative binomial regression models, we first test whether herbivory, as a reported threat, is spatially related to its drivers. In the second step, through exploratory data analysis, we study patterns of the herbivory threat in relation to biogeography and conservation factors. Finally, we model the spatial relationships of herbivory to produce a map of hotspots. Our main finding points to wild herbivores, rather than domestic animals, as the major contributors to defining the present spatial distribution of herbivory threatened plants in Spain. Furthermore, we identify the elevation variable as another important factor. Thus, at higher altitudes, there is a correlation between the number of rare plants, high wild herbivores presence, and the existence of protected areas. At present, mountain areas experience conflicts of interest in the conservation of wildlife and rare plants. At the same time, in lower- elevation areas, livestock are no longer concentrated in the lowlands, which reduces direct pressure on rare plants. Accordingly, we propose specific management strategies: for lowland areas, we propose promoting the presence of wild herbivores. At higher altitudes, we propose to use of natural predators as a tool for plant conservation. In the case of Island herbivory, the active removal of non-native animals using negotiation with diverse social groups is necessary.

AB  - The contamination of farmland soil with cadmium (Cd) poses a significant threat to the safety and quality of agricultural products. Herbivorous pests may develop adaptations to survive in Cd-contaminated farmland over time, potentially leading to population outbreaks. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in this adaptation process, though the mechanisms involved remain unclear. This study examined the effects of two pepper cultivars of Capsicum annuum (Chiyan, CY, and Tianlanse, TLS) under Cd contamination on larval growth, development, food utilization, and gut microbiota of Spodoptera litura larvae. The inherent toxicity of TLS is higher than that of CY, as evidenced by a significant reduction in larvae survival rate in the control. In CY, Cd had a positive effect on larvae at low concentrations and a negative effect at high concentrations. Briefly, 5 mg/kg Cd of CY increased the efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and relative growth rate (RGR), whereas 10 mg/kg Cd decreased larvae growth and nutritional indices [higher relative consumption rate (RCR), approximate digestibility (AD), and lower efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD)]. In TLS, Cd had a significant, dose-dependent, negative effect on larvae weight, ECD, and relative growth rate (RGR). Cd thus increased the negative effects of the plant toxins on the larvae. Meta-barcode sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that microbial diversity was affected by pepper cultivar but not Cd concentration. In larvae fed on CY, the most frequent bacterial genera were Enterococcus and Pluralibacte, whereas Enterococcus was the predominant genus in TLS larvae. Our findings reveal variations in how Cd impacts S. litura larvae across different pepper cultivars and imply that alterations in gut microbial communities could play a role in the joint detoxification of Cd and plant-derived toxins.

AB  - Salvia miltiorrhiza is a herbaceous plant that possesses significant medicinal value. Land salinization affects the growth of S. miltiorrhiza, resulting in a decline in its quality and yield. Knotted1-like homeobox (KNOX) genes are transcription factors that play important roles in plant growth and abiotic stress. The characteristics and functions of KNOX genes in S. miltiorrhiza remain unclear. Here, we identified ten KNOX genes in S. miltiorrhiza, all of which possess the characteristic four domains: KNOX1, KNOX2, ELK, and HD. These SmKNOXs were divided into two groups together with homologous genes. Cis-acting element analysis indicated all SmKNOXs contained elements associated with phytohormone, light, and stress response. The SmKNOXs show tissue-specific expression among roots, stems, leaves, and flowers. We assessed the response of the SmKNOXs to salt stress using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Notably, SmKNOX4 expression significantly decreased within 24 h of salt exposure, while SmKNOX1, SmKNOX2, SmKNOX3, SmKNOX8, and SmKNOX9 showed significant increases. The expression of SmKNOX1, SmKNOX2, and SmKNOX3 was significantly positively correlated with that of their target genes, GA20ox1 and S11 MYB. These findings suggest that SmKNOXs and their target genes respond to salt stress, providing a foundation for studies of SmKNOXs and the potential genetic improvement of S. miltiorrhiza.

AB  - PurposeThe present study assessed the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the metacestode of Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (s. s.) as well as in the liver of Indian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis).MethodsSOD activity was analyzed by the pyrogallol autoxidation assay and electrophoretic fractionation by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by specific staining of the enzyme. Besides this, metallic co-factor of SOD was determined using different concentrations of inhibitors.ResultsThe protoscoleces and cyst wall have appreciable amount of SOD, and the level of SOD was found to be significantly (p <= 0.001) higher in the fertile compared to non-fertile cyst wall and the infected than non-infected liver. Four SOD activity bands were observed in the protoscoleces, while one band each in the fertile and non-fertile cyst wall, suggesting the occurrence of isozymes in the protoscoleces but not in the cyst wall. Approximately 99% and 16% of enzyme activity were inhibited at 5 mM concentration of KCN and H2O2, respectively. Furthermore, no activity band of SOD was detected in the gels treated with 5 mM KCN whereas, the same concentration of H2O2 and NaN3 does not affect the visibility of SOD activity band.ConclusionThe present study indicated that the protoscoleces and cyst wall contain a significant amount of SOD, which likely contributes to their survival within the hostile microenvironment of the host. Inhibition studies revealed the presence of Cu/Zn SOD in the protoscoleces, cyst wall, and host liver. The elevated SOD levels in infected liver may be a protective adaptation against self-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS).

AB  - Silvopastoral agroforestry and the strategic placement of trees and hedgerows offers potential to improve livestock welfare and production efficiency through the provision of shelter in livestock farming systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between shelter-seeking behaviour of ewes during the lambing period and the microclimate influenced by landscape shelter features. Artificial and natural shelter was provided to Aberfield ewes (n = 15) on an upland sheep farm in Wales, UK, which were then continuously monitored for 14 days using global positioning system tracking devices. Modelling of microclimate influenced by topographical shelter features at the test site was used to generate a 1 m resolution wind field for geospatial statistical analysis of localised wind speed. Ewes demonstrated an increased preference for natural (3.4-fold; p < 0.01) and artificial (3.0-fold; p < 0.05) shelter zones five times the height of the shelter, compared to the exposed area of the trial site. Wind-chill and modelled local-scale wind speeds were found to have the greatest influence on shelter-seeking behaviour, with temperature and field-scale wind speed significantly influencing livestock behaviour. Mean wind-chill temperature during the trial was 3.7 degrees C (min -5.3 degrees C; max 13.1 degrees C), which is within the cold stress temperature threshold (-3 and 8 degrees C) that requires thermoregulatory strategies such as shelter-seeking behaviour. An improved understanding of the relationship between microclimate and shelter-seeking behaviour in sheep, demonstrated through the agent-based model developed in this project, shall better inform the economic incentives (e.g., reduction in lamb mortality and forage requirements) behind silvopastoral practices that benefit farm productivity, livestock welfare and the environment.

AB  - Judgement bias paradigms are increasingly being used as a measure of affective state in dogs. Approach to an ambiguous stimulus is commonly used as a measure of affect, however, this may also be influenced by learning. This study directly measured the impact of learning on a commonly used judgement bias paradigm in the absence of an affective state manipulation. Dogs (N = 15) were tested on a judgement bias task across five sessions. The dogs' latency to approach a bowl placed in one of three ambiguous locations between non-baited (negative) and baited (positive) locations was measured. Results show that session number had a significant effect on the dogs' latencies to reach the ambiguous bowl locations, with post-hoc tests revealing that dogs were significantly slower to approach the locations as the number of sessions increased. Session number also had a significant effect on the number of times the dogs did not approach the bowl within 30 s of being released, with the number of no approaches generally increasing across sessions. When dog identity was included as a fixed effect, a significant effect on latency to approach was found, suggesting that some dogs were consistently faster than others across sessions. To assess whether the paradigm produced repeatable results, Intraclass Correlation Coefficients were used. A low degree of reliability was found between latencies to approach each bowl position across sessions. This study demonstrates that dogs learned that the ambiguous locations were not rewarded with repeated exposures, and that this impacted their responses. We conclude that this judgement bias paradigm may require further consideration if applied across multiple exposures and that repeated results should be interpreted with caution as they are likely impacted by learning.

AB  - In light of the challenges posed by global climate change, the environmental adaptability of organisms is becoming increasingly important. The Wuzhishan (WZS) pig, tolerant to high heat and humidity, is an ideal model for genomic study. By characterizing its genome and assessing its genetic diversity and runs of homozygosity (ROH), we can gain insights into its current conservation status and genomic architecture. To this end, we analyzed whole-genome resequencing data from WZS pigs, identifying a comprehensive set of genetic variations: 12,844,858 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 4,723,303 insertions and deletions (InDels), 39,311 copy number variations (CNVs), and 70,392 structural variations (SVs). ROH analysis revealed mostly short segments, indicating limited recent admixture and relatively low inbreeding, reflecting high genetic diversity. Linkage disequilibrium decay and effective population size analyses supported these findings, consistent with previous studies. Population genetic analyses of pig populations from Asia, Europe, and the Americas were conducted using SNPs, InDels, and SVs. The results obtained from different variant types were largely concordant, suggesting that the constructed genomic variation database is robust. Notably, the WZS pig displayed relatively unique genetic characteristics compared to other breeds. By intersecting the top 5 % of genes under selection signatures, we identified key pathways and candidate genes associated with important traits in WZS pigs, including reproduction (ABCC9, APC2, CABS1, CSNK1G1), immunity (ARPIN, CMAS, ITPR1, SLC25A13), meat quality (GANC, OBSCN, SLC5A4), environmental adaptability (MAGI1, PHF3), and heat tolerance (GABPB1, LRRC25). Further integrative analyses based on transcriptomic, single-cell transcriptomic, and epigenomic data were conducted to explore the regulatory mechanisms of key genes such as LRRC25 and ITPR1. We identified relevant expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), associated tissues, and distal regulatory elements that potentially influence gene expression. These findings suggest that epigenetic modifications may contribute to the enhanced heat tolerance and immune function observed in WZS pigs. In conclusion, WZS pigs represent a valuable genetic resource. Further research on this breed will deepen our understanding of mechanisms underlying environmental adaptability, and provide important insights into evolutionary biology and breeding strategies for improved resilience in livestock.

AB  - To date, there have been few studies of the functional traits of the dioecious Hippophae tibetana Schlecht leaves, either male or female, in response to ecological factors such as altitude. Elucidating these relationships will establish an important scientific basis for vegetation restoration and reconstruction of the Tibetan Plateau ecosystem. The natural populations of H. tibetana, distributed across three field sites, at 2868 m, 3012 m and 3244 m, in Tianzhu, Gansu, were studied by field survey sampling and laboratory analysis. In particular, the adaptions of leaf functional traits to elevation in these dioecious plants were analyzed. The results show that: (1) there is no "midday depression" of photosynthetic activity in either male or female plants. Over a one-day period, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and transpiration rate (Tr) of H. tibetana female plants were higher than those of male plants (p < 0.05). This correlated to the period of vigorous fruit growth in the female plant. The measured Pn and Tr were maximal at the intermediate altitude (3012 m). The light compensation point (LCP) of the leaves of male and female plants were 57.6 and 43.2 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), respectively, and the light saturation points (LSP) of the leaves were 1857.6 and 1596.8 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). (2) Altitude had a significant effect on plant and leaf functional traits of male and female H. tibetana (p < 0.05), and no significant difference was noted between plants at the same altitude. The values for leaf area (LA), specific leaf weight (LMA), leaf phosphorus content per unit mass (Pmass) and leaf phosphorus content per unit area (Parea) were also maximal at the intermediate altitude. Leaf nitrogen content per unit area (Narea) and leaf nitrogen content per unit mass (Nmass) increased with altitude. This indicated that the functional traits of male and female plants and leaves of H. tibetana showed a strong "trade-off relationship" with altitude. (3) Pearson correlation analysis showed that there were significant correlations among functional traits of H. tibetana leaves. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that soil water content (SWC), altitude (Alt) and soil organic carbon (SOC) had significant effects on the functional traits of H. tibetana leaves (p < 0.05).

AB  - The Australian freshwater turtle fauna is dominated by species in the family Chelidae. The extant fauna comprises a series of distinct lineages, each of considerable antiquity, relicts of a more extensive and perhaps diverse fauna that existed when wetter climes prevailed. Several phylogenetically distinctive species are restricted to single, often small, drainage basins, which presents challenges for their conservation. Specific threats include water resource development, which alters the magnitude, frequency, and timing of flows and converts lentic to lotic habitat via dams and weirs, fragmentation of habitat, sedimentation, nutrification, and a reduction in the frequency and extent of floodplain flooding. Drainage of wetlands and altered land use are of particular concern for some species that are now very restricted in range and critically endangered. The introduced European red fox is a devastatingly efficient predator of turtle nests and can have a major impact on recruitment. In the north, species such as the northern snake-necked turtle are heavily depredated by feral pigs. Other invasive animals and aquatic weeds dramatically alter freshwater habitats, with consequential impacts on freshwater turtles. Novel pathogens such as viruses have brought at least one species to the brink of extinction. Species that routinely migrate across land are impacted by structural simplification of habitat, reduction in availability of terrestrial refugia, fencing (including conservation fencing), and in some areas, by high levels of road mortality. We report on the listing process and challenges for listing freshwater turtles under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, summarize the state of knowledge relevant to listing decisions, identify the key threatening processes impacting turtles, and identify key knowledge gaps that impede the setting of priorities. We also focus on how to best incorporate First Nations Knowledge into decisions on listing and discuss opportunities to engage Indigenous communities in on-ground work to achieve conservation outcomes.

AB  - Context. Exmouth Gulf is adjacent to the Ningaloo Marine Park, a UNESCO-listed area in Western Australia. The gulf remains largely unprotected, and is under increasing anthropogenic pressure from proposed industrial activities that pose threats to marine megafauna inhabiting the gulf. Threatened and near threatened species, such as the Australian humpback dolphin (Sousa sahulensis) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), reside in the gulf; however, detailed information on their ecology and behaviour is lacking. Aims. The aim was to (1) provide baseline data on the distribution, encounter rate, group size and behaviour of coastal dolphins over an area where current industrial developments are proposed, and (2) report on the occurrence of other marine megafauna within this area. Methods. Boat-based photo-identification surveys were conducted on the western coastline of Exmouth Gulf along predetermined line transects (150 km(2)) over austral autumn/winter 2021. Key results. Across 809.35 km of surveyed waters (181 h), a total of 93 bottlenose dolphin, 15 humpback dolphin, and six interspecific dolphin groups were sighted. Bottlenose dolphin groups were encountered at a rate of 0.077/km, humpback dolphin groups at 0.015/km and interspecific dolphin groups at 0.005/km. Dolphins were predominantly recorded in shallow (mean 10 m) and warm (mean 21 degrees C) waters, and were commonly travelling and foraging. In total, 199 individual bottlenose dolphins and 48 humpback dolphins were photo-identified (excluding calves). There were 30 bottlenose dolphin calves (including three newborns) and four humpback dolphin calves (including two newborns) identified. Other marine megafauna group sightings included humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae; n=32), southern right whales (Eubalaena australis, n=1), dugongs (Dugong dugon, n=25), turtles (n=54), sea snakes (n=27), manta rays (Mobula alfredi, n=13) and sharks (n=2). Conclusions. The presence of threatened marine species feeding, socialising, and resting highlights the importance of these waters for the identified species.

AB  - The impact of drought on the nutrient content of important natural forage plants in semi-arid rangelands is poorly understood. Most studies to date have shown that drought induced stress resulted in lower plant nutrient concentrations. The consequential declines in forage quality may be an important limiting factor in sustaining wild herbivore populations through periods of drought. In the semi-arid southern Kalahari of South Africa, the most severe drought recorded in the last 60 years resulted in high plant and animal mortalities. The aim of this study was to determine if the severe drought impacted the nutritional value of plants in this region and resulted in nutrient deficient forage. For this, the nutrient content of the most abundant woody and grass species was determined during the drought and the first year of above-average rainfall following the drought. The impact of drought differed markedly between dicotyledonous woody species and monocotyledon grasses. In the former, it resulted in decreased crude protein concentrations but increased macronutrient concentrations. In the latter, crude protein contents were higher and the content of most macronutrients lower. Despite these differences, the forage on offer to herbivores during the drought was not nutrient deficient. During the drought, the dry seasons when plant nutrients were naturally at their lowest, persisted for longer than normal. The prolonged dry seasons also resulted in shortened wet seasons, when plants were most nutritious. It was concluded that the prolonging of the period when forage quantity and quality is most limiting, is likely the main limitation in sustaining herbivores during periods of drought. More studies in semi-arid rangelands are however needed to better understand the impact of drought on plant nutrients in these systems.

AB  - This study explores patterning in delta O-18 values of tooth enamel in contemporary African herbivores from mainly C-3-dominated ecosystems. Evapotranspiration causes plants to lose (H2O)-O-16 to a greater extent than (H2O)-O-18, leaving leaves enriched in 18O. In eastern Africa, ES species (evaporation-sensitive species: those obtaining water from food) tend to have more positive delta(18)(Oenamel) values than EI species (evaporation-insensitive species: those heavily dependent on drinking water); the magnitude of the difference increases with increasing aridity. We find the same pattern applies in the winter and year-round rainfall region of southern Africa, allowing us to use delta(18)(Oenamel) in fossil animals to examine paleo-aridity. We apply this approach to infer aridity at Quaternary fossil assemblages from present-day winter and year-round rainfall zones, including Elandsfontein (ca. 1-0.6 Ma), Hoedjiespunt (ca. 300-130 ka), and Nelson Bay Cave (23.5-3 ka). This analysis suggests that (1) at various times during the Pleistocene, Elandsfontein and Hoedjiespunt environments were wetter than last glacial maximum (LGM) to Holocene environments at Nelson Bay Cave (year-round rainfall zone); and (2) considered alongside other evidence from the year-round rainfall zone, wetter conditions across the Pleistocene-Holocene transition at Nelson Bay Cave suggests that climate changes at near-coastal sites may be out of phase with the adjacent interior.

AB  - Parasitic nematodes of ovine abomasum are of economic and hygienic importance throughout the world and Iran. This study was aimed to evaluate molecular identity and species diversity of parasitic nematodes in the abomasum of slaughtered sheep in Ilam, Iran. In this study, a total number of 240 of abomasa were randomly collected from the slaughtered sheep at industrial slaughterhouses in Ilam in all seasons between 2017 and 2018. The abomasum content and abomasal mucosa were removed and washed. The collected nematodes were morphologically identified. The genomic DNA was extracted and a 300 bp-fragment-length from internal transcribed spacer 2 ribosomal ribonucleic acid (ITS2-rRNA) gene was amplified. Overall prevalence was 66.70% (160/240). Five species of four genera of nematodes including Marshallagia marshalli (43.70%), Ostertagia circumcincta (15.50%), Parabronema skrjabini (5.00%), M. occidentalis (2.50%), and Haemonchus contortus (0.04%) were identified. Ostertagia circumcincta and H. contortus were found to be different in two nucleotides. There was no nucleotide difference between M. marshalli and M. occidentalis. This study revealed a significant prevalence of parasitic nematodes in sheep abomasum and species diversity of Trichostrongylid nematodes in the region. (C) 2021 Urmia University.

AB  - Bats provide essential ecosystem services and some are cave dependent. Caves favour the association of bats with ectoparasite Diptera, however, they are poorly sampled in the Amazon biome. Here we present the first description of a community of bats and bat flies from the largest sandstone cave in Brazil, the Planaltina cave, located in the municipality of Brasil Novo, state of Para. Diptera were removed from captured bats and taken to the laboratory for identification. From nine species of bats belonging to four families we recorded 17 species of Diptera, 13 were monoxenous. A possible explanation for the monoxenous parasites collected is that flies have poor survival in unusual hosts. These results are an indicator that the Streblid species are host-specific since even if the hosts take refuge in the same cave, they will not share their parasites. Therefore, the present study provides important information on the parasite-host dynamics in a cave, thus highlighting the importance of cave as are essential shelters for bat species and, despite reported cases of cohabitation, mixed colonies are unlikely to form.

AB  - The present study was envisaged to generate prime information on the life history, biological characteristics, and stock status of the critically endangered smoothback guitarfish (Rhinobatos lionotus) that forms a fishery along the northwestern Bay of Bengal using length-based methods. The stock was predominantly represented by the females (Male: Female = 1:1.71). The species exhibited sexual dimorphism, where females grew bigger (Lmax = 79.0 cm) and matured at a larger size (LM50 = 43.71 cm) than males (Lmax = 61.0 cm, LM50 = 34.93 cm). Growth was allometric, where females were heavier compared to males. The life history characteristics, i.e., L infinity, K, t0, M, and LC50 were 84.31 cm, 0.43 y-1, - 0.45 yr, 0.88 y-1, and 35.31 cm, respectively. The LBB analysis showed that the current biomass (B/B0 = 0.39) exceeded the level needed for maximum sustainable yield (BMSY/B0 = 0.35). The Lmean and LC50 were lower than the Lopt and LCopt, indicating growth overfishing. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the outputs of the Thompson and Bell model are highly influenced by uncertainties associated with L infinity, followed by LC50, M, and K. The Thompson and Bell model revealed that the Fcurrent has depleted the SSB to a 35% level and therefore should be reduced by 18-19% to circumvent growth-overfishing (F0.1) and recruitment-overfishing (F0.4), respectively. Considering the multi-species nature of the fisheries in the region, focusing on spatial and temporal closures and strict implementation of by-catch reduction devices in the trawls are advised for the conservation and sustainable management of the species.

AB  - Some emerging and reemerging diseases have been associated with certain species of bats. These diseases have emerged in anthropogenic environments where the conditions for spillover of infectious agents between bats, domestic animals, and humans are present. Mexico is the country with the fourth highest bat diversity in the world, and some of these bat species live in anthropogenic environments such as a backyard production system. The objective of this study was to analyze the virome of three species of bats (Artibeus spp., Macrotus waterhousii and Pteronotus parnellii) that inhabit roosts near rural backyard farms and have large geographic distributions. Rectal swabs were taken and analyzed by the next-generation sequencing (NGS). Thus, it was possible to study the virome of these bat species which has not been previously reported. In one of them, P. parnellii, sequences of the family Coronaviridae were found. The detected viral communities of these three bat species included mostly bacteriophages while showing low numbers for known animal viruses. Viral diversities varied among the species studied and differed from previous studies. The findings of this research contribute to our knowledge of the virome of bat species which have large geographical distributions and, as in this case, inhabit anthropogenic habitats differing from intensive farms or urban settelments.

AB  - Microalgae remains a primary food source for hatchery and nursery culture of juvenile bivalves. However, there is a mismatch between the characteristics of the microalgae currently used in nursery culture and the feeding abilities and nutritional requirements of juveniles of some bivalve species, such as the green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus. Therefore, there is a need to identify new species of microalgae for this purpose that have favourable cell size, good growth performance under culture conditions and appropriate nutritional content for juvenile bivalves by using these characteristics as primary selection criteria. In this study, the growth performance under standard culture conditions of four microalgae species (Chrysochromulina camella, Gymnodinium simplex, Pyramimonas parkeae and Stephanodiscus niagarae) which are of a sufficiently large cell size to meet the needs of juvenile mussels (i.e. 10-20 mu m size range) were tested in comparison to three commonly cultured commercial species (Chaetoceros muelleri, Diacronema lutheri and Tisochrysis lutea). Results show that G. simplex, S. niagarae and the two strains of P. parkeae (P. parkeae (C) and P. parkeae (I)) can achieve similar biomass as the reference species in the intermediate (1 L) culture stages despite the large difference in cell densities. The poor growth of C. camella in F/2 media indicates a necessity of determining its appropriate culture conditions before further assessing its suitability as a nursery feed for juvenile bivalves. The proximate analysis of S. niagarae, G. simplex and P. parkeae (I) reveals nutritional profiles conducive to spat development. However, the P. parkeae (C) strain contained low carbohydrate content, suggesting inferior nutritional value compared to the P. parkeae (I) strain, showing that variants of the same species can have different biochemical composition and suggesting the former might have limited suitability for feeding in nursery culture. The findings indicate that G. simplex, S. niagarae and P. parkeae (C) hold sufficient promise as spat feed in nursery culture to warrant further testing to confirm their efficacy as live microalgal feed for bivalve spat.

AB  - The preference of females for male body size was examined in an experimental environment where direct interference between males was eliminated. In this environment, females preferred to spawn with larger males. To understand the preference of females for larger males, paternal care and egg defence abilities and paternal cannibalism intensity were further tested with respect to the body size of males. The dead egg rate for an egg mass during the paternal care period was not related to the body size of the paternal males. However, larger males could defend their egg masses more successfully against nest intruders than smaller ones. During the paternal egg care period, paternal males often consumed eggs in their nests. In particular, smaller males compared to females caused paternal brood cannibalism. High egg defence ability and low paternal cannibalism intensity are the most plausible reasons for females to choose larger males.

AB  - The reintroduction of endangered plant species is an essential conservation tool. Reintroductions can fail to create resilient, self-sustaining populations due to a poor understanding of environmental factors that limit or promote plant success. Biotic factors, specifically plant-arthropod interactions, have been shown to affect the establishment of endangered plant populations. Lupinus nipomensis (Nipomo Mesa lupine) is a state of California (California Rare Plant Rank: 1B.1) and federally (65 FR 14888) endangered endemic plant with only one extant population located along the central California coast. How arthropods positively or negatively interact with L. nipomensis is not well known and more information could aid conservation efforts. We conducted arthropod surveys of the entire L. nipomensis extant population in spring 2017. Observed arthropods present on L. nipomensis included 17 families, with a majority of individuals belonging to Thripidae. We did not detect any obvious pollinators of L. nipomensis, providing support for previous studies suggesting this lupine is capable of self-pollinating, and observed several arthropod genera that could potentially impact the reproductive success of L. nipomensis via incidental pollination or plant predation.

AB  - This paper presents a new ensemble ecosystem model (EEM) which predicts the impacts of species reintroductions and optimises potential future management interventions at the Knepp Estate rewilding project, UK. Compared to other EEMs, Knepp has a relatively high level of data availability that can be used to constrain the model, including time-series abundance data and expert knowledge. This could improve the realism of outputs and enable more nuanced and context-specific management intervention recommendations. Calibrating EEMs can be challenging, however, and as the number of constraints increases, so does the complexity of the model fitting process. We use a new Genetic Algorithm-Approximate Bayesian Computation (GA-ABC) approach wherein GA outputs are used to inform the prior distributions for ABC. To reduce the parameter search space, we fixed twelve parameters - the consumer self-interaction strengths alpha i,i and negative growth rates - based on theoretical assumptions. While the GA-ABC method proved effective at efficiently searching the parameter space and optimising multiple constraints, it was computationally intensive and struggled to identify a broad range of outputs. Ultimately, this led to an ensemble of models with similar trajectories. Several potential ways to address this are discussed. Our results reinforce the findings of previous studies that the EEM methodology has potential for guiding conservation management and decision-making. Outputs suggest that reintroducing large herbivores was key to maintaining a diverse grassland-scrubland-woodland ecosystem, and optimisation experiments informed species characteristics and stocking densities needed to achieve specific goals. Ultimately, refining the EEM methodology to improve calibration and facilitate the integration of additional data will enhance its utility for ecosystem management, helping to achieve more effective and informed outcomes.

AB  - Simple Summary The genetic diversity in three populations of creole sheep managed by indigenous communities of the central region of Veracruz, Mexico, is reported from blood samples of 90 sheep, taken from the herds of indigenous families in the municipalities of Tehuipango, Astacinga, and Tlaquilpa, Veracruz, Mexico. The genomic DNA of the sheep was evaluated using four microsatellites amplified by PCR and visualized on polyacrylamide gels. The four microsatellites were polymorphic, observed heterozygosity was lower than the expected level, and the indices of endogamy indicated a slight diminution of homozygotes and the variation was hosted at the individual level. The evaluated sheep present a genetic diversity that is conserved across endogamic crosses, for which reason the design of a plan of protection and use of these sheep populations would permit their sustainable management. In the indigenous communities of central Veracruz, herds of creole sheep have been established and managed through traditional practices of crossing, but their genetic characteristics have never been examined in order to evaluate their state of endogamy, and to help the management programs to protect this genetic resource. The objective of the present study was to characterize the genetic diversity of three populations of creole sheep managed by indigenous communities in the central region of Veracruz, Mexico. Indigenous family producers of creole sheep were located and blood samples taken from 90 individual sheep from the municipalities of Tehuipango, Astacinga and Tlaquilpa, Veracruz. In the laboratory, the genomic DNA was extracted and genetic diversity characterized using four microsatellites (ILSTS11, ILSTS5, SRCRSP9 and OarFCB128) amplified by PCR and visualized on polyacrylamide gels. The four microsatellites were highly informative (PIC = 85%) and presented values of 0.6 to 0.81 of heterozygosity, with an average number of 16 alleles. According to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model, three of the loci were not significant (p < 0.05), presumably this means that they do not deviate significantly from H-W predictions and there was slight genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.025), along with a slight decrease in homozygotes (F-IS = -0.021). According to the analysis of variance, 99% of the total variation was hosted at the individual level. It is concluded that the three creole sheep populations still present genetic diversity at the four loci and non-random pairings have occurred.

AB  - Overwintering conditions affect the physiological state of ectotherms, and therefore, their cold hardiness and survival. A measure of the lethal and sublethal impacts of overwintering conditions on pest populations is crucial to predict population dynamics and to manage pests the following spring. The impact of winter conditions can be most intense for invasive insects undergoing range expansion. Insect herbivores can display plastic host use behaviours that depend on their body condition following winter. The pea leaf weevil, Sitona lineatus L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is an invasive pest of field peas, Pisum sativum L., and faba bean, Vicia faba L. (Fabaceae). Pea leaf weevil has expanded its range in North America to include the Prairie Provinces of Canada. This study investigated the effects of temperature and microhabitat on overwintering survival and cold hardiness of pea leaf weevil in its expanded range. Further, we investigated the sublethal effect of overwintering temperature and duration on post-overwintering survival, feeding, and oviposition of pea leaf weevil. We also investigated the role of juvenile hormone in modulating body condition of overwintering weevils. The overwintering survival of pea leaf weevil adults increased with soil temperature and varied with region and microhabitat. More weevils survived winters when positioned near tree shelterbelts compared to open alfalfa fields. The supercooling point of pea leaf weevil varied throughout its expanding range but did not differ for weevils held in the two microhabitats. The average threshold lethal temperature of pea leaf weevil at all three sites was -9.4 degrees C. Weevils that overwintered for a longer duration and at a higher temperature subsequently fed more on faba bean foliage and laid more eggs compared to those which overwintered for a shorter duration at a lower temperature. Our findings highlight that warm winters would increase overwintering survival and post-overwintering fitness, facilitating further pea leaf weevil invasion northward in the Prairie Provinces of Canada.
   We investigated the sublethal effect of overwintering temperature and duration on post-overwintering interactions between pea leaf weevil, Sitona lineatus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), with its host plants. Weevils that overwintered for a longer duration and at a higher temperature subsequently fed more and laid more eggs compared to those which overwintered for a shorter duration at a lower temperature. Warm winters increase overwintering survival and post-overwintering fitness, facilitating further pea leaf weevil invasion in the Prairie Provinces of Canada.image

AB  - Simple Summary Understanding changes that occur after death, or post-mortem changes, based on decomposition, is very important to relate them to a post-mortem interval (PMI), the time elapsed between the moment of death and discovery of a body. Most studies on decomposition focus on large cadavers, leaving a knowledge gap for small cadavers, which are representative for infants and subadults. To fill this knowledge gap, a season-based subaerial outdoor decomposition study was conducted with small pig cadavers at the Forensic Anthropological Outdoor Research Facility located in Den Ham, The Netherlands, over a period of 4 years. This study revealed important findings related to a deviating decomposition rate during winter and the subsequent spring, reproducibility, the effect of body weight, post-mortem movement, the effect of heavy rainfall on insect activity, delayed bloating, the interaction of different insect species, and invertebrate activity.Abstract Studying post-mortem changes based on signs of decomposition (e.g., using scoring models) is one of the methods used in scientific studies to relate observable changes to the post-mortem interval (PMI). The majority of the studies on cadaver decomposition are based on large cadavers. There is limited literature on the decomposition pattern and rate of small cadavers, even though it is at least as important to be able to estimate the PMI for infants and subadults. Therefore, it is crucial to acquire knowledge of the decomposition process of child-sized remains. To fill this knowledge gap, a season-based subaerial outdoor decomposition study was conducted with small pig cadavers at the Forensic Anthropological Outdoor Research Facility located in Den Ham, The Netherlands, over a period of 4 years. Den Ham is located in the eastern part of the Netherlands, close to the German border, and has a temperate maritime climate, with a Cfb classification according to the Koppen-Geiger system. Salient findings were acquired during the decomposition study, specifically regarding a deviating decomposition rate during winter and the subsequent spring, reproducibility, the effect of body weight, post-mortem movement, the effect of heavy rainfall on insect activity, delayed bloating, the interaction of different insect species, and invertebrate activity. This article includes a systemic review of the results obtained during this four-year decomposition study and discusses the impact of the findings on the estimation of the PMI.

AB  - Hippopotamoids are herbivorous mammals that originated in the late middle Eocene. This taxon includes animals with a great variety of sizes and body proportions, from small and gracile forms with slender limbs to heavy massive ones. Many hippopotamoids have previously been considered semi-aquatic but recent studies have highlighted a diversity of ecologies. This study focuses on bone microanatomy, one of the various proxies that enable inferring the ecology of extinct taxa. The comparative analysis of the inner structure of the stylopod bones in various hippopotamoids, based on both transverse and longitudinal virtual sections, highlights a diversity of patterns and clarifies previously proposed hypotheses about the ecology of the sampled hippopotamoids. The filling of the medullary area by spongious deposits in the pygmy hippopotamus, Choeropsis liberiensis, appears associated with frequent incursions into the water by an animal that essentially forages in forests. The common hippopotamus, Hippopotamus amphibius, which spends most of the day submerged in water, shows a greater filling of the medullary area by spongious bone and a thicker cortex. These observations coupled with comparisons with diverse terrestrial and semi-aquatic mammals of various sizes confirm that semi-aquatic lifestyle and heavy weight-bearing are associated with similar microanatomical specializations causing an increase in bone mass. However, for a given mass, comparisons enable determining if an additional increase in bone compactness occurs, as in Hippopotamus amphibius, in which case a semi-aquatic lifestyle could be inferred. Accordingly, this study suggests an essentially terrestrial lifestyle for Microbunodon minimum, Bothriodon velaunus, Elomeryx borbonicus, Merycopotamus medioximus, Paenanthracotherium bergeri, and probably also Saotherium cf. S. mingoz, a slight degree of water dependence in Brachyodus onoideus, and a stronger one in Libycosaurus bahri and Hexaprotodon garyam, though less intense than in Hippopotamus amphibius. Comparisons with other large terrestrial and semi-aquatic taxa, and based on a large part of the diaphysis, are required to better decipher the microanatomical changes associated with a semi-aquatic lifestyle from those linked to loading in heavy quadrupedal mammals.

AB  - Predation is a fundamental selective pressure on animal morphology, as morphology is directly linked with physical performance and evasion. Bipedal heteromyid rodents, which are characterized by unique morphological traits such as enlarged hindlimbs, appear to be more successful than sympatric quadrupedal rodents at escaping predators such as snakes and owls, but no studies have directly compared the escape performance of bipedal and quadrupedal rodents. We used simulated predator attacks to compare the evasive jumping ability of bipedal kangaroo rats (Dipodomys) to that of three quadrupedal rodent groups-pocket mice (Chaetodipus), woodrats (Neotoma), and ground squirrels (Otospermophilus). Jumping performance of pocket mice was remarkably similar to that of kangaroo rats, which may be driven by their shared anatomical features (such as enlarged hindlimb muscles) and facilitated by their relatively small body size. Woodrats and ground squirrels, in contrast, almost never jumped as a startle response, and they took longer to perform evasive escape maneuvers than the heteromyid species (kangaroo rats and pocket mice). Among the heteromyids, take-off velocity was the only jump performance metric that differed significantly between species. These results support the idea that bipedal body plans facilitate vertical leaping in larger-bodied rodents as a means of predator escape and that vertical leaping likely translates to better evasion success.
   The findings of this study suggest that enlarged hindlimbs improve escape performance by allowing rodents to more efficiently utilize vertical jumping as an antipredator escape response.image

AB  - Background: Although drought and defoliation increase the risk of death of the seedlings in tropical dry forests, few studies have evaluated the impact of this combined factors on the response of species. Questions: What is the seedling water management strategy and how does it affect their growth? How does the combination of drought and defoliation impact the growth of the species? Studied species: Guazuma ulmifolia Lam and Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.) Benth. Study sites and dates: The study was carried out in Autlan, Jalisco, Mexico, between October 2021 and February 2022. Methods: In a greenhouse, the seedlings were submitted to four combined water availability and defoliation treatments. The stomatal conductance and leaf water potential were recorded, and the relative growth rate, final biomass, and biomass allocation were calculated. Results: G. ulmifolia showed to be an anisohydric species, registered higher growth, and was the most affected by drought, while P. dulce was more isohydric, registered lower growth and defoliation was the main stressor. The synergy between Drought x Defoliation negatively impacted the two species' relative growth rate. Conclusions: Regardless of the water management strategy, in the early phases of development, the impact of drought and defoliation was magnified when stressors interacted. Therefore, Drought x Defoliation can limit the regeneration of species within forests, promoting the loss of biodiversity and detriment to the functioning of ecosystems.

AB  - Synopsis Batoid fishes (rays, skates, sawfishes, and guitarfishes) are macrosmatic, meaning they rely on their sense of smell as one of the primary senses for survival and reproduction. Olfaction is important for long-distance tracking and navigation, predator and prey recognition, and conspecific signaling. However, the mechanisms by which batoids harness odorants is unknown. Without a direct pump-like system, it is hypothesized that batoids irrigate their nostrils via one or a combination of the following: the motion pump, buccopharyngeal pump, pressure (ex. pitot-like mechanism), or a shearing force (ex. viscous entrainment). These mechanisms rely on the size, shape, and position of the nostrils with respect to the head and to each other. Batoids are united as a group by their dorsoventrally compressed body plans, with nostrils on the ventral side of their body. This position presents several challenges for odor capture and likely limits the effectivity of the motion pump. Batoid fishes display an expansive nasal morphology, with inlet nostrils ranging from thin, vertical slits to wide, horizontal ovals to protruding, tube-like funnels, and more. In this paper, a morphometric model is developed to quantify the vast diversity in batoid nose shapes, sizes, and positions on the head in an ecological and functional framework. Specifically, swimming mode, lifestyle, habitat, and diet are examined for correlations with observed nasal morphotypes. Morphometric measurements were taken on all 4 orders present in Batoidea to broadly encompass batoid nasal diversity (Rhinopristiformes 4/5 families; Rajiformes 2/4 families; Torpediniformes 4/4 families; Myliobatiformes 8/11 families). All batoid external nasal diversity was found to be categorized into 5 major morphological groups and were termed: flush nare [circle, comma, intermediate], open nare, and protruding nare. Several morphometric traits remained significant when accounting for shared ancestry, including the position and angle of the nostril on the head, the width of the inlet hole, and the spacing of the nostrils from each other. These measurements were found to be closely correlated and statistically significant with the swimming mode of the animal. This study provides the first crucial step in understanding batoid olfaction, by understanding the diversity of the morphology of the system. Because odor capture is a strictly hydrodynamic process, it may be that factors relating more directly to the fluid dynamics (i.e., swimming mode, velocity, Reynolds number) may be more important in shaping the evolution of the diversity of batoid noses than other ecological factors like habitat and diet.

AB  - Environmental variation can influence the reproductive success of species managed under human care and in the wild, yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely mysterious. Molecular mechanisms such as epigenetic modifiers are important in mediating the timing and progression of reproduction in humans and model organisms, but few studies have linked epigenetic variation to reproductive fitness in wildlife. Here, we investigated epigenetic variation in black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes), an endangered North American mammal reliant on ex situ management for survival and persistence in the wild. Despite similar levels of genetic diversity in human-managed and wild-born populations, individuals in ex situ facilities exhibit reproductive problems, such as poor sperm quality. Differences across these settings suggest that an environmentally driven decline in reproductive capacity may be occurring in this species. We examined the role of DNA methylation, one well-studied epigenetic modifier, in this emergent condition. We leveraged blood, testes, and semen samples from male black-footed ferrets bred in ex situ facilities and found tissue-type specificity in DNA methylation across the genome, although 1360 Gene Ontology terms associated with male average litter size shared functions across tissues. We then constructed gene networks of differentially methylated genomic sites associated with three different reproductive phenotypes to explore the putative biological impact of variation in DNA methylation. Sperm gene networks associated with average litter size and sperm count were functionally enriched for candidate genes involved in reproduction, development, and its regulation through transcriptional repression. We propose that DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating these reproductive phenotypes, thereby impacting the fertility of male ex situ individuals. Our results provide information into how DNA methylation may function in the alteration of reproductive pathways and phenotypes in artificial environments. These findings provide early insights to conservation hurdles faced in the protection of this rare species.

AB  - Coexistence of people and large carnivores depends on a complex combination of factors that vary geographically. Both the number and range of the Asiatic lion Panthera leo leo in the Greater Gir landscape, India, has increased since the 1990s. The challenge has been managing the success of conservation, with a particular focus on the spillover population ranging extensively in human-dominated landscapes. To understand the factors conducive to lion survival in this landscape, we undertook an interview-based survey. Overall, people expressed positive, tolerant attitudes towards lions. There was a distinct contrast between people's liking for lions (76.9% of respondents) compared to leopards (27.7%) in spite of greater depredation of livestock by lions (82.6%) than by leopards (17.4%). Younger people and respondents having greater awareness regarding lions expressed positive attitudes. Although community discussions on lions had a positive effect, there was no evidence that land-holding, management interventions, personal encounters with lions, or association of lions with religion affected attitudes. Respondents who had experienced livestock depredation tended to express negative attitudes. Respondents with positive attitudes towards lions favoured non-interventionist strategies for managing lions in the village areas. We advocate consideration of varied factors influencing tolerance of wildlife in conservation planning. We emphasize that site-specific human-wildlife conflict issues such as crop-foraging by wild ungulates and variation in attitudes towards different species should also be considered. Specifically, improved livestock management, motivation of local youth and their participation in awareness campaigns could all further strengthen the prevalent positive attitudes towards lions.

AB  - Knowledge about the factors affecting the number of active latrines (NAL) of reintroduced Cuvier's gazelles (Gazella cuvieri Ogilby, 1841) is of a crucial step aiming at understanding their distributional dynamics and their habitats preference. Here, we used six random 500-m transects to assess the effect of season, microhabitat, and management variables on the spatio-temporal pattern of latrines in the Tergou forest reserve (TFR). Our results showed that, in this reserve, NAL is mainly governed by the interaction between season and distance to the nearest developed runway, being higher at the farthest distances from the runway in autumn and the closest distances to it in summer and winter. Variation partitioning analysis confirmed this pattern as the interaction between season and distance to the nearest developed runway explains 82% (p = 0.001) of the total variance in NAL. The distance to the nearest fence also contributes, but marginally, in influencing the NAL in this forest enclosure. For the species' management and conservation, it is recommended to dispose of sandy open ground areas especially in forest reserves to ensure ideal conditions for reintroduced gazelles. The pursuit of monitoring is necessary to understand mechanisms governing the distributional dynamics of Cuvier's gazelles more deeply. As any enclosure, the TFR would offer a good opportunity for consolidating and improving the knowledge on this vulnerable mammal species in the view of a successful release in the wild.

AB  - One of the most significant challenges for elephant conservation is managing negative interactions that occur where people and elephants use the same space and compete for resources. Human-elephant conflict (HEC) incidents often manifest as direct impacts to humans or elephants. However, some HEC situations result in long-term risk and chronic stress among communities living with elephants. Indirect impacts or opportunity costs, such as people being disadvantaged by the presence of elephants are harder to quantify and are not often addressed. In the eastern Okavango Panhandle, in northern Botswana, about 17,500 people share space and resources with 18,000 elephants in an area of 8,700 km2. Elephants here use distinct, historical corridors on a daily basis, moving from dryland resources to the wetlands of the Okavango Delta. Confrontations with elephants occur most frequently where these elephant corridors cross the main service road in the area, increasing fear among people walking to work, children going to school, parents sending children to school, and the elderly or expectant mothers accessing medical care. This constant fear contributes to chronic stress and can drive negative perceptions towards elephants. A novel intervention has been introduced to help reduce the costs of HEC and foster coexistence, in the Okavango Panhandle area-the 'Elephant Express'. The bus service was established through a multi-stakeholder collaboration to provide primary school children and medical personnel safe transport across elephant corridors to schools and health clinics. The complementary bus service has reduced stress from living with elephants, increased attendance and performance in schools, and facilitated improved access to medical care.

AB  - Hematological parameters and changes in stress-induced functionalities of cellular enzymes have been recognized as valuable tools for monitoring fish health and determining the toxic effects of pesticides. The present study was conducted to evaluate the toxic effect of selected pesticides viz., Ekalux (EC-25%), Impala (EC-55%), and Neemstar (EC-15%) on freshwater catfish Mystus keletius. Fish were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations (mg/L) of the selected pesticide for a period of 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. Hematological parameters viz., total erythrocyte (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and hematocrit (Ht) packed cell volume values decreased with an increase in exposure time to pesticides, whereas the values for parameters viz., leucocytes (WBC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) increased significantly. A decrease in packed cell volume (PCV) and hemoglobin values coupled with decreased and deformed erythrocytes as signs of anemia were also observed. The effect of pesticides on RBC content was 1.43 (million/mm(3)) on day 7 and reduced to 1.18 (million/mm(3)) on days 14 and 21. A similar trend was found for Impala on RBC, which had an initial value of 1.36 (million/mm(3)) on day 7 and reached a value of 1.10 (million/mm(3)) on day 28. In contrast, the value of Neemstar decreased from 1.59 (million/mm(3)) on day 7 in control to 1.02 (million/mm(3)) on day 28. Data indicates that the order of toxic effect of pesticides recorded a maximum for Impala followed by Ekalux and Neemstar in the selected fish model. Likewise, the overall pattern of pesticidal activity on cellular enzymes (GDH, MDH, and SDH) recorded a maximum toxic effect for Impala followed by Ekalux and Neemstar. Results indicate that Chlorpyrifos pesticide-Impala evoked maximum toxic effect on selected tissues compared to the other two pesticides tested. Statistical analysis of the summative data using two way ANOVA was statistically significant (p-value < 0.001). The differences in the hematological parameters analyzed are attributed to the physiological acclimatization of the fish to the local conditions, which influences the energy metabolism and consequently determines the health status of the fish. Overall, Impala exhibited the highest pesticidal activity on cellular enzyme, followed by Ekalux and Neemstar. Results suggest that natural pesticides may be preferable for rice field application in terms of environmental safety.

AB  - Seed traits can influence post-dispersal seed fate and seedling establishment by manipulating the size of caches made by hoarding animals. However, few studies have explored how seed traits affect cache size and subsequent seed fate mediated by hoarding rodents. In this study, we investigated the effects of seed traits on hoarding behavior of Leopoldamys edwardsi using seeds of Quercus variabilis, Castanea henryi, Camellia oleifera, Lithocarpus harlandii, and Choerospondias axillaris in semi-natural enclosures in Dujiangyan, southwest China, in an attempt to elucidate the relationship between seed traits and cache size. Significant differences were detected in the scatter-hoarding preference of L. edwardsi for seeds of C. axillaris, C. henryi, C. oleifera, Q. variabilis, and L. harlandii. There was a significant difference in the cache size between the five seed species made by L. edwardsi. More importantly, we found that there was a significant positive correlation between the cache size and crude fat but a significant negative correlation between cache size and seed mass as well as crude starch. Our study has revealed that seed traits appear to be a key factor in regulating the hoarding behavior of rodents, mainly the size of their caches. This regulation, in turn, has a significant impact on seed survival and seedling establishment that emerge from the caches.

AB  - The ongoing and progressive evolution of antibiotic resistance presents escalating challenges for the clinical management and prevention of bacterial infections. Understanding the makeup of resistance genomes and accurately quantifying the current abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are crucial for assessing the threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to public health. This comprehensive study investigated the distribution and diversity of bacterial community composition, ARGs, and virulence factors (VFs) across human, chicken, pig fecal, and soil microbiomes in various provinces of China. As a result, multidrug resistance was identified across all samples. Core ARGs primarily related to multidrug, MLS (Macrolides-Lincosamide-Streptogramins), and tetracycline resistance were characterized. A significant correlation between ARGs and bacterial taxa was observed, especially in soil samples. Probiotic strains such as Lactobacillus harbored ARGs, potentially contributing to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. We screened subsets of ARGs from samples from different sources as indicators to assess the level of ARGs contamination in samples, with high accuracy. These results underline the complex relationship between microbial communities, resistance mechanisms, and environmental factors, emphasizing the importance of continued research and monitoring to better understand these dynamics.

AB  - Simple Summary Much evidence has indicated that dietary fiber plays an important role in regulating performance and intestinal health of the pigs. Dietary fiber is divided into soluble (SDF) and insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) based on solubility. SDF is easier to be fermented by gut microbiota to produce more volatile fatty acids (VFA) than IDF, and IDF is beneficial to development of the gastrointestinal tract and microbial diversity. Until now, effects of different SDF to IDF ratios on pig performance and their microbial community have not been clear. To provide a scientifically recommended requirement of fiber types for pig nutrition, this study was conducted to explore the roles of different SDF to IDF ratios in weaned and growing-finishing pigs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different SDF to IDF ratios on growth performance, serum indexes and fecal microbial community in pigs. Weaned and growing-finishing pigs were fed a diet containing five different ratios of SDF to IDF from 1:5 to 1:9 and from 1:3 to 1:7, respectively. Results showed a linear tendency that average daily gain (ADG) of weaned pigs decreased but the feed intake to weight gain ratio (F/G) increased as the ratio of SDF to IDF increased from 1:5 to 1:9 (p = 0.06). The ADG of growing-finishing pigs showed quadratic changes (p < 0.05) as ratios of SDF to IDF increased from 1:3 to 1:7. The Shannon index of fecal microbial diversity increased first and then decreased as the SDF to IDF ratio increased from 1:5 to 1:9 (p < 0.05). The Shannon and Chao indexes of fecal microbial diversity in growing-finishing pigs showed significant incremental linearly as the SDF to IDF ratio increased from 1:3 to 1:7 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the recommended inclusion ratios of SDF to IDF in weaned and growing-finishing pigs diets are 1:7 and 1:5.

AB  - Environmental regulation would often limit production, causing conflicts between environmental protection and industrial development. The fundamental reason is the weak compatibility between environmental regulation goals and pig production goals. In order to improve the compatibility, this paper analysed how the herd structure adjusts the impact of environmental regulation on pig production based on the rational theory on small farmer. With the use of inter-provincial panel data from 2008 to 2020 in China, a dual moderation effect model is constructed for the empirical analysis. The results show that: (1) Strengthening environmental regulation would inhibit pig production. (2) Herb structure not only affects pig production directly, but also the nonlinear impact of environmental regulation on pig production, which would be used as a specific guideline to improve the compatibility. (3) Moderate adjustment on herb structure would help to weaken the inhibitory effect of environmental regulation on pig production and realize the sustainable development of the pig industry.

AB  - The earliest widely accepted presence of humans in America dates to approximately 17.5 cal kyr BP, at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Among other evidence, this presence is attested by stone tools and associated cut-marks and other bone surface modifications (BSM), interpreted as the result of the consumption of animals by humans. Claims of an older human presence in the continent have been made based on the proposed anthropogenic modification of faunal remains; however, these have been controversial due to the highly subjective nature of the interpretations. Here, we employ advanced deep learning algorithms to objectively increase the accuracy of BSM identification on bones. With several models that exhibit BSM classification accuracies greater than 94%, we use ensemble learning techniques to robustly classify a selected sample of BSM from the approximately 30 kyr BP site of Arroyo del Vizcaino, Uruguay. Our results confidently show the presence of cut-marks imparted by stone tools on bones at the site. This result supports an earlier presence of humans in the American continent, expanding additional genetic and archaeological evidence of a human LGM and pre-LGM presence in the continent.

AB  - The manure-compost-soil process is the main avenue for using agricultural livestock waste. Biochar not only impacts the composting process but also enhances the soil's organic matter and nitrogen content when applied with compost. This paper explores the profound impact of biochar as an additive on the manure-compost-soil process, uncovering novel mechanisms driving enhanced soil health and bacterial succession. The basic physicochemical properties (organic matter, total nitrogen, etc.) and microbial structure of the composting and soil samples were analyzed. Biochar additive increased the C/N ratio and the total carbon content of the compost. Biochar, compost, and biochar-based compost improved the total carbon and organic matter of the soil. After high-temperature composting, Saccharomonospora (from 2.68% to 0.80%), Atopostipes (from 5.71% to 0.13%), and Lactobacillus (from 5.27% to 0.04%) were almost eliminated. Lysobacter, Glutamicibacter, and Streptomyces were the dominant genera in the soil samples, promoting plant growth. Nocardiopsis, Saccharomonospora, Bacillus, and Oceanobacillus dominated the genera in the whole manure-compost-soil process. Thus, composting could eliminate the toxic or negative bacteria directly deposited into soil by manure. Those genera arising from compost or biochar-based compost in the soil could contribute to organic matter's cycle.

AB  - African trophy hunting is controversial. Central to the debate on this practice is whether it may be justified by any broader provisions to African society. These typically include meat supply to poor communities, problem animal control, and the funding of conservation and community development. The societal role of African hunting is as contested as the practice itself, with proponents advocating for the benefits of hunting, while critics point to these being inadequate. Little is known about the role of location and demography in the debate on hunting benefits. Here we circulated an anonymous online survey through our international networks. We asked respondents to indicate which (if any) benefits they thought may justify the practice and whether they supported African trophy hunting, or not. We also collected data on respondent geographic location, age, gender, and employment within conservation. The 5755 responses were analysed using multiple correspondence analysis and provided strong evidence for an association between the level of support/rejection of trophy hunting and potential benefits that were perceived to justify the practice. Funding of wildlife conservation through hunting was the most frequently selected benefit, even among many respondents with a neutral or slightly negative view toward trophy hunting as a practice. Respondents strongly opposed to trophy hunting were more likely to reject all societal benefits of hunting. There was some divergence in views between Africa-based respondents, and those outside of Africa. We suggest that any policy development on African trophy hunting be required to incorporate the views of all African stakeholders.

AB  - As one of the most important disease vectors worldwide, ticks can transmit a number of pathogenic organisms to humans and domestic animals and cause a variety of important natural focal diseases and zoonoses. Domestic livestock play a vital role in the dispersal of ticks from the field environment to the human settlement, contributing to the prevalence of tick-borne diseases. Identification of the tick control region could contribute a vital role in strategic planning and cost-effective tick control measures. However, little is known about the spatial distribution characteristics of ticks around livestock sheds, which will lead to abusage and overuse of insecticides. Therefore, this study aimed to explore spatial distribution characteristics and correlation factors of ticks around goat sheds. A total of 3898 ticks were collected from eight goat sheds from April to June in Jinan city. All the sampled ticks belonged to the same species, namely Haemaphysalis longicornis, and 88.8% of them were nymphs. A significant positive correlation was noted between free-living ticks and parasitic ticks (r = 0.411, P < 0.001). However, there was a significant negative correlation between number of free-living ticks and distance from the goat sheds (r = -0.622, P < 0.001). Within 20 m from the goat sheds, 2211 ticks were collected respectively, representing 56.7% of the total free-living ticks. At a distance of 30 m, 57.6% decline in the tick density was found with a significant difference (q = 5.534, P < 0.001). In conclusion, focusing control efforts near the goat sheds should be recommend for tick prevention and control.

AB  - Unraveling the diversification mechanisms of organisms is a fundamental and important macroevolutionary question regarding the diversity, ecological niche, and morphological divergence of life. However, many studies have only explored diversification mechanisms via isolated factors. Here, based on comparative phylogenetic analysis, we performed a macroevolutionary examination of horseshoe bats (Chiroptera: Rhinolophidae: Rhinolophus), to reveal the inter-relationships among diversification, intrinsic/extrinsic factors, and climatic ecological niche characteristics. Results showed a general slowing trajectory during diversification, with two dispersal events from Asia into Southeast Asia and Africa playing key roles in shaping regional heterogeneous diversity. Morphospace expansions of the investigated traits (e.g., body size, echolocation, and climate niche) revealed a decoupled pattern between diversification trajectory and trait divergence, suggesting that other factors (e.g., biotic interactions) potentially played a key role in recent diversification. Based on ancestral traits and pathway analyses, most Rhinolophus lineages belonging to the same region overlapped with each other geographically and were positively associated with the diversification rate, implying a competitive prelude to speciation. Overall, our study showed that multiple approaches need to be integrated to address diversification history. Rather than a single factor, the joint effects of multiple factors (biogeography, environmental drivers, and competition) are responsible for the current diversity patterns in horseshoe bats, and a corresponding multifaceted strategy is recommended to study these patterns in the future.

AB  - Podostemum ceratophyllum (Hornleaf riverweed) is a macrophyte that inhabits swift-water rivers with stable substrates and abundant light in montane and piedmont ecoregions of eastern North America. Within these habitats, P. ceratophyllum, is considered a foundation species because the plant can strongly influence community structure by increasing habitat complexity for macroinvertebrates and fishes, and facilitates resources cycling via elemental sequestration, herbivory, and detrital pathways. Currently, the USDA and NatureServe recognize P. ceratophyllum as a conservation concern in some states, but the plant's status remains uncertain in many other states. In West Virginia, P. ceratophyllum, is considered imperiled (S2) by the West Virginia Natural Heritage Program. The most recent records were collected in 1998, while other populations have not been confirmed since the late 1800s. To expand our current understanding of the distribution of P. ceratophyllum in West Virginia, we surveyed six historical sites and 34 new sites between 2016-2019. Four historical site were found to still support P. ceratophyllum, and 10 new populations were discovered in six different river systems; however, P. ceratophyllum was not found at 26 other sites surveyed. Identifying new populations of P. ceratophyllum and resurveying previously documented populations in West Virginia expands the ecological and botanical understanding of this notably underreported plant. Improved documentation of P. ceratophyllum in West Virginia may benefit river management and restoration efforts in the state and provide insight into the plant's sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Zoos play a vital role in conservation with an overall aim of preserving species, such as the okapi (Okapi johnstoni), from extinction. To ensure species survival, sustainable ex-situ populations are required, and therefore understanding the reproductive status of individuals is important for population management. In this study, the oestrous cycles and gestations of four okapi (n = 7 pregnancies) were monitored through non-invasive faecal sampling methods to quantify progestagen and oestrogen metabolites. Baseline criteria for determining oestrous cycles was developed using approximately 20 months of sampling from each of two non-pregnant females, before being applied to pre-and early conception data. Pre-conception oestrous cycles were characterised in two females with luteal phase (mean f SD) was 8.47 f 1.41 days (n = 59) with an inter-luteal phase of 7.38 f 1.67 days (n = 58), and overall average cycle length of 15.83 f 2.02 days (n = 54 full cycles only). Observed in all four females, oestrogen metabolite peaks occurred at the beginning of the inter-luteal phase as progestagen metabolites were decreasing. Gestation was confirmed when progestagen metabolite concentrations remained at luteal phase concentrations for at least 20 days, with concentrations remaining at this level for the first 120 days of gestation without return to baseline values. A secondary increase at around 150 days lasted until parturition. These data demonstrate that okapi exhibit similar oestrous cycles to other members of the giraffidae family, with faecal oestrogens for the first time indicating that ovulation occurs at the beginning of the inter-luteal phase while progestagens are still elevated. Furthermore, we have shown that through routine sample collection and hormone monitoring, gestation can be confirmed within the first trimester, which can benefit the management of the species in ex-situ populations.

AB  - Simple Summary Capybaras are known hosts for various tick species, but there are limited data regarding the tick-borne pathogens they can carry. We assessed the presence of piroplasmids and Ehrlichia spp. in capybaras and their associated ticks in Goias state, central-western Brazil. Neither capybaras nor ticks were positive for Ehrlichia spp. However, we detected an undescribed species of protozoan in both the capybaras and ticks. Further research is required for a formal delineation of this protozoan species, as well as to investigate the role of these ticks as vectors and the possible pathogenicity of this parasite to other animals, including horses. Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are the largest rodents on Earth. While capybaras are hosts for various tick species, there is limited information regarding the tick-borne pathogens they can carry. We investigated the presence of piroplasmids and Ehrlichia spp. in capybaras and their associated ticks in two peri-urban areas in Goias state, central-western Brazil. Blood samples collected from 23 capybaras were used to investigate the presence of piroplasmids and Ehrlichia spp. in stained-blood smears and by PCR. Ticks collected from the capybaras were identified morphologically and also tested using PCR for the same pathogens. A total of 955 ticks were collected, including 822 (86.1%) Amblyomma sculptum, 132 (13.8%) Amblyomma dubitatum, and one (0.1%) unidentified larva of Amblyomma sp. Neither the capybaras nor ticks were positive for Ehrlichia spp. However, a stained-blood smear examination revealed the presence of ring-stage and pyriform-shaped merozoites in the erythrocytes of one (4.4%) capybara. In the same way, 47.8% (11/23) and 19.9% (36/181) of blood samples and ticks, respectively, were positive for piroplasmids in the PCR. We successfully sequenced a partial 18S rRNA gene fragment of four samples (two capybaras, one A. sculptum, and one A. dubitatum), and the phylogenetic reconstruction disclosed that the organism reported in the present study clusters within the genus Babesia. Further research is required for a formal delineation of this species (designated as Babesia sp. strain Capybara) and to investigate the hypothesis of A. dubitatum and A. sculptum ticks being vectors.

AB  - Neurophysiological advances have given us exciting insights into the systems responsible for spatial mapping in mammals. However, we are still lacking information on the evolution of these systems and whether the underlying mechanisms identified are universal across phyla, or specific to the species studied. Here we address these questions by exploring whether a species that is evolutionarily distant from mammals can perform a task central to mammalian spatial mapping-distance estimation. We developed a behavioural paradigm allowing us to test whether goldfish (Carassius auratus) can estimate distance and explored the behavioural mechanisms that underpin this ability. Fish were trained to swim a set distance within a narrow tank covered with a striped pattern. After changing the background pattern, we found that goldfish use the spatial frequency of their visual environment to estimate distance, doubling the spatial frequency of the background pattern resulted in a large overestimation of the swimming distance. We present robust evidence that goldfish can accurately estimate distance and show that they use local optic flow to do so. These results provide a compelling basis to use goldfish as a model system to interrogate the evolution of the mechanisms that underpin spatial cognition, from brain to behaviour.

AB  - Nervous necrosis virus (NNV) (genus: Betanodavirus) attacks aquacultured fish. Biocontrol may prevent and control the disease caused by NNV infection. Shewanella strain 0409 was isolated from the micmbiome of grouper intestines, and its culture supernatant (CS0409) could inhibit NNV replication in vitro. The present study elucidated the antiviral mechanism of Shewanella strain 0409 against NNV in vitro. In NNV-infected GF-1 cells, CS0409 reduced both NNV RNA synthesis and the percentage of cells expressing NNV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) within 24 hpi. However, NNV RdRp activity was not inhibited by CS0490 treatment. The most favorable time for CS0409 treatment in NNV-infected GF-1 cells was the period of viral adsorption, which revealed a high inhibition level of NNV RNA synthesis. Shewanella strain 0409 produced ammonium in CS0409. When ammonium in CS0409 was removed by heating with evaporation, the anti-NNV activity of CS0409 decreased. Moreover, ammonium in CS0409 inhibited the acidification of acidic organelles. Furthermore, the morphology of NNV virions changed to empty particles after exposure to pH 5 and 6, indicating that NNV uncoating required the acidic environment of endosomes. Therefore, ammonium in CS0409 is responsible for the anti-NNV activity in vitro by inhibiting the acidification of endosomes and then suppressing NNV uncoating.

AB  - Intensive pig farming relies on the extensive use of heavy metal additions to feed and this poses a threat to the environment that receives the manure. Pig manure is still continually disposed of improperly and many farms do not possess waste treatment facilities. In this study, two typical pig farms that lacked waste treatment facilities in Beijing, northern China, and two in Hefei, southern China were selected to determine the distributions of Cu, Zn, and Cd in the environment near the farms. Our results indicated that Cu, Zn, and Cd levels were 1.28-36.60, 1.02-19.49, and 1.04-219.56 times their local background values, respectively. The order of frequency of in-dividual metals that could potentially pose ecological risks to soils was Cd > Cu > Zn. All four pig farms were rated as possessing considerable or high risk according to the average contamination degree (C-d). Our RDA result indicated that the heavy metals did not show a significant correlation with the bacterial community composition in the soils. Additionally, groundwater near these pig farms was safe for drinking. Our results indicated that detailed investigations are necessary to determine the extent of heavy metal pollution in soils adjacent to pig farms that lack proper wastewater treatment facilities. This study offers further and deeper insights into the heavy metal pollution from intensive pig farms to the adjacent soils.

AB  - An in vivo study aiming to investigate the rumen methanogens community structure was conducted in Mandya sheep fed on straw and concentrate diet. The ruminal fluid samples were collected and processed for unravelling the rumen microbiota and methanogens diversity. Further, the daily enteric methane emission and methane yield was also quantified using the SF6 tracer technique. Results indicated that the Bacteroidetes (similar to 57%) and Firmicutes (25%) were two prominent affiliates of the bacterial community. Archaea represented about 2.5% of the ruminal microbiota. Methanobacteriales affiliated methanogens were the most prevalent in sheep rumen. The study inveterate that the ruminal archaea community in sheep is composed of 9 genera and 18 species. Methanobrevibacter represented the largest genus of the archaeome, while methylotrophs genera constituted only 13% of the community. Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii was the prominent methanogen, and Methaobrevibacter ruminantium distributed at a lower frequency (similar to 2.5%). Among Methanomassiliicoccales, Group 12 sp. ISO4-H5 constituted the most considerable fraction (similar to 11%). KEGG reference pathway for methane metabolism indicated the formation of methane through hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic pathways, whereas the acetoclastic pathway was not functional in sheep. The enteric methane emission and methane yield was 19.7 g/d and 20.8 g/kg DMI, respectively. Various species of Methanobrevibacter were differently correlated, and the distribution of hydrogenotrophic methanogens mainly explained the variability in methane yield between the individual sheep. It can be inferred from the study that the hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominate the rumen archaeal community in sheep and methylotrophic/aceticlastic methanogens represent a minor fraction of the community. Further studies are warranted for establishing the metabolic association between the prevalent hydrogenotrophs and methylotrophs to identify the key reaction for reducing methane emission.

AB  - Scale-up intensive pig farming can increase profitability by economies of large scale, but it also exacerbates environmental pollution caused by the disordered discharge of manure and sewage. Manure & sewage man-agement (MSM) is critical to mitigate environmental pressure and reuse livestock waste. However, the corresponding MSM measures adopted by pig farmers are multitudinous in reality, due to the diversity of MSM methods and heterogeneity of farmers' characteristics and behaviors. Thus, this study empirically categorized five typical MSM modes (i.e., traditional simple mode (TSM), mixed processing mode (MPM), semi-biogas mode (SBM), professional processing with simple utilization mode (PPSUM) and professional processing with full utilization mode (PPFUM)) by clustering analysis, based on the field data from 406 pig farms, and further discriminated farmers' heterogeneous characteristics on corresponding mode adoption. Results revealed that each mode was distinctive. The applicability of the corresponding mode was reflected in the synthesis deliberation, involving farming structure, land, farmers' characteristic and their subjective awareness. Farmers' education level and pro-environmental perception are significantly promoted to adopt technology-intensive MSM modes. Scale upgrading has a positive effect on mechanization adoption and diversified strategies application. Land as an unalterable objective factor restricted the extension of MSM modes based on field returning. Con-clusions clarified typical MSM modes and provided references to individual pig farms on appropriate mode se-lection, further enhancing the efficiency of MSM and contributing to the sustainability of green development of pig farming in China.

AB  - Climatic, landscape, and host features are critical components in shaping outbreaks of vector-borne diseases. However, the relationship between the outbreaks of vector-borne pathogens and their environmental drivers is typically complicated, nonlinear, and may vary by taxonomic units below the species level (e.g., strain or serotype). Here, we aim to untangle how these complex forces shape the risk of outbreaks of Bluetongue virus (BTV); a vector-borne pathogen that is continuously emerging and re-emerging across Europe, with severe economic implications. We tested if the ecological predictors of BTV outbreak risk were serotype-specific by examining the most prevalent serotypes recorded in Europe (1, 4, and 8). We used a robust machine learning (ML) pipeline and 23 relevant environmental features to fit predictive models to 24,245 outbreaks reported in 25 European countries between 2000 and 2019. Our ML models demonstrated high predictive performance for all BTV serotypes (accuracies > 0.87) and revealed strong nonlinear relationships between BTV outbreak risk and environmental and host features. Serotype-specific analysis suggests, however, that each of the major serotypes (1, 4, and 8) had a unique outbreak risk profile. For example, temperature and midge abundance were as the most important characteristics shaping serotype 1, whereas for serotype 4 goat density and temperature were more important. We were also able to identify strong interactive effects between environmental and host characteristics that were also serotype specific. Our ML pipeline was able to reveal more in-depth insights into the complex epidemiology of BTVs and can guide policymakers in intervention strategies to help reduce the economic implications and social cost of this important pathogen.

AB  - In the Russian Federation, the indigenous population of sika deer (Cervus nippon hortulorum, Swinhoe, 1864) lives only in a small area of the Primorsky Kray. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, along with measures for the conservation of sika deer, they began to acclimatize it, with settling over a large territory and creating new habitats. Currently, up to 40% of the total population of sika deer in the Russian Federation is concentrated in the European part. Despite the long period of existence in the new ecological conditions, molecular genetic methods were not used in the study of sika deer. This work presents for the first time the results of microsatellite analysis of two populations of sika deer from Tver (Zavidovo population) and Kaluga (Tarusa population) regions. F-statistics calculated for 12 STR-loci (BMS1788, Rt1, C143, OheQ, FCB193, C217, Rt24, C32, BMS745, NVHRT16, T40, C276) indicate a lack of heterozygous genotypes and indicate a weak divergence of populations. In the interpopulation comparison, the Zavidovo population was distinguished by a greater allelic diversity and a significant number of private alleles. Genetic variability in observed and expected heterozygosity for the Zavidovo population was HO= 0.47 +/- 0.08 and HE= 0.51 +/- 0.09 and for the Tarusa population - HO= 0.52 +/- 0.09 and HE= 0.49 +/- 0.08, respectively. At the same time, both studied populations of sika deer were characterized by a decrease in allelic diversity and heterozygosity relative to the "maternal" aboriginal Far Eastern population. Accordingly, at the present stage of hunting resource management, a reasonable artificial expansion of the range of rare and economically especially valuable animal species due to their dispersal and acclimatization is impos-sible without a genetic analysis of populations using highly polymorphic molecular markers and the use of standard estimated indicators of dynamic processes in populations. According to the results of the study, it can be concluded that the genetic diversity of the studied acclimatized populations of sika deer in the Tver and Kaluga regions does not differ significantly, and the observed difference in private alleles suggests an independent development of the gene pools of the populations under consideration.

AB  - The consumption of similar diets has led to the convergence of gut microbial compositions and functions across phylogenetically distinct animals. However, given the functional redundancy in gut microbiomes, it remains unclear whether synchrony occurs in their functions only and not in their composition, even within phylogenetically close animals consuming a similar diet. In this study, we collected fresh fecal samples from a Rhinopithecus roxellana population in April 2021 (before food provisioning) and June and December 2021 (after food provisioning) and used high-throughput sequencing methods (full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomes) to investigate changes in the gut microbiome due to food provisioning. Combining the results from our previous studies on a wild Rhinopithecus bieti population, we found that the artificial food provisions (e.g., apples, carrots, and peanuts) affected the gut microbiome, and synchrony occurred only in its functions and antibiotic resistance gene community in both Rhinopithecus species, reflecting its ecological functional redundancy. Given the current findings (e.g., depletion in probiotic microbes, dysbiosis in the gut microbial community, and changes in the antibiotic resistance gene profile), anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., food provisioning) would have potential negative effects on host health. Therefore, human activity in animal conservation should be rethought from the standpoint of gut microbial diversity.

AB  - Soil specialists can have restricted distributions, and effective management in the face of land use change depends on a thorough understanding of the ecology of these unique plants. We investigated the ecology of Eriogonum tiehmii Reveal, a rare soil specialist, using pitfall traps, flower observations, and pollinator exclusion to assess arthropod communities in E. tiehmii habitat, the most common visitors to E. tiehmii flowers, and the importance of pollination for seed set. We collected soil from 21 occupied and unoccupied sites for analysis of physical and chemical characteristics, and conducted a greenhouse soil preference experiment to test how seeds and seedlings respond to soil variation. We also monitored tagged plants in extant populations, measuring survival, size, and reproductive output. Arthropod communities within and around E. tiehmii sites were abundant and diverse; each sample site contained numerous unique species, and there was high turnover in arthropod community composition over time. Open pollination significantly increased seed production, with beetles, wasps, and flies the most likely important pollinators. Reproductive output and size class distributions varied among wild populations, and soil properties differed between occupied and unoccupied sites. Occupied sites were, on average, lower in sulfur, zinc, potassium, and magnesium and, on average higher in boron, pH, and silt, among other differences, though there was high variation in these characteristics among sites. Seedlings demonstrated sensitivity to individual soil properties, and seedlings grown in soils from occupied sites had, on average, higher total biomass and higher root allocation than seedlings grown in soils from unoccupied sites. These preference tests suggest a "specialist" model of soil specialization rather than a "refuge" model, indicating that plants are not simply highly stress-tolerant, but are specifically adapted to their native soil types. While some unoccupied sites we tested were favorable for some life history stages, we did not identify unoccupied sites that could support both establishment and growth of E. tiehmii seedlings. Future work could consider the effects of biotic interactions such as plant competition and herbivores on plant growth, and employ additional demographic monitoring to better understand life history and population dynamics of this extreme soil specialist.

AB  - Incidental capture, or bycatch, of marine species is a global conservation concern. Interactions with fishing gear can cause mortality in air-breathing marine megafauna, including sea turtles. Despite this, interactions between sea turtles and fishing gear-from a behavior standpoint-are not sufficiently documented or described in the literature. Understanding sea turtle behavior in relation to fishing gear is key to discovering how they become entangled or entrapped in gear. This information can also be used to reduce fisheries interactions. However, recording and analyzing these behaviors is difficult and time intensive. In this study, we present a machine learning-based sea turtle behavior recognition scheme. The proposed method utilizes visual object tracking and orientation estimation tasks to extract important features that are used for recognizing behaviors of interest with green turtles (Chelonia mydas) as the study subject. Then, these features are combined in a color-coded feature image that represents the turtle behaviors occurring in a limited time frame. These spatiotemporal feature images are used along a deep convolutional neural network model to recognize the desired behaviors, specifically evasive behaviors which we have labeled "reversal" and "U-turn." Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an average F1 score of 85% in recognizing the target behavior patterns. This method is intended to be a tool for discovering why sea turtles become entangled in gillnet fishing gear.

AB  - Population monitoring can take many different forms, and monitoring elusive and endangered species frequently involves a variety of sparse data from different sources. Small populations are often hard to sample precisely and without bias, so when estimates of vital rates like survival or recruitment point to conflicting population trends, it can be hard to determine which is more correct. Furthermore, data can be extremely hard to collect on small populations and it can be helpful to find a way to use all available hard-won data. To address these issues, we developed an integrated population model (IPM) using all available data to estimate vital rates and abundance for a case study of an endangered woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) population. This IPM allowed us to incorporate data from juvenile recruitment surveys, telemetry-based survival, aerial population counts and mark-resight data, and non-invasive capture-recapture DNA data to better understand population status and trend. We estimated survival, abundance, and recruitment of four age classes of male and female caribou: young, juveniles, subadults, and adults. The four-age class structure of the IPM allowed us to estimate recruitment from reproductive-aged female caribou alone, even though it can be difficult to distinguish age classes-and even sexes-in the field. As part of our IPM, we developed a novel mixture model to break apart data from different age classes when age is unobservable, as it typically is from non-invasive DNA samples. This helped us decrease bias in juvenile and adult survival estimates from scat data, which was important to our understanding of the population dynamics. Overall, our integrated model provided more precise estimates of population trends than any one method (e.g., telemetry or non-invasive DNA) alone. This IPM provides a useful, flexible tool for biologists to monitor populations and provides a valuable example of the benefits of integrated population modeling approaches for endangered species management and recovery.

AB  - Fine fescues are a group of turfgrass species that are often planted when low-input maintenance is desired. The five species most commonly associated with the fine fescues are strong creeping red fescue, slender creeping red fescue, Chewings fescue, sheep fescue, and hard fescue. Little is known about the resistance of fine fescues to snow mold diseases despite the widespread adoption of fine fescues across temperate climates with harsh winters. Field and controlled environment trials were conducted in Wisconsin and New Jersey between 2014 and 2017 to assess snow mold resistance among the fine fescues. In both the field and controlled environments, hard and sheep fescue were among the most resistant to snow molds, and Chewings fescue was the most susceptible. However, significant variation existed among the cultivars within each species, suggesting that opportunities exist for breeding to improve resistance to snow mold in the fine fescues.

AB  - Many species have reduced reproductive potential at the poleward extreme of their range, where they exhibit unique spawning dynamics. However, recent poleward range expansions have resulted in many species being unstudied in these regions, such as the Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) in the northern Bering Sea (NBS). To characterize Pacific halibut spawning dynamics at the northern extreme of their range, we attached pop-up satellite telemetry tags to large females in the NBS, with time series data and tag reporting locations being used to infer spawning behavior and to identify occupied spawning habitat conditions, location, and timing. Pacific halibut in the NBS occupied spawning habitat later and farther north than previously described, where spawning habitat was occupied from January to May and reached as far north as the Russian continental shelf edge. Additionally, 42% of mature individuals never occupied presumed spawning habitat, suggesting the presence of skip spawning behavior. These findings suggest that Pacific halibut exhibit unique spawning dynamics in the NBS, which may result in a reduced reproductive potential within this northern population component.

AB  - Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz is an annual flowering plant that belongs to the Brassicaceae family. C. sativa as a dicotyledonous plant, one of its characteristics is morphological formability to respond to large environmental changes. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ethyl methylsulfonate on germination and morphological traits of C. saiva. Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) is one of the most potent mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds that cause point-substitution-mutation in the genome. To induce mutations in this experiment, ethyl methanesulfonate with concentrations of 0.1% and 0.5% was used in two periods of 8 and 16 hours on 200 seeds of Camelina. The results of variance analysis for plant heights, number of leaves per sub-branch, number of seeds per pod, number of main branch leaves, stem diameter, and pod length did not show the significant difference, but the only significant difference was for the trait of pod width. Also, results showed that there was a significant difference between the tested treatments in terms of germination percentage, longest root length, mean root length, mean shoot length, seedling fresh weight, and seedling dry weight. According to the results of germination experiments, EMS treatment widely affected all six studied traits, therefore, the amounts of the largest root length and shoot length decreased with increasing EMS concentration, but this relationship was not observed in other traits. Although EMS is classified as toxic, for germination percentage, it was observed that with increasing concentration and time of EMS treatment, germination percentage also increased. According to the correlation results, all traits had a positive and significant relationship with each other, which is probably due to the nature of the traits and their additive effect.

AB  - Implementing effective conservation measures to manage migratory populations is challenging, especially in a relatively inaccessible dynamic environment such as the ocean. With limited financial and human resources, efforts must be intelligently prioritized to achieve conservation success and reduce uncertainties of conservation efforts. The southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO) hosts some of the world's most important breeding grounds for the Critically Endangered hawksbill turtle Eretmochelys imbricata. However, knowledge gaps remain about the movement patterns of this species. Between 2007 and 2022, we deployed 17 satellite tags onto hawksbill turtles from scattered locations in the SWIO: 16 nesting females-Granitic Islands, Seychelles (n = 9); north Madagascar (n = 5); Moheli, Comoros (n = 1); Juan de Nova, Terres australes et antarctiques francaises (n = 1)-and 1 female bycaught in fisheries (east Madagascar). We found strong variability in migratory movements amongst individuals, particularly in terms of distance and movement persistence. Detailed analysis of movement persistence reveals that these individuals behave differently in neritic and oceanic habitats, with a lower movement persistence in neritic habitats. We identified a total of 12 foraging areas scattered throughout the SWIO, both in coastal and open-sea neritic habitats. These results reinforce the need to consider the importance of neritic habitats, for both migration and foraging, in conservation policies. The quantification of the degree of migratory variability is particularly important to developing conservation plans and strategies at both the national and international level, including the delineation of regional management units (RMUs) in the Indian Ocean.

AB  - Uptake and release patterns of dissolved organic matter (DOM) compounds and co-transported nutrients are entangled, and the current literature does not provide a consistent picture of the interactions between the retention processes of DOM fractions. We performed plateau addition experiments with five different complex DOM leachates in a small experimental stream impacted by diffuse agricultural pollution. The study used a wide range of DOM qualities by including leachates of cow dung, pig dung, corn leaves, leaves from trees, and whole nettle plants. We measured changes in nutrient and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations along the stream course and determined DOM fractions by fluorescence measurements and parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. To assess the influences of hydrological transport processes, we used a 1D hydrodynamic model.
   We developed a non-linear Bayesian approach based on the nutrient spiralling concept, which we named the "interactions in nutrient spirals using Bayesian regression" (INSBIRE) approach. This approach can disentangle complex interactions of biotic and abiotic drivers of reactive solutes' uptake in multi-component DOM sources. It can show the variability of the uptake velocities and quantify their uncertainty distributions. Furthermore, previous knowledge of nutrient spiralling can be included in the model using prior probability distributions. We used INSBIRE to assess interactions of compound-specific DOM and nutrient spiralling metrics in our experiment.
   Bulk DOC uptake varied among sources, showing decreasing uptake velocities in the following order: corn > pig dung > leaves > nettles > cow dung. We found no correlations between bulk DOC uptake and the amounts of protein-like compounds or co-leached soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). The fastest uptake was observed for SRP and the tryptophan-like component, while the other DOM components' uptake velocities more or less resembled that of the bulk DOC. Almost all DOM components showed a negative relationship between uptake and concentration, known as efficiency loss. Furthermore, we observed a few negative and (weak) positive interactions between the uptake and the concentration of different components, such as a decreased uptake of protein-like compounds at high concentrations of a high-molecular-weight humic-like compound. We also found an influence of the wetted width on the uptake of SRP and a microbially derived humic substance, which indicates the importance of the sediment-water interface for P and humic C cycling in the studied stream.
   Overall, we show that bulk DOC is a weak predictor of DOC uptake behaviour for complex DOM leachates. Individual DOM compound uptake, including co-leached nutrients, is controlled by both internal (quality-related) and external (environmental) factors within the same aquatic ecosystem. We conclude that the cycling of different C fractions and their mutual interaction with N and P uptake in streams is a complex, non-linear problem, which can only be assessed with advanced non-linear approaches, such as the presented INSBIRE approach.

AB  - Main conclusionMonoterpenes and phenolics play distinct roles in defending white spruce trees from insect defoliators. Monoterpenes contribute to the toxicity of the foliage, deterring herbivory, whereas phenolics impede budworm growth. This study demonstrates the complex interplay between monoterpenes and phenolics and their collective influence on the defense strategy of white spruce trees against a common insect defoliator.AbstractLong-lived coniferous trees display considerable variations in their defensive chemistry. The impact of these defense phenotype variations on insect herbivores of the same species remains to be thoroughly studied, mainly due to challenges in replicating the comprehensive defense profiles of trees under controlled conditions. This study methodically examined the defensive properties of foliar monoterpenes and phenolics across 80 distinct white spruce families. These families were subsequently grouped into two chemotypes based on their foliar monoterpene concentrations. To understand the separate and combined effects of these classes on tree defenses to the eastern spruce budworm, we conducted feeding experiments using actual defense profiles from representative families. Specifically, we assessed budworm response when exposed to substrates amended with phenolics alone or monoterpenes. Our findings indicate that the ratios and amounts of monoterpenes and phenolics present in the white spruce foliage influence the survival of spruce budworms. Phenotypes associated with complete larval mortality exhibited elevated ratios (ranging from 0.4 to 0.6) and concentrations (ranging from 1143 to 1796 ng mg-1) of monoterpenes. Conversely, families characterized by higher phenolic ratios (ranging from 0.62 to 0.77) and lower monoterpene concentrations (ranging from 419 to 985 ng mg-1) were less lethal to the spruce budworm. Both classes of defense compounds contribute significantly to the overall defensive capabilities of white spruce trees. Monoterpenes appear critical in determining the general toxicity of foliage, while phenolics play a role in slowing budworm development, thereby underscoring their collective importance in white spruce defenses.

AB  - Urban areas face increasing exposure to climate-induced hazards, including extreme heat and urban flooding, challenges exacerbated by limited green and blue areas. This study presents an integrated parametric workflow for the preliminary evaluation of multi-domain performance of small outdoor spaces, at early design stages, as adaptive interventions for mitigating these issues at the neighborhood scale. Using parametric modelling in Grasshopper with Ladybug Tools and Kangaroo plugins, the novel methodology assesses thermal comfort and surface runoff dynamics in a heat-and flood-prone outdoor space. Thermal stress was evaluated using Ladybug tools via the Universal Thermal Climate Index and the Mediterranean Outdoor Comfort Index, and compared with ENVI-met simulations results to test the reliability of the proposed workflow. Results highlighted significant thermal discomfort during peak summer hours, especially in unshaded areas. Irrigated vegetation, including trees and grass, effectively reduced heat stress, even if in some regions, due to water scarcity, irrigation entails tradeoffs. Surface runoff analyses, combining qualitative and quantitative computations, revealed green spaces' potential to mitigate water accumulation while exposing design inefficiencies, such as impermeable borders restricting infiltration. The findings underscore the critical role of small outdoor urban spaces in enhancing urban resilience. Key design strategies include increasing permeability to reduce runoff, maintaining greenery with irrigation, and integrating shaded elements to improve thermal comfort. The proposed workflow allows rapid scenario-based testing of design solutions during early planning stages, offering practitioners a preliminary tool for adaptive urban design. By addressing hydrological and thermal challenges within a unified workflow, the study highlights the co-benefits of small-scale green infrastructure, advancing climate adaptation and resilience in compact urban settings while promoting equitable and sustainable cities.

AB  - The fertility of boars is intimately tied to the pig farm's economic benefits. This study aimed to rapidly categorize boars of different fertility and investigate the factors influencing the categorization using the production data in a large pig farm in northern China, including 11,163 semen collection records of Yorkshire boars (215), 11,163 breeding records and 8770 records of farrowing performance of Yorkshire sows (4505), as well as 4720 records of selection indices (sire line index and dam line index) for boars and sows (215 and 4505) between 2017 and 2020. The boar population was classified by two-step cluster analysis, followed by factor analysis to minimize the dimensionality of data variables and eliminate multicollinearity, and then using ordinal logistic regression model to investigate the risk variables impacting boar fertility categorization. Results showed that the two-step clustering divided the 215 boars into three subgroups: high-fertility (n = 61, 28.4%), medium-fertility (n = 127, 59.1%) and low-fertility (n = 27, 12.6%). The high-fertility boars were shown to be substantially greater than the medium -fertility or low-fertility boars (p < 0.05) in average total litter size, number of born alive, and number of healthy piglets of mated sows. Compared with low-fertility boars, the high-fertility boars were also significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the pregnancy rate and farrowing rate of mated sows. However, the three boar subgroups showed no difference (p > 0.05) in semen quality information (average sperm motility, average sperm density, and average sperm volume). Collinearity diagnosis indicated severe multicollinearity among the 20 data variables, which were reduced to 8 factor variables (factors 1-8) by factor analysis, and further collinearity diagnosis exhibited no multicollinearity among the 8 factor variables. Ordered logistic regression analysis revealed a significant and positive correlation (p < 0.05) of boar fertility with factor 2 (average total litter size, number of born alive, number of healthy piglets), factor 4 (average number of weak piglets and average weak piglet rate), factor 6 (sire line index of boars and dam line index of boars), factor 8 (pregnancy rate and farrowing rate), highlighting factor 2 as the most important factor influencing the classification of boar fertility. Our results indicate that the two-step cluster analysis can be used as a simple and effective method to screen boars with different fertility and that farm producers should pay attention to the recording of the reproductive performance of the mated sows due to its role as the risk factor for classification of boar fertility.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - There is growing recognition of the threat posed by toxic lead-based ammunition. One group of domestic animals known to be susceptible to harmful lead exposure via this route is hunting dogs. Scent-trailing dogs ('hounds') are used to hunt introduced sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) during a prescribed eight-month (April-November) annual hunting season, during which they are fed fresh venison, in Victoria, south-eastern Australia. We used this annual season as a natural experiment to undertake longitudinal sampling of dogs for lead exposure. Blood was collected from 27 dogs owned by four different deer hunters and comprising three different breeds just prior to the start of the hound hunting season (March 2022) and in the middle of the season (August 2022), and blood lead levels (BLLs) (mu g/dL) were determined via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Using Tobit regression, the expected BLLs across all dogs were significantly lower before the season (0.50 mu g/dL, standard error [SE] = 0.32 mu g/dL) than during the season (1.39 mu g/dL, SE = 0.35 mu g/dL) (p = 0.01). However, when the breed of dog was included in the analyses, this effect was only significant in beagles (P < 0.001), not bloodhounds (p = 0.73) or harriers (p = 0.43). For 32% of the dogs before the season, and 56% during the season, BLLs exceeded the established threshold concentration for developmental neurotoxicity in humans (1.2 mu g/dL). Time since most recent venison feeding, sex of dog and owner were not associated with BLLs. The finding that BLLs more than doubled during the hunting season indicates that lead exposure is a risk in this context. These results expand the sphere of impact from environmental lead in Australia from wild animals and humans, to include some groups of domestic animals, a textbook example of a One Health issue.

AB  - Many small mammal populations exhibit dramatic annual fluctuations, with abundance sometimes varying by orders of magnitude across years. However, there remains much debate about the factors that drive changes in abundance. Long-term datasets provide important opportunities to further investigate these phenomena. Using 30 yr of data from a study at Bartlett Experimental Forest in north-central New Hampshire, USA, we compare the relative effects of pulsed food resources (beech mast), forest structure, and weather on the population dynamics of 5 rodents and 4 shrew species. We estimated detection-corrected abundances using Bayesian N-mixture models. Mast, forest structure, and weather all influenced abundance; however, responses varied among species, and no single variable proved to be broadly influential across all species. More generally, our results suggest that for most species analyzed, mast availability and weather patterns have a greater influence on abundance fluctuations than forest structure. However, our results suggest that species are not responding to changes in the environment in the same way. Given that small mammals are ubiquitous and serve key ecological roles, a better understanding of the drivers of small mammal population fluctuations could have broad-reaching implications for forest ecology and management.
   Understanding the factors that drive abundance fluctuations in animal populations is a central goal of ecology. Here, we utilized a long-term dataset to assess the relative impact of a pulsed food resource, weather patterns, and forest structure on small mammal abundance in a northern hardwood forest. For most species, food availability and weather had the strongest effect on abundance, though the magnitude and direction of the responses were not consistent across species.

AB  - Dirofilaria immitis and D. repens are the two most widespread and important species of mosquito-borne nematodes, posing a significant threat to veterinary health and particularly affecting canines and felines. While D. immitis causes cardiopulmonary dirofilariasis, D. repens causes subcutaneous infections in dogs and other carnivores. Despite the extensive knowledge on these parasites, little is known about their natural vectors in Serbia. The parasite Setaria tundra, known to infect deer, has not yet been detected in Serbia but has been documented in neighboring countries. Thus, the aim of this study was to (i) further map out Dirofilaria sp. hotspots in the Vojvodina Province and detect S. tundra for the first time, (ii) detect positive mosquito species that can provide insights into how the nematodes spread in Serbia, and (iii) analyze the blood-fed female mosquitoes of species found to be infected, in order to identify the potential source of parasite infection. A total of 2902 female mosquitoes were collected across 73 locations during 2021 and 2022. Molecular biology methods, based on conventional PCR, were used to analyze non-blood-fed (2521 specimens) and blood-fed (381 specimens) female mosquitos, in order to detect filarial nematode presence and identify blood-meal sources, respectively. When the parasite genome was detected, the amplicon (cox1 gene, 650 bp fragment) was sent for Sanger sequencing, further confirming the presence of nematodes and species assignation. D. immitis was detected in three Culex pipiens mosquitoes collected in Zrenjanin (August 2021) and Glogonj and Svetozar Mileti & cacute; (both in July 2021). Additionally, Setaria tundra was detected in Aedes vexans collected in I & dstrok;o & scaron; (mid-August 2021) and Aedes caspius, which was collected in Mali I & dstrok;o & scaron; (end of July 2021). This work identifies two new locations where D. immitis occurs in Vojvodina, and is the first report of S. tundra in Serbian territory. Blood-meal analysis provided insights into the preferences of mosquitoes that were positive for Dirofilaria sp. and S. tundra.

AB  - The rising demand for poultry products has resulted in increased chicken manure output and environmental pollution. Cultivation of black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) in chicken manure offers an effective method for composting chicken manure. This study investigates the impact of diverse carbon resources on carbon sequestration in larval biomass and excrement, with a focus on bioavailability rather than carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. Five distinct carbon resources were combined with chicken manure, i.e., glucose (CG), sugar (CS), corn flour (CCF), straw (CST), and wood (CW), with pure chicken manure (CK) as a control. These mixtures were inoculated with BSFL for conversion, maintaining consistent initial C/N ratios across all treatments. Results indicated that the CS treatment yielded the highest biomass conversion rate and carbon sequestration within larval bodies, rating to 14.48 f 0.21 % and 18.01 f 1.43 %, respectively. Analysis of humus composition in frass revealed that CG and CST treatments produced the highest concentration of humic acid (7.86 f 0.01 g/kg and 8.01 f 0.22 g/kg). The both treatments also exhibited superior humification degrees, as evidenced by PARAFAC analysis. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the presence of Labile Carbon Pool I(LCP1) enhances carbon sequestration capacity within larvae bodies by fostering associations between the relative abundance of Firmicutes and larvae growth. Moreover, LCP1 induced anaerobic conditions increase Euryarchaeota abundance, amplifying anaerobic digestion processes conducive to humus generation during BSFL composting of chicken manure. Our discovery refines conventional approaches to raw materials mixing in BSFL composting and elucidates mechanisms through which varied carbon bioavailability alters microbial community composition, facilitating carbon sequestration in both larvae bodies and frass.

AB  - Simple Summary: Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play an important role in the adaptation of animals to high-altitude hypoxia. In high-altitude indigenous species, variation in the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) gene has been reported in Tibetans, yaks and Tibetan horses, but has not been investigated in Tibetan sheep, and is not known if it might affect high-altitude hypoxia adaptation in these sheep. In this study, Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) was used for genotyping of ovine HIF-1 alpha and investigated the effect of variation in HIF-1 alpha on the high-altitude hypoxia adaptation of Tibetan sheep. The results suggest that ovine HIF-1 alpha variants may promote the ability of oxygen utilization in Tibetan sheep and it may serve as a genetic marker for improving high-altitude hypoxia adaptability.The Tibetan sheep is an indigenous species of the Tibetan plateau and has been well adapted to high-altitude hypoxia. In comparison to lowland sheep breeds, the blood gas indicators have changed and the HIFs signaling pathway is activated in Tibetan sheep. These phenotypic and genetic alterations in Tibetan sheep are thought to be an important basis for adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia and variation in genes encoding the subunits that make up HIFs, such as HIF-1 alpha can affect blood gas indicators. In this study, exons 9, 10, 12 of the HIF-1 alpha gene were sequenced to find variations and 3 SNPs were detected, and these 3 SNPs were genotyped by KASP in 341 Hu sheep and 391 Tibetan sheep. In addition, 197 Hu sheep, 160 Tibetan sheep and 12 Gansu alpine merino sheep were used for blood gas indicators analysis. The results showed significant differences between the blood gas indicators of high-altitude breeds (Tibetan sheep and Gansu alpine merino sheep) and low-altitude breeds (Hu sheep), implying that the differences in blood gas indicators are mainly caused by differences in altitude. The haplotype combinations H2H3 and H1H3 were more frequent in the Tibetan sheep population, H2H3 increases O-2 carrying capacity by increasing hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations; H1H3 makes O-2 dissociate more readily from oxyhemoglobin by decreasing partial pressure of oxygen and oxygen saturation. These results suggest that variants at the HIF-1 alpha promote the ability of oxygen utilization in Tibetan sheep, which may underpin the survival and reproduction of Tibetan sheep on the Tibetan plateau.

AB  - IntroductionAtlantic bluefin tuna (ABT) are large, migratory pelagic predators of high economic importance. ABT are currently managed as two independent stocks assigned to discrete spawning areas (Gulf of Mexico, and Mediterranean); however, stock overlap outside spawning areas makes accurate assignment of catch to stock-of-origin difficult. MethodsWithin this two-stock paradigm, we characterised stock-specific spatial distributions and behaviours by comparing habitat usage and vertical movement behaviours of 118 electronically tagged adult ABT spatially assigned to the GOM and Med spawning grounds. These spatial and behavioural differences were used in tests to probabilistically assign unknown individuals (which did not visit the GOM/Med spawning areas) to a stock. ResultsThis new methodological approach using existing tag data, enables increased assignment of a track to a potential stock, to be achieved before genetic assignments. We identified certain markedly different movement patterns, range extents, depth use preferences (and associated area usage), migration directness and speeds, corresponding distance from shore, and mesopelagic-layer visitation. The probabilistic assignment approach had 97% in-bag testing accuracy, then assigned 190 individuals to a stock, doubling the number of assigned stock-of-origin tracks in our dataset, and potentially revealing novel movement and behaviour patterns among pre-spawning-age ABT. DiscussionThis approach can be easily adapted to other study species, more stocks, and different testing variables, hopefully serving as a useful addition to the fisheries management toolkit.

AB  - 1. Each year, whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) aggregate in the northern Gulf of California at Bahia de los Angeles, a small coastal village that recently developed whale shark swimming as economic activity during the summer and autumn. Since the number of animals using the bay fluctuates annually, we aimed to predict it 1 month before each whale shark season. We based our modelling approach on the hypothesis that interannual warming conditions would spatially restrict whale shark habitats, triggering larger aggregations in areas that remain productive. 2. We photo--identified whale sharks while surface feeding in Bahia de los Angeles during a 13--year period, which allowed us to estimate a local abundance index per year through mark--recapture techniques. Then, we fitted these abundances as a function of several competing model structures, based on means of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll--a, as well as their interannual anomalies from the linear trend, during spring, within the best--known range of the species in the northern Gulf of California. 3. The results of the ecological model showed that whale sharks visit Bahia de los Angeles in larger numbers during extreme warming conditions, with relatively high surface chlorophyll--a concentrations, which was especially evident during the 2014--2016 northeast Pacific Marine Heatwave and El Nino. Presumably, the overall reduction in surface productivity associated with these events forced whale sharks to restrict their summer--autumn habitat to productivity hotspots, including Bahia de los Angeles. 4. Our model allowed us to predict the number of animals visiting the site before each season starts, which has crucial proactive management implications, such as allowing authorities to regulate the ecotourism effort dynamically to reduce the probability of ship strikes and/or excessive stress to the animals. We propose an abundance baseline from the prediction for neutral interannual conditions.5. Synthesis and applications. We recommend local authorities apply the model described in this study during the late spring of each year to obtain predictions of the upcoming whale shark abundance and establish the maximum ecotourism effort allowed accordingly.

AB  - Simple Summary The SOX6 (sex determining region Y-box 6) gene belongs to one of the transcription factors in the SRY (sex-determining region Y) family, which affects sex determination, embryonic and nervous system development, bone and various organ formation. In the previous study, the whole-genome sequencing was used to detect multiple genes located in the copy number variation region, including SOX6 gene. In this study, we identified the correlation between the growth traits and CNV of SOX6 in 311 Ashidan yaks. The results showed that SOX6-CNV was significantly correlated with the chest girth of the 6-months old yaks (p < 0.05) and 30-months yaks (p < 0.05), and withers height of 6 months yaks (p < 0.05) and 18-months yaks (p < 0.05), suggesting the SOX6-CNV affect growth traits in yaks, and could be new markers for the selection of yak breeding. Copy number variation (CNV) is a fundamental type of structural variation of the genome affecting the economic traits of livestock. The SOX6 gene (sex-determining region Y-box 6), as a transcription factor, has multiple functions with regard to sex determination, embryonic growth, the nervous system development, as well as bone, and various organ formation. This study employed quantitative real-time fluorescence quota PCR (qPCR) for detecting the SOX6-CNV of the 311 Ashidan yaks and analyzed the correlation of the SOX6-CNV with four phenotypes (including body weight, withers height, body length, and chest girth) of the yaks aged 6, 12, 18, and 30 months using ANOVA and multiple comparisons. Furthermore, the SOX6 gene expression was identified in seven different tissues of the yaks. The experiment results demonstrated the expression of SOX6 in each tissue, and the kidney and muscle tissue were found to have higher relative expression levels. Based on the processing by IBM SPSS software, SOX6-CNV was significantly correlated with the chest girth of the 6-months old yaks (p < 0.05) and 30-months yaks (p < 0.05), and withers height of 6 months yaks (p < 0.05) and 18-months yaks (p < 0.05), as well as the normal type of CNV, was chosen for yak breeding. In conclusion, SOX6 might be prominently involved in promoting growth and development of yaks, suggesting that the SOX6 gene can be used in breeding yaks by molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS). The study also offered some important insights into the references and clues for the genetic breeding of yaks.

AB  - Studies on positional behavior and canopy use are essential for understanding how arboreal animals adapt their morphological characteristics and behaviors to the challenges of their environment. This study explores canopy and substrate use along with positional behavior in adult black snub-nosed monkeys Rhinopithecus strykeri, an endemic, critically endangered primate species in Gaoligong Mountains, southwest China. Using continuous focal animal sampling, we collected data over a 52-month period and found that R. strykeri is highly arboreal primarily using the high layers of the forest canopy (15-30 m), along with the terminal zone of tree crowns (52.9%), medium substrates (41.5%), and oblique substrates (56.8%). We also found sex differences in canopy and substrate use. Females use the terminal zones (56.7% versus 40.4%), small/medium (77.7% versus 60.1%), and oblique (59.9% versus 46.5%) substrates significantly more than males. On the other hand, males spend more time on large/very large (39.9% versus 22.3%) and horizontal (49.7% versus 35.2%) substrates. Whereas both sexes mainly sit (84.7%), and stand quadrupedally (9.1%), males stand quadrupedally (11.5% versus 8.3%), and bipedally (2.9% versus 0.8%) more often than females. Clamber, quadrupedalism, and leap/drop are the main locomotor modes for both sexes. Rhinopithecus strykeri populations never enter canopies of degenerated secondary forest and mainly use terminal branches in the middle and upper layers of canopies in intact mid-montane moist evergreen broadleaf forest and hemlock coniferous broadleaf mixed forests across their habitat.

AB  - Changes in the social environment can induce severe effects on the physiology, productivity and welfare status of dairy animals. The regrouping of dairy ewes according to age, milk production and body condition score is a common practice in sheep farms; however, data concerning its effects on productive and behavioral traits are scarce. As shown in the present study, regrouping triggered an emotional distress in ewes, since the number of bleats, heart rate and flight distance were increased immediately after regrouping. Moreover, milk yield and fat were reduced, and milk oxidation rates and the number of kick responses during milking were increased. It can be concluded that the regrouping of dairy ewes could negatively influence productive and behavioral parameters until the reestablishment of social relationships.The regrouping of ruminants is a common practice in dairy farms and is targeting at the improvement of milk production efficiency. However, changing the established hierarchy in a group affects both productivity and behavioral attributes. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine the possible effects of regrouping on milk yield, composition and several behavioral indices in dairy ewes. The experimental period was divided into two sub-periods of 20 days each. During the first period, 30 Chios ewes were used, while 15 Chios and 15 Karagouniko ewes were mixed during the second period. Milk yield, composition, oxidative stability, flow rate and number of kick responses during milking were recorded for each ewe. An isolation-flight distance test was also performed on a weekly basis. As indicated, the parameters recorded during the behavioral tests, such as the number of bleats, heart rate and flight distance, and the milk oxidation rate and number of kick responses were significantly increased immediately after regrouping compared to the following days during both sub-periods (p < 0.05). Moreover, milk yield was reduced in the second sub-period by 8.61% (p < 0.05). It can be concluded that regrouping could negatively influence productive and behavioral traits, and the effect was more pronounced when sheep of different breeds were mixed.

AB  - Predation establishes risk, which can indirectly influence prey behavior and ecology. We evaluated the influence of Mexican gray wolves (Canis lupus baileyi) on habitat selection and spatiotemporal predator avoidance strategies of elk (Cervus canadensis). We fit 866 adult female elk with GPS collars across areas of varying wolf densities within the Mexican wolf experimental population area of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico between 2019-2021. Using step-selection functions we examined relative intensity of elk use in relation to landscape attributes, estimated predator/prey diel activity, and measures of risk. Risk metrics included predicted wolf presence, habitat openness, and predicted risky places modeled from attributes of locations where wolves killed elk. Wolf activity varied across seasons and increased midday and night in fall and monsoon seasons. Relative use by elk was best explained by incorporating an interaction between diel period and predicted risky places across all seasons. Elk utilized risky places more in times of nutritional deficit associated with high energetic demands of the third trimester pregnancy and lactation and when forage quality was best, during spring and monsoon season. Particularly, use of risky places increased at less risky times in areas with more established wolf presence, suggesting use of risky places varied relative to exposure to Mexican wolves. These behaviors highlight the importance of temporal avoidance when predators and prey are highly mobile and largely overlap in space. Our research suggests temporally responding to predictable and relatively static environmental characteristics associated with encounter and kill rates may better balance energetic trade-offs than anticipating changes in wolf activity or spatially avoiding areas with higher wolf presence. Thus, elk appear to be more willing to take chances and mitigate cursorial predation risk with a more immediate, reactive approach and make proactive trade-offs during the seasons they can best increase fitness.

AB  - The growing world population, combined with scarcities of agricultural land, water, forest, fisheries, and biodiversity resources, makes it necessary to search for alternative sources of nutrients. For this reason, in recent years, edible insects have been introduced into the diet, even in areas where entomophagy is not traditional. In light of this, the present study aims at characterizing the aromatic profile of three edible insects flours: cricket (Acheta domesticus, CP), buffalo worm (Alphitobius diaperinus, BW), and mealworm (Tenebrio molitor, MW). This goal has been achieved by means of an (HS)-SPME/GC-MS strategy. 67 compounds have been tentatively identified; of these, 27 are present only in the CP and BW flours, while 10 are common in all three flours. The compound with the highest peak's relative area in gas chromatograms of CP and BW flours is hexadecanoic acid, while in MW it is 1-heptylpyrrolidin-2-one. In general, we have observed that CP and BW flours have 37 compounds in common, and their volatile compositions along with their profiles are more similar to each other than to MW profile.

AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM), including PM2.5 in pig houses, has received increasing attention due to the potential health risks associated with PM. At present, most studies have analyzed PM2.5 in Chinese pig houses utilizing natural ventilation. These results, however, are strongly affected by the internal structure and regional environment, thus limiting their applicability to non-mechanically ventilated pig houses. This experiment was carried out in an environmentally controlled pig house. The animal feeding operation and manure management in the house were typical for Southwest China. To reduce the influence of various environmental factors on PM2.5, the temperature and humidity in the house were maintained in a relatively stable state by using an environmental control system. The concentration of PM2.5 in the pig house was monitored, while the biological contents and chemical composition of PM2.5 were analyzed, and feed, manure, and dust particles were scanned using an electron microscope. Moreover, bacterial and fungal contents and some water-soluble ions in PM2.5 were identified. The results showed that the concentration of PM2.5 in the pig house was strongly affected by pig activity, and a phenomenon of forming secondary particles in the pig house was found, although the transformation intensity was low. The concentration of PM2.5 had negative correlations of 0.27 and 0.18 with ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, respectively. Interestingly, a stronger correlation was observed between ammonia and hydrogen sulfide and ammonia and carbon dioxide concentrations (the concentration of ammonia had stronger positive correlations with hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide concentrations at +0.44 and +0.59, respectively). The main potential sources of PM2.5 production were feed and manure. We speculate that manure could contribute to the broken, rough, and angular particles that formed the pig house PM2.5 that easily adhered to other components.

AB  - Marine mammals adapt foraging strategies in response to human activities and environmental change, often resulting in conflicts with fisheries. Whale-fishery interactions, including depredation and entanglement, pose significant challenges for both marine conservation and fisheries management. This study presents the first comprehensive, multi-fishery analysis of marine mammal behaviour and gear-associated incidents using at-sea observer (ASO) records collected between 1990 and 2023 across Canada's North Atlantic. The final dataset comprised 5184 marine mammal sightings reported by ASOs across multiple fisheries. The aims were to: (1) assess the severity of incident records, ranging from close approaches, depredation, injury, entanglement, and death; (2) calculate the minimum frequency of sightings and incidents by gear type and target species; and (3) identify trends in depredation incidents across species and fisheries. Results reveal widespread depredation behaviour by deep-diving northern bottlenose (Hyperoodon ampullatus) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), particularly in Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) fisheries. Gillnets and bottom trawls were responsible for most entanglement incidents, with small odontocetes like harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) experiencing relatively higher rates of severe entanglement. Entanglement rates for endangered northern bottlenose whales exceeded limits considered sustainable under current recovery objectives. Minimum annual incident rates exceeded 3 observed events per year for long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) and 1.8 for harbour porpoises, across all reported sightings. Risks varied across regions, gear types, and species. These findings highlight the need for fishery-specific mitigation, spatial management, and expanded observer coverage to reduce harmful interactions and promote long-term coexistence between marine mammals and fishing operations.

AB  - Animal behavior diversity is a key element of biodiversity, and the establishment of an ethogram provides a crucial framework for exploring the relationship between behavioral patterns and environmental factors. However, the development of ethograms and the quantitative analysis of behavioral diversity in fish remain underexplored. In this study, focal animal sampling and instantaneous scan sampling methods, paired with the PAE (Posture-Act-Environment) coding system, were employed to investigate the ethogram and reproductive behavior diversity of silver carp. The findings revealed 12 postures, 20 actions, and 34 behaviors documented during the breeding period of silver carp. Analysis of reproductive behavior diversity revealed that the absolute behavioral diversity index (H), relative behavioral diversity index (r), and regulated diversity index (r-variable) all peaked during the 10-15 h interval following induced spawning. Notably, significant differences (p < 0.001) were observed in these indices across different post-induction time intervals and between sexes. Throughout the breeding cycle, females demonstrated lower diversity and intensity in reproductive behaviors compared to males, suggesting distinct reproductive strategies between the sexes. The reproductive behavior of silver carp exhibited distinct chronobiological disorganization patterns. This study provides a scientific basis for future research on the behavioral ecology of silver carp and the conservation of their wild populations.

AB  - Ant community is one of the soil biotic components with diverse roles, including pollinators, predators, decomposers, parasites, and herbivores. Changes in land use from natural habitats to plantations affect the diversity and composition of ants because these groups are very vulnerable to environmental changes. The purpose of the study was to analyze the diversity of ants (Formicidae) found in peatland planted with oil palm. The study was conducted on peatland in Gambut Jaya village, Sungai Gelam sub-district, Muaro Jambi district, Indonesia from October 2019 to May 2020. The research was conducted through surveys in two peatland locations (natural peatland and oil palm plantation) using the purposive sampling technique through the stages of transect making, field sampling, sample preparation, and identification. A total of 2636 individuals of ants were collected from natural peatland, while 3183 individuals were found in oil palm plantations. Eight ant species were identified from both study sites belong to four subfamilies, namely Dolichoderinae, Formicinae, Myrmicinae, and Ponerinae. Among the species, Dolichoderus thoracicus were most dominant, composed 63.6% in natural peat-land and 73.6% in oil palm plantation. The diversity index of ant species in natural peatland was higher (0.97) than that in oil palm plantations (0.88), indicate the change in the abundance and diversity of ant species in oil palm plantations. Therefore, efforts to preserve the habitat of ants by maintaining their microhabitat and resource, as well as conserving the important species such as natural enemies of pests, need to be taken into account in peatland management.

AB  - Amino acid geochronology can provide effective relative dating frameworks for the Pleistocene and has enabled correlation of terrestrial deposits to the global climatic fluctuations described by the marine oxygen isotope record. Using methods developed for the analysis of intra-crystalline amino acids in tooth enamel, we aimed to construct an enamel-based amino acid geochronology for the terrace deposits in the valley of the River Thames in southern Britain using different mammalian taxonomic groups: elephant, horse and bison. To achieve this, chiral amino acid analysis was applied to 58 elephantid, 21 horse and 15 bison teeth from 10 horizons in the Upper Thames Valley, three in the Lower Thames Valley and one from a Thames tributary in the Lea Valley. We evaluate differences in the rates of amino acid breakdown between the taxa and establish which species are similar enough to enable comparison for relative dating purposes. The relative dating of the river terrace deposits is in good agreement with the terrace stratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and other independent estimates of age for all three taxonomic groups. These frameworks demonstrate the potential of enamel-based amino acid geochronologies for relative dating of Middle-Late Pleistocene deposits in the UK, and establish an aminostratigraphic framework from which the dating of other tooth material can be refined. Enamel offers an opportunity to evaluate the age of sites where shell material is absent or poorly preserved. It can also, crucially, provide direct relative dating of mammalian fossils, which are often the focus of study in terms of their evolution, distributional changes or extinction. Direct dating negates the risk that the mammal fossils themselves might be reworked, or of different ages to shell, sediments or other dated material in the same deposits; it also enables archived samples with insecure provenance (e.g. from early 17th-19th century collections) to be directly dated.

AB  - The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has dramatically increased the global prevalence of depression. Unfortunately, antidepressant drugs benefit only a small minority of patients. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new interventions. Accumulating evidence supports a causal relationship between gut microbiota dysbiosis and depression. To advance microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics of depression, a comprehensive overview of microbial alterations in depression is presented to identify effector microbial biomarkers. This procedure generated 215 bacterial taxa from humans and 312 from animal models. Compared to controls, depression shows significant differences in beta-diversity, but no changes in microbial richness and diversity. Additionally, species-specific microbial changes are identified like increased Eggerthella in humans and decreased Acetatifactor in rodent models. Moreover, a disrupted microbiome balance and functional changes, characterized by an enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacteria (e.g., Desulfovibrio and Escherichia/Shigella) and depletion of anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium) are consistently shared across species. Confounding effects of geographical region, depression type, and intestinal segments are also investigated. Ultimately, a total of 178 species and subspecies probiotics are identified to alleviate the depressive phenotypes. Current findings provide a foundation for developing microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics and advancing microbiota-oriented precision medicine for depression.

AB  - To define the role of organic or inorganic fertilizers in the stability and sustainability of soil organic carbon (SOC) and crop yield, we examined changes in SOC and crop yield, as well as their correlation, in nine different fertilization treatments (sheep manure [M], sheep manure and urea [MN], sheep manure and diammonium phosphate [MP], sheep manure, urea, and diammonium phosphate [MNP], urea and diammonium phosphate [NP], urea and potassium sulfate [NK], diammonium phosphate and potassium sulfate [PK], diammonium phosphate, urea, and potassium sulfate [NPK], no fertilizer [CK]) from 2015 to 2018 on the Loess Plateau. The organic carbon content was higher in organic fertilizer (M, MNP, MP, MN) than in inorganic fertilizer treatments (NP, NPK, NK, PK) and the control. Crop yield was higher for organic than for inorganic fertilizers, whereas that of the control was always lower than those in the fertilization treatments. The highest crop yield was obtained in MNP. Crop yield and soil organic matter quality score correlated positively, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.5994 to 0.7151. Our results provide a theoretical basis for organic and inorganic fertilizer application in dry farming areas on the Loess Plateau and aid the long-term healthy development of soil in cultivated areas.

AB  - In order to improve the sensitivity of lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) for the detection of piscine vitellogenin (Vtg), a well-established biomarker for environmental estrogens, Au coated Ag nanoflowers (Ag@Au NFs) were used as labeling probes to develop a LFIA for marine medaka Vtg. The synthesized Ag@Au NFs with good monodispersity had an average diameter of 44.1 nm and absorbance peak of 524 nm. When the concentration of goat anti-mouse IgG and anti-Vtg polyclonal antibody (anti-Vtg PAbs) were 1.3 and 0.4 mg/mL, respectively, the detection range of the LFIA was 0.19-25 ng/mL, and the visual detection limit was 0.1 ng/mL, which was approximately 80 times lower than that of LFIAs based on other nanoparticles (Au NPs, Ag NPs, Au NFs, and FM). After evaluation of its specificity and robustness, the usefulness of Ag@Au NFs labeled LFIA was validated by measuring Vtg induction in the plasma of marine medaka exposed to bisphenol A, a weak estrogenic chemical. This highly sensitive lateral flow immunoassay could detect Vtg biomarker within 15 min without the need of expensive and complicated instruments, and thus offered an ultrasensitive and robust on-site detection method for estrogenic activity in field environment.

AB  - Quantifying the mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS), and the resulting sea level rise, requires an understanding of inter-annual variability and associated causal mechanisms. Very few studies have been exploring the influence of climate anomalies on the AIS and only a vague estimate of its impact is available. Changes to the ice sheet are quantified using observations from space-borne altimetry and gravimetry missions. We use data from Envisat (2002 to 2010) and Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) (2002 to 2016) missions to estimate monthly elevation changes and mass changes, respectively. Similar estimates of the changes are made using weather variables (surface mass balance (SMB) and temperature) from a regional climate model (RACMO2.3p2) as inputs to a firn compaction (FC) model. Elevation changes estimated from different techniques are in good agreement with each other across the AIS especially in West Antarctica, Antarctic Peninsula, and along the coasts of East Antarctica. Inter-annual height change patterns are then extracted using for the first time an empirical mode decomposition followed by a principal component analysis to investigate for influences of climate anomalies on the AIS. Investigating the inter-annual signals in these regions revealed a sub-4-year periodic signal in the height change patterns. El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a climate anomaly that alters, among other parameters, moisture transport, sea surface temperature, precipitation, in and around the AIS at similar frequency by alternating between warm and cold conditions. This periodic behavior in the height change patterns is altered in the Antarctic Pacific (AP) sector, possibly by the influence of multiple climate drivers, like the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Height change anomaly also appears to traverse eastwards from Coats Land to Pine Island Glacier (PIG) regions passing through Dronning Maud Land (DML) and Wilkes Land (WL) in 6 to 8 years. This is indicative of climate anomaly traversal due to the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave (ACW). Altogether, inter-annual variability in the SMB of the AIS is found to be modulated by multiple competing climate anomalies.

AB  - Lucilia cuprina is a vector of important diseases in humans and animals that causes myiasis in sheep, leading to enormous damage to the sheep sector. Chemical products are used to control these flies; however, there are reports of resistance in addition to these products causing toxicity to the environment, humans, and animals, so alternative controls have been studied to reduce these impacts. Pleurotus spp. are basidiomycete fungi and present bioactive compounds with medicinal properties. Due to the potential use of fungi to control Diptera, this study aimed to verify the activity of Pleurotus florida, P. ostreatus, and P. djamor in the control of larvae and adults of L. cuprina, as well as the effects of aqueous extracts of the fungi P. ostreatus, P. djamor, and P. florida on larvae and adults of L. cuprina. The aqueous extract from P. florida was the only one that showed larvicidal activity against L. cuprina, with a half-maximal effective concentration of 11.42 mg/mL. In the test with adult stages, 30 insects were used for each solution concentration, sprinkled with 1 mL of the solution. All aqueous extracts showed adulticidal activity at all concentrations, P. ostreatus showing the best results, with adult mortality ranging from 75.86 to 100%. Our results demonstrated an important larvicidal effect of P. florida and an adulticidal effect of all AE, with emphasis on P. ostreatus.

AB  - The swine gastrointestinal tract contains a great variety of microbes, forming a complex and dynamic ecosystem. Various internal and external factors (e.g. age, breed and diet) may influence its composition. This study aimed to investigate the gut microbial diversity of German Pi & eacute;train boars housed on different deep-litter bedding materials (regional wood shavings, linen, hemp, spelt husks, and wood shavings) via 16S-rDNA sequencing. Additionally, short-chain fatty acids were analysed using gas chromatography. Fresh faecal samples (n = 80) from 40 Pi & eacute;train boars were collected twice during the trial. Although it can be assumed that boars ingest bedding orally, no differences in the microbiome composition could be found. The main phyla were Firmicutes and Bacteroides. Acinetobacter was identified as a biomarker for sperm quality differences (total sperm motility) in breeding boars.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of partially replacing fish meal with krill and copepod meals in inert diets co-fed with shrimp on the growth and nutrient digestibility of long-snout seahorses (Hippocampus guttulatus). A control diet (Diet 1) using raw starch and four experimental diets with similar protein (approximate to 44.8%) and energy (approximate to 15.1 MJ/kg) levels were tested. Diet 2 used fish meal as the sole protein source, while in Diets 3-5, krill and copepod meals replaced 44% of the fish meal. Seahorses fed shrimp + Diets 2-5 showed significantly higher growth rates (p < 0.05) than those fed shrimp + Diet 1, though there were no significant growth differences among Diets 2-5. Digestibility of dry matter (46.1% to 72.2%), lipids (73.3% to 85.5%), crude protein (89.8% to 95.8%), energy (82% to 92.2%), and phosphorus (28.7% to 64.4%) varied with diet, being consistently lower in seahorses fed shrimp + Diet 1. As an agastric species, H. guttulatus did not exhibit impaired digestibility for any of the tested nutrients, minerals, or energy. This study suggests that crustacean meals can effectively substitute fish meal in inert diets for this species, contributing to the sustainability and optimization of captive seahorse husbandry practices.

AB  - Numerous tropical macroalgae provide associational refuge to other benthic organisms, presumably due to their physical structure and/or production of chemical metabolites. One feature determining their effectiveness as an associational refuge is likely to be the size of the organism benefitting from the refuge. Using a manipulative experiment in the back reef of Moorea, French Polynesia, we tested if the macroalga Turbinaria ornata provided an associational refuge from fish corallivores for small colonies of massive Porites spp., and how this differed with colony size (20-100 mm diameter). Tissue loss through corallivory increased with colony size but was similar to 72% less for Porites colonies associated with T. ornata versus colonies separated from this macroalga, while dense macroalgae beds on contemporary reefs negatively impact the recruitment, growth and survival of corals, small colonies of Porites appear to benefit, through reduced corallivory, by associating with the macroalga Turbinaria. This association may come at a cost (e.g., reduced growth) and should be the focus of future research.

AB  - The Patagonian slope is the region where Subantarctic waters and bathymetry give raise to physical and ecological processes that support a rich biodiversity and a large-scale industrial fisheries. Unique among the species that depend on this region is the deep diving southern elephant seal, Mirounga leonina. We report here on changes in the foraging behavior of a female seal explained by the combined effect of a cold and high salinity water mass and a decrease in surface chlorophyll-a concentration. Behavioral and oceanographic data from about 5000 profiles of temperature, conductivity, pressure, light and prey encounters were collected within an area ranging 59.5-61 degrees W and 46-47.5 degrees S, at depths of 300-700 m, on the Patagonian slope, during November-December 2018. A decrease in temperature (0.15 degrees C) and an increase in salinity (0.03) was found below the mixed layer, during December. Light data revealed a significant increase of irradiance in December (almost reaching the ocean bottom) associated with a decrease of chlorophyll-a in the upper levels. Concomitantly, the seal had a different diving behavior in December, foraging near the surface at night and close to the bottom during daylight hours. Also, the seal doubled the prey capture attempts in December compared to November. This study reveals the importance of ocean physical properties on seal's diving and foraging behavior, and how this changes, although small, can impact on seals diet and body composition during their post-breeding trips.

AB  - Oil palm, with its wide spacing and broad canopy, has the potential to be intercropped with crops that are adapted to shaded conditions. Porang (Amorphophallus onchophyllus Prain ex Hook. f.) is a type of plant that requires shade to grow well. Porang is known as an alternative food crop with a low glycemic index and is included in the healthy food group. This study aims to test the growth of porang in 3 groups of oil palm stands of different ages-3 years, 6 years and 9 years-and compared it with nonshaded conditions as a control. This research was designed as a field experiment using a Completely Randomised Design. The results showed that the growth of porang plants was influenced by shade, with the shade provided by 6-year-old oil palms (N2) and 9-year-old (N3) creating an ideal growing environment. This was indicated by parameters such as plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves and canopy width, which tended to be better. Similarly, nutrient uptake indicators, consisting of C, N, P and K elements, also indicated higher nutrient absorption compared to 3-year old shade (N1) and non-shaded conditions used as a control. The findings demonstrate that the presence of shade from 6 years (N2) and 9 years (N3) oil palm trees fosters an optimal growing environment for porang cultivation.

AB  - Leaf-cutter ants are appreciated as ecosystem engineers. Conversely, under agricultural scenarios, they are considered serious pests. Coffee is one of the crops selectively foraged by this species either under traditional shading or unshaded intensified systems. Despite the economic importance of coffee in Neotropical regions, there are few observational field studies on the impact of leaf-cutter ants on coffee plantation soils and how impact may differ in response to shade management. Three hypotheses were tested in coffee plantations in presence of Atta cephalotes: (1) bioturbation activity by leaf-cutter ants depends on the soil properties, which in turn, are affected by agronomic management of the coffee plantations; (2) a relatively higher concentration of resources (i. e., coffee plants) results in greater leaf-cutter ant activity in unshaded plantations than in shaded plantations; and (3) the effect of ant defoliation on fruit production depends on the level of foliar damage. Ten active ant nests were selected from each management system in ten farm plots. Soil samples were collected from nests and from outside the nests (control), physical, chemical and biological properties were analysed, and leaf-cutter ant herbivory was also assessed. No significant differences in microbial activity, evaluated through respiration, were found between nest and control soils. Nest soils had higher and lower percentages of sand and silt, respectively, than the control soils. Nest soils contained significantly higher amounts of sulphur, regardless of shade management. A. cephalotes translocated mineral soils and improved water infiltration in nest soils. The herbivory index and proportion of damage were greater in unshaded coffee, although fruit production tended to increase, possibly due to a compensatory effect as coffee plants responded to low levels of foliar damage. Therefore, the first hypothesis was only partially supported since bioturbation depended on soil properties, and certain soil properties were affected by coffee management, while the second and third hypotheses were supported by the data, suggesting that leaf-cutter ants differentially affect coffee plantations based on their shade management and on the moment the coffee plants are affected. Our results form the basis for the development of future studies that evaluate production impacts and economic damage in coffee varieties by leaf-cutter ants. Depending on the ecological context of the agroecosystem and management practices used, leaf-cutter ants can have positive or negative impacts for coffee production.

AB  - The colony of southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) at Pen & iacute;nsula Vald & eacute;s (Argentina) grew by 0.9% from 2000 to 2022, reaching a population of 18,000 reproductive females. In 2023, an epidemic of the High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza H5N1 virus led to the death of almost all pups and an unknown number of adults. We tested five scenarios that included complete pup mortality along with varying levels of adult mortality and reduced fertility. Newborn mortality had the smallest impact on the future population due to high natural mortality. Consequences of pup deaths will not appear until 2027, when those lost pups would have first reproduced. Scenarios including mature female mortality had more severe and immediate consequences, with a reduction in the breeding population in 2024 predicted to match the flu death rate. It took about 10 years for the population to readjust to the 2022 age distribution. In scenarios including adult mortality, it will take decades for the population to return to the 2022 level. The 2023 epidemic may thus reverse the conservation status of a population previously having no threats to continued growth.

AB  - Simple Summary Cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal, can extensively pollute the environment after long-term accumulation in the natural environment. After Cd is absorbed by the human body through the food chain, it can also bring great harm to human health. In this study, goats were taken as the research object to study the key pathways and potential therapeutic targets of Cd metabolism to ultimately provide technical support for the prevention and treatment of Cd exposure.Abstract Food safety and environmental pollution are the hotspots of general concern globally. Notably, long-term accumulation of trace toxic heavy metals, such as cadmium (Cd), in animals may endanger human health via the food chain. The mechanism of Cd toxicity in the goat, a popular farmed animal, has not been extensively investigated to date. Therefore, in this study, ten male goats (Nubian black goat x native black goat) were exposed to Cd via drinking water containing CdCl2 (20 mg Cd & BULL;kg-1 & BULL;BW) for 30 days (five male goats per group). In this study, we used an integrated approach combining proteomics and metabolomics to profile proteins and metabolites in the serum of Cd-exposed goats. It was found that Cd exposure impacted the levels of 30 serum metabolites and 108 proteins. The combined proteomic and metabolomic analysis revealed that Cd exposure affected arginine and proline metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, and glutathione metabolism. Further, antioxidant capacity in the serum of goats exposed to Cd was reduced. We identified CKM and spermidine as potential protein and metabolic markers, respectively, of early Cd toxicity in the goat. This study details approaches for the early diagnosis and prevention of Cd-poisoned goats.

AB  - Blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) is an important herbivorous freshwater economic fish cultivated in China. Its economic value has been affected by the existence of intermuscular bones (IBs). Our previous study proved that runx2b is the key gene for the IBs formation, and lack of runx2b gene could obtain a stable zebrafish mutant without IBs. We found runx2b mutant F0 generation of blunt snout bream through CRISPR/Cas9 editing technology had a significant reduction on the number of IBs. In order to further obtain the blunt snout bream without IBs, we used the runx2b mutant F0 generation to self-bred to obtain F1 generation. Subsequently, the 35 runx2b mutant F1 individuals of blunt snout bream without IBs were genotyped and found the number of runx2b targeting sites 1, 2 and 3 obtained 3 (1 insertion, 2 deletion), 13 (8 insertion, 5 deletion) and 7 (1 insertion, 6 deletion) mutation types with the mutation efficiency being 25.71%, 94.28%, and 71.43%, respectively. Alizarin red bone staining and X-ray scan analysis showed that IBs were not existed in runx2b mutant F1 individuals, and micro-CT analysis found that the mineralization of other bone in runx2b mutant was not significantly affected compared to wild type fish (P > 0.05). RT-qPCR results also exhibited that bone-related genes had a lower expression level in runx2b mutants compared to wild type fish. Subsequently, we used the national standard methods to detect nutrition composition of muscle tissue in wild type (with IBs) and runx2b mutant F1 individuals (without IBs) at 120 dpf. The results showed that the basic muscle nutritional composition (moisture, crude protein, crude lipid and crude ash), and the contents of most amino acids and fatty acids had no significant differences between wild and runx2b mutant at juvenile stage (P > 0.05). This study proves that the runx2b gene has an essential role for IBs formation in aquaculture species and lays an important foundation for obtaining a new blunt snout bream strain without IBs, which provides a good example for the application of IBs-free characters from model fish to commercial fish.

AB  - Inappropriate afforestation has caused severe soil desiccation and ecosystem degradation on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) due to poor knowledge of plants' water uptake patterns along the aridity gradient. In this study, the spatiotemporal difference of water uptake patterns by dominant afforestation species of tree (Robinia pseudoacacia), shrubs (e.g., Hippophae rhamnoides, Caragana microphylla, and Artemisia Ordosica) and natural grasses are explored by stable isotopes (S13C, S2H and S18O). Results from the MixSIAR model showed that water uptake fractions from various soil layers changed from low to middle to high precipitation sites in the drier (2015) and wetter year (2016). The afforested shrubs derived the highest proportions of deep soil water at the low precipitation (LP) site, however, their root uptake depth remarkably shifted towards the shallow soil layers at the high precipitation (HP) site in 2015. In contrast, shallow soil water gradually became a dominant water source for tree and shrubs because of its higher shallow water availability during 2016. This changed root water uptake depth, indicating that the tested afforested tree and shrubs had a plastic ability to adapt their water uptake patterns in variable environments. In addition, results also showed natural grasses predominantly depended on the shallow soil water on the CLP despite the drier and wetter year. We observed significant differences in the relationship between S13C values in the leaves of trees, shrubs, and grasses and annual precipitation. Specifically, the leaf carbon isotope (S13C) values indicated that the tested trees and shrubs had a higher intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) for leaf-level water efficiency than grasses, implying that trees and shrubs presented a competitive advantage on water use over grasses on the CLP. This study also improved our understanding of spatial water usage strategies on CLP plantation species, which is essential to guide future selection of further plantation species selections and management in similar regions.

AB  - In the southeastern United States, biting midges transmit agents of hemorrhagic diseases that are enzootic among white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann), Artiodactyla: Cervidae). Culicoides sonorensis Wirth and Jones (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), the only confirmed vector of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) and bluetongue virus (BTV) in the United States, is rarely collected in the Southeast, implying that other Culicoides Latreille species act as vectors. Despite multiple surveillance studies, the influence of trapping habitat and light wavelength on Culicoides sampling has yet to be investigated in Alabama. This study sampled Culicoides species at a deer research facility using CO2-baited CDC light traps with three distinct wavelengths. Traps were rotated within three habitats to examine impacts of habitat type and light wavelength on Culicoides abundance and parity status. For most species, midges were more abundant in a pine forest compared to a hardwood-forest riparian zone or a lightly wooded area adjacent to a seasonal pond. The pine forest generally had negative effects on parity status, suggesting that most females in this habitat were foraging for their first bloodmeal. Ultraviolet (UV) black-light (350 nm-360 nm) attracted more midges than incandescent light or UV LED light (385 nm-395 nm), but wavelength had less of an effect on parity than habitat. This study indicates that light wavelength and habitat significantly influence Culicoides sampling outcomes, and that when collecting parous females is desired (e.g., EHDV/BTV surveillance), targeting areas around oviposition sites may be a better strategy than trapping where midges are most abundant.

AB  - Concentrations of seven polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and twelve polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were examined in plankton collected in summer from different Arctic fjords (Hornsund, Kongsfjorden, Adventfjorden). The levels of all target contaminants in arctic protists have been analyzed for the first time. This is also the first report on PAH levels in arctic fjords zooplankton. Sigma 7 PCB, HCB and Sigma 12 PAH concentrations were up to 3.58 ng/g w.w., 0.28 ng/g w.w. and 249 ng/g w.w., respectively. Among the zooplankton species, the highest concentrations of the most analyzed contaminants were detected in Themisto abyssorum. This could be explained by the predatory feeding strategy of this species. The importance of diet was confirmed by the low concentrations of contaminants detected in the herbivorous copepod Calanus spp. Depending on contaminant, bioaccumulation occurred in 50 to 100% studied cases. Studies have shown significant biomagnification of PCBs and PAHs in zooplankton predator-prey pairs.

AB  - Background: Microbial exposures in early childhood direct the development of the immune system and their diversity may influence the risk of allergy development. We aimed to determine whether the indoor microbial diversity at early-life is associated with the development of allergic rhinitis and inhalant atopy.
   Methods: The study population included children within two birth cohorts: Finnish rural-suburban LUKAS (N = 312), and German urban LISA from Munich and Leipzig study centers (N = 248). The indoor microbiota diversity (Chao1 richness and Shannon entropy) was characterized from floor dust samples collected at the child age of 2?3 months by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of bacterial and fungal DNA amplicons. Allergic rhinitis and inhalant atopy were determined at the age of 10 years and analyzed using logistic regression models.
   Results: High bacterial richness (aOR 0.19, 95%CI 0.09?0.42 for middle and aOR 0.12, 95%CI 0.05?0.29 for highest vs. lowest tertile) and Shannon entropy were associated with lower risk of allergic rhinitis in LISA, and similar trend was seen in LUKAS. We observed some significant associations between bacterial and fungal diversity measured and the risk of inhalant atopy, but the associations were inconsistent between the two cohorts. High bacterial diversity tended to be associated with increased risk of inhalant atopy in rural areas, but lower risk in more urban areas. Fungal diversity tended to be associated with increased risk of inhalant atopy only in LISA.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that a higher bacterial diversity may reduce the risk of allergic rhinitis later in childhood. The environment-dependent heterogeneity in the associations with inhalant atopy ? visible here as inconsistent results between two differing cohorts - suggests that specific constituents of the diversity may be relevant.

AB  - The taxonomy of the family Mugilidae has historically posed challenges, marked by discrepancies between described and valid species, compounded by cryptic diversity and a similar external appearance. Previous studies left four of six lineages unidentified within Crenimugil, including Crenimugil sp. A and Crenimugil sp. B. The goal of this study is to provide a detailed revision of species assigned to Crenimugil by examining specimens from the Red Sea, which is the type locality of Mugil crenilabis, Mugil seheli and Mugil tade, which were here genetically analyzed. After demonstrating that the genus contains nine monophyletic lineages and Moolgarda pura is a valid nominal species, the mugilid genus Moolgarda is restored. Consequently, Moolgarda has priority over Crenimugil and Valamugil. Additional morphological analyses of specimens from the Red Sea assigned to Moolgarda sp. A and Moolgarda sp. B identified them as representing Moolgarda seheli and Moolgarda crenilabis, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis, including new DNA barcodes, confirmed a wide distribution range of both species in the Indo-West Pacific. The identity of the lineage previously identified as Crenimugil crenilabis remains doubtful, and it is referred to as Moolgarda cf. crenilabis here. A third lineage, previously named Crenimugil buchanani, is re-described as Moolgarda tade, a species originally reported from the Red Sea with a long history of taxonomic confusion. The species is widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific and distinguished from other congeners by falcate second dorsal and anal fins that are distinctly higher than the first dorsal fin. A detailed description of the Red Sea specimens of M. crenilabis, M. seheli and M. tade is provided, with comments to other unnamed lineages.

AB  - The Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana) is a rare and endangered primate species endemic to China. Conducting research on the population distribution changes of the Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkey holds paramount importance for its conservation. Our study represented a comprehensive investigation into the population distribution of the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey by integrating data acquired from field surveys, protected areas, and historical records and using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to explore changes in distribution across various time periods, including the historical (the Mid-to-Late Pleistocene), recent (1980-2000), and current (2001-2023). The research findings demonstrate a significant shift in the distribution range of the Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkey compared to historical time frames. Notably, between 1980 and 2000, there was a sharp decline in distribution area. Analyses revealed that the southernmost distribution county for the Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkey in Sichuan Province has shifted northward from Huili to Kangding. Furthermore, distribution changes in Sichuan Province are not solely characterized by a reduction in habitat area but also by a decrease in vertical distribution zones. Regions in the northeastern part of Sichuan with elevations below 1000 m, such as Guang'an City, Bazhong City, Dazhou City, and Nanchong City, no longer support the presence of the Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkey. At present, the distribution range is confined to elevations between 1000 and 4000 m in the two major mountain ranges of Qionglai and Minshan. A holistic approach is required to safeguard this species. The establishment of movement corridors can play a critical role in enhancing the overall connectivity of current distribution areas. Additionally, we propose implementing a hierarchical approach to protect current habitats. Spatially differentiated conservation measures should be implemented to prioritize the protection of key habitats while simultaneously monitoring anthropogenic activities in non-key habitats to prevent further fragmentation and isolation of the monkey's distribution areas.

AB  - We analyzed the stomach contents of wild boars (Sus savfa) inhabiting evergreen forests in western Japan and found that they were dependent on the masting of acorns of Caslanopsis cuspidala. The increased availability of C. cuspidata acorns positively affected their consumption by wild boars. In the good mast years, wild boars consumed C. cuspidata acorns from November to June of the following year. No significant annual variation in body condition was detected, suggesting that alternative food resources (e.g., bamboo shoots) may have maintained the body condition of wild boars, even in poor mast years. A strong negative correlation was found between the consumption of C. cuspidata acorns and the amount of crop damage to vegetables. This study revealed the wild boar as a pulsed food resource feeder, which has not yet been identified in Japan, and emphasized the importance of considering C. cuspidala masting for designing effective strategies for mitigating crop damage.

AB  - Telomere length (TL) is a biomarker hypothesized to capture evolutionarily and ecologically important physiological costs of reproduction, infection and immunity. Few studies have estimated the relationships among infection status, immunity, TL and fitness in natural systems. The hypothesis that short telomeres predict reduced survival because they reflect costly consequences of infection and immune investment remains largely untested. Using longitudinal data from a free-living Soay sheep population, we tested whether leucocyte TL was predicted by infection with nematode parasites and antibody levels against those parasites. Helminth parasite burdens were positively associated with leucocyte TL in both lambs and adults, which is not consistent with TL reflecting infection costs. We found no association between TL and helminth-specific IgG levels in either young or old individuals which suggests TL does not reflect costs of an activated immune response or immunosenescence. Furthermore, we found no support for TL acting as a mediator of trade-offs between infection, immunity and subsequent survival in the wild. Our results suggest that while variation in TL could reflect short-term variation in resource investment or environmental conditions, it does not capture costs of infection and immunity, nor does it behave like a marker of an individual's helminth-specific antibody immune response.

AB  - Every year, mountain pastures show a progressive impoverishment of forage. The loss in grassland feed value restricts the production period of local Pecorino cheeses, which strongly depend on the vegetative cycle of the pasture linked to climatic conditions. The Monte Fietone mountain area (Macerata, Italy) has emblematic pasture flora during spring and early summer. This unique environment is normally used for rearing sheep, allowing regular production of local Pecorino cheeses from their milk, which is rich in vitamins and intrinsic floral aromas. Biologists and agronomists are giving increasing importance to these mountain food products. We conducted sensorial tests and experimental auctions to investigate recognition of the quality of this rare artisanal product. The results indicate considerable potential for economic differentiation. Accordingly, we recommend useful and applicable marketing and policy actions to support the sustainability of mountain grazing systems.

AB  - The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is currently the largest known representative of the Rodentia order. It is an important herbivorous animal from the zootechnical point of view, found in different countries in South America, mainly in Brazil, where it can be found in all its States. The study of the anatomy of the lumbosacral plexus and medullary cone of the species could contribute to the development of comparative anatomy, and to adoption of future clinical and surgical procedures in the species. The present study proposed to conduct an exploration of the nerves of the lumbosacral plexus in capybara to highlight their relationship with the adjacent muscle tissues. Four adult capybaras, two males and two females, were used for dissection of the muscles innervated by the nerves that make up the lumbosacral plexus. The results allowed to verify that the lumbosacral plexus is formed by ventral roots originating in the six lumbar vertebrae and the three sacral vertebrae. The medullary cone was found between L6 and S1 in the sixth lumbar vertebra (L6) and the first sacral vertebra (S1). The identification and the recognition of these nerves in capybaras are important to improve the assessment of possible injuries caused by inadequate management, accidental mechanical shocks, or peripheral nervous system disorders. Additionally, the study included the topographic analysis of the medullary cone, essential for improving the anesthetic techniques by epidural route. The expansion of this type of research with capybaras can be useful for developing management techniques that preserve the species health and well-being.

AB  - Copepods are the dominant marine zooplankton and perform important functions in the marine food web. However, copepod traits have not been studied in many waters. We studied the copepod community under influence of the Mekong River and the Southern Vietnamese coastal upwelling, based on their functional traits, during the southwest monsoon period in 2016. Fourteen trait categories of four key functional traits (trophic-groups, feeding-types, reproductive-strategies and diel migration) of copepod data were analyzed to investigate how environmental gradients impact on their distribution and abundance among the four defined habitats: Mekong River (MKW), upwelling (UpW), nearshore (OnSW) and offshore waters (OSW). There were seven functional groups identified in the study waters based on multiple correspondence analysis of distribution, abundance and traits of 139 copepod species. Herbivorous, current-feeding and sac-spawning copepods were dominant in all habitats with the highest abundance in OSW. Specifically, herbivorous species dominated in MKW and UpW, whereas omnivorous species dominated in OnSW and OSW. Sac-spawners dominated in all habitats, but decreased from MKW and UpW to OnSW and lowest in OSW. Cruise feeders were 2-fold higher than ambush feeders in the UpW, but the opposite was observed in the other habitats. The results suggest that impacts of Mekong River and coastal upwelling led to distinctive copepod assemblages with specific functional traits.

AB  - New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri) are expanding in numbers and distribution throughout New Zealand. The exception is the West Coast of the South Island, where there is documented decline due to decades of mortalities related to fishery. There are fur seal colonies south of these West Coast colonies, in Fiordland, which have never been accurately documented or monitored. Even for those that are documented, there are few records of pup numbers and no population estimates. Here, pups at colonies from Doubtful/Patea, Dusky, and Breaksea Sound, and Chalky Inlet were observed, and their numbers either counted directly or estimated using mark-recapture methods in February 2021. From these pup counts a coarse minimum population estimate of between 14-24 thousand fur seals is calculated for lower Fiordland. The pup counts and population estimates indicated the fur seal numbers are higher than previously recorded from estimates of walk through, boat or helicopter observations. During onshore surveys and from anecdotal evidence, it was noted that fur seals were rearing pups in forested areas. This paper outlines suggestions for the future monitoring of these colonies given, location, diverse geology and the difficulty of monitoring colonies on exposed west coast areas of New Zealand's Fiordland.

AB  - The host response of 17 cover crop cultivars to infection by single-species populations of Pratylenchus hippeastri, Pratylenchus vulnus and Pratylenchus penetrans, the three most common root-lesion nematode species in apple orchards in South Africa (SA), was evaluated under glasshouse conditions. Reproduction of the three Pratylenchus species was assessed 12 weeks after infection of the cover crop plants based on the reproductive potential (RF) and their (relative) susceptibility compared with the most susceptible control plant included in the experiment. Most of the cover crop cultivars (12 out of 17) were poor hosts of all three Pratylenchus species: brown mustard 'Caliente 199', white mustard 'Braco', canola/rapeseed 'Garnet', tillage radish 'Groundhog', barrel medics 'Jester', ribwort plantain 'Captain', creeping fescue (cultivar unknown), black oats 'SAIA', perennial ryegrass 'Champion blend', tall fescue 'Speedway', triticale 'Korog' and french marigold 'Naughty Marietta'. These 12 cover crop cultivars did not support reproduction of P. hippeastri, P. vulnus and P. penetrans, and have thus the potential to limit the build-up of large, damaging populations of these three root-lesion nematode species. Five out of the 17 cover crop cultivars were identified as good hosts of one or more of the three Pratylenchus species: pink serradella 'Margarita' and subterranean clover 'Aarbei Klawer' were good hosts of P. penetrans only; rye 'Duiker Max' was a good host of both P. hippeastri and P. penetrans; Indian buckwheat (cultivar unknown) and garden nasturtium 'Jewel Choice mix' were good hosts of all three Pratylenchus species. These five cover crop cultivars have thus the potential to enable the build-up of large damaging populations of either one, two or three of the root-lesion nematode species and may act as primary sources of infection of apple roots. Their use as cover crops in apple orchards infested with root-lesion nematodes should be avoided.

AB  - Previous data on Estonian louse flies (Diptera, Hippoboscidae) are dispersed across various, mainly local scientific articles and popular science writings, making them inaccessible to a broader international audience. No comprehensive species list or reviews are currently available. This study consolidates data from published sources, insect collections, and newly collected specimens to provide a comprehensive species list, supplemented with voucher specimen information. In total, nine species are confirmed to occur in Estonia, including two species, Ornithomya chloropus (Bergroth, 1901) and O. fringillina Curtis, 1836, recorded for the first time. Two species associated with livestock, Hippobosca equina Linnaeus, 1758 and Melophagus ovinus (Linnaeus, 1758), have been rarely encountered and are apparently nearing local extinction due to the increased use of effective insecticides and a decline in farming. Collection locality maps and habitus photographs from collected specimens are provided for all nine Estonian species.

AB  - We investigated the possibility of single-step genome editing in small ruminants by CRISPR-Cas9 zygote electroporation. We targeted SOCS2 and PDX1 in sheep embryos and OTX2 in goat embryos, utilizing a dual sgRNA approach. Gene editing efficiency was compared between microinjection and three different electroporation settings performed at four different times of embryo development. Electroporation of sheep zygotes 6 h after fertilization with settings that included short high-voltage (poring) and long low-voltage (transfer) pulses was efficient at producing SOCS2 knock-out blastocysts. The mutation rate after CRISPR/Cas9 electroporation was 95.6% +/- 8%, including 95.4% +/- 9% biallelic mutations; which compared favorably to 82.3% +/- 8% and 25% +/- 10%, respectively, when using microinjection. We also successfully disrupted the PDX1 gene in sheep and the OTX2 gene in goat embryos. The biallelic mutation rate was 81 +/- 5% for PDX1 and 85% +/- 6% for OTX2. In conclusion, using single-step CRISPR-Cas9 zygote electroporation, we successfully introduced biallelic deletions in the genome of small ruminant embryos.

AB  - Activity patterns and time budgets play a crucial role in the successful farming and management of animals. In this study, the behavior patterns of 53 forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) were analyzed from October 2nd to 16th, 2021, throughout the day and night. The results showed a distinct dawn-dusk activity rhythm in the captive forest musk deer with a peak activity observed at dawn (07:00 - 10:00) and dusk (16:00 - 19:00). Additionally, there were smaller activity peaks lasting less than an hour during the nighttime (00:00 - 04:00). Comparing behavior ratios between peak and off-peak periods, it was evident that all behaviors, except rumination (RU), showed significant differences. Furthermore, no significant differences were found in the behavior ratios of the forest musk deer between the daytime and night-time. During the daytime, the percentages of time spent performing locomotion (32.87 +/- 3.38%), feeding (14.43 +/- 1.81%), and RU (5.62 +/- 1.46%) were slightly higher compared to the nighttime. Based on these findings, it is important to match the management strategies for musk deer farming with the animals' activity patterns and behavioral rhythms. Doing so can enhance farming outputs and contribute to the welfare of captive forest musk deer.

AB  - To effectively contribute to climate change mitigation, agronomists are increasingly focused on minimizing the application of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides while ensuring that crop yield and quality are not compromised. Plant biomass and organic fertilizers are known to improve soil quality, boost plant growth, and suppress diseases. However, their overall effectiveness remains limited, hence the need for further research to enhance their agricultural performance. This study aims to explore the potential application of two natural sources (manure digestate and crop Artemisia dubia) for crop fertilization and protection. During the growing season, winter wheat was fertilized twice (21-25 BBCH and 30-35 BBCH) with synthetic, organic (pig manure digestate), and combined synthetic-organic fertilizers. Artemisia dubia biomass was incorporated before sowing and planted in strips. The soil chemical composition, crop overwintering, weediness, and diseases were assessed after two years of the respective treatments. The results showed that the organic carbon content increased by 1-5% after fertilizing winter wheat with pig manure digestate and combining fertilizers (organic and synthetic). Additionally, fertilizer or pesticide use had a significant effect on the soil pH process. Combining synthetic and organic fertilizers increased the amount of mobile phosphorus in the soil by 38%. In conclusion, combining synthetic fertilizers with organic fertilizers is the most effective approach to maintain healthy soil conditions and prevent damage to sprouts in the soil. Overall, our findings offer more opportunities for organic and sustainable agricultural processes by integrating pig manure digestate and Artemisia dubia biomass as a natural approach to minimizing synthetic fertilizer and pesticide use.

AB  - Simple Summary: Trace minerals like copper and molybdenum are essential for overall animal health and play crucial roles in metabolic reactions involving tissues and organs. A major factor affecting the absorption and utilization of trace minerals is the interactions that occur between them. A copper deficiency induced by a high molybdenum concentration in the diet (when a sheep trace mineral mix high in Mo is fed to goats) is detrimental, resulting in tremendous economic losses for the goat production industry. An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of an induced copper deficiency by increasing molybdenum on the growth performance, feed efficiency, carcass characteristics, blood metabolites, and immune responses in goats. Eighteen Boer crosses goat kids housed individually were randomly assigned to three treatment groups; (1) control, (2) 5 ppm Mo, and (3) 10 ppm Mo, with 0, 5, and 10 mg/kg of molybdenum added to the grain mix, respectively. The results indicate that low-copper diets with increasing molybdenum did not negatively affect the feed efficiency, animal performance, blood metabolites, or carcass characteristics; however, it did alter the liver's copper and iron concentration as well as immune responses. These results suggest that additional Mo reduced the copper and iron in the liver for the duration of this experiment, and negatively impacted the immune response. This study examined the effects of elevated molybdenum (Mo) in goat diets on the growth, blood parameters, and immune responses in goats. Eighteen Boer crosses goats (BW = 25.6 +/- 1.03 kg) were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: (1) control (no additional Mo), (2) 5 ppm Mo, and (3) 10 ppm Mo as ammonium molybdate was added to the grain mix. Animals were fed a 50:50 hay:grain diet ad libitum twice daily. Daily feed refusals were monitored, and intake was adjusted weekly. Body weights were recorded every 14 days and blood samples were collected on the second week of every month to determine Cu, Mo, Fe, Zn, and other blood metabolites. After 85 days, animals were humanely euthanized and carcass traits were measured. Liver, longissimus muscle area, and kidney samples were collected postmortem. Liver Cu (p < 0.003), blood triacylglycerides (p < 0.03), and serum total protein (p < 0.03) levels were reduced; the liver (p = 0.07) and kidney (p < 0.001) Mo concentrations were increased; and the immune response was decreased linearly (p < 0.01) with additional Mo. Low levels of Cu with increasing Mo levels in the diet did not negatively impact animal performance or blood metabolites, in the duration of this study (85 days); however, it lowered the liver Cu, Fe, and immune responses in goats.

AB  - The impact of heat stress due to climate change is particularly well characterized on the plant aboveground and more specifically in the reproductive parts of crops. However, fewer studies aimed at characterizing the effects of heat stress on root morphology and root exudation. These two components of root functioning are of major importance for nutrient acquisition and set up beneficial interactions with microorganisms but they are also particularly sensitive to high temperatures. In our study, we aimed to analyse the effects of heat stress on root morphology and root exudation (quantitatively and qualitatively) in two Brassicaceae i.e. rapeseed (Brassica napus) and camelina (Camelina sativa) that differed from their development strategy which might interfere with their ability to face heat stress. We also designed several heat stress protocols so as to test whether a prior gradual temperature increase can have a priming effect over intense heat stress. Our results indicated that camelina and rapeseed exhibited two different behaviors upon heat stress. In rapeseed, heat stress led to an increase in exudation and no changes in root morphology. In contrast, camelina showed a more conservative strategy as revealed by increased root prospection and modifications of organic acid exudation. The prior gradual increase before the intense heat stress did not modify the trend observed upon the intense heat stress but tended to limit the impacts on root exudation in rapeseed. However, the combined sequence was more negative for camelina due to the longer cumulated duration of the stress. The contrasting behaviours of the two species can be explained by a difference in development strategy and also contrasting breeding histories, that enable the conservation of more traits involved in abiotic stress resistance in camelina in contrast to rapeseed. Eventually, our study highlights that although heat stress due to increased air temperature is mainly sensed by the aboveground plant parts, root functions are impacted and roots could act as a buffer organ to attempt readjusting impaired allo-cation of carbohydrates to the seeds. Our work opens new perspectives for deciphering the interactions between the plant and soilborne microbe communities under heat stress.

AB  - Uptake and translocation of water-soluble organic compounds by plants represent important means through which terrestrial organisms can be exposed to organic contaminants. In terrestrial systems adjacent to wastewater effluent-dominated streams (e.g., riparian corridors), insects, mammals, and birds could be exposed to trace organic contaminants through this pathway, especially in arid regions where other water sources are scarce. Analysis of the antiepileptic drug, carbamazepine, in plants grown under conditions that mimic effluent-dominated riparian zones indicates that concentrations in plant tissues exceed levels that may pose risks to herbivorous and/or detritivorous organisms. Plant uptake of carbamazepine exhibited considerable interspecies variability and distinct spatial and temporal trends. It also showed evidence of in-planta transformation. Because effluent-dominated riparian zones serve as important habitats for terrestrial species in arid regions, plant uptake and translocation of wastewater-derived trace organic contaminants should be considered when assessing the potential ecotoxicological impacts of municipal wastewater effluent discharges.

AB  - Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is known to facilitate fear extinction and play a protective role against fearful memories.1,2 1,2 Consequently, disruption of REM sleep after a traumatic event may increase the risk for developing PTSD.3,4 3,4 However, the underlying mechanisms by which REM sleep promotes extinction of aversive memories remain largely unknown. The infralimbic cortex (IL) is a key brain structure for the consolidation of extinction memory.5 5 Using calcium imaging, we found in mice that most IL pyramidal neurons are intensively activated during REM sleep. Optogenetically suppressing the IL specifically during REM sleep within a 4-h window after auditory-cued fear conditioning impaired extinction memory consolidation. In contrast, REM-specific IL inhibition after extinction learning did not affect the extinction memory. Whole- cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that inactivating IL neurons during REM sleep depresses their excitability. Together, our findings suggest that REM sleep after fear conditioning facilitates fear extinction by enhancing IL excitability and highlight the importance of REM sleep in the aftermath of traumatic events for protecting against traumatic memories.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) continues to expand in distribution and prevalence across North America. Upon detection, either for the first time in a novel area or in a region with an existing outbreak, wildlife management agencies are tasked with responding to mitigate the disease. This response often entails creation or modification of a management zone with modified rules and regulations that support an agency's disease management plan. To guide the process of creating an appropriately sized CWD management zone, assuming that wild deer movements are a major risk factor for disease spread, we used data from global positioning system (GPS)-collared white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in southeastern Minnesota and southcentral Pennsylvania, USA, between 2018 and 2021 to estimate long-distance movements associated with dispersal and migratory behaviors. These contrasting study areas with active CWD outbreaks permitted an evaluation of deer movement dynamics in different parts of their range. We quantified the proportion, distribution, timing, and orientation of dispersing and migratory deer. We observed 21% of female and 58% of male yearlings disperse from their apparent natal home range in Minnesota, while in Pennsylvania 4% of female and 68% of male yearlings dispersed. We also documented 20% of females and 6% of males migrated between seasonal home ranges in Minnesota, while in Pennsylvania no females and 5% of males migrated. The average distance deer dispersed or migrated in Minnesota was 20 km and 11 km, respectively, while in Pennsylvania male deer dispersed only about 4 km. Both sexes in Minnesota tended to disperse in a consistent, westerly direction; however, there was no directional preference observed for migratory deer or for dispersing deer in Pennsylvania. We found differences between natal and adult home range size for both sexes in Minnesota but not for males in Pennsylvania. Our results identify the considerable variability in dispersal and migration dynamics of white-tailed deer in disparate landscapes, which is important to agencies managing CWD. We summarize the distribution of these movements and suggest agencies use this information to help make decisions about optimal management zone size. We suggest the development of formalized assessments of the tradeoffs associated with optimizing decisions about creation of CWD management zones across white-tailed deer populations that exhibit variation in dispersal behavior and suggest careful evaluation to avoid using an arbitrary size or shape to create disease management zones.

AB  - The fetal and early postnatal stages are periods of rapid brain development, during which, methylmercury (MeHg) ex-posure can cause lasting cognitive impairments. MeHg exposure disrupts neurotransmitter metabolites, which in-creased susceptibility to neurological responses. However, the neurotoxic mechanism underlying the MeHg-induced disruption of neurotransmitter metabolism requires further exploration. To this end, female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administered NaCl (control group) or MeHg (0.6 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/ kg body weight (bw), where the body weight refers to the dams) during the perinatal period, and then changes in neurotransmitter profiles and the gut microbiota of offspring were detected. The results showed that tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr) path-way neurotransmitter metabolites, including serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-HIAA), N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamin (NAS), Tyr, dopamine (DA) and epinephrine (E), were significantly changed, and the Kynurenine/Tryptophan (Kyn/Trp) ratio was increased in the MeHg-treated groups. Meanwhile, acetylcholine (ACh) and neurotransmitters involved in the amino acid pathway were significantly reduced. Notably, MeHg treat-ment induced a significant reduction in tight junctions in the colon and hippocampal tissue. Furthermore, fecal microbiota analysis indicated that the diversity and composition characteristics were significantly altered by MeHg exposure. Mediation analysis showed that the gut microbiota mediated the effect of MeHg treatment on the neuro-transmitter expression profiles. The present findings shed light on the regulatory role of the gut microbiota in MeHg-disrupted neurotransmitter metabolic pathways and the potential impact of perinatal MeHg treatment on the "cross-talk" between the gut and brain.

AB  - Simple Summary Dietary supplements can affect animal growth, product quality, and various physiological factors. This study investigated the effects of supplementing hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD) oil in the diet of goats. CBD, when included at higher levels (0.2-0.3 mL), led to improved meat quality but also altered volatile compound profiles. Additionally, CBD supplementation affected some blood variables related to immunity, metabolism, and homeostasis.Abstract Stress experienced by animals during pre-mortem management handling significantly affects both their welfare and the quality of the meat produced. Using hemp-derived CBD may offer several benefits in alleviating this issue. In this study, we investigated the effects of hemp-derived CBD supplementation on blood variables, growth performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality in goats. Sixteen crossbred Boer goats were divided into four groups receiving a basal diet supplemented with 0 (control), 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 mL CBD/30 kg body weight over 90 days. Although growth, carcass characteristics, and pH remained unaffected, CBD supplementation influenced several blood variables. Specifically, dietary CBD at 0.1-0.3 mL increased white blood cell (WBC) counts, while 0.3 mL CBD increased serum total protein, globulin, sodium, and carbon dioxide levels, potentially affecting protein metabolism and electrolyte balance. Over time, significant changes were noted in hematological profiles, kidney markers, protein profiles, and some electrolytes, indicating physiological adaptations. Regarding meat quality, supplementation with 0.2-0.3 mL of CBD linearly improved color redness and stability; moreover, CBD supplementation improved tenderness and textural properties, resulting in a softer meat texture. However, analysis using an E-nose indicated increased ammonia and organic solvent vapors in meat from the higher CBD groups. This study concluded that CBD supplementation up to 0.3 mL of CBD/30 kg body weight beneficially modulated blood biomarkers, meat color, and tenderness without adverse impacts on growth or carcass characteristics in goats.

AB  - Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) is a multi-host pathogen with sheep and goats as main hosts. To investigate the role of cattle in the epidemiology of PPR, we simulated conditions similar to East African zero-grazing husbandry practices in a series of trials with local Zebu cattle (Bos taurus indicus) co-housed with goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). Furthermore, we developed a mathematical model to assess the impact of PPRV-transmission from cattle to goats. Of the 32 cattle intranasally infected with the locally endemic lineage IV strain PPRV/Ethiopia/Habru/2014 none transmitted PPRV to 32 co-housed goats. However, these cattle or cattle co-housed with PPRV-infected goats seroconverted. The results confirm previous studies that cattle currently play a negligible role in PPRV-transmission and small ruminant vaccination is sufficient for eradication. However, the possible emergence of PPRV strains more virulent for cattle may impact eradication. Therefore, continued monitoring of PPRV circulation and evolution is recommended.
   Field trials and modeling in East Africa suggest zebu cattle, often co-housed with goats under zero-grazing conditions, show no evidence of transmitting PPRV to goats, supporting the strategy of focusing vaccination on small ruminants for PPR eradication in mixed-species systems.

AB  - Hyperspectral video target tracking is generally challenging when the scale of the target varies. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to address the challenges prevalent in the existing hyperspectral video target tracking approaches. The proposed approach employs deep features along with spectral matching reduction and adaptive-scale 3D hog features to track the objects even when the scale is varying. Spectral matching reduction is adopted to estimate the spectral curve of the selected target region using a weighted combination of the global and local spectral curves. In addition to the deep features, adaptive-scale 3D hog features are extracted using cube-level features at three different scales. The four weak response maps thus obtained are then combined using adaptive weights to yield a strong response map. Finally, the region proposal module is utilized to estimate the target box. The proposed strategies make the approach robust against scale variations of the target. A comparative study on different hyperspectral video sequences illustrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB  - Understanding the factors that allow multiple species to coexist and share resources is an outstanding question in community ecology. Animals that share resources tend to use different strategies to decrease potential competition, through morphological adaptations, establishment of hierarchies, behavioral adaptations or spatial or temporal segregation. The main objective of this study was to infer interspecific processes of competition and facilitation through the study of species co-occurrence patterns in a vertebrate scavenger guild in de Brazilian cerrado. We analyzed patterns of spatial and temporal co-occurrence between species pairs, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and determined the activity patterns of the different scavenger species. For this purpose, we placed and monitored 11 large (i.e. goat) and 45 small (i.e. chicken) carcasses by camera-trapping, obtaining a total of 27 448 images. Our results show complex competitive and facilitative relationships among scavenging species in the Brazilian cerrado that are influenced by carcass size and change depending on the spatial and temporal scale at which they are analyzed. The scavenger assemblages that consumed large and small carcasses were different, evidencing resource partitioning between obligate and facultative scavengers. Furthermore, as an alternative to reduce competition levels, most species showed differences in their scavenging patterns, in addition to a strong temporal segregation during carcass consumption. Regarding New World vultures, our results suggest a strong interference competition between species with clear differences in their ecological traits (e.g. size, social behavior). However, we also found evidence of facilitation processes between vulture species in the location and access to the interior of the carcasses. Our findings highlight the role of obligate scavengers both in competition and facilitation processes in this vertebrate scavenger community. Future research should focus on investigating which species play the most important role in the structure and dynamics of this community, also considering intraspecific and behavioral patterns.

AB  - Background The contribution of North Africa to the assembly of biodiversity within the Western Palaearctic is still poorly documented. Since the Miocene, multiple biotic exchanges occurred across the Strait of Gibraltar, underlying the high biogeographic affinity between the western European and African sides of the Mediterranean basin. We investigated the biogeographic and demographic dynamics of two large Mediterranean-adapted snakes across the Strait and assess their relevance to the origin and diversity patterns of current European and North African populations. Results We inferred phylogeographic patterns and demographic history of M. monspessulanus and H. hippocrepis, based on range-wide multilocus data, combined with fossil data and species distribution modelling, under present and past bioclimatic envelopes. For both species we identified endemic lineages in the High Atlas Mountains (Morocco) and in eastern Iberia, suggesting their persistence in Europe during the Pleistocene. One lineage is shared between North Africa and southern Iberia and likely spread from the former to the latter during the sea-level low stand of the last glacial stage. During this period M. monspessulanus shows a sudden demographic expansion, associated with increased habitat suitability in North Africa. Lower habitat suitability is predicted for both species during interglacial stages, with suitable areas restricted to coastal and mountain ranges of Iberia and Morocco. Compiled fossil data for M. monspessulanus show a continuous fossil record in Iberia at least since the Pliocene and throughout the Pleistocene. Conclusions The previously proposed hypothesis of Pleistocene glacial extinction of both species in Europe is not supported based on genetic data, bioclimatic envelopes models, and the available fossil record. A model of range retraction to mountain refugia during arid periods and of glacial expansion (demographic and spatial) associated to an increase of Mediterranean habitats during glacial epochs emerges as a general pattern for mesic vertebrates in North Africa. Moreover, the phylogeographic pattern of H. hippocrepis conforms to a well-established biogeographic partition between western and eastern Maghreb.

AB  - Radionuclides released from nuclear accidents or explosions pose long-term threats to ecosystem health. A prominent example is wild boar contamination in central Europe, which is notorious for its persistently high Cs-137 levels. However, without reliable source identification, the origin of this decades old problem has been uncertain. Here, we target radiocesium contamination in wild boars from Bavaria. Our samples (2019-2021) range from 370 to 15,000 Bq center dot kg(-1) Cs-137, thus exceeding the regulatory limits (600 Bq center dot kg(-1)) by a factor of up to 25. Using an emerging nuclear forensic fingerprint, Cs-135/Cs-137, we distinguished various radiocesium source legacies in their source composition. All samples exhibit signatures of mixing of Chornobyl and nuclear weapons fallout, with Cs-135/Cs-137 ratios ranging from 0.67 to 1.97. Although Chornobyl has been widely believed to be the prime source of Cs-137 in wild boars, we find that "old" Cs-137 from weapons fallout significantly contributes to the total level (10-68%) in those specimens that exceeded the regulatory limit. In some cases, weapons-Cs-137 alone can lead to exceedances of the regulatory limit, especially in samples with a relatively low total Cs-137 level. Our findings demonstrate that the superposition of older and newer legacies of Cs-137 can vastly surpass the impact of any singular yet dominant source and thus highlight the critical role of historical releases of Cs-137 in current environmental pollution challenges.

AB  - While previous studies have primarily examined the impacts of singular interventions on GHG emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removals (CDR), few studies explore complementarities and antagonisms when multiple interventions are simultaneously operationalized. Here, the aim is to examine how stacking of two pathways for mitigation-CDR, via soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual and GHG emissions avoidance via antimethanogenic feed additives-impacts net GHG emissions associated with sheep production. A nonlinear programing approach is invoked to elicit optimal combinations of grazing management and antimethanogenic feed additives to maximize farm profit and/or minimize net GHG emissions. It is shown that stacking multiple interventions realizes that greater abatement and profit do any singular intervention. Adoption of 3-NOP feed supplement with 15- and 30-paddock high stocking rate systems is the most prospective stacked intervention for concurrent profit maximization and emissions minimization. It is contended that (1) increasing payments for farming of carbon and ecosystems services relative to that of wool and meat will stimulate participation in carbon markets, (2) economics of participation in carbon markets tend to be more favorable for larger farms than smaller farms due to economies of scale and (3) adoption of optimal grazing management and antimethanogenic feed additives can realize more profit from sheep production and carbon farming than enterprises that only derive income from sheep production.

AB  - Aim Given the influence of seasonality on most ecological systems, an emerging research area attempts to understand how community network structure is shaped by seasonal climatic variations. To do so, most researchers conduct their analyses using open networks due to the high cost associated with constructing their own community networks. However, unwanted structural differences from the unique sampling and construction methods used to create each open network likely make comparing these networks a difficult task. Here, with the largest set of open bipartite networks collected to date, we test whether seasonal climatic variations explain network structure while additionally accounting for construction/sampling differences between networks. Location Trying to approach global. Time period Contemporary. Major taxa studied Plants and animals. Methods Using 723 open bipartite networks, we test whether temperature and/or precipitation seasonality explains (un)weighted metrics of nestedness, modularity or specialization across plant-pollinator, seed-dispersal, plant-ant, host-parasite or plant-herbivore systems. Results Generally, seasonality only weakly explained network structure: at most 16% of the variation in weighted metrics and 5% of the variation in unweighted metrics. Instead, a control for sampling bias in networks, sampling intensity, often better explained many of the network structural metrics. When limiting our analyses to only intensely sampled networks, however, about 33% of the variation in weighted modularity and specialization was explained by seasonality, but only in plant-pollinator networks. Main conclusions Altogether, we do not find strong evidence that seasonality explains network structure. Our study also highlights the large amount of structural differences in open networks, likely from the many different sampling and network construction techniques adopted by researchers when constructing networks. Hence, a definitive test for the relationship between network structure and seasonality across large spatial extents will require a dataset free from sampling and other biases, where networks are derived from a consistent sampling protocol that appropriately characterizes communities.

AB  - During flight, insect herbivores respond to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by host and non-host plants or conspecifics. Dendroctonus ponderosae uses chemical cues including host and non-host VOCs, as well as aggregation pheromones to navigate through the environment and find a suitable reproductive host. The dispersal flight distance of D. ponderosae from its natal host to its reproductive host varies widely, even within populations of beetles. Beetle energetics do not entirely explain this flight variation. In this study, we test the effect of beetle exposure to semiochemical cues before and during flight on subsequent flight propensity (the likelihood of flight initiation) and flight capacity (the distance and velocity of flight) using computer-linked flight mills. Exposure to host volatiles before flight interacts with beetle pre-flight weight to influence subsequent flight capacity of female but not male beetles. Female beetles flew further and faster following exposure to their aggregation pheromone, trans-verbenol. Flight of female beetles was reduced when they were exposed to volatiles from the non-host, Populus tremuloides, during flight. This study is the first to indicate that semiochemical cues not only influence beetle orientation during flight but also flight capacity of D. ponderosae. These results provide baseline information on the effect of environmental cues on dispersal by flight of D. ponderosae.

AB  - Wheat, a major global cereal crop, is prone to quality degradation from early sprouting when stored improperly, resulting in substantial economic losses. Traditional methods for detecting early sprouting are labor-intensive and destructive, underscoring the need for rapid, non-destructive alternatives. Terahertz (THz) technology provides a promising solution due to its ability to perform non-invasive imaging of internal structures. However, current THz imaging techniques are limited by low image resolution, which restricts their practical application. We address these challenges by proposing an advanced deep learning framework for THz image classification of early sprouting wheat. We first develop an Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (AESRGAN) to improve the resolution of THz images, integrating an attention mechanism to focus on critical image regions. This model achieves a 0.76 dB improvement in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Subsequently, we introduce the EfficientViT-based YOLO V8 classification model, incorporating a Depthwise Separable Attention (C2F-DSA) module, and further optimize the model using the Gazelle Optimization Algorithm (GOA). Experimental results demonstrate the GOA-EViTDSA-YOLO model achieves an accuracy of 97.5% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.962. The model is efficient and significantly enhances the classification of early sprouting wheat compared to other deep learning models.

AB  - To cope with limited availability of drinking water in their environment, terrestrial animals have developed numerous behavioral and physiological strategies including maintaining an optimal hydration state through dietary water intake. Recent studies performed in snakes, which are generalist carnivorous reptiles, suggest that the benefits of dietary water intake are negated by hydric costs of digestion. Most lizards are generalist insectivores that can shift their prey types, but firm experimental demonstration of dietary water intake is currently missing in these organisms. Here, we performed an experimental study in the common lizard Zootoca vivipara, a keystone mesopredator from temperate climates exhibiting a great diversity of prey in its mesic habitats, in order to investigate the effects of food consumption and prey type on physiological responses to water deprivation. Our results indicate that common lizards cannot improve their hydration state through prey consumption, irrespective of prey type, suggesting that they are primarily dependent upon drinking water. Yet, high-quality prey consumption reduced the energetic costs of water deprivation, potentially helping lizards to conserve a better body condition during periods of limited water availability. These findings have important implications for understanding the physiological responses of ectotherms to water stress, and highlight the complex interactions between hydration status, energy metabolism and feeding behavior in insectivorous lizards.

AB  - The Neotropical deer genus Mazama is characterized by homoplastic morphological characters, a high karyotypic diversity, and a polyphyletic condition. The species of the genus have been recovered into two multigeneric lineages, the subtribes Odocoileina and Blastocerina, of the tribe Odocoileini (New World deer) in the family Cervidae. Within the Blastocerina, gray brockets include two non-sister species, Subulo gouazoubira, occurring south of the Amazon region, and Passalites nemorivagus, occurring in the Guianas and in the Amazon region. We clarify the taxonomic status and phylogenetic position of Mazama americana citus Osgood, 1912 (referred to as either S. gouazoubira or P. nemorivagus by other authors). We collected a topotype of M. a. citus from the eastern shore of Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, characterize it morphologically and cytogenetically (conventional banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization), and carry out a phylogenetic analysis of its whole mitogenome and Cytb alongside two additional specimens of M. a. citus from northwestern Venezuela. Our analyses reveal the topotype to be a large gray brocket with a cinnamon band above the eyes and 2n = 61 and FN = 70 karyotype. Using cattle whole chromosome painting and bacterial artificial chromosome X probes, we determined its karyotype to differ in at least 10 rearrangements from that of S. gouazoubira. Bayesian inference recovers M. a. citus within the Blastocerina subtribe, separated phylogenetically from other gray brockets (100% branch value), revealing the Osgood's gray brocket to be a valid species that should be assigned to a new genus. We propose the generic name Bisbalus, with Bisbalus citus (Osgood, 1912) as the type species.

AB  - The supplementation of extenders with PUFAs has not been investigated in fish by now. Thus, the present study examined whether different levels of docosahexaenoic (DHA), which is the predominant PUFAs in the sperm plasma membrane, in Tris-glucose based extender could increase the quality and fertilizing ability of brown trout (Salmo trutta macrostigma) sperm following cryopreservation were evaluated. Sperm samples diluted (1:10) with the base extender were supplemented with 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 ng mL(-1) concentrations of DHA. In the control group, sperm was diluted in the base extender, without DHA. Following dilution, the sperm was aspirated into 0.25 mL straws, frozen 3 cm of above of the liquid nitrogen (LN2) surface, and plunged directly into the LN2. Based on the results, increasing of DHA supplementations in the Tris-glucose based extender improved post-thaw progressive motility, progressive duration of motility, viability, and fertility compared to the control group (P<0.05). Additionally, the results indicated that supplementation of 7.5 ng mL(-1) of DHA significantly exhibited the best cryoprotective effect in terms of progressive motility (62.4 +/- 1.73%), progressive duration of motility (46.8 +/- 1.32s), viability (56.2 +/- 1.20%), fertility (52.6 +/- 1.48%), and hatching (28.6 +/- 1.45%). The results showed that supplementation of DHA to the Tris-glucose based extender can be beneficial for the cryopreservation of brown trout sperm.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate whether conventional farming can be replaced by a lower chemical pollution farming system, integrated rice-duck farming in a suburban agricultural area in northern Zhejiang, Southeast China. We comprehensively assessed the impacts of integrated rice-duck farming on weeds and herbivorous insects along with their natural enemies during the rice-growing season. We found that the rice-duck system effectively controlled weeds within the paddy fields. Nevertheless, the abundance of herbivores, particularly planthoppers and leafhoppers was increased in the duck-roaming paddy fields compared to the control and conventional fields, indicating the inefficiency of the rice-duck system in the control of rice main herbivore pests. Rice-duck farming significantly reduced the abundance of predators, especially spiders and dragonflies, therefore an 'enemy-free space' was created for herbivores which might be responsible for the observed herbivore increase in the rice-duck fields. Despite the inefficiency of rice-duck farming in the control of rice main herbivore pests, the net income of the rice-duck treatment with an organic certification was 7.6 and 1.4 times higher compared to the conventional and control treatments, respectively. In the view of the favourable results obtained in this study, the integrated rice-duck farming system might be suggested as a high economic return organic farming method suitable for modern farmers.

AB  - Despite extensive research into the behavioral ecology of free-ranging animal groups, questions remain about how group members integrate information about their physical and social surroundings. This is because (1) tracking of multiple group members is limited to a few easily manageable species and (2) the tools to simultaneously quantify physical and social influences on an individual's movement remain challenging, especially across large geographic scales. A relevant example of a widely ranging species with complex social structure and of conservation concern is the African savanna elephant. We evaluate highly synchronized GPS tracks from 5 male elephants in Etosha National Park in Namibia by incorporating their dynamic social landscape into an established resource selection model. The fitted model predicts movement patterns based simultaneously on the physical landscape (e.g. repeated visitation of waterholes) and the social landscape (e.g. avoidance of a dominant male). Combining the fitted models for multiple focal individuals produces landscape-dependent social networks that vary over space (e.g. with distance from a waterhole) and time (e.g. as the seasons change). The networks, especially around waterholes, are consistent with dominance patterns determined from previous behavioral studies. Models that combine physical landscape and social effects, based on remote tracking, can augment traditional methods for determining social structure from intensive behavioral observations. More broadly, these models will be essential to effective, in-situ conservation and management of wide-ranging social species in the face of anthropogenic disruptions to their physical surroundings and social connections.
   We modified a tool used to study the movement of animals in their habitat to include social influences. Applying it to male elephants in southern Africa, we reaffirm dominance relationships previously observed around waterholes, but also show how these relationships vary across the landscape. The new tool may be applied to other species and other types of dynamic interactions (e.g. with farmers or poachers), and thus assist wildlife conservation and management in a variety of ways.

AB  - Over numerous years, breeding herds have faced challenges to sustainability with poor profitability, impact of disease, export market instability, limited labor, and increasing environmental and animal welfare regulations. Many of these scenarios are expected to continue, but their impact lessened with adjustments in management, technology, and business. The prospects for success in the future for the pig industry in various locations are based on costs of pig production efficiency and projections for domestic and export markets. Sow farms are expected to increase in size to meet large retailer needs, while smaller farms will fill domestic regional markets. The risk of PRRS in breeding herds and loss of pigs and infertility will continue to be a major concern for producers. Changes in sow housing will likely continue with designs that meet welfare requirements and allow for practical management of the breeding herd. Trends for selection and increase in litter size will continue but will include measures for birthweight and survival, and traits for heat stress and disease resistance. Changes in boar semen production and AI procedures are unlikely since fertility measures are very high. But advances in technology for identifying fertile and time of ovulation, or procedures that aid in selection of sperm or induction of ovulation, could facilitate reduction in the number of sperm used to produce a litter of pigs.

AB  - Astrocytes are associated with varying brain size between rodents and primates. As a close evolutionary relative of primates, the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) provides a valuable comparative model for investigating glial architecture. However, the anatomical distribution and morphological characteristics of astrocytes in the tree shrew brain remain poorly characterized. In this study, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunofluorescence was employed to systematically examine the spatial distribution and morphology of astrocytes in the whole brain of tree shrews. Notably, GFAP-immunoreactive (ir) astrocytes were detected throughout the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon. Distinct laminar distribution was evident in regions such as the main olfactory bulb and hippocampus. Semi-quantitative comparisons revealed significant regional differences in astrocyte density between tree shrews and mice, encompassing the main olfactory bulb, accessory olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle, cortex, hippocampus, cortical amygdaloid nucleus, hypothalamus, thalamus, superior colliculus, interpeduncular nucleus, median raphe nucleus, and parabrachial nucleus. Compared to mice, tree shrews exhibited higher astrocyte density with increased morphological complexity in the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, and periaqueductal gray, but lower density with greater morphological complexity in the hippocampus and substantia nigra. In the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus and lateral hypothalamic area, GFAP-ir astrocytes displayed comparable densities between tree shrews and mice but exhibited region-specific differences in morphological complexity. This study provides the first brain-wide mapping of GFAP-ir astrocytes in tree shrews, revealing marked interspecies differences in their distribution and morphology, and establishing a neuroanatomical framework for understanding astrocyte involvement in diverse physiological and behavioral functions.

AB  - Simple Summary Populations of many marine species are threatened by a number of interacting factors, including anthropogenic activities, climate change, and biodiversity loss. The assessment of the conservation status of such populations relies heavily on several types of data, such as large-scale geographical and ecological distribution. Seahorses are charismatic fish sensitive to environmental pressures, and according to the IUCN directive 95/2020, they should be considered a model for environmental quality assessment. As in many other areas, the data on seahorse ecological distribution in Europe are scattered, patchy, and mainly focused on small-scale studies. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review using the PRISMA protocol to identify the current knowledge status, detect gaps, and propose future research priorities. We analyzed 32 years of published studies and described the distribution of Hippocampus guttulatus and H. hippocampus across 176 sites in the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and Black Sea as a function of habitat, depth, and degree of confinement. The applied method evidenced the overall lack of a detailed habitat description in published studies. Seahorse conservation would benefit from an analytical description of habitats, such as data on the depth, nature of the substrate, and associated biological communities, as well as the use of a standardized habitat classification system, such as formally recognized EUNIS habitat codes. Human pressures on marine ecosystems have caused extensive degradation of marine habitats and several local extinctions. Overexploitation and destructive fishing practices are responsible for biodiversity loss in many coastal ecosystems. The definition of conservation programs in marine fish requires comprehensive knowledge on large-scale geographical distribution, while considering distribution/abundance patterns in relation to key environmental variables. Due to their life-cycle traits, the two European seahorses (Hippocampus guttulatus and H. hippocampus), as with other congeneric species, are particularly sensitive to the effects of anthropogenic activities and habitat changes. However, information on the ecological distribution of these two species is scattered, patchy, and mainly focused on small-scale studies. In this paper, we followed an international standard protocol for systematic reviews (the PRISMA protocol) to provide a detailed assessment of the two species' geographical distribution in relation to the environmental characteristics. According to the 134 analyzed studies, Hippocampus guttulatus is more common in confined areas, while H. hippocampus is found in marine shelf waters. With several interspecific differences, seagrasses were the most used holdfasts of both species. The EUNIS codes (European nature information system) referring to a specific and unique habitat were discussed as a potential tool for defining the ecological distribution of the two species. The obtained results and their future implementation could help plan conservation actions.

AB  - The occurrence and distribution of ten larger terrestrial mammals on the Ionian Island of Corfu were investigated from January 2020 to March 2021. The northern white-breasted hedgehog and the stone marten were found to be common, and this is probably also the case for the least weasel. The red fox was primarily found in the island's rocky northeast and although not uncommon it may be under pressure as it is often considered a pest. Wild boars were found to be present, and reproduction may occur, but the status of this species needs further investigation. The Eurasian otter was found in several areas around the island, but the data indicates that the Corfu population contains few individuals that move over large areas. We suggest strengthened protection for this species to avoid further population decline and subsequent extinction. Brown hares of unknown origins are repeatedly released on the island, and in combination with extensive hunting any genetic characteristics of the indigenous population is expected to be lost. No evidence for presence of fallow deer was found, and except for photos of single specimens this was also the case for red deer and golden jackal. All investigated species are potentially threatened by habitat loss, caused by increasing tourism, extensive development, high water out-take and, in some cases, persecution.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of cervids caused by a misfolded and infectious protein, called a prion. Infection with CWD is characterized by an asymptomatic period, followed by a decline that inevitably leads to death. The disease is transmitted mainly through direct contact between infected and uninfected animals, but vertical transmission has been documented in muntjac deer (Muntiacus reevesi), along with the presence of infectious prions in the reproductive tissues of elk (Cervus canadensis) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Therefore, questions have been raised about the effects of CWD on the health and characteristics of the offspring gestated by infected animals, and about how vertical transmission may complicate disease management efforts and drive reduction of herd fitness. To begin finding quantitative answers to these questions, this study used multilevel Bayesian linear regression to model the influence of maternal infection with CWD, along with several other environmental and biological variables, on fetal weight, sex, and length using data collected on white-tailed deer as part of the CWD management program in Illinois for the time period between fiscal years 2003 and 2020. The regression analyses found no statistically significant relationship between maternal CWD status and fetal length or the fraction of males in a litter but did find a significant relationship between maternal infection and fetal weight. Fetuses of CWD positive deer weighed 1% less than fetuses from deer in which CWD was not detected. Given that 88% of the fetuses in this data were in the second trimester of gestation, the impact of CWD on fetuses through the entire course of gestation remains to be evaluated.

AB  - Simple Summary Finding strategies to manage variability in growing pig operations is of major importance to avoid the extra costs associated with inefficient barn usage or penalties at the processing plants when pigs are not correctly sorted. The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary amino acid density can have an impact on body weight variability in a population of growing pigs. Feeding diets with a reduced amino acid density had a negative effect because they increased body weight variability of pens composed of the smallest pigs. For instance, in those pigs, the coefficient of variation, which is used as a measure of variability, increased significantly at the end of the experiment when dietary amino acid density was reduced. It was observed that this effect was explained by a growth restriction that was more severe the lightest the pigs were at the start of the trial. Hypothesizing that posteriorly there would be no differences in growth between those restricted pigs and the normally fed ones, the differences in growth would result in around 5-10 additional days to reach marketing weight. In conclusion, severe nutritional restrictions can negatively affect growing pigs' body weight variability. The goal of this experiment was to determine the implications of dietary standardized ileal digestible lysine (SID Lys:NE) on body weight variability of growing pigs grouped in three initial body weight categories (BWCAT). Animals (N = 1170) were individually weighed and classified in 3 BWCAT (Lp: 32.1 +/- 2.8 kg, Mp: 27.5 +/- 2.3 kg, and Sp: 23.4 +/- 2.9 kg). Afterward, pens were randomly allocated to five dietary SID Lys:NE treatments (3.25 to 4.88 g/Mcal) that were fed over 47 days. Pen coefficient of variation of Sp at day 47 was linearly increased when reducing SID Lys:NE (p < 0.01), from 9.8% to 15.4% between the two extreme dietary levels. The linear effect was different in Sp compared to Lp (p < 0.05) as no effect of SID Lys:NE was reported in the latter BWCAT (p = 0.992). Further analysis showed that this effect was explained by a growth restriction that was more severe the lightest the pigs were at the start of the trial. To summarize, swine body weight variability can be negatively affected when SID Lys requirements are not fulfilled.

AB  - The ability to predict ancient DNA sequencing success in natural history collections is critical to reducing the amount of destructive sampling of a finite resource. So far, studies investigating such success have predominantly focused on taxa with ranges restricted to temperate or cold environments at northern latitudes, which likely aids DNA preservation. Here, we report remarkably high aDNA sequencing success in Sirenia, herbivorous marine mammals of which the distribution is currently constrained to the global tropics. We investigate 91 samples from 85 specimens comprising all four contemporary species and one extinct species, comparing different sample types (cranial/post-cranial bone, skin and cartilage), species, collections, and material age. We obtained remarkably high (e.g., > 20%) endogenous DNA preservation for the majority (e.g., similar to 57% percent) of samples. Sequencing success was linked to sample type, with cranial bones (including petrous and tympanic bones) yielding significantly higher endogenous DNA. Additionally, we obtained variable, but potentially superior DNA results for preserved cartilage and hide samples that can be associated with historical bone. Although such tissue is not always present, this type of material is easy to sample, with very limited destructive impacts on the associated bones, and we therefore highlight its untapped potential as a source of DNA. Overall, our results show the high success of ancient DNA retrieval from historical collections of species with a tropical distribution, expanding on the types of specimens that are available for temporal genomic analyses.

AB  - The multiple land use of agricultural areas is a building block for increased land use efficiency. Unlike monoculture, integrated crop-livestock systems optimally improve ecosystem services, making it an important field of research and application for adapting land use and food systems that have sustainability deficits. The integration of sheep in viticulture production is described as a promising example of an integrated crop-livestock system. While some studies of the integration of sheep into vineyards are already available for other parts of the world, there is still no research on its implementation in Central European viticulture systems. In order to fill this gap of knowledge, we conducted standardized interviews with 34 winegrowers who already graze sheep in their vineyards. The method allowed a wider overview of the implementation of the integrated crop-livestock system than would have been possible with other approaches. Furthermore, the authors kept sheep in their own vineyard for three years to evaluate the statements of the survey participants. The period during which sheep graze in vineyards is quite heterogeneous in Central Europe. Some farms use sheep only during vine dormancy; others also let sheep graze during a certain period in summer. There are also viticulture training systems where grazing is almost continuously possible. In Central Europe, summer grazing normally requires operational adjustments such as lifting the wires of the training system and branches of the vine; otherwise, the vines could be damaged. This option seems to be tailored to the training system in use. Some interviewees mentioned that sheep not only use the accompanying vegetation as fodder and therefore control the undervine growth, but in some cases, they were also able to replace other work processes, such as defoliating the grape zone or cleaning undesired vine shoots near the ground. However, a high additional workload due to livestock keeping was also mentioned by some survey participants. Some of the interviewees cooperate with shepherds, which could help to solve this challenge. Finally, we summarize possible opportunities and risks of this integrated crop-livestock system. Integrating sheep in vineyards seems to be quite feasible in the period of vine dormancy, whereas more information and considerably more effort is needed to integrate sheep during the vegetation period. Further research is needed to answer open questions especially for the necessary adaptions of the common vine training system or the implementation of alternative systems more suitable to combine with livestock keeping. Some practitioners found opportunities to merchandize the use of sheep in wine sales. This potentially unique selling point could be a solution for a broader consideration of sheep in vineyards.

AB  - Q fever, caused by Coxiella burnetii, is a zoonotic disease that poses significant risks to both livestock productivity and human health. This is the first molecular and epidemiological study of C. burnetii infections on a Boer goat farm in South Korea, encompassing clinical cases in animals and humans, as well as environmental contamination. The investigation was initiated following abortion cases at a farm that co-raised Boer goats and cattle. Samples-including vaginal swabs, aborted fetuses, blood, tissues, feces, dust, and soil-were tested using PCR, confirming C. burnetii infection from multiple sources. Genotyping through Multiple Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis and Multispacer Sequence Typing revealed molecular epidemiological links between farm-detected strains and those previously identified in human cases from South Korea, France, and the UK, suggesting possible zoonotic transmission. C. burnetii was also found in dust, soil, feces, and in farmworkers, indicating ongoing environmental and occupational exposure. These findings emphasize the role of environmental contamination in disease persistence and the need for improved biosecurity and coordinated surveillance. This study supports a One Health approach and offers meaningful implications for public health policy, particularly in establishing effective strategies for monitoring and controlling Q fever in livestock farms and surrounding communities.

AB  - Golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos are a long-lived and wide-ranging species believed to be stable or in slight decline across North America. Golden eagles have an extended subadult stage (4-5 years) that is critical to maintaining recruitment into the breeding population and population viability. Compared to adult golden eagles, the ecology of subadult golden eagles (hereafter, subadults) has received little attention. We investigated patterns of resource selection for subadults in the Great Basin Desert of the western United States during summer and winter, 2013-2019. We monitored 46 subadults with GPS transmitters and related locations (n =99 037) with predictors hypothesized to influence seasonal patterns of space use with mixed-effects logistic regression. Subadults selected for ridges and upper slopes in summer and winter, but higher elevations in summer. Subadults showed weak selection for lower ridge density in summer, which was likely facilitated by selection for areas with greater thermal wind current potential. In contrast, subadults showed strong selection for higher ridge density in winter. Subadults selected areas further from roads in summer and closer to roads and electrical transmission lines in winter, which may be related to winter scavenging of road-killed ungulates. Resource selection functions suggested subadults selected for shrublands and woodlands in both seasons, but odds ratios revealed that during winter subadults avoided shrublands and increased selection of woodlands relative to summer. Subadults selected for areas with infrequent fires in both seasons; areas with frequent fires were avoided in summer but selected for in winter. Seasonal changes in resource selection suggested that subadults used woodlands more than expected, potentially reflecting spatial partitioning by subadults to lower-quality habitats to minimize competition with breeding adults during winter when energetic demands for thermoregulation were presumably higher and prey more limited.

AB  - Simple Summary Common ragwort (Senecio jacobaea L.) contains potentially toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA). Occurring on sites of roughage production, it contaminates the harvest. Regardless of fresh or dried intake, ragwort may result in fatal liver cirrhosis in livestock animals. Controlling ragwort, especially without biocides in nature conservation areas, is difficult. Since sheep seemed more resistant to PA in experiments, we tested how this animal species copes with ragwort under field and free-choice conditions. On a ragwort-rich pasture with a stocking density of 12 sheep/hectare, animals grazed for six months over two grazing seasons. From 70 sheep in the beginning, seven were slaughtered every six weeks for analysis of liver parameters, including seven control animals in the beginning of each grazing season. We addressed two questions: (1) To what extent do sheep voluntarily ingest ragwort on contaminated pastures? (2) Which impact on animal health does this grazing behavior have? Sheep ingested large amounts of ragwort, exceeding the assumed lethal dose established under experimental conditions by up to 200%. Behavior, body condition, and liver enzymes mainly remained unchanged. From the point of view of animal health and nature conservation, sheep grazing might be an option to reduce the amount of ragwort on pastures. Common ragwort (Senecio jacobaea L.) naturally occurs on species-rich grasslands. Containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA), it endangers livestock health through contaminated feed. Although in vitro studies showed a detoxification capacity of PA in sheep, few field data are available on the ability of grazing sheep to cope with ragwort. During two grazing seasons on a ragwort-rich pasture, we studied: (1) To what extent do sheep voluntarily ingest ragwort and (2) What impact their grazing behavior has on animal health. Ragwort intake was monitored by counting missing plant parts and calculating their weight. From 70 sheep, seven were slaughtered at the beginning and in six-week intervals at the end of each grazing period to monitor blood parameters and liver tissue. Sheep continuously preferred ragwort. The daily intake was above the currently assumed lethal dose, varying between 0.2-4.9 kg per sheep. Clinical, hematologic, and blood biochemistry parameters mostly remained within the reference limits. Initially elevated liver copper content declined over time. The liver of all 70 animals displayed slight to moderate hepatitis, fibrosis, and proliferation of the bile ducts, but no morphological signs of liver cirrhosis. Sheep preferred and tolerated ragwort, making their grazing an option to control ragwort from both an animal health and nature conservation perspective.

AB  - Composts are an attractive organic-farming alternative to chemical fertilizers and are used for carbon sequestration to increase soil carbon storage. In Japan, a new type of mixed compost fertilizer called compost-compound fertilizer mixture (CCFM) has been registered. It exhibits several merits for organic farming; that is, it is odorless, easy to handle, and has a controllable nutrient content. CCFM consists of compost mixed with chemical fertilizer, such that nutrient content can be effectively adjusted. Although it has been pointed out that pellet composts generate more greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs), such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), the mechanism involved is not clearly understood. To investigate the effect of CCFM on GHGEs, soil microbial properties and plant growth, incubation and pot experiments were conducted in a Hungarian Chernozem and a Japanese Andosol. Both soils were incubated with 1) CCFM prepared using pig manure mixed with chemical fertilizer, 2) chemical fertilizer only, or 3) no fertilizer. A pot experiment was conducted using Komatsuna (Brassica rapa). In the Chernozem, the maximum N2O production rate was observed after chemical fertilizer treatment. The emission factors of chemical fertilizer and CCFM were 0.25% and 0.19%, respectively. In contrast, N2O production was not detected in the Andosol. Meanwhile, CO2 production was higher (P < 0.05) in the Chernozem than in the Andosol; furthermore, it was higher under CCFM than under chemical fertilizer treatment, with 7.5% of amended carbon changing to CO2, thus suggesting that dominant carbon remained in the soil. Microbial biomass increased faster in the Andosol than in the Chernozem and the change was faster under the CCFM than under the chemical fertilizer or control treatments. In the pot experiment, CCFM tended to enhance plant growth in both soils. These experiments showed that CCFM has a soil-carbon storage effect with less resultant GHGEs, especially in Andosols, thereby leading to a more sustainable agriculture. Nonetheless, further studies are required for long-term experiments with other crops.

AB  - Plants experience a wide variety of mechanical stimuli in their environment, some of which indicate the presence of herbivory. Insect feeding vibrations elicit direct and primed increases in levels of defensive compounds. Touch is also a mechanical stimulus arising from rain, wind, and the movement of herbivores and pollinators. In this study, we compared the effect of insect feeding vibrations on flavonoid defenses with two other mechanical stimuli, a silent sham treatment and an active touch treatment. Feeding vibrations caused a direct increase in the concentration of anthocyanins compared to silent sham and active touch, and elicited no priming effects on response to methyl jasmonate. Silent sham caused a priming increase in the concentration of flavonols compared to feeding vibrations and active touch, and there were no direct effects. Although these results provide additional evidence for plant discrimination among mechanical stimuli, we discuss the common intertwining of touch and vibration in what plants experience in natural environments. We propose that touch and vibration are likely perceived by plants as related mechanical stimuli, and encourage broader exploration of this core feature of plant sensory ecology.

AB  - Hunting is a widely employed method for mitigating game damage; however, hunting population has decreased in Japan. This study explored the potential of forestry schools in recruiting and retaining hunters. The forestry schools mainly aim to develop human resources for forestry. Meanwhile, 13 of 22 schools include hunting license classes in their curriculum. They recognize the necessity of hunting licenses for forestry workers. Some schools also provide interaction opportunities between veteran hunters and the young generation. Analysis of hunting license examinations across eight prefectures revealed that 42% of teenagers who passed the exam were forestry school students. In contrast, some forestry schools regard hunting licenses as less important for training forestry workers. They mentioned the limited study period as a reason for not including the classes in their curriculum. The findings showed that forestry schools in the area with minimum damage from deer did not have classes on hunting licenses. It suggests that forestry schools have the potential to contribute to the recruitment and retention of hunters, but it may be confined by geographical conditions, such as the type of target wildlife (e.g. deer or bear). Besides, the case of Kumamoto Forestry College showed students' frustration about post-capture handling. Nonetheless, few forestry schools provide practical training on trap installation in the field. Therefore, forestry schools may be able to contribute to an increase in the number of licensed hunters, but providing practical education remains a significant challenge to foster active and practical hunters to mitigate game damage in Japan.

AB  - The objective was the study of the regulating effect of light on the composition and contents of phenolic compounds in the callus culture of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) grown for 28 days in the light (16-h photoperiod) or in the dark. For the analyses of phenolic compounds, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography in combination with a photodiode array detector and a high-resolution Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC-PDA-HRMS/MS) was used. Nineteen phenolic compounds were characterized. The main phenolic compounds were flavan-3-ols (mono- and oligomers of flavan-3-ols) and derivatives of hydroxybenzoic acids (mono- and digalloyl glucoses, hexosides of 2,5- and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic and salicylic acids). It was shown that the growth of the tea callus in the light or in the dark does not affect the composition of phenolic compounds, but differently affects the content of flavan-3-ols and derivatives of hydroxybenzoic acids. In the callus grown in the light, the content of flavan-3-ols was about 2-fold higher than in the dark. On the contrary, the content of derivatives of hydroxybenzoic acids in the light was at average 3-fold lower. The regulating role of light in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds, as well as light control of the distribution of carbon flux between the branches of the shikimate pathway, which are associated with the biosynthesis of flavan-3-ols and hydroxybenzoic acids, are discussed.

AB  - The larger kangaroos (Macropus giganteus, M. fuliginosus and Osphranter rufus) are widely distributed and have a national population which fluctuates in response to changes in grass growth and trends to 40 million. Most are outside parks and reserves and, on pastoral properties, particularly on the rangelands of southern Australia. High numbers compromise regenerative agriculture, pasture conservation, revegetation and stewardship programmes, and can have significant financial impacts on landholders by lowering livestock production and damaging sustainability. Some smaller macropods, wallabies and pademelons, also have a similar effect, especially in Tasmania and on other smaller Australian Islands where foxes are absent. Paradoxically, kangaroos have a wide range of potentially valuable production attributes and are unique, which should be a global comparative advantage. The kangaroo industry is established with a small domestic and international market, although demand has been falling in recent years. Non-commercial culling is rising, which results in millions of carcasses being wasted and left to decompose in the field. Indigenous communities abhor such waste and its cultural implications. A stronger kangaroo industry would be a better solution to managing overabundant kangaroos than pest culling and exclusion fences. Because kangaroos move from property to property, populations need to be managed on a regional basis through 'regional property-based kangaroo production'. A form of proprietorship over this mobile resource would encourage landholders to play a role in creating greater demand for kangaroo products. They would have an incentive to raise the value of kangaroos. Through innovative harvesting, they could deliver high-quality, environmentally branded, accurately described, gourmet, differentiated products integrated with other livestock industries. They could establish cooperatives and embark on promoting regional kangaroo products. Policy improvements are needed to achieve these production systems. Doing so would diversify their enterprises, convert a liability already on their properties into an asset, create employment, enhance rural economic resilience, and improve animal welfare and conservation outcomes while earning them carbon credits. These opportunities become even more profound as climate change progresses.

AB  - Simple Summary Insects, including dung beetles, rely on volatile cues to locate food and mates. However, the antennal responses of dung beetles to dung headspace volatiles have received minimal attention. To address this gap, we conducted a scanning electron microscopy study to examine the density distribution of three types of antennal sensilla in three introduced dung beetle species found in Australia: Geotrupes spiniger, Bubas bison and Onitis aygulus. The gross morphology of the antennal sensilla of these species is described here for the first time. Notably, we observed distinct patterns of sensilla trichodea, sensilla basiconica and sensilla chaetica on the proximal and distal surfaces of three lamellae in their antennal clubs. Furthermore, using electroantennography, we investigated the olfactory responses of these dung beetles to ten selected dung volatiles and mixtures of the same volatiles. The test chemicals evoked differential antennal responses in all three test species. The results are discussed in relation to the distribution and density of the antennal sensilla and the potential role of dung headspace volatiles in dung preference by these dung beetles. Overall, our findings indicate the possibility of using EAG-active compounds to attract dung beetles in the field. Locating sporadically distributed food resources and mate finding are strongly aided by volatile cues for most insects, including dung beetles. However, there is limited information on the olfactory ecology of dung beetles. We conducted a scanning electron microscopy study on the morphology and distribution of the antennal sensilla of three introduced dung beetle species in Australia: Geotrupes spiniger (Coleoptera: Geotrupidae), Bubas bison and Onitis aygulus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). Three main morphological types of antennal sensilla were identified: sensilla trichodea (ST), sensilla basiconica (SB) and sensilla chaetica (SCh). Distinct variations of SB distribution were observed in B. bison and G. spiniger and on different lamellar surfaces in both sexes of all three species. Sexual dimorphism in antennal sensilla distribution or their abundance was not evident. To complement the morphological characterisation of sensilla, electroantennography (EAG) was carried out to construct EAG response profiles of the three species to selected dung volatiles. An initial study revealed that antennae of all species were sensitive to a mix of phenol, skatole, indole, p-cresol, butanone and butyric acid, common components of livestock dung headspace. In addition to these six compounds, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, eucalyptol and toluene were tested for antennal activity. All compounds evoked measurable EAG responses, confirming antennal sensitivity. Geotrupes spiniger exhibited significant responses to all the compounds compared to the control, whereas B. bison and O. aygulus only responded to a subset of compounds. A comparison of relative EAG amplitudes revealed highly significant responses to p-cresol in G. spiniger and to skatole in B. bison. Geotrupes spiniger displayed differential responses to all the compounds. Pooled EAG data suggest highly significant differences in responses among the three species and among compounds. Our findings suggest that a blend of volatiles may offer potential for the trapping of dung beetles, thereby avoiding the use of dung baits that are inconvenient, inconsistent and may pose a threat to farm biosecurity.

AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms present challenges for water treatment, especially in regions like the Canadian prairies where poor water quality intensifies water treatment issues. Buoyant cyanobacteria that resist sedimentation present a challenge as water treatment operators attempt to balance pre-treatment and toxic disinfection by-products. Here, we used microscopy to identify and describe the succession of cyanobacterial species in Buffalo Pound Lake, a key drinking water supply. We used indicator species analysis to identify temporal grouping structures throughout two sampling seasons from May to October 2018 and 2019. Our findings highlight two key cyanobacterial bloom phases - a mid-summer diazotrophic bloom of Dolichospermum spp. and an autumn Planktothrix agardhii bloom. Dolichospermum crassa and Woronichinia compacta served as indicators of the mid-summer and autumn bloom phases, respectively. Different cyanobacterial metabolites were associated with the distinct bloom phases in both years: toxic microcystins were associated with the mid-summer Dolichospermum bloom and some newly monitored cyanopeptides (anabaenopeptin A and B) with the autumn Planktothrix bloom. Despite forming a significant proportion of the autumn phytoplankton biomass (>60%), the Planktothrix bloom had previously not been detected by sensor or laboratory-derived chlorophyll-a. Our results demonstrate the power of targeted taxonomic identification of key species as a tool for managers of bloom-prone systems. Moreover, we describe an autumn Planktothrix agardhii bloom that has the potential to disrupt water treatment due to its evasion of detection. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying this autumn bloom given the expectation that warmer temperatures and a longer ice-free season will become the norm.

AB  - South Africa produces both marine and freshwater aquaculture species, with a combined production output of 5418 tons of food fish in 2015. Key aquaculture species reportedly cultured include four marine species - abalone, dusky kob, mussels and oysters and seven freshwater species - tilapia, trout, catfish, marron crayfish, carp, koi-carp and ornamental species. The study aims to quantitatively assess the SWOT factors (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) of major aquaculture species of South Africa to determine their aquaculture development and market potential. Key food fish species - abalone, dusky kob, mussel, oyster, salmon, trout, tilapia, catfish and marron crayfish, were selected and subjected to qualitative and quantitative SWOT analyses by adapting the quantified SWOT analytical method coupled with the multi-attribute decision-making method MADM (SWOT-MADM). Trout and tilapia are positioned in quadrant I, showing a combination of competitive strengths and market opportunities. Abalone, oyster and marron crayfish are situated in quadrant II; thus, they possess market opportunities but weak in competitive strengths as aquaculture species. Salmon and dusky kob are positioned in quadrant III; both species are weak in competitive strengths and faced with more threat factors rather than market opportunities. Mussel and catfish are in quadrant IV; both species thus have competitive strengths but are facing more threats than opportunities. Catfish recorded the highest competitive strengths due to internal assessment factors such as low FCR, ability to tolerate very high stocking density, rapid growth rate, high survival rate, hardiness and versatility of production systems and locations. Abalone and marron crayfish, on the other hand, both exhibited more market opportunities compared to other key aquaculture species due to external assessment factors like high pricing and good financial indicators. The study is expected to add to the existing body of knowledge and in guiding aquaculture industry stakeholders to make informed decisions with regards to the feasibility of aquaculture species in South Africa.

AB  - New collections from caves in Bahia state, northeastern Brazil, have revealed additional occurrences of Xangoniscus species. These findings have led to the identification of previously unknown, taxonomically significant morphological features for the genus, including the presence of a depression on the propodus and an expansion of the carpus in pereopod 6 in males of certain species. This study reports new records of X. aganju and provides updated illustrations of the genus' type species. Moreover, four new species are described: Xangoniscus paiabare n. sp., collected from caves in the Padre Cave System in Santana municipality; Xangoniscus tymaopeba n. sp., from Serra Solta II and III caves; Xangoniscus ykanhema n. sp., from Google Cave, both in Serra do Ramalho municipality; and Xangoniscus puku n. sp., found in PEA445 Cave, in Santa Maria da Vit & oacute;ria municipality, all in Bahia state. The discovery of these new species underscores the remarkable diversity of Xangoniscus in subterranean habitats and highlights the Serra do Ramalho region as a significant center of endemism for the species of this genus. The descriptions of these taxa not only expand the known biodiversity of troglobitic isopods in Brazil but also shed light on their morphological variation, offering valuable insights into the evolutionary adaptations of these cave-dwelling organisms.

AB  - Recent interest in modern climate change has stimulated extensive scientific study into past societal responses to climate variability. However, examining climate change and society as a historical narrative drawing upon politics, economics, and settlement patterns does not provide a direct link between climate and society. Given that most inhabitants of the premodern world engaged in agriculture and/or pastoralism, examining chronological correlations between climate and foodways, not as a historical narrative but as a longterm socioenvironmental process, has the potential to identify direct societal adaptations to a changing environment. From South Greece there is evidence for drier conditions at the end of the Late Bronze Age. Is the disappearance of writing, art, and many known settlements at the end of the Bronze Age an example of collapse in the face of inability to adapt to climate change? This is a difficult question to answer given the coarse resolution of many of our archaeological and climatic datasets. Settlement faunal records suggest that food production systems became increasingly homogenous in Late Bronze Age Greece, potentially due to an elite control over various production systems that promoted intensification of certain products. However, in the first millennium B.C.E., animal husbandry, specifically, and food production systems, more broadly, became more heterogenous, and a proportional increase in goats in areas with less rainfall was likely an adaptive response to the drier climate. This paper examines the adaptive relationship between foodways and climate and argues for a process driven approach when explaining social responses to ancient climate change.

AB  - Simple Summary Keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) are a structural component of wool fibers. Despite the gene encoding the high-glycine/tyrosine KAP6-2 (called KRTAP6-2) having been described in sheep, it has not been identified goats. This study describes the identification of caprine KRTAP6-2, reports variation in the gene, and describes its association with cashmere fiber diameter in Longdong cashmere goats. Keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) are a structural component of cashmere fibers and in part determine fiber attributes. The gene encoding the high-glycine/tyrosine KAP6-2 (called KRTAP6-2) has been described in sheep, but it has not been identified goats. In this study, a 252-bp open reading frame with similarity to ovine KRTAP6-2 was found on goat chromosome 1, with its upstream and downstream flanking sequences are closely related with ovine KRTAP6-2 but are clearly distinct from other ovine KRTAP6-n sequences. Polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of this region revealed five distinct banding patterns representing five different sequences (A to E) in 230 Longdong cashmere goats. Eleven diallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a three-nucleotide sequence variation, and a 12-bp insertion/deletion were found among these five sequences, with most SNPs being either outside the coding region or synonymous. The presence of variant D was found to be associated with decreased mean fiber diameter (MFD; present: 13.26 +/- 0.07 mu m; absent: 13.55 +/- 0.04 mu m; p < 0.001), suggesting that variation in KRTAP6-2 may affect fiber diameter and have value as a molecular marker for improving the cashmere fiber diameter trait.

AB  - Social comparison is a fundamental human characteristic; however, long-term social comparison may induce psychological stress and can lead to depression and anxiety. Recent studies have shown that nonhuman primates compare themselves with others; however, no studies have investigated whether social comparisons exist among rodents. In the present study, we established a rat model of social comparison. This model was subsequently used to examine the effects of the differential environment of a partner on depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in male rats, as well as to assess the changes in serum, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and dorsal hippocampus brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels induced by long-term social comparison. Compared to rats whose partners were exposed to the same environment, rats whose partners were exposed to two combined enriched environmental stimuli for 14 days showed significantly decreased social novelty preference and sucrose consumption. No anxiety-like behaviors were observed. Rats whose partners were exposed to one enriched environment for 31 days showed significantly increased immobility time in the forced swimming test, and significantly decreased time spent in the center area in the open-field test. Further, rats whose partners were exposed to one enriched environment for 31 days showed lower BDNF levels in the mPFC and dorsal hippocampus, but not following partner exposure for 14 days. These results suggest that social comparisons exist in rats and can induce psychosocial stress and other negative affect. This model will not only provide the possibility to reveal the neurobiological basis of the emotional impact of social comparison, but could also be used to confirm the conservative evolutionary characteristics of social comparison as a behavioral attribute.

AB  - Simple Summary Boar semen can contain many bacterial species, some of which can have a negative impact upon the quality of the semen, as well as on the sows' reproductive capacity. Semen contamination may occur at time of collection or during semen processing. The aim of this study was to identify gram-negative bacteria that appear in boar semen and to establish models of antimicrobial resistance of isolated gram-negative bacteria. Semen doses examined contained bacterial species with a known negative effect on sows' reproductive tracts (Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, E. coli), and more than half of these isolates were resistance to gentamycin (56.52%) and penicillin (58.69%) antimicrobials commonly used in boar semen extenders. This work proved the presence of pathogenic multiple resistant bacteria in semen, and therefore, we highly recommend periodic microbiological screening of bacteriospermia in boars to avoid the use of low-quality semen in the pig industry.
   Abstract Bacterial contamination of boar semen occurs with some frequency in artificial insemination centers and may have a negative effect on the quality of the semen as well as on the sows' reproductive capacity. Normally, the source of bacterial contamination in pig seminal doses is the own boar. However, distilled water or laboratory equipment used to elaborate the seminal doses can be an important source of bacterial contamination. This study focused on the identification of gram-negative bacteria in boar semen, and impact on the quality of ejaculates obtained from boar, as well as on the establishment of antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolated gram-negative bacteria. Semen samples were collected from 96 boars, ranging in age from 12-36 month, from three artificial insemination centers from the North-West of Romania. Bacterial species were identified by two methods: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and API 20 E (BioMerieux, France). The main bacteria isolated from the doses diluted semen were gram-negative bacteria (47.91%), with a majority of the contaminant bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae: Seratia marcescens 19.56%, Proteus mirabilis 15.21% and Escherichia coli 10.86% and to the family Pseudomonaceae: Ralstonia picketii 17.39%, Burkholderia cepacia 10.86%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8.69%, and Pseudomonas fluorescens 4.34%, respectively. More than half of these isolates (56.52%) were resistant to gentamycin and 58.69% were resistant to penicillin. These antibiotics are very frequently added in sperm diluent in the centers for the processing of sperm from boars in Romania. Regular monitoring for bacterial contamination is an important aspect of a control program.

AB  - Long-term population dynamics are essentially unknown for the western heather vole (Phenacomys intermedius), a relatively rare microtine species. Our objectives were to provide a description of demographic changes in populations of P. intermedius and determine possible causes of these changes. We analyzed four detailed 12- to 22-year data sets that recorded changes in abundance of P. intermedius in a variety of managed forests in south-central British Columbia, Canada from 1993 to 2018. We evaluated three hypotheses (H) that may help explain population changes: heather voles will (H-1) have higher populations in sites with (i) abundant dwarf shrubs or (ii) cover of woody debris; (H-2) colonize new clear-cuts as dispersal sinks for young voles; and (H-3) be at lower abundance when other Microtus species are present at equal or higher numbers. Populations of P. intermedius occurred commonly at <= 1 animal/ha (as a density index). However, in favorable habitats such as some new clear-cuts and in "open" pine stands, P. intermedius occurred at mean annual peak numbers of 5-6/ha (as a density index). There were two relatively high populations of P. intermedius in 1994-1995 and 1998, and possibly again in 2002 in the open pine stands. Mean numbers of lactating females and recruits per year tended to follow the pattern of changes in abundance. High populations of P. intermedius occurred in stands with abundant dwarf shrubs in open pine stands but not those with a cover of woody debris structures in clear-cuts, H-1, therefore, was only partially supported. A relatively higher proportion of adult than juvenile heather voles on clear-cuts did not support H-2: that these harvested sites would be dispersal sinks for young voles. Mean annual numbers of P. intermedius were positively correlated with those of M. longicaudus, at least on clear-cut sites, hence H-3 was not supported. Phenacomys intermedius was essentially absent from our closed-canopy mature/old-growth forests but occurred in many managed forest habitats at low abundance (density index of <= 1/ha). In early successional habitats after clear-cutting and in open young pine stands this species occurred at moderate abundance and generally appeared stable in numbers across these forest landscapes.

AB  - Trypanosomoses are parasitic diseases caused by flagellated protozoa called vector-borne trypanosomes. There are many species of trypanosome that infect a wide range of animal hosts. These Trypanosomes causes a disease that is often fatal, characterized by anemia, immunosuppression, and damage to the central nervous system. The economic losses associated with clinical cases, resulting in mortalities, neonatal deaths, abortions, cachexia, or drops in production, are significant. It mainly affects horses, buffalo, dromedaries, and Bactrian camels. Diagnosing these trypanosome species is challenging with a single test. In this study, two hundred and fifty blood samples were collected from camels: one hundred and fifty from Marsa Matrouh and one hundred from Aswan. Microscopic examination and multiplex-PCR were used to detect different species of trypanosomes. In addition to sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed to confirm Trypanosoma species in camels and compare them with Trypanosoma species in different hosts. The microscopic examination detected trypanosomes in only two samples, while multiplex PCR detected trypanosomes in thirty-five samples. Of the total collected samples, 25 (10%) were infected with Trypanosoma evansi, 4 (1.6%) were infected with Trypanosoma vivax, 4 (1.6%) were infected with Trypanosoma theileri, and 2 (0.8%) were infected with Trypanosoma simiae. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all T. evansi isolates from camels were clustered together in a single branch. T. saimei sequences were clustered with those from sheep and goats. T. theileria sequences were clustered with those detected in cow. Finally, T. vivax sequences were clustered with those from goat in Gabon. This study reports the first incidence for the presence T. theileria and co-infection with other three trypanosome species in camels from Egypt.

AB  - The world's largest extant fish, the whale shark Rhincodon typus, is one of the most-studied species of sharks globally. The discovery of predictable aggregation sites where these animals gather seasonally or are sighted year-round - most of which are coastal and juvenile-dominated - has allowed for a rapid expansion of research on this species. The most common method for studying whale sharks at these sites is photographic identification (photo-ID). This technique allows for long -term individual-based data to be collected which can, in turn, be used to evaluate population structure, build population models, identify long-distance movements, and assess philopatry and other population dynamics. Lagged identification rate (LIR) models have fewer underlying assumptions than more traditional capture mark recapture approaches, making them more broadly applicable to marine taxa, especially far-ranging megafauna species like whale sharks. However, the increased flexibility comes at a cost. Parameter estimations based on LIR can be difficult to interpret and may not be comparable between areas with different sampling regimes. Using a unique data-set from the Philippines with similar to 8 years of nearly continuous survey effort, we were able to derive a metric for converting LIR residency estimates into more intuitive days-per-year units. We applied this metric to 25 different sites allowing for the first quantitatively-meaningful comparison of sightings-derived residence among the world's whale shark aggregations. We validated these results against the only three published acoustic residence metrics (falling within the ranges established by these earlier works in all cases). The results were then used to understand residency behaviours exhibited by the sharks at each site. The adjusted residency metric is an improvement to LIR-based population modelling, already one of the most widely used tools for describing whale shark aggregations. The standardised methods presented here can serve as a valuable tool for assessing residency patterns of whale sharks, which is crucial for tailored conservation action, and can cautiously be tested in other taxa.

AB  - Rare plant species are suggested to be less resistant to herbivores than common species. Their lower apparency and the fact that they often live in isolated populations, resulting in fewer herbivore encounters, might have led to the evolution of reduced defences. Moreover, their frequent lower levels of genetic diversity compared with common species could negatively affect their resistance against enemies. However, the hypothesis that plant resistance depends on plant regional and local rarity, independently of habitat and competitive and growth strategy, lacks evidence. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the performance and preference of one belowground and three aboveground generalist invertebrate herbivores from different taxonomic groups as indicators of plant resistance. Herbivores were fed a total of 62 regionally and locally rare and common plant species from Switzerland. We accounted for differences in a plant's growth and competitive strategy and habitat resource availability. We found that regionally and locally rare and common plant species did not generally differ in their resistance to most generalist herbivores. However, one herbivore species even performed better and preferred locally and regionally common plant species over rarer ones, indicating that common species are not more resistant, but tend to be less resistant. We also found that all herbivore species consistently performed better on competitive and large plant species, although different herbivore species generally preferred and performed better on different plant species. The latter indicates that the use of generalist herbivores as indicators of plant-resistance levels can be misleading. Synthesis: Our results show that rare plant species are not inherently less resistant than common ones to herbivores. Instead, our results suggest that the ability of plants to allocate resources away from defence towards enhancing their competitive ability might have allowed plants to tolerate herbivory, and to become locally and regionally common.

AB  - Integrated community models-an emerging framework in which multiple data sources for multiple species are analyzed simultaneously-offer opportunities to expand inferences beyond the single-species and single-data-source approaches common in ecology. We developed a novel integrated community model that combines distance sampling and single-visit count data; within the model, information is shared among data sources (via a joint likelihood) and species (via a random-effects structure) to estimate abundance patterns across a community. Parameters relating to abundance are shared between data sources, and the model can specify either shared or separate observation processes for each data source. Simulations demonstrated that the model provided unbiased estimates of abundance and detection parameters even when detection probabilities varied between the data types. The integrated community model also provided more accurate and more precise parameter estimates than alternative single-species and single-data-source models in many instances. We applied the model to a community of 11 herbivore species in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, and found considerable interspecific variation in response to local wildlife management practices: Five species showed higher abundances in a region with passive conservation enforcement (median across species: 4.5x higher), three species showed higher abundances in a region with active conservation enforcement (median: 3.9x higher), and the remaining three species showed no abundance differences between the two regions. Furthermore, the community average of abundance was slightly higher in the region with active conservation enforcement but not definitively so (posterior mean: higher by 0.20 animals; 95% credible interval: 1.43 fewer animals, 1.86 more animals). Our integrated community modeling framework has the potential to expand the scope of inference over space, time, and levels of biological organization, but practitioners should carefully evaluate whether model assumptions are met in their systems and whether data integration is valuable for their applications.

AB  - Necrophagous insect species are widely used during death investigations primarily for the estimation of the minimum postmortem interval, since these species use decomposing organic matter for feeding, oviposition, and larval development. The development stages and successional colonization patterns provide important information for shorter or longer postmortem time intervals. Diptera species are the predominant taxa recovered from decomposed bodies. The temperature variance/seasonality is the main factor affecting the time presence and activity of these species. Other factors, such as geographical location, antemortem conditions, and cause of death, can influence the presence and succession of necrophagous entomofauna. Consequently, successional studies and information regarding species colonization patterns are needed for each geographical region to be used as reference data during death investigations. This study addressed the need to collect forensic entomological data for the State of North Dakota, within the first necrophagous entomofauna diversity report for the month of July 2022, using pig carcasses as human analogs. During the experimental period, 18 species of Diptera and Coleoptera were identified, with 10 new state records, while Calliphoridae was found to be the predominant family. The resulted data on necrophagous insect species diversity and dynamics from exposed pig carcasses will strengthen the current knowledge on forensic entomology in North Dakota and will serve as reference data to be used during death investigations in the Great Plains region.

AB  - BIM-LCA integration facilitates sustainability indicators in infrastructure projects; however, BIM-LCA integration poses interoperability and information exchange issues. This study develops a parametric-life-cycle-carbonassessment (PLCCA) model for automating data-integration, dynamic-computations, and online-visualization of carbon emissions. Emission factors (EFs) are systematically integrated as additional design parameters in the BIM-model. Carbon emissions are dynamically calculated using parameterized inputs. Rhino-Grasshopper plugins generate real-time bar charts and color codes inside BIM-environments. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) incorporates carbon emissions, materials, energy, and cost to optimize design parameters and facilitate early decisions. The performance and applicability of PLCCA are evaluated using a tunnel in Yunnan, China. Production and operational stages account for 30% and 65% of carbon emissions. Tunnel is then remodeled with optimized parameters; carbon emissions are recalculated to reduce environmental effects. Carbon emissions in the production and operational phases are reduced by 32.94% and 28.40%. This research educates project stakeholders on low-carbon techniques to attain carbon neutrality.

AB  - Captive breeding of wild animals can enhance conservation of species, while the prevalence of diseases and other pathological conditions is a very common issue in captive animals and birds. The present study investigated the prevalence of different diseases and health conditions among animal and bird species at 10 captive breeding facilities of Punjab, Pakistan. For this purpose, three-year data (2017-2019), regarding diseases and pathological conditions was collected from treatment register, stud books and post-mortem reports. Most prevalent health issues in animals were infectious diseases 26%, followed by generalized conditions 23%, gastrointestinal issues 17%, and cardiovascular issues 7%. In animals, out of total 102 different diseases and pathological conditions, the maximum variation was noted in mouflon sheep (Ovis orientalis orientalis), hog deer (Axis porcinus) and spotted deer (Axis axis). In birds, 37% infectious diseases, 24% generalized conditions, 15% gastrointestinal and 9% respiratory issues were recorded. Among infectious diseases, salmonellosis, infectious coryza and colibacillosis were most abundant with 34, 34 and 29 cases respectively. Out of 99 different diseases and pathological conditions in birds, maximum variety was recorded in ring-necked pheasant (Phasinaus colchicus), black-shouldered peafowl (Pavo cristatus) and green pheasant (Phasianus versicolor). Comparison of different study sites revealed that Lahore Zoo had the highest disease prevalence in animals with significance value 0.002 (p<0.05). To reduce prevalence of diseases and health issues, various strategies and guidelines given by international authorities such as Association of Zoos and Aquariums and European Association of Zoos and Aquaria should be adopted and implemented.

AB  - Low winter temperatures severely stress newly arriving insect species. Adaptive evolutionary changes in cold tolerance can facilitate their establishment in new environments. Ambrosia artemisiifolia, a noxious invasive plant, occurs throughout China. Ophraella communa, a biological control agent of A. artemisiifolia, mainly occurs in southern China. However, in 2012, it established populations in Beijing (39.98 degrees N, 115.97 degrees E) following introduction from Laibin (23.62 degrees N, 109.37 degrees E), implying cold adaptation. The mechanisms underlying its rapid evolution of cold tolerance remain unknown. We investigated the levels of cryoprotectants and energy reserves in adult O. communa from two latitudes. In high-latitude insects, we found high trehalose, proline, glycerol, total sugar, and lipid levels; five potential genes (Tret1a, Tret1b, Tret1-2, P5CS, and GST), responsible for regulating cold tolerance and involved in trehalose transport, proline biosynthesis, and glutathione S-transferase activation, were highly expressed. These hybridisation changes could facilitate cold temperature adaptation. We demonstrate the genetic basis underlying rapid adaptation of cold tolerance in O. communa, explaining its extension to higher latitudes. Thus, specialist herbivores can follow host plants by adapting to new temperature environments via rapid genetic evolution.

AB  - The accumulation of silicon (Si) is widely reported to have anti-herbivore defensive properties in grasses. There is emerging, but fragmentary, evidence that Si could play a similar role in legumes.Here, we sought to understand the effects of Si supplementation on anti-herbivore defensive properties in lucerne (Medicago sativa), especially in relation to other potential defences (i.e. phenolics) and the phytohormone that regulates anti-herbivore defences, jasmonic acid or jasmonate (JA), which is also linked to Si accumulation.We determined how growth, root nodulation and chemistry (carbon, nitrogen and phenolic concentrations) of four genotypes of lucerne responded to Si supplementation, with and without the application of JA, and we used feeding assays to determine the subsequent effects on the feeding success of adult Sitona discoideus weevils.Si supplementation increased plant mass and root nodulation of M. sativa by 61% and 227%, respectively, and reduced relative consumption (RC) and frass production by S. discoideus by 38% and 30% respectively. Si supplementation had no effect on foliar nitrogen concentrations, most likely due to the dilution effects of increased plant growth and foliar carbon. Phenolic concentrations were negatively correlated with leaf RC; RC also decreased by 34% when JA was applied to plants. When Si was combined with JA application, phenolics were significantly enhanced, demonstrating the potential to stimulate multiple anti-herbivore properties in M. sativa. Overall, the Si- and JA-induced phytochemical and herbivore feeding responses were consistent between the four lucerne genotypes tested.Synthesis. The novel findings suggest that Si accumulation may play a more important role in legume resistance to herbivorous animals than previously thought. The ubiquity of soil Si and its emerging functional role in plant biology, including plant-animal interactions, suggest that these patterns could be common among legumes.

AB  - Bonding between mothers and their young is fundamental to mammalian reproductive behaviour and individual fitness. In social systems where the risk of confusing filial and non-filial offspring is high, mothers should demonstrate early, strong and consistent responses to their kin throughout the period of offspring dependence, irrespective of maternal traits. We tested this hypothesis through playback experiments in the northern elephant seal Mirounga angustirostris, a phocid species that breeds in high-density colonies. We found that mothers recognized their offspring throughout lactation and as early as 1-2 days after parturition. Measures of experience (age) and temperament (aggressivity) did not predict their response strength to filial playback treatments, nor did pup age or sex. Some mothers showed great consistency in behavioural responses throughout the lactation period, while others were less predictable. The strength of a female's response did not influence her pup's weaning weight; however, more consistent females weaned pups of higher mass. This is a rare demonstration of individual recognition among phocid mothers and their offspring, and suggests that consistency in maternal responsiveness may be an important social factor influencing the pup's growth and survival.

AB  - Inactivation of growth differentiation factor 9 revealed its critical role for proper ovarian development and function in pigs.
   Growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) is a secreted protein belonging to the transforming growth factor beta superfamily and has been well characterized for its role during folliculogenesis in the ovary. Although previous studies in mice and sheep have shown that mutations in GDF9 disrupt follicular progression, the exact role of GDF9 in pigs has yet to be elucidated. The objective of this study was to understand the role of GDF9 in ovarian function by rapidly generating GDF9 knockout (GDF9(-/-)) pigs by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Three single-guide RNAs designed to disrupt porcine GDF9 were injected with Cas9 mRNA into zygotes, and blastocyst-stage embryos were transferred into surrogates. One pregnancy was sacrificed on day 100 of gestation to investigate the role of GDF9 during oogenesis. Four female fetuses were recovered with one predicted to be GDF9(-/-) and the others with in-frame mutations. All four had fully formed oocytes within primordial follicles, confirming that knockout of GDF9 does not disrupt oogenesis. Four GDF9 mutant gilts were generated and were grown past puberty. One gilt was predicted to completely lack functional GDF9 (GDF9(-/-)), and the gilt never demonstrated standing estrus and had a severely underdeveloped reproductive tract with large ovarian cysts. Further examination revealed that the follicles from the GDF9(-/-) gilt did not progress past preantral stages, and the uterine vasculature was less extensive than the control pigs. By using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we demonstrated that GDF9 is a critical growth factor for proper ovarian development and function in pigs.

AB  - This study analyzed the spatial variation of stable isotopes (delta N-15 and delta C-13) and the trophic position of three rocky reef fishes, Balistes polylepis, Stegastes rectifraenum and Kyphosus vaigiensis. According to previous feeding studies, these species are categorized as a benthic carnivore, an omnivore, and an herbivore, respectively. Specimens were sampled in two locations on the western Gulf of California: Bahia de La Paz and Santa Rosalia. For 815N, the mean value recorded in S. rectifraenum was 18.1 parts per thousand, followed by B. polylepis (17.7 parts per thousand), and K. vaigiensis (16.7 parts per thousand): omnivore-carnivore-herbivore. The mean 813C value recorded for K. vaigiensis was -13.6 parts per thousand, followed by S. rectifraenum (-14.9%) and B. polylepis (-16.1 parts per thousand): herbivore-omnivore-carnivore. delta N-15 and delta C-13 values differed significantly between locations, except for delta N-15 for K. vaigiensis and delta C-13 for S. rectifraenum. Differences in delta N-15 may probably be related to oceanographic differences in productivity between the areas or to discharges of anthropogenic compounds. In general, the differences in delta C-13 between La Paz and Santa Rosalia suggest that fishes have different feeding grounds in each of the locations studied. The mean trophic position, estimated from both isotopes, varied between 2.91 in K. vaigiensis and 3.65 in S. rectifraenum. In La Paz, the isotopic niches of the three species overlapped, while in Santa Rosalia this overlap was observed only between B. polylepis and S. rectifraenum. This study is one of the first to apply stable isotopes as a tool to depict the trophic structure of the diverse biota associated with rocky reefs in the Gulf of California. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hunting and fishing support diverse food systems in tropical forest areas, but carry serious occupational risks. Health and safety at work is important to human wellbeing and constitutes an element of Indigenous rights. This issue has received attention in the regulated sector, but needs additional focus in subsistence and informal economies. We draw on semi-structured interviews with Turumbo hunters and fishers in the Yangambi Biosphere Reserve region (DRC) to assess perceptions of occupational risk, especially attacks from wild animals. Fishers were concerned about drowning and cuts, while hunters cited bad weather and injuries from faulty equipment. There was gender-specific perception of risk from wild animals that reflected different roles: women noted snake bites and wasps, while men feared larger animals. Retaliatory behaviors among respondents included killing various species. The risks associated with fishing and hunting in tropical forests should be addressed in policies that consider the wellbeing of the poor.

AB  - Background The demand for productive economic plant resources is increasing with the continued growth of the human population. Ancient Pu'er tea trees [Camellia sinensis var. assamica (J. W. Mast.) Kitam.] are an important ecological resource with high economic value and large interests. The study intends to explore and evaluate critical drivers affecting the species' productivity, then builds formulas and indexes to make predicting the productivity of such valuable plant resources possible and applicable. Results Our analysis identified the ideal values of the seven most important environmental variables and their relative contribution (shown in parentheses) to the distribution of ancient Pu'er tea trees: annual precipitation, ca. 1245 mm (28.73%); min temperature of coldest month, ca. 4.2 degrees C (18.25%); precipitation of driest quarter, ca. 47.5 mm (14.45%); isothermality, 49.9% to 50.4% (14.11%); precipitation seasonality, ca. 89.2 (6.77%); temperature seasonality, ca. 391 (4.46%); and solar radiation, 12,250 to 13,250 kJ m(-2) day(-1) (3.28%). Productivity was indicated by the total value (viz. fresh leaf harvested multiplied by unit price) of each tree. Environmental suitability, tree growth, and management positively affected productivity; regression weights were 0.325, 0.982, and 0.075, respectively. The degree of productivity was classified as follows: > 0.8, "highly productive"; 0.5-0.8, "productive"; 0.3-0.5, "poorly productive"; and < 0.3, "unproductive". Overall, 53% of the samples were categorized as "poorly productive" or "unproductive"; thus, the management of these regions require attention. Conclusions This model improves the accuracy of the predictions of ancient Pu'er tea tree productivity and will aid future analyses of distribution shifts under climate change, as well as the identification of areas suitable for Pu'er tea tree plantations. Our modeling framework provides insights that facilitate the interpretation of abstract concepts and could be applied to other economically valuable plant resources.

AB  - The Lori-Bakhtiari fat-tailed sheep is one of the most important heavyweight native breeds of Iran. The breed is robust and well-adapted to semi-arid regions and an important resource for smallholder farms. An established nucleus-based breeding scheme is used to improve their production traits but there is an indication of inbreeding depression and loss of genetic diversity due to selection. Here, we estimated the inbreeding levels and the distribution of runs of homozygosity (ROH) islands in 122 multi-generational female Lori-Bakhtiari from different half-sib families selected from a breeding station that were genotyped on the 50k array. A total of 2404 ROH islands were identified. On average, there were 19.70 +/- 1.4 ROH per individual ranging between 6 and 41. The mean length of the ROH was 4.1 +/- 0.14 Mb. There were 1999 short ROH of length 1-6 Mb and another 300 in the 6-12 Mb range. Additionally long ROH indicative of inbreeding were found in the ranges of 12-24 Mb (95) and 24-48 Mb (10). The average inbreeding coefficient (F-ROH) was 0.031 +/- 0.003 with estimates varying from 0.006 to 0.083. Across generations, F-ROH increased from 0.019 +/- 0.012 to 0.036 +/- 0.007. Signatures of selection were identified on chromosomes 2, 6, and 10, encompassing 55 genes and 23 QTL associated with production traits. Inbreeding coefficients are currently within acceptable levels but across generations, inbreeding is increasing due to selection. The breeding program needs to actively monitor future inbreeding rates and ensure that the breed maintains or improves on its current levels of environmental adaptation.

AB  - Buffalo are mainly distributed in low-altitude (LA), medium-altitude (MA), and high-altitude (HA) regions characterised by different thermal and oxygen environments in Yunnan province, China. Due to black skin, sparse hair, and the low density of skin sweat glands, buffalo are more sensitive to heat stress. Here, we used data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics to reveal a broad spectrum of proteins that play roles in adaptation to the heat stress of buffalo raised at low altitude or hypoxia at high altitude. LA buffalo showed higher body temperatures than MA- and HA buffalo, and HA buffalo had higher levels of GSH and SOD and lower levels of ROS compared to LA and MA buffalo. In 33 samples, 8476 peptides corresponding to 666 high-confidence proteins were detected. The levels of circulating complement proteins in the immune pathways were lower in LA and MA buffalo than in HA buffalo. There were higher levels of alpha-1 acid glycoprotein in LA buffalo than in MA and HA buffalo. Relative to MA buffalo, levels of blood oxygen delivery proteins were higher in LA and HA buffalo. A higher abundance of apolipoproteins was detected in LA and MA buffalo than in HA buffalo. In summary, buffalo adopted similar adaptation strategies to oxidative stress induced by heat stress or hypoxia, including immunological enhancement, high efficiency of blood oxygen delivery, and the inhibition of lipid oxidation.

AB  - Host specificity in an Australian species of processionary moth was studied over three years in the eastern Australia states of Queensland and New South Wales. The processionary moth Ochrogaster lunifer is known as a species complex, characterised by several nesting forms coexisting in the same geographical area. The canopy nesting forms associated with acacias (Acacia spp.) and eucalypts (Eucalyptus spp. and Corymbia spp.) were recently shown to be genetically distinct, and they were here tested for host specificity by reciprocal transplant experiments. Egg masses and subsequent offspring were moved within and among putative hosts in field settings. Early larval colonies performed significantly better on their natal hosts than on the transplanted ones, with no difference observed for mature larval colonies. The genetic separation identified in previous work is, thus, confirmed by these ecological observations on host specificity, stressing the importance of host specialization in the ongoing speciation process.The 'mother knows best' hypothesis is tested in a species of processionary moth feeding on acacias and eucalypts in Australia. The processionary moth Ochrogaster lunifer (Lepidoptera: Notodontidae; Thaumetopoeinae) is a social caterpillar living in large colonies on a number of tree and shrub species. Five nesting types-canopy, trunk, tree-hugger, hanging, and ground-have been described, and this study deals with canopy nesters on various species of acacias (Acacia spp.) and eucalypts (Eucalyptus spp. and Corymbia spp.). Reciprocal transplant experiments conducted over three years confirm the 'mother knows best' hypothesis, as colonies performed better on the natal host plant than on the recipient ones. Young first instar larvae were less likely to establish on a non-natal host than the mature larvae, and all acacia-sourced canopy egg masses failed to establish on eucalypts. Large larvae were able to establish on transplant hosts. This suggests a strong preference-performance link at what is likely a species level, confirming preliminary results recently published on genetic divergence. Canopy nesting forms also have a lower realised fecundity than the ground nesting form on acacias from the same geographic area, but higher than another canopy nesting form from western Australia. Further observations on ecological and genetic traits are required to draw conclusions about the separation of lineages in the canopy nesting form of O. lunifer, by including populations from other parts of the range for both the herbivore and the host plants.

AB  - Generally, floral characteristics and pollination are important factors enhancing the quality and quantity of reproductive output for regeneration in plant conservation. However, lack of evidence-based management could decrease fitness under ex-situ conservation. We investigated the capitulum and pollination characteristics of Eriocaulon heleocharioides Satake (Eriocaulaceae), which is extinct in the wild, to develop an evidence-based conservation management plan incorporating previously ignored reproductive characteristics.
   To evaluate the functional characteristics of capitula, pollen-ovule ratio, and reproductive status (maximum pollination success/florivory damage) were investigated along six flowering sequences of capitulum. To evaluate the effect of plant density on pollen transfer, high- and low-density plots were established. Total deposited pollen on stigma, insect visitation, and visit duration per capitulum were observed.
   A significantly lower pollen-ovule ratio was observed in the first of six capitula, reflecting higher female functionality. The highest pollination success was found in the second-fourth capitula, whereas florivory increased along the terminal capitula position. High plant density affected the pollen deposited on stigmas via insect visitation and low pollinator visit duration.
   Different capitula in E. heleocharioides could have different effects: different sexual functionality, enhancement of reproductive output both in quality and quantity through active pollen transfer, and escaping from florivores. High plant density could facilitate outcross-pollen transfer in E. heleocharioides. Multiple perspectives are important for determining potential reproductive success in ex-situ conservation. Thus, density management reflecting capitulum characteristics could improve the efficiency of conservation efforts for E. heleocharioides.

AB  - Low Red (R) to Far Red (FR) light ratios, a light signal associated with vegetation shade, can prompt intact maize (Zea mays) plants to constitutively emit more volatiles when exposed to herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Here we investigated how simulated shading affects priming responses in the context of volatile-mediated plant-plant interactions. Receiver maize plants were exposed to either constitutive volatile organic compounds (cVOCs) or HIPVs from emitter maize plants, while we manipulated R: FR light conditions of receivers or emitters. Priming responses in the receivers were then assessed by measuring real-time volatile emissions following simulated herbivory. We show that low R: FR light enhances HIPVs emissions in plants previously exposed to HIPVs from neighbours independently of the light conditions of emitters. We also demonstrate that both cVOCs and HIPVs emitted by maize grown under low R: FR amplify HIPVs emissions in their neighbours. This amplified response could not be explained by FR-mediated changes in the release of green leaf volatiles or terpenoids by emitters, thus suggesting the involvement of other VOCs. We conclude that volatile-mediated plant-plant interactions can be expected to become more intense in denser canopies due to light-mediated amplification of volatile emission and responsiveness.

AB  - Composting and vermicomposting have attracted attention in relation to both waste management and the potential to produce organic amendments that could improve soil quality. The main differences between compost depend on the feedstock, the production process, and the degree of maturity. In the present study, samples of compost of different origin (food and green waste, livestock waste, algae waste, urban waste or sewage sludge) or subjected to different composting methods (traditional or using earthworms) were collected for analysis. Additionally, samples collected at various stages of the composting process were compared (raw material, 15 and 30 days of composting, and final compost). Different analysis and techniques were used to establish the chemical composition, physicochemical and acid-base properties of compost samples and the organic matter extracts. The correlations obtained (between the abundance of acid groups in different extracts of the compost or between the cation exchange capacity and the C/N atomic ratio) would allow for predicting the compost behaviour based on certain characteristics, and a reduction in the number of parameters determined experimentally, thus facilitating comparisons between different compost. In addition, the potential value of the compost as amendment was tested with a Haplic Cambisol from a mining area. The application of compost increased the pH, the organic matter and nutrient content, and promoted seed germination and root growth.

AB  - Bovine Ephemeral Fever Virus (BEFV) is a non-contagious virus that commonly infects cattle and water buffalo, reduces milk productivity, decreases the quality of beef, and causes an adverse economic impact on the global livestock industry. However, the evolution of BEFV is unclear, and uncertainty exists regarding its global geodynamics. Consequently, this study aims to comprehend the pattern of viral evolution and gene expression in the BEFV genes G, M, N, and P, including synonymous codons. Additionally, we performed recombination analyses, which exclusively detected recombination signals in the G- and P-genes. Subsequently, a phylogenetic tree was constructed to validate and support these findings. The codon usage bias results showed that the BEFV-selected genes were influenced by both natural and mutation pressure. Furthermore, nucleotide A is more abundant in all the selected genes. The eNC values, ranging from 42.99 to 47.10, revealed the presence of moderate codon usage bias, where gene P exhibited the highest and gene G had the lowest codon usage bias. The neutrality and PR-2 plots, specified codon usage patterns of the genes, are also being shaped by strong selectional pressure. This comprehensive analysis of BEFV genes (G, M, N, and P) sheds light on the molecular evolutionary patterns, co-adaptation, and different genes expression in diverse regions, facilitating the development of preventative programs and insights into viral pathogenesis and vaccine design.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - Although herbicide drift is a common side effect of herbicide application in agroecosystems, its effects on the ecology and evolution of natural communities are rarely studied. A recent shift to dicamba, a synthetic auxin herbicide known for 'drifting' to nontarget areas, necessitates the examination of drift effects on the plant-insect interactions that drive eco-evo dynamics in weed communities. We review current knowledge of direct effects of synthetic auxin herbicides on plant-insect interactions, focusing on plant herbivory, and discuss potential indirect effects, which are cascading effects on organisms that interact with herbicide-exposed plants. We end by developing a framework for the study of plant-insect interactions given drift, highlighting potential changes to plant developmental timing, resource quantity, quality, and cues.

T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE

KW  - AIR-POLLUTION
KW  - BEETLE
AB  - Environmental pollution is one cause of insect decline in the Anthropocene, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure due to a paucity of pollution-impact studies on insects that address density-dependent processes. Long data series (19-26 years) are available only for a few species monitored around two industrial polluters in north-western Russia. A particularly exciting current finding is that industrial pollution determines the relative strength of rapid (stabilising) and delayed (destabilising) density dependence operating on a herbivore population. Most studies address acute effects of traditional pollutants (e.g. sulphur dioxide and trace elements) and nitrogen deposition on agricultural pests, whereas the effects of realistic concentrations of ozone, particulate matter and emerging pollutants on insects feeding on noncultivated plants are unknown. The accumulated evidence remains insufficient to predict the effects of pollutants of global concern on the population dynamics of herbivorous insects.

AB  - In vertebrates, offspring survival often decreases with increasing maternal age. While many studies have reported a decline in fitness-related traits of offspring with increasing maternal age, the study of senescence in maternal effect through age-specific changes in offspring physiological condition is still at its infancy. We assessed the influence of maternal age and body mass on offspring physiological condition in two populations of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) subjected to markedly different environmental conditions. We measured seven markers to index body condition and characterize the immune profile in 86 fawns which became recently independent of their known-aged mothers. We did not find striking effects of maternal age on offspring physiological condition measured at 8 months of age. This absence of evidence for senescence in maternal effects is likely due to the strong viability selection observed in the very first months of life in this species. Offspring physiological condition was, on the other hand, positively influenced by maternal body mass. Between-population differences in environmental conditions experienced by fawns also influenced their average body condition and immune phenotype. Fawns facing food limitation displayed lower values in some markers of body condition (body mass and haemoglobin levels) than those living in good quality habitat. They also allocated preferentially to humoral immunity, contrary to those living in good conditions, which allocated more to cellular response. These results shed a new light on the eco-physiological pathways mediating the relationship between mother's mass and offspring condition.

AB  - Despite the significant removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) by anaerobic digestion, anaerobically-treated palm oil mill effluent (POME) still contains tannins and other phenolic compounds, resulting in residual COD and a brownish color. In this study, we investigated the removal of tannins from anaerobically treated POME using protein-tannin complexation in conjunction with electrocoagulation. The amino acid composition of the protein, aqueous pH, and protein: tannin ratios were found to be important parameters affecting the tannin removal efficiency. Pig blood protein was superior to casein protein in removing tannins, possibly because it had aspartic acid as the major amino acid component. At an optimal condition with a pig blood protein: tannin ratio of 0.33 (w/w), a current density of 30 mA/cm2, pH 5, and an electrolysis time of 10 min, the removals of tannins, COD, and color were 93%, 96%, and 97%, respectively.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever (ASF) has caused significant damage to wildlife and domestic pig production. Since the first confirmed case in South Korea, the number of infected wild boars has continued to increase despite various management operations. Hence, this study developed the ASF expansion model based on an agent-based modeling approach to simulate management strategies for assessing the effective control of ASF. In our model, the agents' (wild boars) behavior and daily movement range based on their ecological and behavioral characteristics by applying annual hunting scenarios from the past three years (2019.09-2022.08). Our results represented that the higher the hunting intensity, the smaller the ASF expansion area (24,987 km(2) at 0% annual hunting rate; 3533 km(2) at 70%). Furthermore, the complete removal of agents during the simulation period was shown to be possible through the annual hunting rate above 70%. In conclusion, an annual hunting intensity of 70% is needed to control ASF effectively. African swine fever (ASF) is a viral hemorrhagic fever fatal to animals of the Suidae family. It has spread from Africa to Europe and Asia, causing significant damage to wildlife and domesticated pig production. Since the first confirmed case in South Korea in September 2019, the number of infected wild boars has continued to increase, despite quarantine fences and hunting operations. Hence, new strategies are needed for the effective control of ASF. We developed an agent-based model (ABM) to estimate the ASF expansion area and the efficacy of infection control strategies. In addition, we simulated the agents' (wild boars) behavior and daily movement range based on their ecological and behavioral characteristics, by applying annual hunting scenarios from past three years (2019.09-2022.08). The results of the simulation based on the annual changes in the number of infected agents and the ASF expansion area showed that the higher the hunting intensity, the smaller the expansion area (24,987 km(2) at 0% vs. 3533 km(2) at 70%); a hunting intensity exceeding 70% minimally affected the expansion area. A complete removal of agents during the simulation period was shown to be possible. In conclusion, an annual hunting intensity of 70% should be maintained to effectively control ASF.

AB  - Animals concentrate key nutrients in their bodies. In fenced wildlife reserves where nutrient input and/or retention is low, the off-site removal of animals may constitute a significant loss of nutrients for the ecosystem.
   Here we add wildlife capture and removal into the phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca) budget for a 121,700 ha fenced game reserve located in the southern Kalahari. We then use faecal P concentrations from 11 mammal herbivores >10 kg as an indicator of potential nutrient stress in this system to investigate whether the implications of nutrient loss via off-site wildlife removal may be cause for concern. Finally, we assess the role of natural predation as a mechanism to minimise the need for wildlife removal and concomitant nutrient loss.
   During the period 2009-2018, mean loss of P and Ca via wildlife removal was 2.9 and 6.2 kg km(-2) year(-1), respectively. This compares to 1.0 and 2.1 kg km(-2) year(-1) of P and Ca added via the provision of mineral licks. If it is assumed that natural fluxes of these elements are in steady state, then anthropogenic activities have resulted in a net deficit of 18.5 kg/km(2) of P and 40.6 kg/km(2) of Ca over the decade.
   We found that dry season herbivore faecal P concentrations are close to or below a widely cited minimum threshold of 2,000 mg/kg, below which most vertebrates begin suffering growth and reproductive issues. Large animals were more likely to be under this threshold. Prolonged continuation of off-site wildlife removal may result in nutrient losses that can lead to long-term ecological degradation. Natural predation levels were, however, found sufficient to mitigate the need for wildlife removal and present a management strategy whereby herbivore populations can be regulated without a loss of nutrients.
   Synthesis and applications. We find that the capture and permanent removal of large-bodied animals from wildlife reserves can be a significant cause of nutrient loss. Over time, in sites where nutrient input and/or retention is low, this may contribute to nutritional stress for remaining resident animals. Where possible, holistic management strategies that promote the retention of animals and carcasses within the reserve-such as the reintroduction of large carnivores-should be preferred.

AB  - Societal Impact StatementThis study illuminates the underappreciated role of invertebrates in seed dispersal, extending beyond the well-documented contributions of ants. Focusing on Monotropastrum humile ((sic)(sic)(sic) [silver dragon plant] or (sic)(sic)(sic) [crystal orchid]), a non-photosynthetic plant known for its minuscule, dust-like seeds, the present research uncovers their seed dispersal roles of woodlice and earwigs in Japan. Remarkably, these invertebrates include the smallest known endozoochorous seed dispersers. Summary Endozoochory, or internal seed dispersal through the digestive tracts of animals, has been less studied in invertebrates compared with vertebrates. Nonetheless, endozoochory is plausible whenever seeds are small enough for ingestion by frugivorous animals, suggesting a potential role for invertebrates in seed dispersal, especially for plants with minute seeds. Monotropastrum humile (Ericaceae), characterized by its fleshy fruits and dust-like seeds, is known to utilize invertebrate agents such as camel crickets and cockroaches for seed dispersal. Here, we investigate this seed dispersal mechanism using time-lapse photography, feeding experiments, and seed coat anatomy analysis, particularly focusing on interactions among undocumented invertebrate internal seed dispersers. Field observations indicated that in the studied population, M. humile fruits were primarily consumed by camel crickets, woodlice, and earwigs. Their effectiveness as seed dispersers varied, with camel crickets primarily acting as dispersers, whereas earwigs and woodlice were more inclined toward seed predation. Nonetheless, some seeds defecated by earwigs and woodlice remained intact, suggesting that they could also function as dispersal agents. The woodlouse Porcellio scaber is now recognized as the world's smallest internal seed dispersal agent. Combined with earlier discoveries, such as seed dispersal by camel crickets, cockroaches, and ants, and the fact that P. scaber is an exotic species in the study site, M. humile likely depends on a broad spectrum of local invertebrates. The engagement of multiple invertebrate dispersers may enhance seed dispersal across diverse habitats.

AB  - Implementing nature-based solutions (NbSs) for wildfire risk management and other hazards has been challenging in emerging economies due to the high costs, the lack of immediate returns on investment, and stringent inclusion criteria set by organizations like the IUCN and domain experts. To address these challenges, this exploratory study proposes a new concept: green/blue initiatives. These initiatives represent intermediate steps, encompassing small-scale, community-driven activities that can evolve into recognized NbSs over time. To explore this concept, experiences related to wildfire prevention in the Biob & iacute;o region of Chile were analyzed through primary and secondary source reviews. The analysis identified three initiatives qualifying as green/blue initiatives: (1) goat grazing in Santa Juana to reduce fuel loads, (2) a restoration prevention farm model in Florida called Faro de Restauraci & oacute;n Mahuidanche and (3) the Conservation Landscape Strategy in Nongu & eacute;n. They were examined in detail using data collected from site visits and interviews. In contrast to Chile's prevailing wildfire policies, which focus on costly, large-scale fire suppression efforts, these initiatives emphasize the importance of reframing wildfire as a manageable ecological process. Lastly, the challenges and enabling factors for adopting green/blue initiatives are discussed, highlighting their potential to pave the way for future NbS implementation in central Chile.

AB  - The heavy metal, cadmium (Cd), has become a new threat to rice production in paddy fields. Cd is absorbed by rice roots and translocated to shoots, where it accumulates in different tissues. Rice is also commonly attacked by insect herbivores, but the effects of low-level Cd exposure on the performance of rice pests and the underlying mechanisms remain unexplored. We investigated brown planthopper (BPH) performance on Cd-exposed rice in the laboratory and field. Low-level Cd exposure did not significantly affect rice growth but decreased hatching rate and extended hatching duration of BPH eggs. No direct toxic effect of low Cd exposure on BPH eggs were found in in vitro developmental rate assays. By transcriptome analysis, a total of 747 rice genes were differentially expressed in Cd-exposed plants under BPH attack. Interestingly, BPH-elicited jasmonate (JA) and phenylpropanoid pathway genes were up-regulated by Cd exposure. Consistently, the levels of JAs and JA-mediated phenylpropanoid derivatives were also increased. Furthermore, Cd exposure did not affect BPH performance on mutant plants impaired in JA biosynthesis (aoc-2) and signaling (myc2-5), suggesting that JA is required to influence BPH performance under Cd exposure. In the field, herbivore populations were reduced on Cd-treated plants compared with control plants. This study revealed that low-level Cd exposure primes JA-mediated defense responses in rice and thereby affects herbivore performance.

AB  - Biochar is considered as a promising additive with multi-benefits to compost production. However, how the biochar properties and composting conditions affect the composting process and quality and ecological risk of compost is still unclear. In the present study, we conducted a global meta-analysis based on 876 observations from 84 studies. Overall, regardless of biochar properties and composting conditions, biochar addition could significantly increase the pH (5.90%), germination index (26.6%), contents of nitrate nitrogen (56.6%), total nitrogen (9.50%), and total potassium (10.1%), and degree of polymerization (29.4%) while decrease the electrical conductivity (-5.70%), contents of ammonium nitrogen (-33.7%), bioavailable zinc (-22.9%), and bioavailable copper (-38.6%), and emissions of ammonia (-44.2%), nitrous oxide (-68.4%), and methane (-61.7%). Other compost indicators, including the carbon to nitrogen ratio and total phosphorus content, were found to be insignificantly affected by biochar addition. The responses of tested compost indicators affected by the biochar properties and composting conditions were further explored, based on which the addition of straw biochars at a rate of 10-15% was recommended due to its greater potential to improve quality of compost and reduce its ecological risk. Combining the results of linear regression analysis and structural equation model, the increase in compost pH caused by biochar addition was identified as the key mechanism for the increased nutrient content and decreased heavy metal bioavailability. These results could guide us to choose suitable kinds of biochar or develop engineered biochars with specific functionality to realize an optimal compost production mode. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Novel host plants are incorporated into the diets of phytophagous insects when females oviposit and juveniles feed and survive on them. A change in diet, however, can have morphological consequences. We recently found a population of the leaf-footed cactus bug, Narnia femorata (Hemiptera: Coreidae), a historical cactus specialist, living and feeding on Cirsium thistle. We also found adults breeding and males using their enlarged hind legs (i.e., weapons) in male-male combat on thistle. When we compared this thistle population with a population feeding on cactus, we found that both populations had similar body and weapon sizes as well as weapon composition. However, the population living on thistle had longer mouthparts than the population found on cactus, although this difference only occurred at larger body sizes. This difference in adult mouthpart size is likely a result of the juvenile rearing environment (i.e., thistle or cactus). However, genetic differences may also affect this trait. Our results provide some interesting avenues for future research (e.g., a reciprocal transplant experiment) in a species with a recent host range expansion.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that plankton can be a key pathway for the uptake and transfer of contaminants entering the marine environment up to top predators.The plankton-contaminant MERITE-HIPPOCAMPE cruise was devoted to quantifying contaminants in water and the whole plankton size range (10 size fractions) at 10 stations along a north-south transect in the western Mediterranean Sea from the French to the Tunisian coasts through the Provencal and Algerian basins. Pumping and filtering devices and net sampling have been used for collecting very high amounts of small particles and planktonic organisms in the chlorophyll maximum layer (CML). The present paper characterizes the zooplankton components for which the contaminant measurements were carried out. At each station, a horizontal towed Hydro-Bios net with a 60 & mu;m mesh-size net was used to discriminate 5 size-fractions from 60 & mu;m to a few mm. For each size-fraction, one part of the sample was used for dry weight measurements and the other one for estimating the contribution to biomass of detritus, phytoplankton, and among zooplankton of the major taxonomic groups based on the imagery tools ZOOSCAN and FLOWCAM. In each zooplankton size fraction, metabolic rates were calculated from the size spectrum to estimate trophic and excretion fluxes flowing through this fraction. These observations were compared to a similar analysis of tows in the upper layer (vertical) and the surface layer (horizontal).The total sampled biomass concentration at the CML was higher than in the water column (COL) and much higher than at the surface (SURF) in most of the stations, but in the CML and COL a substantial contribution was due to detritus mostly concentrated in the smallest size-fractions (60-200 & mu;m and 200-500 & mu;m). Absolute values of zooplankton biomass show neither a clear spatial pattern nor a significant difference between strata. The CML layer was dominated by copepods similarly to COL and SURF, but presented a higher contribution of nauplii and a near absence of appendicularians. At some stations, crustaceans and gelatinous plankton could be important contributors to CML. The zooplankton biomass composition of the two smallest fractions (<500 & mu;m) was dominated by nauplii, small copepods and, occasionally, by small miscellaneous organisms (mostly pteropodes). In contrast, clear differences between stations appeared for the largest fractions (>500 & mu;m) due to large crustaceans, gelatinous organisms, and chaetognaths. These changes in biomass composition according to size fractions suggest a progressive trophic shift from dominant herbivory in the smallest fractions to more contrasted trophic structure (including carnivory) in the largest fractions.The daily carbon demand and the N and P excretion of zooplankton were on average higher at the CML but with no significant difference with COL. The zooplankton grazing represented 2.7 to 22.7 % of the phytoplankton stock per day, whereas its excretion represented a daily N and P recycling compared to dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus stocks ranging respectively from 0.2 to 19 % and from 0 to 21 %. This information should help in the interpretation of the content of various contaminants in zooplankton fractions.

AB  - China's deer population is rich in resources and species; how to improve the health status of the deer population and reduce the occurrence of intestinal diseases is a necessary direction for current research. In this study, Enterococcus faecalis was used as the research object to explore the effect of lactic acid bacteria on deer growth performance and intestinal health and to further investigate the role played by lactic acid bacteria on the intestinal health status of deer. The results of this study showed that the addition of Enterococcus faecalis to the feed promoted weight gain, improved immune function, altered the structure of the intestinal flora of fallow deer, especially increasing the abundance of Firmicutes phylum, and increased the abundance of the Ruminococcaceae and Lacertococcaceae at the same phylum as that of Enterococcus faecalis. Furthermore, metabolomic analyses also revealed that Enterococcus faecalis supplementation increased the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and phospholipids by the intestinal microbiota. In conclusion, this study revealed the beneficial effects of lactic acid bacteria on growth traits, immunity and intestinal health of deer and provided a scientific basis for the further development of deer-specific probiotic products to promote intestinal health and reduce intestinal diseases in deer species in the future. Intestinal diseases are one of the diseases that affect the growth and immunity of deer. Currently, more lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are available as feed additives to improve the intestinal ecological balance of ruminants in production practices. In this study, Enterococcus faecalis was supplemented in the feed of fallow deer for 170 d, and body weights, blood indices and immune levels of fallow deer were counted at 35, 65 and 170 d. The effects of Enterococcus faecalis on the intestinal microbiota and the metabolism of fallow deer were analysed using 16S rDNA and UPLC-MS/MS methods. The results showed that the addition of Enterococcus faecalis to the diet improved body weight and immune function and increased the aggregation of gut microbiota in fallow deer. The addition of Enterococcus faecalis altered the community structure of intestinal microorganisms in fallow deer and increased the number of beneficial bacteria. In addition, combined with metabolomics analysis, it was found that supplementation with Enterococcus faecalis significantly altered the metabolites of fallow deer, mainly regulating lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and phospholipid metabolism. In conclusion, this study presents, for the first time, evidence that the LAB strain Enterococcus faecalis can be used as a potential probiotic for deer and points to a new direction for the treatment of intestinal disorders in the deer family.

AB  - Effects of parental age on juvenile survival are well documented, but whether parental age has long-term consequences for the fitness of surviving offspring remains poorly understood. This is particularly the case for polygynous mammals, where differential impacts on sons versus daughters are predicted. Here, we investigate the effects of maternal and paternal age on offspring first-year survival, longevity, lifetime reproduction, and annual reproduction in a wild Soay sheep population. We find that younger and older mothers produced offspring that were less likely to survive their first year than middle-aged mothers, and this effect was independent of offspring sex. However, among offspring that survived their first year, adult lifespan and lifetime reproductive success were only influenced by maternal age in sons and not in daughters. Increased adult reproductive success in sons of middle-aged mothers, compared to young and old mothers, was not driven by maternal age effects on offspring reproductive ageing patterns, but potentially by consistent effects on offspring average annual reproductive performance. There was weak evidence of a paternal age effect on offspring longevity but no effect on other offspring traits. Our study shows long-lasting, sex-dependent maternal age effects on offspring fitness traits in the wild, adding to the growing body of literature that highlights the potential importance of intergenerational effects in natural populations.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that the global biomass of fish in the ocean is dominated by meso- and bathypelagic fish. However, despite their abundance and important role in marine ecosystems, their trophic ecology remains poorly understood. Feeding studies of meso-/bathypelagic fish are temporally and geographically scattered and apply different methodologies. A meta-analysis of published fatty acid and stable isotope data was conducted to determine the diet patterns of 23 meso-/bathypelagic fish species. The dataset was processed using logratio analysis resulting in a set of six biochemically important logratios which explained 91.5% of the total variance. The results demonstrate a gradient of feeding strategies from trophic level 2.17-3.38 and interspecific variation in the content of key fatty acid trophic markers indicated a potential gradient of meso-/bathypelagic consumers of herbivorous to carnivorous prey. Stable isotope analysis showed statistically significant differences in isotopic values of fish sampled in different locations and characterized by different fatty acid trophic markers, whereas trophic diversity and redundancy were explored based on six community metrics. Our study serves as a global perspective on the trophic ecology of meso-/bathypelagic fish based on currently available biochemical data. This type of studies, derived from the combination of fatty acid and stable isotope analyses could potentially be useful in large-scale comparisons of meso-/bathypelagic fish trophic ecology studies and that would ultimately better define their function in the global oceanic ecosystem.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is a critical component of the soil system and a sensitive indicator of soil quality. We aimed to investigate the response of SOM pools to different land uses and management in irrigated croplands of the semi-arid region of northeast Brazil. Four sites irrigated under long-term (29 years) land uses were selected: banana (B1 and B2); elephant grass (EG) -perennial systems; maize and cowpea succession (MCP) -annual system; B1 was cropped for 17 years +2 years of maize and cowpea +17 years banana, while B2 was continu-ously cropped. A native forest (NF) site was selected as reference of steady state. Soil samples were collected at four depths in the rows and inter-rows of each management system. The higher decline in SOM fractions was perceived at 0-0.05 m depth and microbial indices (microbial biomass C and N, and basal respiration and metabolic quotient) were very sensitive indicators of soil quality. Perennial systems (B1 and EG) maintained the C and N stocks at higher levels equivalent to NF at the 0-0.40 m layer, while MCP and B2 had lower total organic carbon (TOC) (15 and 17%, respectively) and total nitrogen stocks (4.27 and 8.67%, respectively). Perennial cultivation with B1 and EG showed also the highest soil C and N microbial biomass and stratification ratio and, the lowest respiratory quotients, all indications of elevated soil C sequestration. In general, land use change from native forest to annual crops reduced plant residue input and increased soil disturbance, favoring higher SOM mineralization, while perennial crops and grasses were the most effective in increasing C and N stocks due to the maintenance of crop residues on the soil surface and the absence of soil tillage.

AB  - Insights into the habitat use and spatial distribution of wild ungulates is crucial for effective conservation planning. The Kashmir musk deer, Moschus cupreus Grubb, 1982, categorised as endangered by the IUCN, remains one of the India's least studied mammals within its distributional range. This study, conducted from June 2021 to May 2023 in the Kazinag National Park, aimed to unravel the habitat use of the species for conservation planning in the region. Based on the reconnaissance surveys and information gathered from locals, forest officials, and field guides, trails/transects (n = 12) spanning 2000 to 3500 m a.s.l. were surveyed, encompassing various habitat types. Generalized Linear Model analysis revealed significant influence of livestock and distance to the nearest water source on musk deer signs. A total of 74 sightings (direct and indirect) were recorded. Habitat use was quantified using Ivelv's electivity index (IEI). The Kashmir musk deer exhibited the highest preference for mixed coniferous forests (IEI = 0.27), while rocky cliffs were the least favoured (IEI = -0.6). Southwestern aspects and a crown cover of 25-50% were highly preferred. Most sightings (58.10%) occurred at distances greater than 1200 m from livestock. These findings offer valuable insights for conservation strategies within the national park and surrounding areas, aiming to ensure the long-term survival of the Kashmir musk deer and other wildlife.

AB  - Caprine herding in the hyper-arid zone of the Southern Levant emerged in the early Holocene during a brief moist episode (-9500 years ago) within semi-permanent Middle PPNB settlements that depended on herding, farming, and hunting/foraging, organized within a transhumant land use strategy. With the onset of much drier conditions (-9200 years ago) these Desert Neolithic settlements were abandoned in Late PPNB times giving way to Timnian groups that followed a more mobile settlement strategy with an emphasis on herding accompanied by range expansion. Through introducing a case study of the Desert Neolithic site of Ayn Abu over bar Nukhayla and a deep sounding in a nearby dry lake bed, climatic-environmental fluctuations, human demographics, resource availability and land use strategies are evaluated as interwoven effects relative to the progressive shifts seen between prehistoric human populations and caprine herds. And these changes are viewed in the context of cultural macroevolutionary theory, specifically in the framework of Niche Construction Theory (NCT), in weighing the differential influences of human agency and natural selection on the process.

AB  - An understanding of the long-term trends of ground height and sedimentation in a landscape context can provide a framework to better understand the impacts of agricultural development on floodplain processes. This study examined long-term changes in ground height using surface elevation tables (SETs) and sediment deposition measurements in the Cache River floodplains of Southern Illinois including Taxodium distichum swamps in Crawford Tract and Eagle Pond from 2019 to 2022 and in Deer Pond and Snake Hole from 2005 to 2022. The mean ground heights of these swamps decreased by a mean of -0.33, -033, -0.28 and -0.19 cm year(-1), respectively. Annual sediment deposition on feldspar markers in Crawford Tract was negligible from 2020 to 2022 (range of annual deposition depth: <0.1 to 0.4 cm). However, sediment deposition at Deer Pond and Snake Hole was higher from 2006 to 2021 (range of annual deposition depth: <0.1-2.5 and <1 to 2.0 cm, respectively). In some years, the sites appeared scoured, and the feldspar markers had disappeared. The loss of ground height in these swamps could be related to erosion, increased precipitation and/or downcutting of the channel following the construction of a major diversion to dewater the floodplain via the Post Creek Cutoff in the early 1900s. Despite the limitations of this study toward revealing specific mechanisms linking floodplain erosion to channel downcutting and the engineered features of this landscape, this study clearly showed that Cache floodplains have lost height in past decades with potential consequences for the conservation of natural forests.

AB  - Simple Summary Industrial hemp is currently being investigated as a potential new crop in the U.S. after the passage and approval of the 2014 and 2018 Farm Bills. Hemp plants grow efficiently, and its seeds are used in the production of hemp oil, leaving hempseed meal (HSM) as a byproduct, which is reported to be rich in crude protein (CP) around 30-38% on a dry matter basis and fiber, making it a possible feedstuff and a protein source for ruminants. However, limited work has been carried out to evaluate the effects of utilizing HSM as feedstuffs for goats on their carcass characteristics. This study aims to investigate the effects of feeding various levels of HSM on the carcass traits of the crossbred Boer goats. Results suggest that including up to 30% of HSM in the diet of growing meat goats has no adverse effects on their carcass traits and meat quality. These results might be encouraging for the hemp industry as HSM could potentially be marketed and used as an alternative protein source for livestock. Hempseed meal (HSM) is the byproduct of hemp seeds and is rich in crude protein and fiber, making it an ideal candidate as a feedstuff for ruminants. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects of feeding different levels of HSM on the carcass traits of crossbred Boer goats. Forty castrated goat kids (approximately six months, 25.63 +/- 0.33 kg) were assigned to one of four treatments (n = 10) in a completely randomized design. Goats were fed pelleted diets (50% forage and 50% concentrate) with additional supplementation of HSM: control with 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% of the total diets. Goats were harvested and processed after a 60-day feeding trial. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in the mean values of dressing percentages, carcass weights, body wall thickness, and ribeye area among treatments. Marbling scores and percentages of moisture, fats, proteins, and collagen in the muscles showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) among the treatments. Results suggest that including up to 30% of HSM in the diet of growing meat goats does not affect their carcass traits.

AB  - The drastic fluctuations in pork prices directly affect the sustainable development of pig farming, agriculture, and feed processing industries, reducing people's happiness and sense of gain. Although there have been extensive studies on pork price prediction and early warning in the literature, some problems still need further study. Based on the monthly time series data of pork prices and other 11 influencing prices (variables) such as beef, hog, piglet, etc., in China from January 2000 to November 2023, we have established a project pursuit auto-regression (PPAR) and a hybrid PPAR (H-PPAR) model. The results of the PPAR model study show that the monthly pork prices in the lagged periods one to three have an important impact on the current monthly pork price. The first lagged period has the largest and most positive impact. The second lagged period has the second and a negative impact. We built the H-PPAR model using the 11 independent variables (prices), including the prices of corn, hog, mutton, hen's egg, and beef in lagged period one, the piglet's price in lagged period six, and by deleting non-important variables. The results of the H-PPAR model show that the hog price in lagged period one is the most critical factor, and beef price and the other six influencing variables are essential factors. The model's performance metrics show that the PPAR and H-PPAR models outperform approaches such as support vector regression, error backpropagation neural network, dynamic model average, etc., and possess better suitability, applicability, and reliability. Our results forecast the changing trend of the monthly pork price and provide policy insights for administrators and pig farmers to control and adjust the monthly pork price and further enhance the health and sustainable development of the hog farming industry.

AB  - Generalist populations often harbor individual dietary specialists. Whether using a narrower set of resources than the population (= specialization) affects specialists' nutrient intake remains underexplored. We evaluated variation in ingredient and nutrient specialization in a European brown bear Ursus arctos population via the Proportional Similarity Index (PSi, from 0 = highly specialized to 1 = not specialized) and assessed associations of specialization with year, season and reproductive class. Different methodologies concerning the organization of raw data for PSi calculations were evaluated (i.e. the resolution of diet compositional data (feces vs the average of all feces per individual) and temporal restrictions for the population (year-round vs within-season). Overall, a tendency for ingredient specialization (PSi 0.37 +/- 0.14) and absence of nutrient specialization (PSi 0.79 +/- 0.10) was observed. Ingredient specialization was mainly influenced by the proportion of berries, graminoids, oats and moose in the diet. Annual, seasonal and reproductive class effects were moderate and did not strongly affect PSi for both ingredients and nutrients. Organizing diet compositional data from a 'feces resolution' to 'individual resolution' decreased specialization. Changing the comparative population in PSi calculations from 'all-year-round' to 'within year and season' also resulted in less pronounced specialization. The degree of specialization was not caused by individuals exhibiting consistent ingredient preferences over the years (low repeatability of PSi) except in spring. Our results suggested absence of nutrient specialization and mild ingredient specialization, which appeared to be an outcome of the ecological circumstances rather than specific individual traits. Additionally, we demonstrated that the methods applied can have substantial influence for the calculation of specialization indices.

AB  - Organisms inhabiting extreme thermal environments, such as desert birds, have evolved spectacular adaptations to thermoregulate during hot and cold conditions. However, our knowledge of selection for thermoregulation and the potential for evolutionary responses is limited, particularly for large organisms experiencing extreme temperature fluctuations. Here we use thermal imaging to quantify selection and genetic variation in thermoregulation in ostriches (Struthio camelus), the world's largest bird species that is experiencing increasingly volatile temperatures. We found that females who are better at regulating their head temperatures ("thermoregulatory capacity") had higher egg-laying rates under hotter conditions. Thermoregulatory capacity was both heritable and showed signatures of local adaptation: females originating from more unpredictable climates were better at regulating their head temperatures in response to temperature fluctuations. Together these results reveal that past and present evolutionary processes have shaped genetic variation in thermoregulatory capacity, which appears to protect critical organs, such as the brain, from extreme temperatures during reproduction.
   Large animals inhabiting extreme thermal environments, such as deserts, are predicted to be particularly vulnerable to the increasing temperature fluctuations expected in the future. However, previous work on the evolutionary potential of thermoregulation has primarily focused on the effect of hot temperatures on the survival of small ectotherms. We know little about how large endothermic vertebrates, such as birds, will respond to changing temperatures. Here we study the ostrich (Struthio camelus ), the world's largest bird, that inhabits some of the hottest and driest regions on Earth. We show that the ability of females to reproduce during hot conditions is associated with the regulation of their head temperatures ("thermoregulatory capacity"). Furthermore, variation in thermoregulation is heritable and related to past climatic conditions: females originating from parts of Africa with more extreme temperature fluctuations were better able to thermoregulate, indicating local adaptation to different climatic conditions. Together, these results suggest that thermoregulation in this large desert bird has evolved in response to past climatic conditions, remains genetically variable, and is currently under selection through its effect on reproduction.

AB  - The dependency of the anti-herbivore defense on ant-plant protective mutualism often varies depending on abiotic and biotic conditions. Although intraspecific competition is a primary interaction between neighboring plants, its effects on ant-plant mutualisms have yet to be sufficiently elucidated. In order to determine the effects of intraspecific competition and competitor genotype on ant-plant mutualisms, I conducted competition and ant-removal experiments and examined their effects on damage to the leaves of Urena lobata var. tomentosa plants. I found that larger numbers of worker ants visited the plants growing with non-siblings than plants growing alone and that plants growing with non-siblings had a higher shoot to root ratio and secreted greater volumes of extrafloral nectar than plants growing alone and/or with siblings. Under the presence of both sibling and non-sibling competitors, I observed that when ants were removed from plants, those grown with conspecific neighbors were characterized by a higher percentage of damaged leaf area than plants harboring ants. The effect of ant exclusion on leaf damage was more pronounced in plants grown with non-siblings than those grown near siblings. However, when the plants were grown alone, I detected no significant difference in percentage leaf damage between the ant-excluded and ant-harboring plants. The results indicate that neighboring plants can exert strong effects on ant-plant protective mutualisms, thereby highlighting the need to take into consideration plant-plant interactions in studies on these mutualistic associations.

AB  - Local people knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) have played an important role in human-wildlife coexistence and have received increased attention in biodiversity conservation. However, studies on the KAP of local people towards human-carnivore coexistence (HCC) are scarce, species-specific or limited to the protected areas. Therefore, we investigated the local people KAP towards carnivore coexistence with humans, the problem of livestock and mitigation practices in a human-dominated landscape of southern Ethiopia. We collected the data from 352 households interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire and photographic sampling. The respondents mentioned 13 carnivores coexisting with local people belonging to six families. Eighty-five percent of the respondents perceived carnivores as problematic species and expressed a negative attitude towards them, primarily due to the damage they caused to their livestock. Respondents who had better knowledge of carnivores also showed a positive attitude towards carnivores. The cluster analysis showed that the spotted hyena, serval, leopard, common genet and black-backed jackal were grouped under a high-threat cluster. Chickens and goats were the most threatened livestock reported by respondents. The main predation control methods reported were guarding and fencing for larger livestock and keeping chickens indoors during the night. The regression models predicted that males and literate respondents had better knowledge of carnivores than females and illiterates. The respondents who owned more livestock experienced more damage to livestock, and females showed a negative attitude towards carnivores. Although the study area is the critical conservation value of the 13 carnivore species, livestock predation by carnivores, the local people's negative attitude towards carnivores and lethal predation control methods practiced by local people were affecting HCC in the area. The findings call for conservation actions such as conservation education to raise awareness and develop a positive attitude and non-lethal predation mitigation measures to promote HCC in consultation with the local community.

AB  - Little yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) and big head croaker (Collichthys lucidus) are economically important fishes of the Lyusi fishing ground. The intestinal bacterial communities of L. polyactis and C. lucidus were examined using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology. The Shannon and Chao-1 indices of the small body length group were significantly larger than those of the large body length group, and the Simpson index was the opposite (P < 0.05). Pseudomonas and Photobacterium of L. polyactis were significantly less abundant than those of C. lucidus (P < 0.05), and Clostridium sensu stricto and Acinetobacter were significantly more abundant than those of C. lucidus (P < 0.05). The abundance of Pseudomonas in L. polyactis increased significantly with increasing body length (P < 0.05), and the abundances of Psychrobacter and Acinetobacter decreased significantly with increasing body length (P < 0.05). The abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto in the large body length group was significantly increased compared with that in the small body length group (P < 0.05). The abundance of Vibrio first increased significantly and then decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing body length. The abundances of Pseudomonas and Photobacterium of C. lucidus increased significantly with increasing body length (P < 0.05). The abundance of Psychrobacter in the large body length group was significantly lower than that in the other groups (P < 0.05). Clostridium sensu stricto was significantly more abundant in the small body length group than in the other groups (P < 0.05). Vibrio was significantly more abundant in the small body length group than in the other groups (P < 0.05). Studies have shown that the feeding range of L. polyactis is wider than that of C. lucidus. Compared with C. lucidus, L. polyactis is less carnivorous and more herbivorous. The carnivorous habit of the two fish became more and more obvious with the increase of body length. The Clostridium sensu stricto related to herbivory of the two fishes may be related to the need to degrade indirectly ingested plants. The larval stages of the two fishes had a higher proportion of Vibrio.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of the combination of phosphogypsum with calcium oxide (PPG + CaO), superphosphate with calcium oxide (SSP + CaO) and zeolite (Zeolite) on composting maturity and heavy metal passivation in pig manure composting. The results showed that all treatments reached the maturity requirements and the phosphorus-containing additive treatments had higher final germination indices (GIs). Compared with CK, additive treatments enhanced the compost maturity by promoting volatile fatty acids (VFAs) decomposition (26.4%-30.5%) and formation of stable humus substances. All additive amendment treatments increased humic acid-like substances by over 20%, and the PPG + CaO treatment had the highest level of humus. Composting process reduced the bioavailability of Cu (49.2%), Cd (5.0%), Cr (54.3%), and Pb (26.6%). Correlation analysis found that the heavy mental passivation rate was significantly negatively correlated with the contents of VFAs and nitrogenous substances, and positively correlated with the pH, GI, humic acid content and the ratio of humic acid to fulvic acid (HA/FA). Therefore, the PPG + CaO treatment further increased the passivation rates of Cu (65.6%), Cd (21.7%), and Pb (48.7%) and decreased the mobilization of Zn by promoting maturity and humification during composting.

AB  - Developing conservation and management strategies for species with complex life histories, broad spatial dis-tributions, and long lifespans is notoriously difficult. Too often managers cannot identify critical habitats nor vulnerable life stages because of the sheer scale of migration or uncertainty about connectivity among pop-ulations. Advancements in otolith stable isotope analysis, and specifically sampling of discrete otolith layers, have provided opportunities to assess lifetime migrations and connectivity without extensive, long-term field sampling. Here, we compared carbon and oxygen stable isotope values in discrete otolith layers for Crevalle Jack (an unregulated and data-poor species) captured in two isotopically distinct regions (Alabama and the Florida Keys). Our goal was to address vital questions about how broad-scale movement patterns through ontogeny differ between the two regions and whether connectivity occurs throughout the life history. Our results revealed that Crevalle Jack appear to inhabit inshore nursery areas at age-0, before migrating to coastal/offshore habitats between age-1 and age-2. Comparisons between fish collected in northeastern and southeastern Gulf of Mexico regions revealed significant differences in the patterns of stable isotope values throughout the life history and in otolith delta 13C values. Despite these differences that suggest a separation of the two populations, individual vari-ability was significant, hindering our ability to determine whether fish from the two regions represent separate, self-recruiting stocks. Our research illustrates the potential of otolith stable isotope micro-sampling as a tool for examining broad-scale movement and migration patterns of fishes, and informing future research and management.

AB  - Time resolution of shell middens is normally addressed through estimation of shell accumulation rates, where calculations are based on radiocarbon analysis. Density values by volume or discard rates by time units are also normally estimated for comparative purposes. In this paper, we support the idea that time has many measurable properties in archaeological deposits. These can be used as tapho-chronometric tools (e.g., bone weathering, shell fragmentation, soil formation, etc.) to identify differential time-averaging in shell midden formation, and to evaluate their archaeological implications regarding the material record. One site in the Beagle Channel, Argentina, was chosen to (a) demonstrate how different processes that interact in shell midden formation can provide information on temporal resolution and (b) discuss the implications of the time-averaged properties of shell middens for different analytical approaches and methodological pathways. Results show that several factors involved in the formation of mounds should be addressed prior to advancing interpretations about different behavioral aspects of the past: a) shell deposits do not necessarily represent a gradual accumulation of waste; b) these middens can represent occupations of varied duration that are expressed independently of both the thickness of the deposit and the rate of accumulation of the material; c) the formation of shell middens includes the actions of several cultural and natural processes that occur over variable time spans; d) re-occupations modify the shell deposits produced by previous occupations in the same location. Finally, we argue that to explore shell middens as time-averaged records helps to clarify distinctive aspects of mound formation, which in turn have significant effects on archaeological interpretations.

AB  - The first objective of this study was to develop a thermal stress index for sheep based on environmental and animal data collected in a climate chamber under various environmental conditions. The second objective was to compare published indices of thermal comfort and the proposed index, testing them with the data from this study, with the objective of pointing out the most adequate index to be used by breeders when choosing management procedures. A total of 3024 data were obtained for the physiological variables of the sheep exposed to the eight thermal conditions in the climatic chamber and in ambient condition, kept three days in each thermal condition. A principal component analysis summarized the measurements of physiological variables into only one variable (y1). Using SigmaPlot software, multiple regression of y1 with the environmental variables and their combinations produced a number of indices. The equation chosen was the heat stress index for sheep, TSI = 24.153 - (0.0523*AT) + (0.746*BGT) + (4.104*Vp), with R2 = 0.668. The correlations presented high values, where these correlation values were assumed to indicate the efficiency of each index as indicators of the animals' response to the environment. Thus, it was assumed that the TSI presents a high efficiency.

AB  - Durophagous vertebrates feed on shelled prey and share many morphological traits; in particular, high leverage jaws with robust jaw-closing muscles. Myliobatid stingrays are no exception, having reinforced jaw skeletons, large jaw adductor muscles, and with all species in the family consuming some combination of shelled prey. Myliobatid rays have a long evolutionary history (65-70 million years) and number over thirty species, yet despite similar performance demands given their diet ecology, exhibit considerable morphological diversity of the feeding apparatus. We examined how feeding performance changes in the bullnose ray, Myliobatis freminvillei over its ontogeny, and compared how these rays produce crushing bite forces relative to confamilial and co-occurring cownose rays (Rhinopterinae). Within the durophagous family Myliobatidae, rhinopterines are more generalist in their dietary preferences, feeding on small bivalves and infaunal crustaceans, whereas eagle rays (Aetobatinae) prey on gastropods and bivalves exclusively, while bullnose/bat rays (Myliobatinae) consume a size range of gastropods and hermit crabs. We found that bullnose rays show isometric changes in feeding performance over their ontogeny, relying on the high mechanical efficiency of their jaws to crush shelled prey throughout their ontogeny. This manner of generating high bite forces diverges from cownose rays and other durophagous elasmobranchs, which primarily rely on muscular hypertrophy to generate forceful bites. These two lineages evolved distinct means of dismantling hard prey, which further showcases how multiplicity of form can result in similar ecological function. These predators are frequently subsumed within a single ecological category, durophagy, which underestimates their diversity.

AB  - In many species, individuals are embedded in a network of kin with whom they interact. Interactions between kin can affect survival and fertility rates and thus the life history of individuals. These interactions indirectly affect both the network of kin and the dynamics of the population. In this way, a nonlinear feedback between the kin network and individual vital rates emerges. We describe a framework for integrating these kin interactions into a matrix model by linking the individual kin network to a matrix model. We demonstrate the use of this framework for African elephant populations under varying poaching pressure. For this example, we incorporate effects of the maternal presence and matriarchal age on juvenile survival and effects of the presence of a sister on young female fecundity. We find that the feedback resulting from the interactions between family members shifts and reduces the expected kin network. The reduction in family size and structure severely reduces the positive effects of family interactions, leading to an additional decrease in population growth rate on top of the direct decrease due to the additional mortality. Our analysis provides a framework that can be applied to a wide range of social species.

AB  - Particle passage from the reticulorumen (RR) depends on particle density and size. A classic way of assessing these effects is the use of plastic markers of varying density and size that are recovered in the faeces. Here, we report results of an experiment where four fistulated reindeer ( Rangifer tarandus , 96 +/- 12 kg) were fed two different diets (browse, voluntary dry matter intake [DMI] 70 +/- 10 g/kg 0.75 /d; or a pelleted diet, DMI 124 +/- 52 g/kg 0.75 /d) and dosed via fistula with 8 different particle types combining densities of 1.03, 1.22 and 1.44 g/ml and sizes of 1, 10 and 20 mm. Generally, particles that passed the digestive tract intact (not ruminated) did so relatively early after marker dosing, and therefore had shorter mean retention times (MRT) than ruminated particles. On the higher intake, the overall mean retention time (MRT) of particles was shorter, but this was not an effect of shorter MRT for either intact or ruminated particles, but due to a higher proportion of intact particles at the higher intake. This supports the concept that ruminants do not adjust chewing behaviour depending on intake, but that a lower proportion of digesta is submitted to rumination due to pressure -driven escape from the forestomach at higher gut fills. Compared to cattle ( Bos primigenius taurus ), muskoxen ( Ovibos moschatus ) and moose ( Alces alces ) that had received the same markers, reindeer had a lower proportion of 1 mm particles that passed intact. Our results support the concept that the critical size threshold for particles leaving the ruminant forestomach is dependent on body size. While the results likely do not represent findings peculiar for reindeer, they indicate fundamental mechanisms operating in the forestomach of ruminants.

AB  - Central European forests have been shaped by complex human interactions throughout the Holocene, with significant changes following the introduction of domesticated animals in the Neolithic (similar to 7.5-6.0 ka before present [BP]). However, understanding early pastoral practices and their impact on forests is limited by methods for detecting animal movement across past landscapes. Here, we examine ancient sedimentary DNA (sedaDNA) preserved at the Velky Mamutak rock shelter in northern Bohemia (Czech Republic), which has been a forested enclave since the early Holocene. We find that domesticated animals, their associated microbiomes, and plants potentially gathered for fodder have clear representation by the Late Neolithic, around 6.0 ka BP, and persist throughout the Bronze Age into recent times. We identify a change in dominant grazing species from sheep to pigs in the Bronze Age (similar to 4.1-3.0 ka BP) and interpret the impact this had in the mid-Holocene retrogressions that still define the structure of Central European forests today. This study highlights the ability of ancient metagenomics to bridge archaeological and paleoecological methods and provide an enhanced perspective on the roots of the "Anthropocene."

AB  - Long-term and wide-ranging citizen science programs provide a unique opportunity to monitor wildlife populations and trends through time while encouraging stakeholder participation, engagement, and trust. Hunter observations is such a program that in Sweden is used on a regular basis to monitor population trends of moose. However, hunter observations are not reliable to determine the actual population size. We developed a mechanistic moose population model that integrated citizen science data and used it at various geographical scales to estimate moose population size between 2012 and 2020. A sensitivity analysis, specifically performed for recruitment, adult sex ratio and calf sex ratio, showed that the simulated population size was most sensitive for variation in recruitment. According to the results, Sweden had a total moose population of -311 000 (+/- 4%) individuals pre-hunt and -228 000 (+/- 4%) post-hunt in 2020. The post-hunt moose abundance has decreased nationwide with 15%, from 0.72 to 0.61 moose per km2 during the 2012 - 2020 period. The present post-hunt moose density was estimated at 0.39, 0.78, 0.84 and 0.54 per km2 for the regions northernmost, northern, central and southern Sweden, respectively. The simulation model can be used for strategic and operative management at various geographical scales and is publicly available. By integrating citizen data with a mechanistic population model, a new low-cost method of estimating population size and relevant population dynamics was established.

AB  - Cohort effects, reflecting early adversity or advantage, have persisting consequences for growth, reproductive onset, longevity, and lifetime reproductive success. In species with prolonged life histories, cohort effects may establish variation in age-sex structures, while social structure may buffer individuals against early adversity. Using periods of significant ecological adversity, we examined cohort effects for male and female elephants (Loxodonta africana) over almost 50 years in Amboseli, Kenya. Mortality spiked during severe droughts with highest mortality among calves under 2 years and females over 40 years. Deaths of oldest females resulted in social disruption via matriarch turnover, with potential impacts on resource acquisition for survivors. We predicted that survivors of high mortality and social challenges would have altered life-history trajectories, with later age at first reproduction and reduced age-specific fertility for females and slow transitions to independence and late-onset of potential mating or musth among males. Contrary to expectations, there were no persisting early drought effects on female age at first conception while matriarch loss around puberty accelerated reproductive onset. Experience of an early life drought did not influence age-specific reproductive rates once females commenced reproduction. Males who survived an early drought exhibited complex consequences: male age at family independence was later with larger peer cohort size, but earlier with drought in year of independence (13.9 vs 14.6 years). Early drought had no effect on age at first musth, but male reproductive onset was weakly associated with the number of peers (negative) and age at independence (positive).
   Do early-life disadvantages mean shorter, less successful lives, or can those disadvantages be overcome if later life is good or includes strong social support? For African elephants, whose long lives and strong bonds might buffer early hardship, experiencing environmental adversity in early life reduces longevity, as does losing a mother post-weaning or a family matriarch. While surviving females experience few long-term effects on their reproduction, we find complex consequences for male dispersal and reproductive onset. Many peers accelerate male family departure but delay reproductive careers.

AB  - Recent advances in autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have increased their use in remote sensing applications, such as precision agriculture, biosecurity, disaster monitoring, and surveillance. However, onboard UAV cognition capabilities for understanding and interacting in environments with imprecise or partial observations, for objects of interest within complex scenes, are limited, and have not yet been fully investigated. This limitation of onboard decision-making under uncertainty has delegated the motion planning strategy in complex environments to human pilots, which rely on communication subsystems and real-time telemetry from ground control stations. This paper presents a UAV-based autonomous motion planning and object finding system under uncertainty and partial observability in outdoor environments. The proposed system architecture follows a modular design, which allocates most of the computationally intensive tasks to a companion computer onboard the UAV to achieve high-fidelity results in simulated environments. We demonstrate the system with a search and rescue (SAR) case study, where a lost person (victim) in bushland needs to be found using a sub-2 kg quadrotor UAV. The navigation problem is mathematically formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). A motion strategy (or policy) is obtained once a POMDP is solved mid-flight and in real time using augmented belief trees (ABT) and the TAPIR toolkit. The system's performance was assessed using three flight modes: (1) mission mode, which follows a survey plan and used here as the baseline motion planner; (2) offboard mode, which runs the POMDP-based planner across the flying area; and (3) hybrid mode, which combines mission and offboard modes for improved coverage in outdoor scenarios. Results suggest the increased cognitive power added by the proposed motion planner and flight modes allow UAVs to collect more accurate victim coordinates compared to the baseline planner. Adding the proposed system to UAVs results in improved robustness against potential false positive readings of detected objects caused by data noise, inaccurate detections, and elevated complexity to navigate in time-critical applications, such as SAR.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy caused by prions that has spread across cervid species in North America since the 1960s and has recently been detected in Eurasian cervids. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) considers CWD to be of major concern for cervids in AZA-accredited facilities because of the indirect transmission risk of the disease and the impact of CWD regulatory protocols on captive breeding programs. Vulnerability to CWD is affected by variation in the PRNP gene that encodes the prion protein. We therefore sequenced PRNP in Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus), a species that was extinct in the wild for more than a century and descends from ca. 11 founders. In 27 individuals, we detected two PRNP haplotypes, designated Elad1 (51 of 54 sequences) and Elad2 (3 of 54 sequences). The two haplotypes are separated by four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), three of which are non-synonymous. Both Elad1 and Elad2 have polymorphisms that in other cervid taxa are associated with reduced vulnerability to CWD. The two haplotypes are more similar in sequence to PRNP in other cervids than to each other. This suggests that PRNP in cervids may have been under long-term balancing selection, as has been shown for PRNP in non-cervid taxa, and which could account for the presence of multiple haplotypes among founders. There may be a fitness benefit in maintaining both PRNP haplotypes in the species because variation in the prion protein amino acid sequence can limit transmission of CWD.

AB  - Simple Summary Breeding programs are used for the selection and breeding of animals that maximize a breeding objective in a specific production environment. Currently, breeders use pigs from conventional populations to breed organic pigs. This could be problematic, because pigs that perform best in an indoor and controlled conventional environment may not perform as well in the outdoor and less-controlled organic environment. To test this theory, we simulated different breeding programs for organic pigs. We used our knowledge on the genetics of the Danish pig population to make the simulations as realistic as possible. The first simulated breeding program used conventional boars to breed organic pigs. The second simulated breeding program used only organic pigs to breed for organic pigs. The results of the current study illustrate the importance of using pigs from an organic breeding population to breed organic pigs. If conventional pigs are used instead, the organic pigs will be adapted to suit a conventional production system. Current organic pig-breeding programs use pigs from conventional breeding populations. However, there are considerable differences between conventional and organic production systems. This simulation study aims to evaluate how the organic pig sector could benefit from having an independent breeding program. Two organic pig-breeding programs were simulated: one used sires from a conventional breeding population (conventional sires), and the other used sires from an organic breeding population (organic sires). For maintaining the breeding population, the conventional population used a conventional breeding goal, whereas the organic population used an organic breeding goal. Four breeding goals were simulated: one conventional breeding goal, and three organic breeding goals. When conventional sires were used, genetic gain in the organic population followed the conventional breeding goal, even when an organic breeding goal was used to select conventional sires. When organic sires were used, genetic gain followed the organic breeding goal. From an economic point of view, using conventional sires for breeding organic pigs is best, but only if there are no genotype-by-environment interactions. However, these results show that from a biological standpoint, using conventional sires biologically adapts organic pigs for a conventional production system.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are abundant in reproductive tract fluids and serve as important mediators of paracrine communication, influencing the function of gametes. Sperm undergo development in the male reproductive tract and exert their function within the female reproductive tract, engaging in interactions with various types of EVs present throughout the reproductive system. Previous studies have demonstrated that both male and female reproductive tract EVs can impact sperm function by transferring regulatory cargoes to them. Nevertheless, inconsistencies of previous research regarding the effects of EVs on sperm function, coupled with a lack of investigation into the influence of female reproductive tract EVs on sperm fertilization, have left the true role and underlying mechanisms of reproductive tract EVs on sperm function largely unexplored. Given that pigs represent significant economic livestock and serve as an ideal biomedical model for human diseases, this review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the current knowledge regarding reproductive tract EVs and their influence on boar sperm function, while highlighting their potential roles. We anticipate that this review will facilitate future research on reproductive tract EVs and their impact on sperm function, contributing to improved animal reproductive efficiency and advancements in the treatment of male infertility.

AB  - Ranging behavior has been studied extensively in eastern (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) and western (P. t. verus) chimpanzees, but relatively little is known regarding home ranges of the other two subspecies (P. t. ellioti; P. t. troglodytes). In this study, we determined the home range size and space use of a habituated community (Rekambo) of central chimpanzees living in a habitat mosaic in Loango National Park, Gabon. Data on travel routes were collected during follows between January 2017 and April 2019 (N = 670,616 relocations, collected over 640 days and 5690 h of observation). We used three methods for calculating home range size (minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimation, and biased random bridges). We compare our estimates to those obtained from prior genetic and camera trap studies of the Rekambo community and contrast them with estimates from other chimpanzee communities of the four chimpanzee subspecies. Depending on the methodology used, the home range size of the Rekambo community ranged between 27.64 and 59.03 km(2). The location of the center of the home range remained relatively stable over the last decade, while the overall size decreased. The Rekambo home range is, therefore, one of the largest documented so far for chimpanzees outside savannah-woodland habitats. We discuss several explanations, including the presence of savannah, interspecies competition, and intercommunity interactions.

AB  - Amphibious fishes transition between aquatic and terrestrial habitats, and must therefore learn to navigate two dramatically different environments. We used the amphibious killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus to test the hypothesis that the spatial learning ability of amphibious fishes would be altered by exposure to terrestrial environments because of neural plasticity in the brain region linked to spatial cognition (dorsolateral pallium). We subjected fish to eight weeks of fluctuating air-water conditions or terrestrial exercise before assessing spatial learning using a bifurcating T-maze, and neurogenesis in the dorsolateral pallium by immunostaining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen. In support of our hypothesis, we found that air-water fluctuations and terrestrial exercise improved some markers of spatial learning. Moreover, air-water and exercised fish had 39% and 46% more proliferating cells in their dorsolateral pallium relative to control fish, respectively. Overall, our findings suggest that fish with more terrestrial tendencies may have a cognitive advantage over those that remain in water, which ultimately may influence their fitness in both aquatic and terrestrial settings. More broadly, understanding the factors that promote neural and behavioural plasticity in extant amphibious fishes may provide insights into how ancestral fishes successfully colonized novel terrestrial environments before giving rise to land-dwelling tetrapods.

AB  - The Northeast of Brazil is a leading region for small ruminants. However, these herds are primarily located in the semi-arid region and face significant losses due to fetal and perinatal mortality, frequently linked to the consumption of teratogenic toxic plants during pregnancy. This study investigated the clinical and epidemiological aspects related to abortions and malformations in 80 small ruminant farms in the semi-arid region of Brazil. Necropsies were also performed on fetuses and neonates, along with histopathological, molecular, and serological analyses of the herds to differentiate other conditions. Malformations were identified on approximately 42 farms, with arthrogryposis being the most common abnormality. Toxic plants, including Mimosa tenuiflora and Cenostigma pyramidalis, were recorded on 95.23% of the properties with reported malformations. Additionally, necropsies confirmed the association between the occurrence of these plants and malformations, abortions, and mortality, excluding infectious causes. These results underscore the urgent need for prevention and control strategies to mitigate the impact of toxic plants on small ruminant production in the semi-arid region.

AB  - Darwin's finches are a classic example of adaptive radiation involving differential use of dietary resources among sympatric species. Here, we apply stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta H-2) analyses of feathers to examine ecological segregation among eight Darwin's finch species in Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos collected from live birds and museum specimens (1962-2019). We found that delta C-13 values were higher for the granivorous and herbivorous foraging guilds, and lower for the insectivorous finches. Values of delta N-15 were similar among foraging guilds but values of delta H-2 were higher for insectivores, followed by granivores, and lowest for herbivores. The herbivorous guild generally occupied the largest isotopic standard ellipse areas for all isotopic combinations and the insectivorous guild the smallest. Values of delta H-2 provided better trophic discrimination than those of delta N-15 possibly due to confounding influences of agricultural inputs of nitrogen. Segregation among guilds was enhanced by portraying guilds in three-dimensional isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta H-2) space. Values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 were higher for feathers of museum specimens than for live birds. We provide evidence that Darwin's finches on Santa Cruz Island tend to be generalists with overlapping isotopic niches and suggest that dietary overlap may also be more considerable than previously thought.

AB  - Introduction: Rice heavily relies on nitrogen fertilizers, posing environmental, resource, and geopolitical challenges. This study explores sustainable alternatives like animal manure and remote sensing for resource-efficient rice cultivation. It aims to assess the long-term impact of organic fertilization and remote sensing monitoring on agronomic traits, yield, and nutrition.Methods: A six-year experiment in rice fields evaluated fertilization strategies, including pig slurry (PS) and chicken manure (CM) with mineral fertilizers (MIN), MIN-only, and zero-fertilization. Traits, yield, spectral responses, and nutrient content were measured. Sentinel-2 remote sensing tracked crop development.Results: Cost-effective organic fertilizers (PS and CM) caused a 13% and 15% yield reduction but still doubled zero-fertilization yield. PS reduced nitrogen leaching. Heavy metals in rice grains were present at safe amounts. Organic-fertilized crops showed nitrogen deficiency at the late vegetative stages, affecting yield. Sentinel-2 detected nutrient deficiencies through NDVI.Discussion: Organic fertilizers, especially PS, reduce nitrogen loss, benefiting the environment. However, they come with yield trade-offs and nutrient management challenges that can be managed and balanced with reduced additional mineral applications. Sentinel-2 remote sensing helps manage nutrient deficiencies. In summary, this research favors cost-effective organic fertilizers with improved nutrient management for sustainable rice production.

AB  - Aim: The distribution of a species in an area depends on the presence of suitable climatic conditions, suitable biotic interactions and species dispersal capabilities. Studies of species migration usually do not include all these factors due to a lack of detailed ecological information or appropriate methods. Here, we present simulations that consider all those factors for the study of the migratory patterns of Urania boisduvalii by incorporating environmental suitability, biotic interactions with its host plants (Omphalea spp.), and the moth dispersal capacity.Location: Cuba.Taxon: Urania and Omphalea.Methods: Our approach considers changes in the palatability of plants resulting from foraging by moths, as the novel mechanism driving their dispersal. Here, the state of each cell is determined by climate, dispersal, presence of edible food plants and change in food plant palatability.Results: Urania dispersal occurs among sites with both edible food plants and suitable climates within the dispersal capacity of the moths. The number of isolated clusters of suitable patches decreased with larger dispersal capacities. All simulations where the palatability recovery is faster than palatability loss, lead to an oscillatory pattern of a local nature, while the other ones lead to a steady occupancy or extirpation of the moth species.Main Conclusions: Our results provide theoretical support for the hypothesis that the palatability of food plants drives the pattern of movement of the moths and predict that the relationship between toxic and non-toxic periods is critical to determining steady occupancy, oscillatory occupancy or extirpation of the moth from the host plant patches. The conceptual framework we used is directly based on classic literature and the methods we used are implemented as an R package. Therefore, our approach is suited to model, in a practical way, invasive species, emerging diseases or migratory species.

AB  - Simple Summary The infection by the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica in South American camelids, mainly llamas and alpacas, has been the focus of many studies. However, their capacity to participate in the transmission of the disease and their potential reservoir role in human or animal endemic areas have never been studied. Therefore, all development stages of an isolate from Argentine llama of the high Andean plateau have been experimentally investigated, from egg embryogenesis to metacercarial infectivity, by using the vector snail Galba truncatula from the high altitude Bolivian Altiplano human hyperendemic area. Although eggs shed by llamas may successfully develop until the adult stage in a subsequent mammal host, the transmission capacity of the llama proved to be pronouncedly less efficient than that of other hosts as sheep and cattle. Moreover, the low prevalences, intensities, and daily fecal outputs of liver fluke eggs in llama in Andean endemic areas, together with their peculiar defecating behavior in dung piles always far from freshwater collections, indicate that the contribution of this camelid should be considered negligible. Therefore, the llama does not need to receive priority within fascioliasis control initiatives, although it may play a disease-spreading role if used as a pack animal. South American camelids are definitive hosts of Fasciola hepatica. However, their capacity to participate in the transmission and epidemiology of fascioliasis has never been appropriately studied. Therefore, an F. hepatica isolate from Argentine llama is for the first time analyzed using Galba truncatula lymnaeids from Bolivia. Experimental follow-up studies included egg embryogenesis, miracidial infection of lymnaeid snails, intramolluscan larval development, cercarial production, chronobiology of cercarial shedding, vector survival to infection, and metacercarial infectivity of mammal host. Shorter prepatent and patent periods were leading to markedly lower cercarial production, shorter cercarial shedding, and a higher negative impact on snail survival. The usually low liver fluke prevalences and intensities and low daily fecal outputs indicate that llamas do not substantially contribute to fascioliasis transmission. The defecating behavior in dung piles far from freshwater collections prevents lymnaeid infection by eggs shed by this camelid. All results suggest the reservoir role of the llama to be negligible and, therefore, no priority within control measures in endemic areas. However, llamas may play a disease-spreading role if used as pack animals in rural areas. In the Northern Bolivian Altiplano human hyperendemic area, neither llamas nor alpacas should be considered for control measures within a One Health action.

AB  - Buffaloes are raised mainly to obtain milk that is nutritionally very rich. The technological characteristics of buffalo milk are optimal for processing into cheese, and it is mainly used to produce mozzarella cheese. Under stressful conditions, buffaloes, like other animals, produce milk qualitatively poorly. The stressors that can affect the quality of production are, in addition to other factors, deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals. In this study, we evaluated the effect of antioxidant supplementation on the quality of buffalo milk. Sixty-six buffaloes were enrolled and subdivided into two balanced groups of 33 each. The ZnSe group received 0.2 kg/head/day of Bufalo Plus (R) containing antioxidants and barley meal, CaCO3 and MgCO3 mix; the control group was supplemented with 0.2 kg/head/day of barley meal, CaCO3 and MgCO3 mix. The two groups were fed ad libitum with a total mixed ration (TMR). The amount of diet distributed was recorded daily, and the residue in the trough manger was recorded three times per week. TMR samples were taken every two weeks for each group. Daily milk yield was recorded twice a week. Milk samples were collected every four weeks and analysed for chemical and technological properties. Furthermore, milk total antioxidant capacity was determined. The results obtained showed that the antioxidant supplement had no effect on feed intake, feeding behaviour, and feed efficiency. The treatment positively influenced milk production while it did not affect the chemical characteristics of the milk. In addition, the supplement of antioxidants improved the milk clotting properties (MCP). The supplement did not affect the antioxidant activity of the milk.

AB  - Protected Areas (PAs) in Bangladesh have been pivotal for conserving wildlife. The country plans to increase the number of PAs by implementing new forest-governing policies with the involvement of local communities. Their efficacy in wildlife conservation and forest preservation is being questioned due to significant land cover changes within PA boundaries. It is essential to understand the current role of existing PAs in forest cover transformation and their impact on wildlife conservation before expanding the PAs and implementing new policies. This study aims to explore the land cover transformation within Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary (TWS) and describe the role of the local community and its impact on wildlife. Utilizing Landsat satellite images from 1989 to 2015, this study discovered a 46 % deforestation rate within TWS, surpassing its surrounding areas. Since 1989, 75 % of primary forests have been eradicated, leaving a mere 650 hectares intact. This transformation is shifting forested areas towards the PA boundaries, potentially threatening conservation efforts by making wildlife more vulnerable. Socioeconomic surveys of 5769 households revealed that bigger landowners within the local communities played a significant role in this deforestation. Such community-driven forest alterations increased wildlife vulnerability by intensifying their interaction with forest surrounding communities. This study presents an interesting case of the process of forest transformation within PAs with the intersection of human-wildlife conflict and deforesta-tion. For effective wildlife conservation, strategies need to address and rectify these forest cover transformations and focus on the wildlife habitats, ensuring conservation and coexistence for forests, humans and wildlife.

AB  - Simple Summary In modern sheep production systems, less energy is required to gain lean tissue than to deposit fat; therefore, producers are attempting to decrease fat deposition costs by altering nutrient use to benefit the production of leaner carcasses. Microbes in the rumen have vital functions in feed digestion; however, limited research has been performed on the rumen microbiome's effect on fat deposition. This study revealed variations in microbial populations in rumen carrying different fat deposition phenotypes in a characteristic way, and these findings could aid in developing strategies for manipulating rumen microbiota to alter the production performance of sheep. Microbial communities of the sheep rumen have been studied extensively; however, their involvement in the regulation of fat deposition is unknown. Herein, we aimed to identify the correlations among fat deposition-related phenotypes and the effect of microbiota on changes in body fat accumulation. The rumen microbiota of 141 lambs was profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, and the volatile fatty acids' (VFAs') concentrations were quantified by gas chromatography. Subsequently, the animals were grouped according to body mass index (BMI) to compare the microbiota of the rumen among the sheep with different fat deposition levels. Results further revealed differences in terms of the species abundance, diversity, and microbial composition between sheep with different fat deposition levels. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis and Random Forest (RF) regression analysis identified changes in 29 ruminal bacteria, which may be the main driver for different fat deposition.

AB  - There is increasing awareness that interactions between plants and insects can be mediated by microbial symbionts. Nonetheless, evidence showing that symbionts associated with organisms beyond the second trophic level affect plant-insect interactions are restricted to a few cases belonging to parasitoid-associated bracoviruses. Insect parasitoids harbour a wide array of symbionts which, like bracoviruses, can be injected into their herbivorous hosts to manipulate their physiology and behaviour. Yet, the function of these symbionts in plant-based trophic webs remains largely overlooked. Here, we provide the first evidence of a parasitoid-associated symbiont belonging to the group of ichnoviruses which affects the strength of plant-insect interactions. A comparative proteomic analysis shows that, upon parasitoid injection of calyx fluid containing ichnovirus particles, the composition of salivary glands of caterpillars changes both qualitatively (presence of two viral-encoded proteins) and quantitatively (abundance of several caterpillar-resident enzymes, including elicitors such as glucose oxidase). In turn, plant phenotypic changes triggered by the altered composition of caterpillar oral secretions affect the performance of herbivores. Ichnovirus manipulation of plant responses to herbivory leads to benefits for their parasitoid partners in terms of reduced developmental time within the parasitized caterpillar. Interestingly, plant-mediated ichnovirus-induced effects also enhance the performances of unparasitized herbivores which in natural conditions may feed alongside parasitized ones. We discuss these findings in the context of ecological costs imposed to the plant by the viral symbiont of the parasitoid. Our results provide intriguing novel findings about the role played by carnivore-associated symbionts on plant-insect-parasitoid systems and underline the importance of placing mutualistic associations in an ecological perspective.

AB  - While numerous studies have examined the effects of direct and carbonized straw return on soil fertility, most focus on short-term impacts. Long-term research is needed to understand how these practices affect soil fertility and organic carbon transformation, providing guidance for the use of straw and biochar in agriculture. This study examined the long-term effects of corn straw (CS), straw biochar (BIO), and biochar-based fertilizer (BF) applied over 5, 10, and 15 years on soil aggregates, organic carbon, and humus composition in a peanut field microplot experiment. Using pig manure compost (PMC) as a control, we assessed soil water-stable aggregate distribution, carbon content in soil and aggregates, and organic carbon's infrared spectral characteristics. The goal was to understand how different straw utilization methods impact soil carbon retention and humus composition for sustainable agricultural practices. The results showed that the straw biochar (BIO) had a significantly better long-term effect on increasing the proportion and stability of large soil aggregates compared to direct straw return (CS) and biochar-based fertilizer (BF). After ten years of continuous fertilization, the organic carbon content in soils treated with BIO was higher than that in soils treated with CS. After fifteen years of continuous fertilization, the organic carbon content in soils treated with BF was similar to that of the CS treatment. Additionally, humus carbon primarily accumulated in the 2-0.25 mm aggregates (SMA), and the BIO treatment significantly improved the quality of soil humus. FTIR spectra indicated that the long-term application of BIO and BF increased the proportion of aromatic carbon in the soil, enhancing the stability of soil organic carbon. Long-term application of carbonized straw returns improved soil organic carbon, aggregate stability, and humus quality, contributing to carbon sequestration. Fertilization duration directly and indirectly regulated humus formation through its impact on organic carbon and aggregates, while organic materials influenced humus indirectly.

AB  - Direct measures of body mass of marine mammals are logistically complicated to obtain even for pinnipeds. An alternative method for mass estimation based on 3D imaging technology and automated processing algorithms, was tested in southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina). Two models of artificial neural networks (ANN)-nonlinear neural network and self-organizing maps-were trained to compute the volume and to estimate the mass of the digital models, previously obtained by scanning individuals with an infrared light sensor. Body mass estimates were as accurate (mean % error = 4.4) as estimates in previous photogrammetry studies in southern elephant seals and the mass predictive ability of the trained ANN was higher (99% of the variance explained) than other predictive models using photogrammetry in pinniped studies. While this method has proven to produce accurate body mass estimates, it also overcame some of the constraints of other indirect techniques, avoiding animal disturbance caused by physical restraint or chemical immobilization, minimizing risks, and capitalizing on the time working in the field. The results of these estimations were promising, which shows that the proposed methodology can provide adequate results with lower logistic and computational requirements.

AB  - Understanding the impact of hunting on wildlife is necessary to protect biodiversity in remote, endangered ecosystems, where rural communities depend on bushmeat as sources of food and income. Unsustainable hunting has led to a major decline in mammal population densities across Africa, especially for ungulates and primates. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the impact of hunting on lesula (Cercopithecus lomamiensis), a semiterrestrial and poorly known monkey in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and (2) assess the species' relative abundance in the context of its behavioral ecology and local hunting practices. We compared the relative abundance of lesula to prey species preferred by hunters using data collected from camera trap surveys (5,960 days) and primate vocalization surveys (n = 174) and assessed species-specific hunting pressure in the buffer zone using data collected from surveillance patrols (2,255 km), hunter follows (n = 16), and semistructured interviews (n = 21). We found that the abundance of terrestrial mammal and primate species was negatively impacted by hunting in the buffer zone, but the abundance of lesula appeared relatively similar throughout its range. Our results suggest that the relative tolerance of lesula in the buffer zone was associated with its ecological niche and the specific behavior of local hunters. Lesula is a threatened, endemic monkey of the Congo Basin rainforest, and this study provides data to enable its continuous monitoring and long-term population management. Some primate populations, such as lesula, may be able to persist under specific conditions despite being subject to high hunting pressure.

AB  - Feral burros (Equus asinus) and horses (E. ferus caballus) inhabiting public land in the western United States are intended to be managed at population levels established to promote a thriving, natural ecological balance. Double-observer sightability (M-DS) models, which use detection records from multiple observers and sighting covariates, perform well for estimating feral horse abundances, but their effectiveness for use in burro populations is less understood. These M-DS models help minimize detection bias, yet bias can be further reduced with models that account for unmodeled variation, or residual heterogeneity, in detection probability. In populations containing radio-marked individuals, residual heterogeneity can be estimated with M-DS models by including a covariate that corresponds to the marked status of a group (M-H models). Another approach is to use information from detections missed by both observers to account for the characteristics that make groups more or less likely to be detected, or recaptured, by the second observer (M-R models). We used aerial survey data from 3 burro populations (Sinbad Herd Management Area, UT [2016-2018], Lake Pleasant Herd Management Area, AZ [2017], and Fort Irwin National Training Center, CA [2016-2017]) to develop M-DS models applicable for feral burros in the southwestern United States. Our objectives were to quantify precision and bias of standard M-DS surveys for feral burros and to examine which model type for incorporating residual heterogeneity (M-H or M-R) would result in the least-biased estimates of burro populations relative to the minimum number known alive (MNKA) within the Sinbad Herd Management Area. Standard M-DS model estimates achieved a mean coefficient of variation of 0.08, while underestimating MNKA by an average of 27.1%. Accounting for residual heterogeneity through recapture probability in M-R models resulted in estimates closer to MNKA than M-H models (9.5% vs. 16.5% less than MNKA). Our results indicate that M-DS models can achieve precise enough estimates to monitor feral burro populations, but they routinely produce negatively biased estimates. We encourage the use of radio-collars to reduce bias in future burro surveys by accounting for residual heterogeneity through M-R models.

AB  - Road networks pose many well-documented threats to wildlife, from fragmenting habitats and restricting movement to causing mortality through vehicle collisions. For large, wide-ranging mammals, home range requirements and seasonal migrations often necessitate road crossings, posing threats to human safety, property, and animal survival. Artificial nightlight, emanating from light posts and urban sky glow, is ubiquitous on and around road networks worldwide; however, its effects on road crossing behavior and the associated mortality risk for wildlife are not well understood. By integrating the latest NASA nightlight products with GPS collar data collected from 67 mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) over a 7-year period (2012-2018), we used a resource-selection framework to assess factors influencing seasonal crossing behavior and road mortality in Salt Lake City, Utah, an expanding metropolitan area in the United States. We found deer preferred to cross the road where surrounding artificial nightlight was lower in both summer and winter seasons, especially during crepuscular and nighttime periods. However, lower nightlight levels also increased the risk of road mortality. Areas with more shrub cover and lower speed limits increased the likelihood of crossing as well as lowered the risk of road mortality. There were five times as many mortality events in winter as in summer, likely because of the combination of deer preference for dark roads mixed with proximity to both higher speed roads and increased human activity. Better understanding how a pervasive and expanding environmental pollutant like artificial nightlight may attract or repel human-tolerant wildlife species from roadways presents an opportunity to mitigate collision risk while improving population management strategies for this abundant, generalist herbivore and many other economically and ecologically important species.

AB  - Wild boar (Sus scrofa) are known an important reservoir for multiple infectious diseases. While the burden exerted by disease from the free-range wild boar in China has not been evaluated. In northeastern China, where the boundary to the Russian Federal Far East, the big cat protection projects across the two countries and the unstopped epidemics of canine distemper (CD) and rabies (RV) in Far East Russia arouse our great concern. Revealing the epidemiological information has become a pressing matter of the moment. The 358 serum samples from hybrid wild boar collected along the Sino-Russia boundary in 11 cities in Heilongjiang province were tested by cELISA for antibodies of RV and canine distemper virus (CDV). The AusVet Epitools program was run to estimate the true prevalence, which revealed the positive rate of RV and CDV antibodies to be 10.06% (95% CI 7.14, 13.65) and 0.56% (95% CI 0.07, 2), respectively. The highest RV seroprevalences were reported in Huanan county of Jiamusi city (100%) followed by Ningan county of Mudanjiang city (42.86%). CDV antibody was only identified in Hegang city with a seroprevalence of 12.5%. The overall true prevalence for RV and CDV were estimated as 10.07% (95% CI 7.19, 13.85) and -0.04% (95% CI -0.48, 1.51). No association was found between antibody responses and city, gender, and age. The study for the first time reported the prevalence of RV and CDV based on the antibody investigation in wild boar in the Heilongjiang province of China. We share our monitoring results would aid in the construction of the epidemiological history of CDV and RV in the Heilongjiang province of China.

AB  - Recent intensive livestock production has made domestic animals vulnerable to infectious diseases such as foot and mouth disease. Infected animals and nearby animals are culled and then buried or incinerated to prevent the spread of the disease in most countries, including South Korea. The burial of animal carcasses in the soil may produce side effects, such as the production of leachate and odors, and could potentially spread infectious diseases. This study tested YM microorganisms, which mainly contain hyper-thermophilic organisms that can degrade pig carcasses and inactivate pathogenic microorganisms. An experimental burial system installed with an aeration facility was developed, and the decomposition effects of YM microorganisms were verified using pig carcasses. Pig carcasses were almost completely decomposed in 30 days without leachate, and all experimentally inoculated pathogens were completely inactivated by YM microorganisms. The final composites were satisfied with all inspection criteria for using the byproduct as fertilizer after an additional 34 days of composting. In conclusion, the newly developed hyper-thermophilic YM microorganism system may produce biosecure fertilizers from animal carcasses.

AB  - When animals engage in 'non-serious' fighting (play-fighting) they 'borrow' motor patterns especially from the aggressive context. It may be difficult to distinguish play-and real-fighting. This is particularly true for piglets (Sus scrofa), which can use play-fighting as a substitute for aggression. To check for the structural differences between play-and real-fighting in piglets, we: i) video recorded 496 interactions from three litters (at Parva-Domus extensive ethical farm; Turin, Italy); ii) extracted (by video analyses) duration, patterns, and data on involved individuals; iii) calculated session structural/ecological indices; and iv) compared the indices (play-vs real-fighting). Compared to real-fighting - play-fighting was longer (informing its rewarding nature), more symmetrical (lower asymmetry index) and variable (higher Shannon index). Moreover, play-fighting showed less pattern repetition (lower Repetition Index) and was not more polyadic and evenly distributed (comparable polyadic and Pielou indices). By being longer, and more variable and symmetrical than real-fighting, play -fighting could serve some of its functions such as motor training, social assessment and training for the unex-pected. However, play-fighting in piglets did not comply with all the expected play features, possibly because play is a fluid behavioural system that under certain circumstances may escalate into or replace aggression.

AB  - The frequent fluctuation of pork prices has seriously affected the sustainable development of the pork industry. The accurate prediction of pork prices can not only help pork practitioners make scientific decisions but also help them to avoid market risks, which is the only way to promote the healthy development of the pork industry. Therefore, to improve the prediction accuracy of pork prices, this paper first combines the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) and traditional machine learning model, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), to establish an SSA-CART optimization model for predicting pork prices. Secondly, based on the Sichuan pork price data during the 12th Five-Year Plan period, the linear correlation between piglet, corn, fattening pig feed, and pork price was measured using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Thirdly, the MAE fitness value was calculated by combining the validation set and training set, and the hyperparameter "MinLeafSize" was optimized via the SSA. Finally, a comparative analysis of the prediction performance of the White Shark Optimizer (WSO)-CART model, CART model, and Simulated Annealing (SA)-CART model demonstrated that the SSA-CART model has the best prediction of pork price (compared with a single decision tree, R2 increased by 9.236%), which is conducive to providing support for pork price prediction. The accurate prediction of pork prices with an optimized machine learning model is of great practical significance for stabilizing pig production, ensuring the sustainable growth of farmers' income, and promoting sound economic development.

AB  - Herbivory in plant reproductive tissues can severely reduce the fitness of the species, especially for those threatened with extinction. We investigated aspects of the reproductive ecology of Neoregelia ibitipocensis (Leme) Leme, an endangered species restricted to a few cloud forests sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Data on breeding systems, fertility, and viability of its populations are provided, as well as alternatives for development of strategies for ex situ conservation. Hand pollination experiments revealed that N. ibitipocensis is partially self-incompatible. Fruit and seeds were affected by intense herbivory caused by Tipulidae (Diptera) larvae. The predation reached 100% of the analysed infructescences during the first year of the study. We observed the production of parthenocarpic fruit both through controlled pollination experiments and under natural conditions. The potential for self-pollination and autogamy probably compensate for the reduced ability of the species to attract pollinators due to its small floral display. In the same way, parthenocarpy seems to represent a strategy to enhance the fitness of N. ibitipocensis, mitigating the effects of the predation. We developed an efficient protocol of in vitro multiplication, which represents a viable alternative for ex situ conservation of the species.

AB  - Globally, vultures are one of the most threatened of all groups of birds. European vulture populations are benefited by several anthropogenic food sources such as landfills. Current European Union directives aim to decrease the amount of organic matter dumped in landfills, reducing this important food source for some vulture species. In this context, we assessed the effect of the reduction of organic waste available and accessible for scavengers in a landfill on the visitation probability and abundance of a local Eurasian Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus population in Central Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula), using a long-term dataset of captured-marked-recaptured individuals in the period 2012-2018. Our results indicated a decrease in the visitation probability due to a significant reduction of organic matter dumped into the landfill after a waste treatment centre was built (0.82 to 0.76) that may cause a permanent emigration of vultures in response to food reduction. However, the estimated annual abundance of vultures tended to grow over time due to the positive trend that regional vulture populations have experienced in recent decades. These results suggest that population processes occurring at regional scales are more relevant to vulture populations than local waste management measures. A reduction in locally available food can make a site less attractive, but species with high dispersal capacity such as vultures may overcome this issue by moving to other suitable sites. Although Griffon Vultures obtain most of the food from domestic and wild ungulates, a regional application of European directives could threaten an important alternative feeding source, especially in food shortage seasons where landfills could be supporting the energetic requirements of the species. Conservation strategies should be planned to counteract the possible negative effects of new European directives on scavenger populations.

AB  - Recent research has challenged the idea that cervid antlers are such costly traits, supporting the assertion early-life antler investment is an honest signal of adult phenotypic quality. However, inferences were made based on antler measurements while growing (velvet) and thus, studies on fully-formed clean antlers are needed to avoid possible bias caused by the inter-individual variation in antler growth phenology. We studied a semi-captive population of European roe deer inhabiting a sub-Mediterranean area (Valsemana research station) and living under optimal conditions (ad libitum food supply and veterinary care). Based on repeated measurements taken from 146 individuals, we assessed whether allocation to secondary sexual traits during early life affected body mass or antler development during adulthood. Furthermore, we evaluated which body measurements better predicted future male quality. Additionally, using 488 individuals, we described age-class-specific variation in male body measurements and assessed the decline in antler size between adult and senescent stages (i.e. magnitude of senescence). Results agree with the assertion that there is no negative effect of a high investment in antler during early life on adult antler size or body mass, but we suggest the use of clean antlers as a more robust and reliable measure. The variables that better predicted body mass during adulthood were yearling body mass and body size at 6 months. Antler score between 10 and 18 months resulted in the best indicator of adult antler size. Finally, we support the idea that the magnitude of senescence in antler size is smaller in environments with higher resource availability during winter.

AB  - The iconic fly Thyreophora cynophila has long attracted the interest of entomologists but, despite its re-discovery in Spain and France, its biology is still poorly known. The larvae and puparium have been described in detail but their feeding habits on large carcasses remain largely unknown. Here, we took advantage of a carrion pile containing the remains of wild boar (Sus scrofa) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) as well as of two cow (Bos taurus) carcasses to search for T. cynophila larvae inside the bones and skulls. We document the occurrence of T. cynophila inside the cerebral cavity of dead animals, containing the brain. From the carrion pile, out of seven skulls, T. cynophila larvae could be found in five of them, and identified on the basis of their size, the shape and arrangement of the ventral tubercles, prothoracic spiracle and cephalopharyngeal skeleton. In contrast, no T. cynophila larvae could be found inside the nine bones we inspected. From the cow carcasses, no T. cynophila larvae could be found in the bones but one larva was found inside the cerebral cavity of one cow. In addition, other Diptera and Coleoptera larvae were found inside the bones.

AB  - Aquatic ectotherms often attain smaller body sizes at higher temperatures. By analysing similar to 15,000 coastal-reef fish surveys across a 15 degrees C spatial sea surface temperature (SST) gradient, we found that the mean length of fish in communities decreased by similar to 5% for each 1 degrees C temperature increase across space, or 50% decrease in mean length from 14 to 29 degrees C mean annual SST. Community mean body size change was driven by differential temperature responses within trophic groups and temperature-driven change in their relative abundance. Herbivores, invertivores and planktivores became smaller on average in warmer temperatures, but no trend was found in piscivores. Nearly 25% of the temperature-related community mean size trend was attributable to trophic composition at the warmest sites, but at colder temperatures, this was <1% due to trophic groups being similarly sized. Our findings suggest that small changes in temperature are associated with large changes in fish community composition and body sizes, with important ecological implications.

AB  - Manure can serve as a comparable source of nitrogen (N) as synthetic fertilizer; however, soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes may differ substantially between these two N sources. This study was carried out during three growing seasons (2011, 2013, and 2014) in a replicated field experiment, cropped to either barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) or wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The experiment included three treatments in a randomized complete block design with four replicates: zero N amendment (CON), liquid pig manure (LPM) at a rate of 56,000 L ha-1 yr? 1, and urea (FER) at N rate matching the total available N content in the manure. In all three years, crop yield and N uptake were slightly higher in the LPM treatment compared to the FER treatment, but the difference was not statistically significant. In 2011 and 2014, when applied N rate was moderate but the application time coincided with a long period of drought, cumulative N2O emissions, emission intensity and factor were significantly higher in the FER treatment than in LPM treatment. In 2013, however, when applied manure N was relatively high, and soil moisture mostly adequate, no such effect was observed. Soil available N content, temperature, and moisture together were positively correlated (P < 0.05) with N2O emission in both LPM and FER samples, and explained about 40 % of the overall variability of N2O emission. We conclude that the use of liquid manure N in cropping system is an environmentally advisable strategy. However, from both nutrient management planning and N2O emission reduction stand points, the results of this study highlight the challenges associated with manure N variability, and emphasis the need for applying manure based on its known N content in addition to soil N test, so that application rate can meet the crop N demand and minimize N2O emissions.

AB  - This study aimed to find the optimal fermentation technology of medicinal plants (turmeric, Curcuma longa and green tea, Camellia sinensis) mixed with Lactobacillus brevis (FML) and the effects of FML on the growth performance, immune response, and anti-microbial ability of rainbow trout fingerlings. To optimize the fermentation process, response to surface methodology (RSM) was applied. The optimal fermentation conditions were 8% probiotic and 25-h fermentation time. Fish (n = 600; 9.37 +/- 0.24 g initial weight) was subjected to a feeding experiment involving five different diets. These diets included a control group without any additives as well as groups supplemented with various amounts of FML: 0.2% (FML1), 0.5% (FML2), 0.8% (FML3), and 1% (FML4) for a period of 60 days. Afterwards, a subset of 15 fish was selected from each tank and exposed to Yersinia ruckeri for 14 days. After the feeding trial, the growth indices significantly increased in FML-added groups (p < 0.05). The protease activity markedly increased in all FML-treated groups (except for FML1) compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the serum bactericidal activity, immunoglobulin, total protein (TP), and globulin levels increased in FML3 and FML4 groups compared to those receiving the control and FML1 diets (p < 0.05). The skin mucus alkaline phosphatase and serum TP levels significantly increased in the fish fed with FML3 and FML4 diets compared to other treatments (p < 0.05). The highest sivival rate was observed in FML4 (83.3%) followed by FML3 (66.7%) group. Overall, dietary FML, especially in FML4 diet, has a beneficial role to ameliorate growth rate, immune functions, and disease resistance against Y. ruckeri in rainbow trout.

AB  - The discharge from pig farms presents significant challenges to the environment and human health, specifically regarding the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Fermentation bed culture has emerged as an increasingly popular and environmentally friendly pig farming model in China, as it minimizes the release of harmful substances into the environment. However, there remains a limited understanding of the occurrence and dynamics of microbiome and antibiotic resistome in fermentation bed culture. Herein, we collected fermentation bed materials (FBM) from four fermentation bed culture pig farms with varying service ages and investigated their bacterial communities, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements (MGEs), metal resis-tance genes (MRGs) and potential antibiotic-resistant bacterial hosts through metagenomics. Pseudomonadota, Actinomycetota, Bacteroidota and Bacillota were identified as the dominant phyla present in the FBM. In total, we detected 258 unique ARGs in the FBM samples, with 79 core ARGs shared by all FBM samples, accounting for 95 % of the total ARG abundance. Our results revealed significant variations in microbial communities and ARG profiles across varying service ages of FBM. Compared to long-term FBW, short-term FBM exhibited higher numbers and abundances of ARGs, MRGs and MGEs, along with higher levels of potential bacterial pathogens and high-risk ARGs. Further analysis of metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) indicated that the putative hosts of ARGs primarily belonged to Pseudomonadota, Actinomycetota and Bacillota. Alarmingly, among the 80 recovered ARG-carrying MAGs, 23 MAGs encoded multi-resistance, including clinically significant species that require urgent attention. Overall, this study provided valuable insights into the temporal patterns of antibiotic resistome and bacterial communities within FBM, enhancing our understanding of FBM in pig farming. The findings could potentially contribute to the development of effective strategies for evaluating and regulating fermentation bed culture practices in pig farming.

AB  - Sustainable crop production is a major concern that demanding development of novel management strategies. To this end, response of kidney bean to sheep manure and zeolite combination on micro and macro nutrients and yield is evaluated. A factorial experiment in a randomized complete block design with three replications in two consecutive cropping years (2016 and 2017) and three factors including, cultivar (V1: goli and V2: akhtar), nutritional systems (F1: 100% sheep manure, F2: 100% Urea, F3: 75% Urea + 25% sheep manure, F4: 50% Urea + 50% sheep manure, F5: 25% Urea + 75% sheep manure), and zeolite (Z1: 0 tons ha-1, Z2:3 tons ha-1, Z3: 6 tons ha-1, Z4: 9 tons ha-1) was carried out. The results showed that increasing in zeolite application, led to aerial tissues proline content decrease, whereas the grain yield (2199 kg ha(-1)) increased. The highest amount of aerial iron, grain iron and grain yield were obtained from 50% Urea + 50% sheep manure. The 3-way interaction of zeolite * cultivar * sheep manure was significant for amount of Fe for both aerial tissues and grains, whereas it was only significant for the mount of K and Zn for both aerial and grains. The highest amount of Fe in both aerial and grains was obtained using 50% Sheep manure + 50% Urea and 6 tones/ha zeolite. The results demonstrated that a combination of urea and zeolite can be used to improve nutrients in kidney bean, suggesting that natural fertilizers are promising to improve kidney bean yield and quality.

AB  - Simple Summary
   In order to assess the effect of grazing level on milk quality and indicators related to the carbon footprint of dairy sheep farms, monthly data collection was carried out for 1 year on 17 farms in the region of Castilla y Leon (Spain). These data were analysed using a multivariate statistical procedure that allowed the association of the mentioned indicators with the grazing level and identifying the management system of the farms. It was shown that farms with higher grazing levels were more environmentally sustainable, as indirect gas emissions and energy consumption were much lower. Milk quality from these farms was higher in terms of total protein, fat, omega 3 fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acid and alpha-tocopherol levels.
   Currently, there are very few studies in the dairy sheep sector associating milk quality and indicators regarding carbon footprint and their link to grazing levels. For 1 year, monthly milk samples and records related to environmental emissions and management systems were collected through surveys from 17 dairy sheep farms in the region of Castilla y Leon (Spain), in order to relate this information to the use of natural pastures under free grazing. Indicators were constructed on the collected data and subjected to a multivariate statistical procedure that involved a factor analysis, a cluster analysis and a population canonical analysis. By applying multivariate statistical techniques on milk quality and carbon footprint indicators, it was possible to identify the management system of the farms. From an environmental point of view, farms with a higher grazing level (cluster 4) were more sustainable, as they had the lowest carbon footprint (lower CO2, N2O and CO2 equivalent emissions per sheep and year) and the lowest energy consumption levels, which were gradually lower than those of farms in cluster 3; both indicators were much lower than those of farms in clusters 1 and 2. The milk quality of cluster 1 and 2 farms was significantly lower in terms of total protein and fat content, dry extract, omega-3 fatty acid levels and alpha-tocopherol content than farms in clusters 3 and 4, which had higher accessibility to grazing resources. In sum, the higher the use of natural resources, the lower the external inputs the farms required and the lower environmental impact and energy costs they have.

AB  - Crop foraging by African savannah elephants Loxodonta africana negatively affects farmer livelihoods and support for conservation, yet affordable, sustainable and practical solutions remain elusive. To inform conservation priorities, our goal was to assess the hitherto little explored relationships between farmers' views on agricultural damage and the socio-economic factors limiting their use of elephant deterrents. We tested our hypotheses associated with the demographic categories of age, education level, years spent farming, gender, exposure to information on deterrent methods, farm size, village and relevant combinations of these factors by surveying 206 respondents across six villages in rural Kenya and analysing the resulting data using an information theoretic approach. Respondents were almost four times more likely to use deterrents if exposed to the relevant information, and almost five times more likely to do so if they had secondary education as opposed to none. Farmers with a higher level of education were five times more likely to have received information on deterrents compared to those with no formal education. Participants who had not received information on deterrents were almost three times more likely to believe that they could implement deterrent methods. Respondents who stated that they could not implement deterrents overwhelmingly cited a lack of financial resources as the reason. Overall, we found that crucial information on reducing elephant crop foraging is not reaching the relevant stakeholders, and socio-economic factors such as education and exposure to information appear to limit uptake of protective measures. These insights are important for developing mitigation strategies and supporting the livelihoods of people affected by negative human-elephant interactions, and thus for effective elephant conservation. Our findings also have broader applications for practitioners seeking to understand barriers stakeholders face in their efforts to mitigate negative interactions with wildlife.

AB  - The adaptation of lung cells to high-altitude environments represents a notable gap in our understanding of how animals cope with hypoxic conditions. Alveolar epithelial cells type II (AEC II) are crucial for lung development and repair. However, their, specific role in the adaptation of yaks to high-altitude environments remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to address this gap by investigating the differential responses of AEC II in yaks at high and low altitudes (4000 m and 2600 m, respectively). We used the 10 x scRNA-seq technology to construct a comprehensive cell atlas of yak lung tissue, and identified 15 distinct cell classes. AEC II in high-altitude yaks revealed increased immunomodulatory, adhesive, and metabolic activities, which are crucial for maintaining lung tissue stability and energy supply under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, alveolar epithelial progenitor cells within AEC II can differentiate into both Alveolar epithelial cell type I (AEC I) and AEC II. SHIP1 and other factors are promoters of AEC I transdifferentiation, whereas SFTPC and others promote AEC II transdifferentiation. This study provides new insights into the evolutionary adaptation of lung cells in plateau animals by elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying AEC II adaptation to high-altitude environments.

AB  - Conventional microsatellite (simple sequence repeat, SSR) genotyping methods cannot accurately identify polyploid genotypes leading to allele dosage uncertainty, introducing biases in population genetic analysis. Here, a new SSR genotyping method was developed to directly infer accurate polyploid genotypes. The frequency distribution of SSR sequences was obtained based on deep-coverage high-throughput sequencing data. Corrections were performed accounting for the "stutter peak" and amplification efficiency of SSR sequences. Perl scripts and an online SSR genotyping tool "SSRSeq" were provided to process the sequencing data and output genotypes with corrected allele dosages. Hexaploid Camellia oleifera is the dominant woody oilseed crop in China. Understanding the geographical pattern of genetic variation in wild C. oleifera is essential for the conservation and utilization of genetic resources. Six wild C. oleifera populations were sampled across geographical ranges in subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests of China. Using 35 SSR markers, the high-throughput sequencing-based SSRSeq method was applied to obtain accurate hexaploid genotypes of wild C. oleifera. The results demonstrated that the new method could resolve allele dosage uncertainty and considerably improve genetic diversity, structure and differentiation analyses for polyploids. The genetic variation patterns of wild C. oleifera across geographical ranges agree with the "central-marginal hypothesis", stating that genetic diversity is high in the central population and declines from the central to the peripheral populations, and genetic differentiation increases from the centre to the periphery. This method and findings can facilitate the utilization of wild C. oleifera genetic resources for the breeding of cultivated C. oleifera.

AB  - Plants produce an astonishing diversity of specialized metabolites as defences against herbivores, pathogens or detrimental abiotic conditions. Plants growing at different elevations are exposed to different biotic and abiotic conditions and typically show pronounced differences in their chemistry. Understanding how these differences arise through changes in various measures of chemical diversity can inform us concerning factors that contribute to the variety of metabolites found among plants. We focused on elevational changes in concentration, richness and intra- and interspecific variation in specialized chemistry in willows (Salix, Salicaceae) and compare them among metabolite classes with different functions. We aim to show how these various measures of chemical diversity change with elevation to reveal trends contributing to changes in plant chemistry along major ecological gradients. We studied chemistry, herbivory and fungal pathogen damage in an assemblage of seven willow species along an elevational gradient in the Alps (800-2600 m a.s.l.). We examined trends in chemical diversity using untargeted metabolomics, and further quantified trends in three specific classes: proanthocyanidins and salicinoids involved in biotic interactions, and flavonoids involved mainly in abiotic protection. We use measures of willow chemistry that take structural relatedness of metabolites into account to show if the roles of structurally distinct metabolites change with elevation. Willows from low elevations exhibited greater proanthocyanidin concentration and structural richness of flavonoids. In contrast, willows from high elevations showed greater structural richness of salicinoids and greater variation in total metabolite composition at both the intra- and interspecific levels. The trends in salicinoid richness and proanthocyanidin concentration were explained by elevational changes in temperature. Our results show how elevational differences in plant chemistry arise through trends in various aspects of their chemical diversity. Willows at high elevations showed reduced structural richness of metabolites involved in abiotic protection. This may reflect focused investment in metabolites with the highest ecological benefit relative to their concentration in high-elevation willows. At the same time, they possessed greater richness of metabolites involved in biotic interactions, while variation in microhabitat preferences among high-elevation species likely contributed to the high variation in their total metabolite pool.

AB  - Outbreaks of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar japonica Motschulsky) cause serious defoliation in birch. A single year of defoliation has no significant impact on the trees, whereas continuous defoliation events could be fatal. How birch species avoid serious damage caused by gypsy moth outbreak is yet to be revealed. Trichomes on leaf surfaces of birch trees are an effective antiherbivore defense strategy. We examined a 1-yr delayed induction of glandular (GT) and nonglandular trichomes (NGT) on leaf surfaces caused by stress in white birch (Betula platyphylla Sukaczev var. japonica [Miq.] Hara) and monarch birch (Betula maximowicziana Regel). Saplings were subjected to four treatments in June 2009: herbivory (50% of the leaf area was grazed by gypsy moths), mechanical cutting (50% of the leaf area was cut using scissors), shading (50% light shading with a black sheet), and control (covered with a net to prevent herbivory). Then, the density of GT and NGT on early leaves was determined in April 2010. In both birch species, the density of GT was higher in herbivory than in other treatments. The density of GT due to mechanical cutting was higher than that in the control, but only for white birch. However, the density of NGT was lower after mechanical cutting than in other treatments for white birch. There were no differences in the density of NGT among treatments for monarch birch. These results show that 1-yr delayed induction of GT by herbivory was stronger in white birch than in monarch birch.

AB  - Tigers (Panthera tigris) are endangered wild felids, despite ongoing efforts to recover populations globally. The majority of the global population is concentrated within similar to 40 "source sites". Protection and effective management of these populations constitute the cornerstone of global tiger conservation strategies. Reliable population estimates and site specific carrying capacities are important for informed management actions. Here, we estimated the ecological carrying capacity of tigers based on prey densities in the Bardia- Banke Complex in western Nepal embedded within the Terai Arc Landscape, a globally significant tiger conservation landscape. A total of 303.8 km line transects (n=195) were surveyed in the Bardia-Banke Complex. We estimated an overall density of 69.09 (95 % CI=52.32 - 91.23) ungulates/km(2) and biomass of 2736.92 (1807.83 - 4830.12) kg/km(2) in Bardia National Park (NP), and 25.67 (18.22 - 36.18) ungulates/km(2) and biomass of 1356.65 (646.85 - 2994.86) kg/km(2) in Banke NP. The available prey base can support 133 (101 - 177) adult tigers in Bardia NP and 28 (20 - 40) in Banke NP. We also carried out systematic camera trap survey across the Complex with a sampling effort of 13,365 trap days (719 camera sites). In core habitats of Bardia and Banke NP, we estimated tiger abundance of 77 (72 - 83) and 12 (9 - 15) at a density of 7.96 and 2.18 tigers per 100 km(2) respectively. Our study shows the tiger populations in the national parks are below carrying capacity. We emphasize the need for robust estimates of prey abundance and carrying capacity of tigers in a given landscape for effective conservation planning. We highlight the importance of high prey density and biomass with effective human-tiger conflict mitigation measures to sustain a large tiger source population.

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) wet pool size (GITwps) refers to the total amount of wet contents in GIT, which in small ruminants can reach up to 19% of their body weight (BW). This study aimed to develop models to comprehensively predict GITwps in small ruminants using a meta-regression approach. A dataset was created based on 21 studies, comprising 750 individual records of sheep and goats. Various predictor variables, including BW, sex, breed, species, intake level, physiological states, stages and types of pregnancy, dry matter intake, and neutral detergent fiber intake (NDFI), were initially analyzed through simple linear regression. Subsequently, the variables were fitted using natural logarithm transformations, considering the random effect of the study and residual error, employing a supervised forward selection procedure. Overall, no significant relationship between GITwps and BW (p = 0.326) was observed for animals fed a milk-based diet. However, a strong negative linear relationship (p < 0.001) was found for animals on a solid diet, with the level of restriction influencing GITwps only at the intercept. Furthermore, the prediction of GITwps was independent of sex and influenced by species in cases where individuals were fed ad libitum. Pregnant females showed a noticeable reduction in GITwps, which was more pronounced in cases of multiple pregnancies, regardless of species (p < 0.01). The composition of the diet was found to be the primary factor affecting the modulation of GITwps, with NDFI able to override the species effect (p < 0.0001). Overall, this study sheds light on the factors influencing GITwps in small ruminants, providing valuable insights into their digestive processes and nutritional requirements.

AB  - Hunter participation in testing harvested white-tailed deer for chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a critical wildlife disease surveillance strategy; however, this strategy has not been evaluated to determine what may promote or discourage hunter participation in testing when involvement is voluntary. We used a binomial logit model to predict the relative influence of harvest location and several psychological constructs on hunters' voluntary participation in testing for CWD in Wisconsin, USA. The presence of CWD in the county of harvest was a significant factor in determining hunter participation in testing. We found hunters' testing behavior was influenced by risk perceptions associated with CWD impacts on the deer population and consumption of venison from areas of the state known to have CWD. Higher risk perceptions associated with CWD impacts to economic values and recreational hunting experiences decreased the likelihood of testing for the disease. Belief in the efficacy of CWD management actions was another significant factor; however, this effect varied with levels of trust in information provided by the managing agency, attention paid to news coverage related to CWD, and risk perceptions associated with economic and recreational impacts. For agencies seeking to increase hunter engagement with CWD management through participation in voluntary testing programs, a key challenge is to demonstrate how testing contributes to effective disease management.

AB  - Premise: The expected concomitant increase in multiple stressors such as herbivory and drought may threaten peatland ecosystems. How Sphagnum, the ecological engineers of peatlands, responds to combined stressors remains largely unexplored. Here we aimed to clarify resource allocations in Sphagnum during concomitant herbivory and drought. Methods: S. magellanicum and S. fuscum were exposed to drought and herbivory together or separately in laboratory experiments and analyzed for growth (biomass production and net photosynthetic rate), defense (phenolics in leachates and phenolics in extraction) and nonstructural carbohydrates (soluble sugar and starch) in relation to untreated controls. Results: Herbivory and drought had significant interactive effects on Sphagnum growth and defense. In both species, drought without herbivory reduced the phenolics in leachate, but with herbivory increased phenolics, indicating a synergistic effect between herbivory and drought on Sphagnum defense. Both stressors significantly decreased biomass production, with the combined stress having a more negative effect. Interestingly, a growth-defense trade-off was found in the drought treatment of both Sphagnum species, but disappeared in the wet treatment. Conversely, a trade-off between soluble sugars and phenolics was found in the wet but not in the drought treatment, suggesting that soluble sugars may play a role in inducing the defense and hence mask the growth-defense trade-off in peat mosses. Conclusions: Our results emphasize that predicting the impact of combined stressors on peat moss traits is complex and challenging. Future models should account for the effects of multiple environmental stressors to guide peatland conservation under climate warming.

AB  - Along with exposure to parasites and other biological disease vectors, animal faeces can also contain heavy metals and metalloids. We quantified metals, metalloids, and non-metals in the faeces of capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) that live in parks in the city of Campo Grande (Brazil). Quantification of metalloids was obtained after acid digestion using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. Higher mean concentrations in mg/kg of aluminium (Al) (140.322), arsenic (As) (0.010), cadmium (Cd) (1.042), chromium (Cr) (26.866), cobalt (Co) (1.946), copper (Cu) (50.764), lead (Pb) (8.762), manganese (Mn) (291.469), molybdenum (Mo) (3.634), nickel (Ni) (5.475), and zinc (Zn) (100.027) were quantified in samples of faeces of capybara that live on the banks of a lagoon that receives input from streams that cross the city. According to the risk assessment, potential risks to the health of children and adults may occur due to the presence of Al, As, Cd, Co, Cu, and Mn through involuntary oral ingestion of faeces, via inhalation and dermal contact. The hazard index (HI) due to oral ingestion was greater than 1 for children and adults. Therefore, we believe that faeces of H. hydrochaeris can be considered as a bioindicator of environmental pollution in urban parks.

AB  - Pollination services of cacao are crucial for global chocolate production, yet remain critically understudied, particularly in regions of origin of the species. Notably, uncertainties remain concerning the identity of cacao pollinators, the influence of landscape (forest distance) and management (shade cover) on flower visitation and the role of pollen deposition in limiting fruit set. Here, we aimed to improve understanding of cacao pollination by studying limiting factors of fruit set in Peru, part of the centre of origin of cacao. Flower visitors were sampled with sticky insect glue in 20 cacao agroforests in two biogeographically distinct regions of Peru, across gradients of shade cover and forest distance. Further, we assessed pollen quantities and compared fruit set between naturally and manually pollinated flowers. The most abundant flower visitors were aphids, ants and thrips in the north and thrips, midges and parasitoid wasps in the south of Peru. We present some evidence of increasing visitation rates from medium to high shade (40%-95% canopy closure) in the dry north, and opposite patterns in the semi-humid south, during the wet season. Natural pollination resulted in remarkably low fruit set rates (2%), and very low pollen deposition. After hand pollination, fruit set more than tripled (7%), but was still low. The diversity and high relative abundances of herbivore flower visitors limit our ability to draw conclusions on the functional role of different flower visitors. The remarkably low fruit set of naturally and even hand pollinated flowers indicates that other unaddressed factors limit cacao fruit production. Such factors could be, amongst others, a lack of effective pollinators, genetic incompatibility or resource limitation. Revealing efficient pollinator species and other causes of low fruit set rates is therefore key to establish location-specific management strategies and develop high yielding native cacao agroforestry systems in regions of origin of cacao.

AB  - The Bag-shelter moth, Ochrogaster lunifer (Lepidoptera: Notodontidae), is an Australian endemic species of Thaumetopoeinae with a univoltine life cycle and gregarious, herbivorous larvae. It is variable throughout its range across the continent, most noticeably by the species of host tree used and nest-building behaviour. It has long been considered a species complex by some taxonomists, and the lack of gene flow between populations of ground-nesters and above-ground nesters at the same sites provides strong evidence for at least two species. We tested the specificity of host use and nesting behaviour of ground-nesting and trunk-nesting forms of O. lunifer by transplanting field-collected egg masses to the other form's host, either in their natural position or in the position used by the other form. At the study site, ground-nesting and trunk-nesting (tree-hugger) O. lunifer coexist. Ground-nesting larvae are found on Acacia spp., and egg masses are laid at the base of host tree trunks where nests develop whereas tree-hugger larvae are found on Blakella tessellaris, egg masses are laid in the outer canopy, and nests develop on the trunk or large branches. Of the 47 egg masses of O. lunifer transplanted to the unnatural host, only one cohort of tree-hugger larvae developed through to adult moths. Placing an egg mass in its unnatural position on its natural host did not prevent the larvae from developing and successfully establishing nests for either nesting-form, although all the ground-nesters moved position (from the canopy to the ground) and the tree-huggers mostly did not (from the ground to the canopy). Only the tree-hugger form of O. lunifer developed a viable nest on the unnatural host species, established a nest at the unnatural oviposition site, and shared that nest with larvae of the other nesting-form, suggesting tree-hugger larvae are somewhat plastic in their behaviour and ecology. Our findings add to previous studies indicating that Acacia is likely the ancestral host of O. lunifer though large areas of its range remain unstudied.

AB  - Background: Alpine meadows, typical steppes, and deserts are among the globally important rangeland types that are generally distributed along temperature and precipitation gradients. Mineral losses caused by grazing are one of the key factors that can lead to instability or even degradation of these rangeland ecosystems.Methods: We examined the concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn in soil, forage, and livestock dungs from diverse rangeland types in northwest China, to determine the relationships between these trace elements (TEs) con-centrations and climatic factors (i.e., temperature, precipitation, and humidity), and to evaluate the potential risks of TEs deficiencies or excesses in these rangeland ecosystems.Results: Forage Zn concentrations in forage of all three types of rangeland, and Cu concentrations in forage of the alpine meadow did not meet the growth requirements of grazing livestock. Concentrations of Cu, Fe, and Mn in forage and Fe, Mn, and Zn in livestock dungs had quadratic parabola relationships with temperature, precipi-tation, and humidity, but the relationships between climate factors and Cu, Fe, and Mn concentrations in soil were not significant. In addition, the abilities of the plant to absorb Cu, Fe, and Zn from soil were stronger in the typical steppe than that in the alpine meadows and desert. Also, the abilities of livestock to return TEs to soil were stronger in the alpine meadow than that in the typical steppe and desert.Conclusion: We derived a conceptual mode that the ratio of TE concentrations of the plant to soil and of livestock dung to forage represents the abilities of plants to absorb TEs from the soil matrix and livestock to return TEs to soil or to absorb TEs from forage, respectively. Results indicate potentially more serious risks of TEs deficiencies, especially that of Zn than previously considered in typical steppes and desert rangelands.

AB  - Losses of floral tissues to herbivory (florivory) can affect plant reproduction, population growth and structure, and community dynamics. Because carnivorous plants inhabit nutrient-poor environments and exhibit slow growth rates, losses to herbivory may be particularly costly. However, there has been no published study of florivory in carnivorous plants. We conducted a 2-year field study in Leon County, Texas USA, on the carnivorous Pale Pitcher Plant Sarracenia alata and its specialist herbivore Exyra semicrocea. We surveyed the proportions of flowers attacked and compared the mass of floral components (ovaries, anthers, petals, sepals, and style) between attacked and undamaged flowers. In 2017, a mean of 53% of flowers was attacked. The anther count and the masses of anthers, perianth (petals + sepals), and style were significantly lower in attacked flowers than in undamaged flowers, but ovary mass was not significantly affected. The total flower dry mass (without peduncle) of attacked flowers on the last collection date was 13.3% less than that of undamaged flowers, but this difference was not statistically significant. In 2018, a mean of 33% of flowers were attacked, with significant mass losses from all floral components, including ovaries. The total flower dry mass (without peduncle) of attacked flowers on the last collection date was significantly (48%) less than that of undamaged flowers. Herbivore population size, differences in emergence phenology of the host and/or herbivore, and differential defense of components may have contributed to differences between years in the proportion of flowers attacked and variation in the floral structures consumed.

AB  - We explore the correspondence between changing palaeoenvironments, patterns of site use, and lithic technology at the rock shelter site Klein Kliphuis (South Africa) across the interval 65-55 000 years before present. This period coincides with the termination of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4, and the disappearance of an iconic late Pleistocene archaeological unit known as the Howiesons Poort. Wood charcoals indicate sufficient soil moisture around Klein Kliphuis throughout the Howiesons Poort to support diverse tree species at a time when site occupation was relatively intense. At least some fuelwood-gathering in this period may have been undertaken to support heat treatment of silcrete, which was the dominant lithology in tool production. A coherent set of changes occurs across the MIS 4/3 transition: occupational intensity declines, tracked by declining diversity of fuelwood species, an increase in the proportion of charcoals from shrubs and small flowering plants, lower prevalence of silcrete, and less heat treatment. While declining soil moisture is implied, there appears to be a significant change in behaviour relating to site usage, whereby foraging for dense fuelwoods was replaced by the construction of 'fast fires' that may reflect briefer visits and increased forager mobility in early MIS 3.

AB  - Plant secondary metabolites play important roles in defence against herbivorous insects. However, many insects can overcome plant defences even when they produce a rich toxin load, and an arms race between plants evolving new toxins and insects evolving to counter them is expected. Here, we deciphered genomic features linked to a potential race between the tree of heaven and two monophagous weevils that only feed on this tree species, with the tree of heaven producing a rich set of secondary metabolites involving about 745 compounds. We first assembled chromosome-level genomes for the tree of heaven and the two weevils. Comparative genomics showed an expansion of genes related to synthesising secondary metabolites in the tree, while in the weevils, genes related to detoxification and chemosensing expanded. The expansion of core genes involved in quassinoid biosynthesis in the tree was linked to tandem duplication and whole genome duplication, while the expansion of detoxifying GST and chemosensing SNMP genes in the two weevils was linked to tandem duplication and novel genes, respectively. The results indicate that plants and insect herbivores both reshaped their genomes through gene expansion, while the host tree also underwent whole genome duplication and the two weevils evolved novel genes. These changes likely reflect an arms race of defence and counter-defence, providing an understanding of genome evolution driven by trophic interactions.

AB  - In Germany, the high risk of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) is further increasing due to increasing traffic volumes and road densities as well as the growing population densities of common ungulate species. As a result, threats to human health and property as well as wildlife mortality of widely spread and rare species increase. Currently, three basic types of wildlife fences are used in Germany: type A, a conventional galvanized-high tensile deer fence (made of knot braid); type B, a chain wire (mesh wire) fence; type C, a rigid welded wire mesh fence panels. Since fencing needs to restrict access of many different species with different behaviours (e.g. jumping, climbing, digging), fencing needs to be multifaceted to be effectively. Furthermore, the occurrence of wildlife species with habits such as jumping, climbing or digging determines the optimal (functional) fence design per location. We surveyed road managers in combination with a personal assessment of road sections in Germany and derived the following recommendations for optimal fencing to reduce WVC: 1) To deter digging, use plates made of recycled synthetic materials or a concrete foundation, instead of barbed wire. 2) Fencing should be made of chain wire (mesh wire, type B) fence or rigid welded wire mesh fence panels (type C) instead of knot braid mesh (type A). 3) To restrict climbing, use angled chain wire fence or rigid welded wire mesh fence panels at the top of the fences. 4) Maintain fences so that they are kept free from ingrown vegetation/woods. Maintenance conditions should be considered while planning and building the fence, especially to ensure sufficient space on both sides for accessibility. 5) Fencing should be established preferably near the roadside and moved away from property lines. In conclusion, wildlife fencing could be a very effective mitigation measure to prevent WVC with common as well as protected species, when proper designed and recommendations of the survey will be consequently considered. Currently many wildlife fences lack functionality due to an inappropriate design and maintenance issues in Germany.

AB  - Conflicts between different goals can obstruct progress in sustainability, but interests may also coincide. We evaluated relationships between environmental quality and animal welfare on Swedish farms with grazing livestock, using publicly available databases. Data were collected from 8700 official animal welfare inspections on 5808 cattle farms and 2823 inspections on 2280 sheep farms in 2012-2017. Compliance with three animal-based checkpoints was modeled using logistic regression, including a random farm effect to account for repeated inspections. Compliance was regressed on semi-natural grassland area, participation in the National Meadow and Pasture Inventory, Agri-Environmental Scheme (AES) grassland payments, presence of indicator plant species, and the presence of Natura 2000 habitats. Cattle farms complied more often if they received AES payments for grasslands of special values compared with if they did not apply for them (OR = 1.55-1.65; p <= 0.0001) and there was a similar tendency for cattle farms that applied for but were denied such payments (OR = 1.29; p = 0.074). There was also a strong tendency for Natura 2000 habitats on cattle farms to be associated with higher compliance (OR = 1.36; p = 0.059). These results suggest a direct or indirect causal effect of biodiversity on cattle welfare. The same associations could not be shown in sheep.

AB  - Four new species of vulcanellid sponges (Demospongiae: Tetractinellida), Poecillastra malyutini sp. nov., Vulcanella koltuni sp. nov., V. commander sp. nov. and V. grebelnyi sp. nov., are described from the Piip submarine volcano and adjacent area (the Bering Sea, North Pacific). This work includes materials sampled using the ROV Comanche 18 during the cruises of the RV Akademik M.A. Lavrentyev in 2016 and 2018. These specimens were studied and illustrated using light and electron (SEM) microscopy and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The distribution of species is characterized by pronounced vertical zoning. In areas of hydrothermal vents and on their periphery, Demospongiae are abundant with a pronounced dominance of a single species, V. koltuni sp. nov. The delta 13C value for V. koltuni sp. nov. and P. malyutini sp. nov. from the volcano summits were almost 2-fold lower than for V. commander sp. nov. collected outside the areas of hydrothermal activity. These isotopic signatures indicate the organic matter of chemosynthetic origin in the diet of V. koltuni sp. nov. and P. malyutini sp. nov. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rDNA does not confirm the phylogenetic relationship of Lamellomorpha Bergquist, 1968 with the family Vulcanellidae C ' ardenas, Xavier, Reveillaud, Schander & Rapp, 2011.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the effect of long-term use of chlortetracycline (CTC) on the gut microbiota composition and metabolism profiles in pigs, and the variation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microbial communities in faeces and manure during aerobic composting (AC) and anaerobic digestion (AD). The pigs were fed the same basal diet supplemented with or without 75 mg/kg CTC, and fresh faeces of 30-, 60-, 90-, and 120-day-old pigs were collected from the CTC group. The results showed that CTC reduced the diversity of the gut microbiota significantly and changed its structure. Metabolomics analysis of intestinal contents revealed 23 differentially abundant metabolites, mainly organic acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. Metabolic pathways, such as the TCA cycle, propionate metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism, were changed. From 30 to 120 days of age, the amount of CTC residues in faeces and the abundance of 3 tetracycline resistance genes increased significantly, and it was positively correlated with tetC, tetG, tetW, sul1 and intI2. CTC residue levels and ARGs abundance gradually decreased with fermentation time, and AC was better than AD at reducing ARGs abundance. The results suggest that in-feed CTC can reduce the diversity of the gut microbiota, change the structure, function and metabolism of the bacterial community, and increase the abundance of ARGs in faeces.

AB  - Vossia cuspidata (Roxb.) Griff. (Poaceae) is a serious invasive plant in Africa, capable to colonize several riverine wetlands. Controlling of any invasive plant is hampered by the lack of studies involving its growth ecology. Here, we aimed to evaluate the monthly and seasonal variations in the dry biomass partitioning of V. cuspidata and its macronutrients in three aquatic habitats (slopes, water edges and open water) along the banks of the River Nile in Cairo, Egypt. In the study area V. cuspidata started its growth in February 2018 by the formation of shoots, which sprouted from buds on the underground rhizomes, showed its maximum growth in autumn and entered the senescent stage in early winter. The monthly maximum biomass dry matter (BDM) of the root system (48.9 g DWm 2) occurred in October, and in April for rhizomes (110.4 g DWm(-2)). The BDM production of leaves was minimum in March at the three habitats while its maximum was obtained in September or October reaching 326.6 g DWm(-2) on slopes, 303.6 g DWm(-2) in water edges and 246.6 g DWm(-2) in open water, respectively. The maximum monthly total BDM partitioning of V. cuspidata was 604.5 g DWm(-2) on the slopes during September and reached 543.8 and 550.0 g DWm(-2) in open water and water edges, respectively, during October. The highest total BDM production was obtained in autumn, while the mean of BDM of the four seasons was 1869.7 g DWm(-2) +/- 150.9. Generally, the concentrations (% biomass DW) of the analyzed nutrient elements (K, Ca, Mg, N and P) showed mostly a gradual decrease with time during the year; starting from spring until summer or autumn, then increased again in autumn or winter. An important result of this study is that to conserve other native species, then the harvest of the aboveground organs of V. cuspidata should be carried out during late autumn in November after the translocation of reserved materials from the belowground organs to maximize V. cuspidata biomass removal.

AB  - The abundance of coprophilous (dung-inhabiting) fungal spores (CFS) in sedimentary records is an increasingly popular proxy for past megaherbivore abundance that is used to study megaherbivore-vegetation interactions, timing of megaherbivore population declines and extinctions, and the introduction of domesticated herbivores. This method often relies on counting CFS alongside pollen and tracers of known concentration such as exotic pollen or synthetic microspherules. Prior work has encouraged reporting CFS abundances as accumulation rates (spores/unit(2)/year) or concentration (spores/unit(3)) instead of percentages relative to the total pollen abundance, because CFS percentages can be sensitive to fluctuations in pollen influx. In this work, we quantify the uncertainty associated with estimating concentration values at different total counts and find that high uncertainty is associated with concentration estimates using low to moderate total counts (n = 20 to 200) of individual fungal spore types and tracers. We also demonstrate the effect of varying tracer proportions, and find that larger tracer proportions result in narrower confidence intervals. Finally, the probability of encountering a CFS spore from a specific taxon occurring in moderate concentrations (1,000 spores/unit(2)) dramatically decreases after a low tracer count (similar to 50). The uncertainties in concentration estimates caused by calculating tracer proportion are a likely cause of the high observed variance in many CFS time series, especially when CFS or tracer concentrations are low. Thus, we recommend future CFS studies increase counts and report the uncertainty surrounding concentration values. For some records, reporting spore data as presence/absence rather than concentrations or counts is preferable, such as when performing high counts is not feasible.

AB  - In Yakutia, 31 cases of sable hunting for musk deer were registered in 1990-2021. The success of sable hunting for its prey is increased in snowy winters. Large adult sable males mainly specialize in the hunt for musk deer. There are more females than males in the sex and age composition of the predator's killed prey (1 : 4.5), the proportion of youngsters being the minimal. The largest number of sable attacks on musk deer is recorded in the second half of winter (83.3%) and reaches the maximum in February. Sable switches to large prey while reducing access to common food items (mouse-like rodents, berries, nuts, etc.) as the snow cover grows.

AB  - Vermicompost was used as an additive in swine manure composting to investigate the expression of bacterial functional genes on nutrients biotransformation. Three treatments with vermicompost compositions of 10%, 20%, and 30% in swine manure were set up. Raw manure was used as the control. The thermophilic period increased to 12 days, the NH4+ -N/NO3- -N ratio decreased to 0.85, and the germination index (GI) increased to 166% after vermicompost addition. Furthermore, higher relative abundances of Firmicutes were observed in the substrate during the initial stages of experiment. The abundance of the dominant phylum Proteobacteria and its related pathogenic genera Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas decreased in the thermophilic stage while the potentially beneficial genera Actinomadura and Chryseolinea increased. The expression of primary functional genes associated with the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, xenobiotics, and fatty acids was enhanced during the thermophilic phase. Besides, most dominant genera showed strengthened correlations with NO3--N and GI, which were the strongest environmental factors for bacterial communities. Network analysis revealed a new metabolic pathway associated with dominant genera Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas, and Oceanobacter, whose abundance increased with vermicompost addition. Collectively, the results of this study indicate that vermicompost can promote composting efficiency by increasing the potentially beneficial bacteria, decreasing pathogenic bacteria, and enhancing the metabolic capacity of bacterial communities.

AB  - Blackflies (Diptera: Simuliidae) are cosmopolitan nuisance pests of great economic importance as well as vectors of many pathogens. After reports of massive blackfly biting of captive nyala antelopes in the Vienna Zoo, Austria, this study aimed to identify the species causing multiple skin lesions on the antelope hosts. The Palearctic species Simulium equinum, belonging to the medically and veterinary important Wilhelmia subgenus, was identified as the most likely causative agent. Barcoding and maximum likelihood analysis supported morphological species identification and highlighted the complex phylogeny of the subgenus Wilhelmia. Our study gives first evidence of the multi-host feeding blackfly S. equinum in the Vienna Zoo, thereby raising the question whether other hosts could also be bitten on a regular basis. The preliminary results urge for further analysis of blackfly breeding sites as well as the clarification of the host spectrum to assess the medical and veterinary importance of blackflies in the Zoo.

AB  - Moschidae are the only pecoran ruminants where all representatives totally lack cranial appendages today. Latest phylogenetic studies name them the sister group of Bovidae. Thus, cladogenesis of Moschidae and Bovidae should be older than the earliest known bovids (similar to 18 Ma). However, the oldest known moschid fossil so far dates to about 16 Ma years old in Eastern Europe. This and other early records so far comprise few fossils and thus, the early evolution as well as the origin of the extant Moschus is not yet fully known. Here, we report new results on the Moschidae from the Shinanu Fauna, Linxia Basin, older than 15 Ma. New and historic material reveal some of the oldest records of Moschidae and an unexpected rich diversity, especially for this early phase of evolution. A new taxon, 'Micromeryx' caoi sp. nov., presents affinities with the late Middle Miocene species 'M.' eiselei from Steinheim am Albuch. The second new taxon represents the oldest described Hispanomeryx species, Hispanomeryx linxiaensis sp. nov. and confirms an Asian Hispanomeryx-lineage. Furthermore, there may be one additional so far undetermined large moschid in the basin during this time slice. Our results provide essential data for a possible Asiatic origin of the Moschidae, and for their early evolution, and improve our understanding of terrestrial Early Miocene ecosystems in East Asia.
