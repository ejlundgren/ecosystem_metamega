AB  - Species invasions and range shifts can lead to novel host-parasite communities, but we lack general rules on which new associations are likely to form. While many studies examine parasite sharing among host species, the directionality of transmission is typically overlooked, impeding our ability to derive principles of parasite acquisition. Consequently, we analysed parasite records from the non-native ranges of 11 carnivore and ungulate species. Using boosted regression trees, we modelled parasite acquisition within each zoogeographic realm of a focal host's non-native range, using a suite of predictors characterizing the parasites themselves and the host community in which they live. We found that higher parasite prevalence among established hosts increases the likelihood of acquisition, particularly for generalist parasites. Non-native host species are also more likely to acquire parasites from established host species to which they are closely related; however, the acquisition of several parasite groups is biased to phylogenetically specialist parasites, indicating potential costs of parasite generalism. Statistical models incorporating these features provide an accurate prediction of parasite acquisition, indicating that measurable host and parasite traits can be used to estimate the likelihood of new host-parasite associations forming. This work provides general rules to help anticipate novel host-parasite associations created by climate change and other anthropogenic influences.

AB  - The adaptive physiological functions of black Bengal goats (Capra hircus) of coastal regions were compared with goats from the plains during winter, spring, and summer seasons. Goats in the coastal zone had significantly (P < 0.01) higher plasma electrolytes levels. Goats in the plains zone had significantly (P < 0.01) higher haemoglobin, PCV, TEC, and erythrocyte indices and lower TLC values. Glucose, total protein, and creatinine were significantly (P < 0.01) lower, whereas cholesterol, BUN, and SGPT were significantly (P < 0.01) higher in goats of coastal zone. Regardless of zones, glucose, total protein, and creatinine levels were higher in winter, cholesterol and SGOT levels were higher in spring, and BUN was higher in summer. Goats from coastal areas had significantly (P < 0.05) higher urinary pH and urea levels. Goats in the coastal zone had significantly (P < 0.05) higher cortisol concentrations. From the above study, we can conclude that salinity of feed, soil and water does not significantly affect the homeostasis of black Bengal goats reared in coastal areas, indicating their adaptability to saline coastal environments and their potential for reproduction in a climate-resilient livestock system.

AB  - Wildlife management often involves trade-offs between protecting species and allowing human activities and development. Ideally, these decisions are guided by scientific studies that quantify the impacts of proposed actions on the environment. However, critical information to assess impacts of proposed activities may be lacking, such as certainty in where actions will take place, which may hinder a robust impact assessment. To address this issue, we present the Development Impacts Analysis (DIA), which employs Monte Carlo simulation modeling to quantify the environmental consequences of proposed development scenarios, while accounting for uncertainty in the exact location of future development. We applied the DIA to five proposed oil leasing management scenarios under a revised management plan for the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. For each management scenario with differing levels of proposed development ("alternatives"), oil production pads and roads were randomly simulated in proportion to estimated undiscovered oil and following alternative-specific restrictions. We assessed habitat displacement for two caribou (Rangifer tarandus) herds, eight shorebird species, and black brant (Branta bernicla) based on reported responses to development, repeating the process 100 times for each alternative. Some habitat loss was reported for each proposed alternative, but the amount of impact varied by alternative and species. One caribou herd and most bird species indicated greatest effects in the alternative with the least restrictions on development and lesser impacts under more protective alternatives. Our results emphasized the importance of considering spatial variation in development effects and species-specific differences when evaluating management proposals. The DIA quantified potential impacts on a suite of species under proposed management alternatives, while accounting for uncertainty in where development will occur and providing confidence intervals on estimated impacts. This illustrates that uncertainty need not preclude management decisions about establishment of broad land use restrictions prior to submission of project-level proposals but can instead be explicitly incorporated into decision making. While no single management approach will likely benefit all species, use of tools such as the DIA allows managers to quantify trade-offs among species and pursue approaches that balance the needs of various taxa and other management objectives.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a highly destructive invasive species throughout North and South America, Australia, and many island nations. Where invasive, their populations are targeted for control to reduce damage. Con-trolling wild pigs often involves baiting to draw them into traps or entice them to consume a toxic bait. However, baiting can have mixed success in congregating wild pigs to focal areas long enough for control measures to ultimately be implemented. We sought to evaluate how environmental conditions (i.e., precipitation) and negative stimuli (i.e., proxy for exposure to previous control efforts) influenced use of bait sites by wild pigs. We compared visitation to bait sites during dry (2019-2020) and wet (2021) years, and between wild pigs that had been previously trapped and released in southcentral Alabama and northcentral Texas, USA. We found that drier years substantially increased use of bait sites by wild pigs (i.e., 119-136 % increase over 17 days). Similarly, wild pigs that did not experience negative stimuli had increased use of bait sites (i.e., 30-31 % increase over 17 days). We recommend that managers intensify their control efforts during drier periods to take advantage of susceptible behaviors of wild pigs during these times. We also recommend that control efforts focus on eliminating the potential for surviving wild pigs which may experience negative stimuli (e.g., narrow misses during trapping, shooting some wild pigs from a group, sub-lethal doses from toxic baits) and become educated against future efforts.

AB  - Deer in northern temperate environments show behavioral and physiological adaptations to conserve energy during winter, including decreased movements. Whether these behaviors persist in warmer temperate environments such as the arid Southwest has received little consideration. We compared daily movements as estimated by continuous-time movement models and minimum subdaily (4 h) straight-line movements of adult female mule deer between winter and spring-autumn seasons in south-central New Mexico. Deer moved less during winter daily (2.90 vs. 4.34 km/d) and subdaily (302 vs. 409 m). Similarly, for deer for which movement data for successive seasons were available, movements between successive seasons were less during the winter (daily = -1.05 km/d; subdaily = -91 m) than the following or preceding spring-autumn. Our results support conservation of decreased movements during winter in the less extreme winters of the arid Southwest. Because some proximate stimuli (i.e., deep snow, very cold temperatures) associated with energy conservation behaviors are lacking in the arid Southwest, our results further support low forage quality and availability being the primary drivers of this behavior.

AB  - The land is where Inuit knowledge transfer has taken place for generations. Land-based programs for learning and healing have been increasingly initiated across Inuit Nunangat in support of Inuit knowledge transfer that was disrupted by colonial settlement policies and imposed governance systems. We worked with Elders in Uqsuqtuuq (Gjoa Haven, Nunavut) to develop a project to understand the connections between caribou and community well-being. They emphasized that Elder -youth land camps are the most effective means for Elders to share their knowledge, for youth to learn, and for researchers to engage in respectful research. We used the Qaggiq Model for Inuktut knowledge renewal as a guiding framework, and we followed the direction of a land camp planning committee to plan, facilitate, and follow-up on three land camps (2011 -2013). The Qaggiq Model also outlines the Qaggiq Dialogue as a way of engaging in relational accountability according to Inuit context and values. In this paper, we reflect on the complexities of upholding relational accountability in cross-cultural research - as part of entering into a Qaggiq Dialogue - with particular emphasis on local leadership, ethics and safety, experiential learning, and continuity. Our intention is to help others evaluate the opportunities and limitations of land camps for their own community context and research questions.

AB  - This study evaluated the impact of soil modifiers on seed germination and soil quality. Mixtures of paper mill sludge (PMS) with camellia oilseed cake (CO) and peat moss (P), as well as with oilseed cake of toothache tree (TO) and peat moss (P), showed promising results as biostimulants for seed germination. The addition of PMS increased the germination index, indicating its beneficial effects on seed performance. The pH levels remained optimal, and the electrical conductivity values stayed within acceptable ranges, suggesting minimal hindrance to plant growth. The cation exchange capacity increased with PMS, enhancing nutrient availability. Composted mixtures exhibited increased phosphorus levels, contributing to soil fertility. While the organic matter content decreased after composting, the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio remained balanced. The bulk density increased after composting, potentially improving soil drainage. Overall, the TO-containing mixture demonstrated superior growth rates compared to the P. These findings support the use of PMS-based soil modifiers for enhancing seed germination and improving soil quality.

AB  - Wildlife fences are often considered an important tool in conservation. Fences are used in attempts to prevent human-wildlife conflict and reduce poaching, despite known negative impacts on landscape connectivity and animal movement patterns. Such impacts are likely to be particularly important for wide-ranging species, such as the African wild dog Lycaon pictus, which requires large areas of continuous habitat to fulfil its resource requirements. Laikipia County in northern Kenya is an important area for wild dogs but new wildlife fences are increasingly being built in this ecosystem. Using a long-term dataset from the area's free-ranging wild dog population, we evaluated the effect of wildlife fence structure on the ability of wild dogs to cross them. The extent to which fences impeded wild dog movement differed between fence designs, although individuals crossed fences of all types. Purpose-built fence gaps increased passage through relatively impermeable fences. Nevertheless, low fence permeability can lead to packs, or parts of packs, becoming trapped on the wrong side of a fence, with consequences for population dynamics. Careful evaluation should be given to the necessity of erecting fences; ecological impact assessments should incorporate evaluation of impacts on animal movement patterns and should be undertaken for all large-scale fencing interventions. Where fencing is unavoidable, projects should use the most permeable fencing structures possible, both in the design of the fence and including as many purpose-built gaps as possible, to minimize impacts on wide-ranging wildlife.

AB  - Lepidoptera are a highly diverse group of herbivorous insects; however, some superfamilies have relatively few species. Two alternative hypotheses for drivers of Lepidoptera diversity are shifts in food plant use or shifts from concealed to external feeding as larvae. Many studies address the former hypothesis but with bias toward externally feeding taxa. One of the most striking examples of species disparity between sister lineages in Lepidoptera is between the concealed-feeding sack-bearer moths (Mimallonoidea), which contain about 300 species, and externally feeding Macroheterocera, which have over 74,000 species. We provide the first dated tree of Mimallonidae to understand the diversification dynamics of these moths in order to fill a knowledge gap pertaining to drivers of diversity within an important concealed-feeding clade. We find that Mimallonidae is an ancient Lepidoptera lineage that originated in the Cretaceous similar to 105 million years ago and has had a close association with the plant order Myrtales for the past 40 million years. Diversification dynamics are tightly linked with food plant usage in this group. Reliance on Myrtales may have influenced diversification of Mimallonidae because clades that shifted away from the ancestral condition of feeding on Myrtales have the highest speciation rates in the family.

AB  - Plantations have been reconsidered as important habitats for wildlife, including bats, in recent decades. Although Japan has a high proportion of plantations used for timber production in the forest area, knowledge of the effects of forest management practices such as clearcuttings and thinning on bats is still lacking. We investigated bat activity using bat detectors in evergreen coniferous plantation stands (23 mature stands, and 7 clear-cut stands) in Tochigi prefecture, central Japan. Based on the bat calls, we classified them into four groups: Nyctalus and Vespertilio bats (NYVE), open-space foraging bats; Rhinolophus bats (RH), edge and closed-space foraging bats; Pipistrellus bats (PI), edge foraging bats; and Myotis and Murina bats (MYMU), edge and closed-space foraging bats. We recorded bat calls in each stand from June to September, compared bat activity between mature stands and clear-cut stands, and examined the effects of stand structure on bat activity in mature stands. The activity of all groups (except RH, which had insufficient sample size for statistical testing) was significantly higher in clear-cut stands than in mature stands. The ratio of feeding buzzes to activity (feeding buzz ratio) in the NYVE group was also higher in clear-cut stands than in mature stands. The feeding buzz ratio in the NYVE group showed a significant positive correlation with tree density. Thus, clear-cut stands provide foraging habitats for some bat species, including open-space foraging bats. However, other effects of clearcutting, such as loss of roosting sites, must be considered for the conservation of bats.

AB  - This paper analyses the environmental assessment of every proposed mining project that has undergone full review through the Nunavut Impact Review Board from 1999 to 2019, with specific emphasis on how impacts to caribou were identified and assessed. Caribou are the most important terrestrial species in Nunavut from a food security, traditional culture, and harvesting perspective, and mining is known to have impacts on caribou habitat, migration and calving behaviour, predation and hunting patterns, and other effects. Close study of how caribou impacts are discerned and evaluated within environmental assessment (EA) can thus reveal broader trends about both EA and the broader resource governance process. Although some project proposals were initially rejected, every EA ultimately concluded that impacts to caribou were not significant, despite evidence presented to the contrary. We present three modes through which serious impacts are rendered insignificant within EA (mitigation, strategic use of scale, and strategic use of Inuit knowledge and consultation) and comment on the broader context shaping EA in Nunavut. We argue that EA cannot do what it is expected to do (come to rational, science-based decisions that balance ecological, social, and economic goals) and is an insufficient tool for ensuring the long-term well-being of caribou in Nunavut.

AB  - Artificial feeding of wildlife is a widespread, but controversial, management practice with many positive and negative effects. Besides the effects on the target species, it can also affect other (non-target) species by modulating interspecific interactions. Previous research showed that the presence of artificial feeding sites for bears and ungulates increases the risk of kleptoparasitism by the brown bear (Ursus arctos) on kills made by Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). However, it remains unknown whether lynx adjust their behaviour to the distribution of artificial feeding sites, which also attract potential prey (ungulates) for lynx. Using GPS telemetry data, we explored the spatiotemporal lynx response to such sites and studied how this response varied with experience level, i.e. between adult resident individuals ('experienced lynx') and juveniles and/or trans-located individuals ('naYve lynx'). We found that lynx experience played an important role in the use of artificial feeding sites. Specifically, while both experienced and naYve lynx selected feeding sites while moving within their home range, the attraction was stronger among the naYve lynx. Considering the distribution of kill sites, naYve lynx killed prey closer to the artificial feeding sites than expected, while experienced lynx avoided them. Finally, the proximity to artificial feeding sites by experienced lynx showed an annual variation, matching the seasonal kleptoparasitism risk, with overall closer proximity to feeding sites during the winter, when bears are less active, which is also when ungulates are more concentrated around feeding sites. Our study suggests that, despite the relatively recent introduction of artificial feeding in the ecosystems, wildlife can learn to respond to the altered interactions with other species. However, this appears to be a learning process with manifold management and conservation implications. A better under-standing of species interactions and space use in the context of resource manipulation is increasingly relevant as the use of anthropogenic food by wildlife is nowadays substantial and widespread across most parts of the world.

AB  - Understanding the porosity of biochar (BC) that promotes the heavy metal (HM) passivation during composting can contribute to the sustainable management of pig manure (PM). The current work aimed to explore the influence of BC with varying pore sizes on the physicochemical properties and morphological changes of HMs (including Zn, Cu, Cr, As, and Hg), and microbiota development during PM composting. The various pore sizes of BC were generated by pyrolyzing pine wood at 400 (T1), 500 (T2), 600 (T3) and 700 (T4) C, respectively. The results revealed a positive correlation between specific surface area of BC and pyrolysis temperature. BC addition contributed to a significantly extended compost warming rate and duration of high-temperature period, as well as HM passivation, reflected in the decrease in Exc-Zn (63-34%) and Red-Cu (28-13%) content, and the conversion of Oxi-Cr (29-21%) and Red-Hg (16-5%) to more stable forms. Moreover, BC at T4 exhibited the best effect on Zn and Cu passivation due to the highest specific surface area (380.03 m(2)/g). In addition to its impact on HM passivation, BC addition improved the microbial environment during PM composting, leading to enhanced microbial diversity and richness. Notably, Chloroflexi and Bacteroidota played key roles in promoting the transformation of Exc-Cu and Red-Hg into stable forms. This phenomenon further stimulated the enhanced decomposition of organic matter (OM) when BC prepared at 600-700 C-degrees was added. Therefore, it can be concluded that the regulation of BC porosity is an effective strategy to improve HM passivation and the overall effectiveness of PM composting.

AB  - Nitrogen is a crucial element that affects plant metabolic processes and indirectly influences the structure and dynamics of ecological interactions in terrestrial ecosystems. Since the invention of the Haber-Bosch process, human activity has significantly influenced the amount of nitrogen released into the environment. However, how do these overfertilization processes affect flora and fauna in urban ecosystems? In our experiments, we used elevated nitrogen concentrations to simulate terrestrial eutrophication processes in Nicotiana tabacum L. We evaluated reproductive traits such as floral morphology using geometric morphometrics. Additionally, nectar volume and solute concentration, along with other vegetative traits, were quantified. Subsequently, the impacts of these modifications on herbivory and pollination interactions in a peri-urban environment were measured. Overfertilization resulted in notable modifications to the floral shape of the lobes, as well as a significant increase in percentage of herbivory by chewing insects, without affecting floral visitation rates. We also observed that elevated herbivory on fertilised plants did not show a direct correlation with overall pollination rates per plant or seed set. In contrast, the reduction in leaf size during the second phase of the experiment, owing to overfertilization effects, affected seed production. The roles of potential pollinators and their influence on seed quantity in control plants are discussed. Nitrogen is a crucial element not only for plants in natural terrestrial ecosystems but also plays a fundamental role in the modification and shaping of reproductive and vegetative structures. Moreover, it affects the functionality of ecological interactions of pollination and herbivory in anthropogenic environments, such as peri-urban areas.
   El nitr & oacute;geno es un elemento crucial que afecta los procesos metab & oacute;licos de las plantas e influye indirectamente en la estructura y din & aacute;mica de las interacciones ecol & oacute;gicas en los ecosistemas terrestres. Desde la invenci & oacute;n del proceso de Haber-Bosch, la actividad humana ha influenciado significativamente la cantidad de nitr & oacute;geno liberado al medio ambiente. Sin embargo, & iquest;c & oacute;mo podr & iacute;an estos procesos de sobrefertilizaci & oacute;n impactar la flora y fauna dentro de los ecosistemas periurbanos? En el presente experimento, se usaron concentraciones elevadas de nitr & oacute;geno para simular procesos de eutrofizaci & oacute;n terrestre en Nicotiana tabacum L. Se evaluaron rasgos reproductivos como la forma floral empleando morfometr & iacute;a geom & eacute;trica y se cuantific & oacute; el volumen del n & eacute;ctar, la concentraci & oacute;n de solutos, y otros rasgos vegetativos. Posteriormente, se midi & oacute; el impacto de estas modificaciones en las interacciones de herbivor & iacute;a, polinizaci & oacute;n y su rol en la generaci & oacute;n de semillas en un entorno periurbano. La sobrefertilizaci & oacute;n result & oacute; en modificaciones notables en la forma floral de los l & oacute;bulos, adem & aacute;s de provocar un aumento significativo en los porcentajes de herbivor & iacute;a por insectos masticadores, sin afectar las tasas de visitas florales. Observamos tambi & eacute;n que los altos porcentajes herbivor & iacute;a en las plantas fertilizadas no estaban directamente correlacionadas ni con la tasa global de polinizaci & oacute;n por planta ni con la cantidad de semillas generadas. En cambio, la reducci & oacute;n del tama & ntilde;o de las hojas en la segunda fase del experimento, debido a los efectos de la sobrefertilizaci & oacute;n, s & iacute; afect & oacute; la producci & oacute;n de semillas. Adem & aacute;s, se discute el papel de un potencial polinizador y su influencia en la cantidad de semillas en las plantas del grupo control. El nitr & oacute;geno es un elemento esencial no solo para las plantas en los ecosistemas terrestres, sino que tambi & eacute;n juega un papel clave en la modificaci & oacute;n y configuraci & oacute;n de las estructuras reproductivas y vegetativas, adem & aacute;s de influir en la funcionalidad de las interacciones ecol & oacute;gicas en entornos antropog & eacute;nicos como las & aacute;reas periurbanas.
   By applying high concentrations of nitrogen, we simulated a nutrient pollution scenario at a small scale and evaluated how nitrogen affects aboveground processes in peri-urban environments. We found that in peri-urban environments, under the effects of overfertilization, significant changes can occur in floral morphology and vegetative traits (leaves). In the latter case, these changes likely affect interactions with other organisms, as observed in one of the guilds of chewing herbivores. Overall, nutrient pollution processes could indeed have significant effects on species inhabiting peri-urban environments. image

AB  - Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) pose a growing concern for public and wildlife health. Understanding how host traits and environmental factors influence tick infestation in small mammals is critical for improving TBD management strategies. We investigated the presence and load of Dermacentor spp. Larvae on three rodent species: Peromyscus leucopus, Sigmodon hispidus, and Onychomys leucogaster, in the arid brushland ecosystem of South Texas. We used generalized linear models to quantify how host, habitat structure, and climatic variables impact tick presence and load. Our results show that different drivers influenced tick infestation across species; O. leucogaster experienced higher tick loads in smaller individuals and habitats with more leaf litter, whereas for P. leucopus, infestation was determined by the reproductive state and sex of the host as well as larval activity throughout the year. None of the variables measured in this study adequately explained the presence and parasite load in S. hispidus. These findings highlight the importance of considering species-specific interactions between host traits and environmental factors for understanding the dynamics of ticks infestation in rodents. Our results contribute to a growing body of evidence on the complexity of tick-rodent host dynamics and offer insights for predicting changes in parasitism patterns and managing wildlife health in response to a changing environment in South Texas.

AB  - The lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of individuals is affected by random events such as death, realized growth or realized reproduction, and the outcomes of these events can differ even when individuals have identical probabilities. Another source of randomness arises when these probabilities also change over time in variable environments. For structured populations in stochastic environments, we extend our recent method to determine how birth environment and birth stage determine the random distribution of the LRS. Our results provide a null model that quantifies effects on LRS of just the birth size or stage. Using Roe deer Capreolus capreolus as a case study, we show that the effect of an individual's birth environment on LRS varies with the frequency of environments and their temporal autocorrelation, and that lifetime performance is affected by changes in the pattern of environmental states expected as a result of climate change.

AB  - The fruits of some Anacardiaceae tree species are important sources of food and water for vertebrate species in seasonal tropical forest. During a monitoring study using camera-traps in a tropical dry forest of the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, we documented tree visitation and fruit consumption in the 'Chupandillo' Cyrtocarpa procera by medium to large-sized terrestrial mammals species. From 2012 to 2017, we established cameras-traps in front of six adult chupandillo trees during 385-499 days. A total of 4,831 photographs were obtained during a total of 2,706 days. The camera-traps recorded 12 mammals species visiting, passing in front the tree, or consuming its fruits. The white-tailed deer, cotton rabbit, collared peccary and gray fox were the species that presented the highest number of visit events, with the two ungulate species recorded visiting all of the sampled trees. These species, as well as coati, consumed fruits of this tree species from September to October. The white-tailed deer visited during the day, while the collared peccary mainly visited during the twilight-night time period. We propose that fruits of C. procera are an important resource for mammals in this region, in particular for white-tailed deer and collared peccary.

AB  - Antibiotics can be released into agricultural soils through animal manure used as fertilizers, thus affecting the soil environment, and consequently crop production. This study investigated the impacts of antibiotics on the growth and nutrient uptake of wheat. The aims were to highlight the importance of assessing the potential ecological risk of using pig manure containing antibiotics on agricultural production and provide a guide for the rational use of manure as an organic fertilizer to improve crop productivity. A pot experiment was conducted to grow wheat in pig manure-amended soil with different phosphorus (P) and oxytetracycline (OTC) rates. Plant growth, P nutrition, and root traits such as secretion of phosphatases and carboxylates were determined and compared. The results showed that the effect of OTC on shoot growth was always inhibitive, but that on root growth showed a two-phase pattern, being stimulative at low OTC dose and inhibitive at high OTC dose. Shoot and root P concentrations significantly increased when OTC was 50 mg kg(-1). The highest OTC rate caused a marked decrease in P-uptake efficiency at all P rates, and in P-utilization efficiency at the highest P rate. Adding OTC reduced the amount of tartrate, the only carboxylate detected in the rhizosheath, and might result in less P mobilized for plant uptake. OTC can abate the promoting effect of P-fertilizers on wheat growth and had a dose-dependent effect on wheat growth and P uptake. Therefore, antibiotic residues in pig manure should be considered when pig manure is applied to soil as fertilizer.

AB  - Many caribou populations are declining across the Circumpolar North, presenting challenges for many Indigenous Peoples who have deep and enduring relationships with this animal. In Labrador, Canada, caribou herds have recently experienced population declines, including the George River herd, which has dropped by 99% from its peak, leading to the enactment of a total hunting ban in 2013 issued by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador. The decline and subsequent hunting ban have affected various aspects of Inuit well-being. Using Inuit-led multi-media methods, this project heard voices of Inuit across the Nunatsiavut and NunatuKavut regions in Labrador, Canada, which (1) described the importance of caribou for Inuit social connections, (2) explored the ways in which the changes in caribou populations and management strategies are influencing these social connections, and (3) discussed the meaning and value of these social connections for Inuit well-being and the sustainability of Inuit-caribou relationships into the future. Data from video interviews (Nunatsiavut region: n = 54; NunatuKavut region: n = 30) were collected and analyzed using video and photography-based methods. Results characterized how caribou are important social connectors: human-caribou relationships are core to Inuit socialization, inter-connection, and shared experience and memory regarding families, communities, and food and knowledge sharing across Labrador's landscape. Thus, declines in caribou populations and associated social interaction have had serious implications for Inuit identity, livelihoods, emotional well-being, cultural continuity, and knowledge transfer. In order to support the broader social-ecological system and the well-being of those who are connected to caribou, increased understanding and integration of these social connections into caribou-related decision making and research is recommended.

AB  - Ticks are blood-feeding obligate ectoparasites that belong to order Arachnida with three main families (Ixodidae, Argasidae, and Nuttalleillidae). Ticks transmit viral, bacterial, and zoonotic diseases in humans, and animals (wild and domestic). Ticks directly and indirectly affect the livestock industry which plays an important role in the rural economy of Pakistan. These are the main source of income and a source of food for poor people. The current study was conducted to identify the tick species infesting livestock in Dera Ismail Khan Pakistan. For this purpose, different farms were randomly visited and 130 ticks were collected from 200 scanned animals. The collected ticks were identified to species level using morphological keys. In the current study, four tick species were identified as Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Hyalomma marginatum, Hyalomma anatolicum, and Dermacentor marginatus were identified. The most dominant species were Hy. anatolicum (35.39%) followed by R. sanguineus (30.00%), Hy. marginatum (23.85%) and D. marginatus (10.77%). Hy. anatolicum was the predominant tick species and accounted for 35.39% of the ticks. Tick infestation was highest in buffaloes followed by cows, sheep, and goats. Tail and ear were the most preferable sites for tick infestation than other body parts.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the change in microbiome composition of wild Sichuan takin (Budorcas tibetanus) during winter and spring and analyzed the physiological implications for such changes. Diversity analyses of the microbiome (average 15,091 high-quality reads per sample) in 24 fecal samples (15 from winter, 9 from spring) revealed that spring samples had higher species diversity and were compositionally different from winter samples (P < 0.05). Taxonomic composition analysis showed that the relative abundance increased in spring for Patescibacteria (2.7% vs. 0.9% in winter, P < 0.001) and Tenericutes (1.9% vs. 1% in winter, P < 0.05). Substantial increases in relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Micrococcaceae were identified in spring and winter, respectively. Mann-Whitney U and ANCOM identified seven differentially abundant genera: Enterococcus, Acetitomaculum, Blautia, Coprococcus 1, Lachnospiraceae UCG 008, Ruminococcus 2 and Ralstonia. All seven genera were significantly more abundant in spring (average 0.016-1.2%) than winter (average 0-0.16%), with the largest difference found in Ruminococcus (1.21% in spring vs. 0.16% in winter). The other six genera were undetectable in winter. Functional prediction and pathway analysis revealed that biosynthesis of cofactors (ko01240) had the highest gene count ratios in the winter, followed by the two-component system (ko02020). Seasonal variation affects the gut microbiomes in wild Sichuan takins, with winter associated with lower species diversity and spring with enrichment of cellulose-degrading genera and phytopathogens. Such changes were crucial in their adaptation to the environment, particularly the difference in food abundance.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Tooth damage in carnivores can reflect shifts in both diet and feeding habits, and in large carnivores, it is associated with increased bone consumption. Variation in tooth condition in Icelandic arctic foxes, a mesocarnivore, was recorded from 854 individual foxes spanning 29 years. We hypothesized that annual climatic variations, which can influence food abundance and accessibility, will influence tooth condition by causing dietary shifts toward less edible prey. We examined tooth condition in relation to four climatic predictors: mean annual winter temperature, indices of both the El Nino anomaly and North Atlantic subpolar gyre (SPG), and the number of rain-on-snow days (ROS). We found unequivocal evidence for a strong effect of annual climate on tooth condition. Teeth of Icelandic foxes were in better condition when winter temperatures were higher, when the SPG was more positive, and when the number of ROS was low. We also found a substantial subregional effect with foxes from northeastern Iceland having lower tooth damage than those from two western sites. Contradicting our original hypothesis that foxes from northeastern Iceland, where foxes are known to scavenge on large mammal remains (e.g., sheep and horses), would show the highest tooth damage, we suggest that western coastal sites exhibited greater tooth damage because cold winter temperatures lowered the availability of seabirds, causing a shift in diet toward abrasive marine subsidies (e.g., bivalves) and frozen beach wrack. Our study shows that monitoring tooth breakage and wear can be a useful tool for evaluating the impact of climate on carnivore populations and that climate change may influence the condition and fitness of carnivores in complex and potentially conflicting ways.

AB  - Delineating priority areas for highly mobile marine megafauna represents a major challenge for conservation biology. To manage such areas, one must understand both their spatial properties (i.e., location, number, extent), and the level of exposure to a number of given pressures. Here, we used a combination of ensemble distribution models, field-based validation methods and a cumulative effect assessment to illustrate key foraging sites and risk hotspots for adult loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta, in the Mediterranean Sea. We found that foraging sites covered about 10% of the neritic zone of the Mediterranean basin. We identified sites which are well recognized by scientists, but also other areas for which our knowledge on the potential importance is limited. The patterns of the habitat use generated by field data validated the accuracy of the distribution model. About one fifth of the foraging areas hosted in the Mediterranean could be considered as hotspots of risk, characterized by high or very high exposure to cumulative pressures. Our results suggest that management and conservation efforts should continue to be held at key, well-known foraging grounds of adult sea turtles (e.g., Northern Adriatic Sea, Tunisian Plateau) but there are several more potential sites (e.g., parts of the Aegean Sea and the Western Mediterranean) which deserve our attention in order to ensure viable populations.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed the C, N, and P contents and stoichiometric characteristics of forage leaves of five species (Elymus breviaristatus cv. Tongde, Poa crymophila cv. Qinghai, Puccinellia tenuiflora cv. Qinghai, Festuca sinensis cv. Qinghai, and Poa pratensis cv. Qinghai) in "fertilizer-reconstructed soil" through integrative soil amendment with parched sheep manure and granular organic fertilizer in an alpine mining area. A model is fitted in order to screen out the best forage species suitable for vegetation restoration in the alpine mining area and the most favorable fertilizer dosage to improve the nutrient content of forage leaves. The results showed that (1) increasing the dosages of granular organic fertilizer and sheep manure had little effect on the C content of the five types of forage grasses, but they could significantly increase the N and P contents and N/P of the manually restored grassland in the alpine mining area (p < 0.05). (2) The productivity and stability of the five species were ranked as follows: Elymus breviaristatus cv. Tongde > Puccinellia tenuiflora cv. Qinghai > Festuca sinensis cv. Qinghai > Poa pratensis cv. Qinghai > Poa crymophila cv. Qinghai. (3) According to the fitted least squares model and the willingness to maximize the C, N, and P contents of the leaves, the ranking of the five forage grasses was described by the Prediction Profiler as follows: Elymus breviaristatus cv. Tongde > Puccinellia tenuiflora cv. Qinghai > Festuca sinensis cv. Qinghai > Poa crymophila cv. Qinghai > Poa pratensis cv. Qinghai. (4) The predictive model suggested that the optimal contents of C, N, and P in Elymus breviaristatus cv. Tongde, Festuca sinensis cv. Qinghai, and Poa pratensis cv. Qinghai leaves could be achieved with the application of 3.6 kg/m(2) of granular organic fertilizer and 45.0 kg/m(2)of sheep manure. For Poa crymophila cv. Qinghai leaves, the ideal content was attained by applying 0 kg/m(2) of granular organic fertilizer and 45.0 kg/m(2) of sheep manure. Lastly, the optimal C, N, and P contents in Puccinellia tenuiflora cv. Qinghai leaves could be obtained through the application of 3.6 kg/m(2) of granular organic fertilizer combined with 0 kg/m(2) of sheep manure. In conclusion, the study's results highlight the significant practical value of the fertilizer-reconstructed soil for vegetation restoration in alpine mining regions.

AB  - Risk assessment of microplastics (MPs) contamination in the assemblage of 15 important fish species with different feeding habits and microhabitats was studied in the River Ravi, Pakistan. Fishes with different feeding habits (omnivore, herbivore, and carnivore) and microhabitat preferences (surface, column, and bottom dweller) were sampled at Balloki and Sidhnai barrages during the post-monsoon seasons of 2019-2020. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of fish samples were found to be contaminated with MPs, with an average of 28.1 & PLUSMN; 20.7 MPs/individual and 26.8 & PLUSMN; 15.9 MPs/individual at Balloki and Sidhnai barrages, respectively. The surface dweller fish exhibited the highest MPs abundance, followed by the bottom dweller and column dweller. In addition, the highest MPs recovered from the omnivore generalist feeding group as compared to herbivores and carnivores. The fibers were the most abundant shape and generally made up of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene (PE). These PET and PE (low-density MPs) exhibit low hazard level, whereas high-density MPs with high hazard level and rarely present in GIT of sampled fishes. Based on MP polymer toxicity assessment, nine fish species were categorized in minor risk, two species in medium risk, and four species in highrisk group. Bottom dwelling fishes were at the highest plastic polymer risk level III due to the presence of a high density of MPs with high toxicity hazards. The high-risk prone fishes are under direct threat from MPs pollution, which may disrupt the ecological integrity of the river ecosystem and human health. The findings of the current study highlight the urgent need to address plastic pollution issues in River Ravi, and will be helpful for managers, researchers, and fisheries experts to mitigate this emerging challenge.speciesspecies

TI  - IMPORTANCE OF HERBIVORY TO THE SURVIVAL AND GROWTH OF PHASEOLUS TEXENSIS (BOERNE BEAN, FABACEAE = LEGUMINOSAE) A RARE SPECIES
T2  - SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST
LA  - English
AB  - Boerne bean Phaseolus texensis (Fabaceae = Leguminosae) is a rare perennial understory plant with limited distribution in central Texas woodlands. We examined the importance of large animal herbivory on its survival and growth. Plants were protected or not protected (caged and not caged) from large animal herbivory. Survival of protected plants was 100% at the end of the growing season, while survival for nonprotected plants was 40%. Mean aboveground dry mass of protected plants was 0.228 +/- 0.074 g (mean +/- SE) and reduced by 88% to 0.028 +/- 0.016 g for partially eaten nonprotected plants. Stem length for protected plants was 25.42 +/- 2.38 cm and 4.29 +/- 1.77 cm for nonprotected plants. The number of leaves on the protected plants was 3.74 +/- 0.16 at the beginning of the study and declined to 2.08 +/- 0.63 in the fall at the end of the study. For nonprotected plants, they started at 3.41 +/- 0.16 leaves/plant and ended with 0.92 +/- 0.54. Herbivory began the second week after the plants were placed in the field, with aboveground parts of three nonprotected plants eaten. Herbivores consumed almost all of the aboveground dry mass of nonprotected plants by the end of the third week of the study. Four plants survived and produced new tissue. Regrowth of nonprotected plants was 12% of the dry mass of the protected plants. High density of large herbivores (white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus) seemed to be the cause of the loss of Boerne bean plants. Small herbivores had access to protected and nonprotected plants, but did not consume any of the protected plants.

AB  - Scientific understanding of ecological role of alkaline phosphomonoesterase (phoD)-harboring bacteria in phosphorus availability is lacking during composting. To explore ecological functions of phoD-harboring bacteria and differences in compost properties among four animal (i.e., pig, chicken, cow, and sheep) manure groups, we conducted small-scale composting and applied Illumina MiSeq sequencing and multiple statistical analyses. Results displayed notably shifts in compost abiotic and biotic properties, and phoD-harboring bacteria in the pig manure group showed larger compositional differences, weaker community replacement, more complex coex-istence patterns, and stronger environmental constraints than other manure groups. The temperature-affected phoD-harboring bacterial community directly and indirectly shapes compost phosphorus availability, and available phosphorus in the final compost was notably higher in pig manure (1.04 g kg -1) group than other groups (0.61-0.78 g kg -1). Our findings highlight important ecological roles of phoD-harboring bacteria in phosphorus availability during winter composting, and disentangle that pig manure is superior to other manures for composting. These findings might guide small-scale manure composting, and the final compost can serve as biological phosphorus fertilizer.

AB  - Drastic seasonal changes in higher latitudes and altitudes impact the phenology of plant growth forms differently and thus diet of ungulates feeding on them. We examined how fecal nitrogen (N), an indicator of diet quality, varied with season against the background variation in forage biomass and N in habitats of two sympatric ungulates in subtropical Himalaya. We conducted this study in Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary, Sikkim, where the Himalayan goral Naemorhedus goral occurred from 3000 to 3600 m and Himalayan musk deer Moschus chrysogaster from 3300 to 4200 m. We measured biomass and N content of forbs and graminoids and browse in their habitats and proportions of monocots and dicots and N content in their fecal pellets. Seasonal variation in biomass, primarily determined by forbs, was similar in goral and musk deer habitats. Goral had a graminoid-dominated diet switching to dicots in autumn and winter. Musk deer had a dicot-dominated diet in all seasons. Fecal N in both the ungulates was higher than forage N in all seasons except spring when the latter was greater. Forage and fecal N declined sharply from spring as seasons progressed. Fecal N in goral was considerably lower than in musk deer in all seasons, probably below maintenance levels in autumn and winter. As evident from peaks and duration of high diet quality, goral is likely a capital breeder and musk deer an income breeder. Results suggest that linkages between diet and reproductive seasonality in ungulates will have important implications in face of climate change.

AB  - Intraspecific competition for food may affect the development, survival, and fecundity of organisms. However, environmental variation in abiotic conditions can influence resource quality and/or quantity, thereby modifying the strength of intraspecific competition.
   This study focuses on intraspecific competition among Tanytarsus gracilentus (Chironomidae: Diptera) larvae. In Lake Myvatn, Iceland, T. gracilentus undergoes large population fluctuations, and evidence suggests that these fluctuations are governed by consumer-resource interactions between the larvae and benthic diatoms. In two experiments, we studied (i) the effects of larval density on individual development and survival, and (ii) how light and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) mediate the strength of intraspecific competition across a density gradient.
   Survival declined with increasing larval density in both experiments, although not significantly in the first experiment in which we manipulated only density. In the second experiment, enhancement of either light or phosphorus mitigated the negative effect of larval density on survival. In both experiments, density had a negative effect on individual development. In the first experiment, fewer larvae progressed to the final fourth instar at higher densities. In the second experiment, larvae were smaller in high density treatments, and this effect was most pronounced in the treatments without light or phosphorus supplementation.
   These results highlight the potential for environmental factors to influence the strength of density-dependent competition. Environmental variation that affects resource quantity or quality may influence the overall dynamics of our study organism and other populations whose dynamics are controlled by consumer-resource relationships.

AB  - Although habitat fragmentation is widely reported to affect species survival and distribution, its effect in terms of host-parasite interactions in small mammal communities is poorly studied yet. Using information collected from carcasses of 34 road-kill and two preyed-upon individuals, we present the first comprehensive study dealing with the relationship between habitat fragmentation and the presence of different ectoparasite species infecting a small Sciurus vulgaris population inhabiting the Apennine ridge. We predicted that the probability to find individuals infested by parasites would be lower in highly fragmented areas because of the trade-off effects over both mammal and ectoparasite communities. Our findings showed that the most frequent ectoparasites were the squirrel fleas Ceratophyllus sciurorum and hard ticks Ixodes ricinus. Males showed higher presence of ectoparasites than females, probably because of different behaviour in space use and higher hormone levels, which may compromise host's resistance to infection. As to the relationship with habitat fragmentation, we did not find support that individuals in highly fragmented areas would be less susceptible to C. sciurorum infestation because of lower red squirrel relative density. The presence of highly suitable habitat patches in fragmented habitats may have favoured the presence of squirrels, hence promoting C. sciurorum transmission among specimens. Similarly, we did not find support that habitat fragmentation would have reduced the likelihood of generalist ectoparasites transmission among squirrels. This finding may be explained by the increasing tolerance of generalist ectoparasites towards habitat fragmentation because of the presence of species (e.g., roe deer Capreolus capreolus) able to better exploit ecotonal areas. We believe that our research provides interesting preliminary results on ectoparasites infesting red squirrels in the Apennine area, and of the potential impact which habitat fragmentation may have on them. Nevertheless, the effect of habitat fragmentation over parasite communities is still poorly considered, and further researches are needed.

AB  - The environmental conditions experienced by hunter-gatherers during the second part of the Upper Palaeolithic (ca. 28 000-15 000 cal bp) are poorly known in the mid-elevation volcanic mountains of the Massif Central in southern France. The stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen (C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14 expressed as delta C-13 and delta N-15 values) in bone collagen of large herbivores can track their diet and habitat, reflecting local abiotic conditions (temperature, aridity, altitude). Due to poor preservation of skeletal organic matter in the region, new radiocarbon dating was conducted on a limited number of quality-controlled collagen samples, based on a minimum carbon content of 30%. They document three main phases of occupation corresponding to the Final Gravettian, the Badegoulian and the Magdalenian, each of which is represented in different regions of the Allier and Loire valleys. Over time, a decrease in horse delta N-15 values, the best documented species of large herbivores, is found between the Final Gravettian (ca. 26 700-25 600 cal bp), around the Last Glacial Maximum and the Badegoulian (ca. 21 900-19 200 cal bp), followed by an increase in delta N-15 and delta C-13 values during the Magdalenian (ca. 19 100-16 600 cal bp). During the Badegoulian, the delta N-15 values of the horses were lower than those of their counterparts in southwestern France, testifying to harsh climatic conditions favourable to a tundra-like landscape, also reflected in the higher horse and reindeer delta C-13 values in the Allier valley compared to those in southwestern France. The relatively high delta C-13 and low delta N-15 values of a Final Gravettian wolf from the Allier valley suggests reindeer as a preferred prey, in line with their high abundance in the archaeological sites. Game access, rather than climatic conditions or lithic resources, seems to have motivated human groups to occupy the Massif Central during the Upper Palaeolithic.

AB  - Unsustainable grazing practices result in degradation of arid and semiarid rangelands in southern Africa. Continuous grazing systems are often blamed for degradation, while rotational grazing systems are seen as more sustainable. The discussion about the impact of these grazing practices also has political and societal dimensions: continuous grazing is often related to communal farming while independent farmers are often economically able to subdivide large camps to rotate livestock and rest the rangeland. We evaluated 17 studies from southern Africa that compared the impact of continuous vs. rotational grazing on vegetation and found the outcomes to be contradictory and inconclusive. We identified several issues regarding the comparability of these grazing systems (such as differences in stocking densities, in herbivore composition and in spatial scale of data collection), making comparisons of the impacts of the two grazing systems ambiguous. Based on the evaluation of these studies, we list factors affecting the outcome of comparative rangeland studies that need to be considered when comparing rangeland management types. We conclude that only if comparative studies are designed to ensure result comparability, then the two management systems can be properly compared, thereby forming a basis for further research on sustainable grazing systems.

AB  - Fluorine (F) and its compounds produced from industrial production and coal combustion can cause air, water and soil contamination, which can accumulate in animals, plants and humans via food chain threatening public health. Fluoride exposure affects liver, kidney, gastrointestinal and reproductive system in humans and animals. Literature regarding fluoride influence on intestinal structure and microbiota composition in ducks is scarce. This study was designed to investigate these effects by using simple and electron microscopy and 16S rRNA sequencing techniques. Results indicated an impaired structure with reduced relative distribution of goblet cells in the fluoride exposed group. Moreover, the gut microbiota showed a significant decrease in alpha diversity. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla in both control and fluoride-exposed groups. Specifically, fluoride exposure resulted in a significant decrease in the relative abundance of 9 bacterial phyla and 15 bacterial genera. Among them, 4 phyla (Latescibacteria, Dependentiae, Zixibacteria and Fibrobacteres) and 4 genera (Thauera, Hydrogenophaga, Reyranella and Arenimonas) weren't even detectable in the gut microbiota of the ducks. In summary, higher fluoride exposure can significantly damage the intestinal structure and gut microbial composition in ducks. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leaf-cutting ants of the genus Atta are widely distributed throughout the American tropics and subtropics and rival other herbivores in the consumption of surrounding foliage. Although numerous studies have been conducted on the role these insects play in herbivory and organic matter dynamics, only a handful of studies have examined their impacts on soil greenhouse gas emissions. Our study investigated fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from three nests of Atta cephalotes using a portable greenhouse gas analyzer, and measured CO2 and CH4 emissions from soils containing nest holes that ranged 5.2-152.1 g CO2-C and -1.1 to 15,264.7 mg CH4-C m-2 day-1, respectively. Fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were positively correlated above nest holes, but not in patches of soil away from leaf-cutting ant nests. Nearby non-nest soil emissions were significantly lower, ranging from 0.6 to 6.0 g CO2-C and -1.3 to 0.77 mg CH4-C m-2 day-1. Fluxes of both gases among nests and among holes within a single nest were highly variable. This preliminary dataset is small in scale both temporarily and geographically, but the discovery of substantial greenhouse gas fluxes from Atta cephalotes nests may have important implications for carbon budgets of tropical and subtropical American forests. Further work will be necessary to determine the mechanisms behind enhanced greenhouse gas emissions from leaf-cutting ant nests, and how this may alter ecosystem-scale CO2 emissions and CH4 sink strength in tropical forest soils.

AB  - The relative effect of demographic history and selection on the number and length of runs of homozygosity (ROH) has been poorly studied in wild populations. A recent study that combined evolutionary simulations with empirical data for red deer (Cervus elaphus) found that population history has a stronger effect than selection on the distribution of ROH. Here, we investigate the relative influence of demographic history and selection on the number and length of ROH using wild red deer populations with varying demographic histories and selection scenarios related to male-male competition for mates. We genotyped 167 individuals with > 38,000 genome-wide autosomal SNPs and compared ROH features between red deer under different combinations of demographic histories and selection scenarios. We found that red deer with lower historic effective population size (N-e) had higher number and length of ROH than the red deer with higher historic N-e. In contrast, red deer under strong selection pressure (high male mating competition) did not exhibit different ROH features compared to those under weaker selection pressure (low male mating competition). Additionally, we did not find clear evidence that genome regions with ROH were affected by selection. Therefore, our results support the conclusion that, under the study conditions in our red deer populations, demographic history plays a more significant role than selection in shaping ROH patterns.

AB  - Wildlife translocation is increasingly utilized as a conservation management action, to mitigate the immediate negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation (e.g. from land clearing or bushfires). Previous research has shown that stress responses can help or hinder survival in translocated wildlife and determine the efficacy of translocation as a conservation action. Yet these translocated animals are only one side of the equation, with translocation also potentially impacting the animals in the recipient population. We measured physiological markers of stress (faecal cortisol metabolite concentrations and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios) and assessed health condition in a wild koala population one year after a major translocation of bushfire-rescued koalas on Kangaroo Island. We expected to find a high population density at the site (>0.75 koalas per hectare) and that resident koalas would show signs of chronic stress and ill health as a result of territorial conflict over food trees and reproductive opportunities. In contrast, we found that only one-fifth of the population remaining at the site were translocated koalas. The overall population density was also much lower (0.21 koalas per hectare) than anticipated. With no evidence of mass mortality at the site, we suggest that the majority of translocated koalas dispersed away from the site. Our stress marker measurements did not differ between the wild koalas and a sample of captive (non-display) koalas at the nearby Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park and were generally low compared to other studies. Veterinary examinations found that most koalas were in good body condition with very few diagnostic indicators of systemic ill health. Overall, our results suggest that, if there is adequate landscape-scale habitat connectivity and opportunity for dispersal, translocated koalas are likely to disperse from the site of release, with limited impacts on recipient koala populations at translocation release sites.

AB  - Many animals track ephemeral peaks in food abundance and quality that propagate across landscapes. Migrating ungulates, in particular, track waves of newly emerging plants from low-elevation winter ranges to high-elevation summer ranges-known as "green-wave surfing." Because plants lose crude protein and gain insoluble fiber with maturation, ruminants are expected to exploit peaks in forage quality among individual plants (i.e., Forage Maturation Hypothesis). Although ample evidence supports the long-standing hypothesis that migratory ungulates surf peaks in forage quality during migration, the hypothesis that ungulates track peaks in forage quality at a small scale (i.e., microsurf while on summer range) remains less known. We studied a partially migratory population of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in Wyoming, USA, to understand whether temperate ungulates optimize the use of high-quality forage as plants grow and senesce on disparate summer ranges. Specifically, we evaluated how crude protein, digestible energy, and relative abundance changed throughout the growing season and whether deer altered their diet to reflect species-specific changes in plant phenology. In support of the Forage Maturation Hypothesis, forage quality declined as large-scale patterns of phenology progressed away from a remotely sensed metric of peak green-up for most plant species on the summer ranges of deer that migrated short (<50 km), medium (50-130 km), and long distances (>130 km). Declining rates in forage quality among plant species were heterogeneous, providing deer with the phenological diversity required to microsurf. Deer changed their diet throughout the growing season and prioritized the consumption of some plants, including Rosa woodsii and Purshia tridentata, as the rank of forage quality increased (p < 0.01). In light of the complexities common to studies on foraging behavior, our findings suggest that deer may have some potential to microsurf on summer range when heterogeneity in resource phenology is prevalent. Moreover, our findings validate the accuracy of remote sensing in quantifying peak forage quality for plants within sagebrush shrublands and montane habitats.

AB  - In phytopathogenic fungi, the HOG MAPK pathway has roles in osmoregulation, fungicide sensitivity, and other processes. The ATF1/CREB-activating transcription factor Atf1 is a regulator that functions downstream of the HOG MAPK pathway. Here, we identified a gene, designated CsAtf1, that encodes a bZIP transcription factor in Colletotrichum siamense, which is the main pathogen that causes Colletotrichum leaf fall disease in rubber trees in China. CsAtf1 localizes to the nucleus. Its mRNA expression correlates positively with that of CsPbs2 and CsHog1 in the HOG MAPK pathway in response to activator (anisomycin), inhibitor (SB203580) and fludioxonil treatments. The CsAtf1 deletion mutant showed slightly retarded mycelial growth, small conidia, slow spore germination, and abnormal appressorium formation. This mutant showed the increased spore germination rate after fludioxonil treatment and more resistance to the fungicide fludioxonil than did the wild-type fungus. However, unlike deletion of Pbs2 or Hog1, which resulted in greater sensitivity to osmotic stress, the CsAtf1 deletion induced slightly increased resistance to osmotic stress and the cell wall stress response. The Delta CsAtf1 strain also exhibited significantly reduced virulence on rubber tree leaves. These data revealed that CsAtf1 plays a key role in the regulation of fludioxonil sensitivity and in pathogenicity regulation in C. siamense.

AB  - Ecological studies and restoration efforts in deep-sea environments are a priority for international programs aimed at preserving biodiversity and recovering ocean health. These efforts, however, face technical challenges, particularly in the controlled placement of megafauna individuals near the seabed. Traditional methods, such as diving with autonomous breathing equipment, are generally impractical for large-scale restoration beyond 50 m depth, while releasing organisms at the sea surface leads to high dispersion rates, reducing their chances of reaching the intended location. To address these challenges, we have developed and tested releaser devices equipped with enclosed compartments that mechanically open at a specified distance from the seabed, allowing for precise organism release. We designed and deployed various versions of these devices, each suited for different field applications, including active restoration actions and ecological studies requiring the safe deployment of individuals near the seabed. Technical descriptions of these devices are provided for replication and further adaptation. The devices demonstrated their effectiveness in active restoration efforts, particularly in the mass release of cold-water corals. Additionally, they facilitated ecological studies involving the acoustic tagging of megafauna, allowing for improved monitoring of their daily and spatial behavior. The proposed animal release devices offer a practical solution for deep-sea restoration and research, ensuring precise organism deployment at designated depths. Their design enhances efficiency in both marine conservation and scientific investigations.

AB  - Research Highlight discussing: Heinen, J.; Dominguez, V.; Aguilera, G.; Malsher, G.; Vesterinen, E.; Roslin, T.; Bommarco, R.; Bartomeus, I. (2024). Diversified cropping strengthens herbivore regulation by providing seasonal resource continuity to predators. Journal of Applied Ecology, . Crop monocultures consist of homogenous agroecosystems highly dependent on pesticides for pest regulation and mineral fertilisation for maintaining plant nutrition, representing the least resilient system. Agricultural diversification practices can increase heterogeneity in agroecosystems, resulting in greater richness of arthropod predators and enhanced ecological services. Among natural enemies of pests, generalist predators are important for pest regulation as they prey on diverse arthropod pests and be present throughout the season. However, since they consume other predators (intraguild predation) and soil fauna, it is uncertain whether enhanced richness of generalist predators translates into improved pest regulation. The study by Heinen et al. examined how diversified crop rotation and organic fertilisation influenced predator-prey interactions throughout the cropping cycle in cereal fields. The predators' diet preference shifted over the growing season, indicating that soil fauna is an important resource for recruitment and maintenance of predators early in the season. Although intraguild predation was considerably high, it decreased across the season in fields with the greatest level of diversification, where predation of pests remained stable. This study demonstrated how diversified cropping is important for providing resource continuity with alternative prey (soil fauna and predators) over crop-growing season, enhancing predator richness and herbivore regulation.

   The article by Heinen et al. is an important contribution to our understanding of how agricultural diversification can enhance pest regulation by examining predator-prey interactions. Crop rotations and organic fertilisation enhance the richness of predatory beetles and provide resource continuity with alterative prey, such as soil fauna and other predators, to maintain their ecological service of pest regulation.image

AB  - The anthropogenic movement of species has favoured the introduction of invasive plants worldwide. Invasive plants are frequently released from their natural enemies; however, new associations with generalist herbivores may induce defence mechanisms of non-native plants. Defensive traits are often directly related to the highly competitive ability, but also to potential antagonisms and mutualisms that they can establish with soil microorganisms. Here, we examined whether the intraspecific competition and soil microorganisms influence the morphological and physiological traits of Carpobrotus edulis when is being attacked by the native generalist snail Theba pisana. To achieve this, we grew two C. edulis individuals in separate and same pots filled with live or sterile sand, and with or without T. pisana. Our results indicated that herbivory induced an increase of shoot biomass in attacked C. edulis individuals (i.e., treated donor plants), as well as in un-attacked neighbouring individuals co-growing in the same pot (i.e., untreated recipient plants). Nevertheless, intraspecific competition nor soil microorganisms did not affect the growth of C. edulis despite reduced physiological activity and damage caused by the herbivore. Overall, our findings revealed that C. edulis individuals tolerate snail attack by inducing a compensatory growth response. We conclude that phenotypic plasticity of invasive C. edulis favours tolerance against herbivores, but we also suggest that plant-plant interactions probably determine the plant growth of un-attacked neighbouring C. edulis individuals, thus favouring their invasion mechanisms.

AB  - Semiarid rangeland plays an important multifunctional agricultural system and plant nutritive value can vary according to soil and climate conditions, and land use such as grazing pressure. This study investigated the impact of four forage allowances (2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5 kg dry matter per kg body weight) on condensed tannin biological activity and nutritional value of Bauhinia cheilantha (Bong) Steud.). The experiment was conducted in a manipulated shrub-tree tropical rangeland under sheep grazing in a two-year field trial, during the rainy season. Forage allowance and time influenced condensed tannin biological activity and nutritional value. B. cheilantha with up to 167 g kg(-1) condensed tannins inhibited up to 38.3% rumen methane, indicating possible sheep metabolizable energy intake increases and also reduced up to 29% larval motility, which may reduce gastrointestinal parasite infections. B. cheilantha nutritional values vary over years and have a negative relationship with forage allowance. Forage allowance can be manipulated depending on management goals as forage or environmental mitigation. Low forage allowance promotes great condensed tannins which impacts on great larval motility and less methane production, but great nutritive value. The findings suggest that the legume B. cheilantha can contribute to meeting the nutritional requirements of ruminants.

AB  - Despite the diverse and wide-ranging forage availability in abundance in grassland habitat systems, wild ungulates perform selective grazing under their natural foraging conditions as an adaptation to the variation in palatability and availability of forage grasses in different seasons in a given area by retaining the less palatable species as the dry season diet. The study elucidated how the domestic livestock exerts overgrazing pressures on the grass community, removing all the grass stand before the arrival of dry season and restricting forage availability for blackbucks Antilope cervicapra in Basur Amruth Mahal Kaval Conservation Reserve, Karnataka. Direct observations on the feeding behaviours of herbivores were done and opportunistic sampling for the collection and identification of grasses at the same time, covering all different microhabitat characteristic locations of the grassland in all seasons. 29 grass species were identified with different palatability grades and variations in their seasonal availability as forage. Dichanthium annulatum (Forssk.) Stapf and Sehima nervosum (Rottler) Stapf with the highest palatability grade, are spatially declining with the increase of less palatable grasses in the Kaval i.e. Heteropogon contortus (L.) P.Beauv. ex Roem. & Schult. and Chrysopogon fulvus (Spreng.) Chiov under overgrazing pressures. A limitation of three to four months shortage of forage grass availability was created under overgrazing pressures by domestic livestock when compared to selective grazing expectations by blackbucks throughout the year. The forage grasses were grazed to empty by domestic livestock before the arrival of dry seasons. In prolonged overgrazing effects, a competitive replacement of palatable grasses by unpalatable or less palatable species can be expected in these grasslands. Competitive exclusion of blackbucks by the domestic herbivores was modelled using Lotka-Volterra equations. The model revealed that the populations of wild boar and domestic herbivores tend to increase up to their carrying capacities K2 with time ti and attain stable populations, but the blackbuck populations tend to extinction with continuous exposure to competition due to their shy nature. The grass composition can be expected to recover with palatable grasses only if external grazing forces are controlled or avoided.

AB  - Rice-fish co-culture, combining rice cultivation with managed fish populations, has been conducted in southeast Asia for more than 2000 years. This is both an extensive and integrated management system that has significant potential to enhance yield by promoting a range of ecosystem services benefiting soil health and natural pest control in the rice growing period. However, very little is known about the role of earthworms in this process once the crop has been harvested. Here, we conducted a field experiment over two years (2019 and 2021) comparing rice-fish co-culture vs. rice-monoculture (fish free) systems in eastern China. We evaluated rice yield, earthworm populations (supporting nutrient cycling and soil structure), soil quality (including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and organic matter), pest abundance and populations of arthropod predators. Results showed that rice-fish co-culture increased earthworm and predator populations, while also improving soil quality and decreasing insect pests. This led to increased yield. We showed that the spill-over effects of earthworms from surrounding paddy field ridges into rice paddy fields benefited soil quality acting to increase rice productivity, but that this acted in combination with other processes such as the activity of fish and increased natural pest control. Our study suggests that rice-fish co-culture farming practices support multiple ecosystem services through improved soil quality, earthworm abundance, arthropod predator natural pest control and rice productivity.

AB  - Context. Little is known about wildlife harvesting by licensed recreational hunters in Australia, where both native and introduced species are hunted. It is important to understand harvest trends to assess sustainability for native species and implications for population control of introduced species. Aim. The aim of this study was to analyse trends in hunter participation, activity and efficiency, and wildlife harvest, including effects of climate, in Victoria, Australia, for three game species groups: introduced deer, native waterfowl (ducks) and one native grassland species, stubble quail (Coturnix pectoralis). Methods. Telephone surveys of a random sample of licenced Victorian hunters were performed annually from 2009 to 2019. Hunters were asked to quantify their hunting effort and the number of animals harvested. The respondents' answers were analysed to estimate measures of hunter success, activity and efficiency. Bayesian modelling was applied to these data, accounting for changes over time, differences between survey periods for all licence types, and random effects for over-dispersion. The effect of climate on game bird hunter activity and harvest was estimated, as measured by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Results. Over 11 years, annual deer harvest (all species) increased exponentially, at a mean annual rate of 17% (95% credible interval: 14-21%), and the number of deer hunters increased at 8% (5-11%). In contrast, for ducks and stubble quail, hunter numbers remained relatively unchanged, with no evidence of consistent change to total harvests over time, unrelated to changes in environmental conditions or regulations. The annual duck harvest was influenced by ENSO and hunting regulations. The annual stubble quail harvest exhibited 'boom-and-bust' dynamics, with an exceptionally large harvest immediately after a La Nina season. Conclusions. Long-term monitoring of harvest trends in south-eastern Australia revealed stark differences between introduced deer and native birds: harvest of deer increased rapidly whereas equivalent rates for game birds were either stable or declining. Seasonal effects had a strong influence on game bird harvest. Environmental and regulatory conditions were influential for harvest outcomes for ducks and stubble quail. Implications. This study filled a key knowledge gap around managing harvesting of game species, but increased scrutiny is warranted in this field.

AB  - Mechanisms for surviving water and temperature stress in epiphytes are essential adaptations for successful regeneration in forest canopies. Hemiepiphytes start their life cycle as epiphytes, eventually establishing aerial root connections to the ground. This strategy allows for greater light capture, while benefitting from minimized risk of fire, flooding and damage by terrestrial herbivores, but exposes the vulnerable seedling stage to heat and drought stress. However, the response to temperature and water stress during early regeneration in hemiepiphytes is not known. In this study, we tested the effect of temperature (15/5, 25/15 and 35/25 degrees C; day/night diurnal variation) and water availability, as substrate moisture (0.00, -0.20 and -0.35 MPa) and water vapor (18.5-99.5% relative humidity), on seed germination, seedling emergence and survival in six hemiepiphytic and nine non-hemiepiphytic Ficus species. Under high-temperature conditions (35/25 degrees C), hemiepiphytes had higher gemination and seedling survival, achieved peak germination slower and extended germination. Greater water stress (-0.35 MPa) in the growth substrate resulted in higher germination of non-hemiepiphytes; hemiepiphytes, in contrast, took a shorter time to complete germination, but had higher seedling emergence and survival. Hemiepiphytes germinated at 99.5% relative humidity more readily compared with non-hemiepiphytes. These findings provide the first comprehensive evidence that hemiepiphytic Ficus species are better adapted to drier and warmer conditions during the critical transition from seed to seedling. Through greater flexibility in achieving peak germination and duration of regeneration activity, hemiepiphytes modulate their recruitment process to be more resilient under abiotic stressors. This may allow them to be more successful in regenerating in forest canopies under ambient conditions that are transient. These results support previous work showing greater drought tolerance of hemiepiphytic Ficus species in larger size classes and extend this finding to show that physiological adaptations for drought and heat tolerance start from the early seedling emergence stage.

AB  - The valorization of date palm wastes as bioresources has received little attention. In this context, the feasibility of date palm waste valorization through composting and the application effects on barley plants production under control condition was investigated. The principal requirements for compost to be safely used are stability and maturity that refer, respectively, to the microbial biomass activity's level, germination tests, and plant growth bioassays or phytotoxicity. Indeed, the phytotoxicity of composted date palm waste used for seed germination and seedling growth bioassays was researched. The finished compost values of the C/N ratio were 15.36 and 18.58%, 1.21%, 0.54%, and 0.95% for total organic carbon, N, P, and K contents, respectively. The concentration of heavy metals and microelements were lower and met the requirement established by national standards. Moreover, the end product was free from harmful pathogens like Salmonella, Escherichia coli, total coliforms, and fecal coliform bacteria. Application of compost extract (especially 25%, 50%, and 75%) did not affect barley seed germination, stimulated hypocotyl and radicle growth and is characterized by a GI exceeding 90%, demonstrating its stability and lack of phytotoxic effect. Moreover, compost promotes plant growth, improved physiological parameters, photosynthetic pigments, and plant biomass. According to the results, the prepared compost especially at the dose T3 (soil amended with 30 t/ha) increased the nutrients availability and uptake which may be the reason for an increase in photosynthetic activity, chlorophyll synthesis, and dry matter accumulation. Composting may well represent an acceptable solution for disposing of date palm waste and be of great interest to sustainable agriculture in Tunisia oasis ecosystems.

AB  - Desert tortoises play ecologically significant roles, including plant seed dispersal and mineral cycling, and yet little is known about microbial members that are critical to their gut and overall health. Tortoises consume recalcitrant plant material, which their gut microbiota degrades and converts into usable metabolites and nutrients for the tortoise. Findings from tortoise gut microbiomes may translate well into biotechnological applications as these microbes have evolved to efficiently degrade recalcitrant substrates and generate useful products. In this study, we cultivated microbial communities from desert tortoise fecal samples following a targeted anaerobic enrichment for microbes involved in deconstruction and utilization of plant biomass. We employed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to compare cultivated communities to initial fecal source material and found high abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidota typically associated with biomass deconstruction in all cultivated samples. Significantly decreased microbial diversity was observed in the cultivated microbial communities, yet several key taxa thrived in lignocellulose enrichments, including Lachnospiraceae and Enterococcus. Additionally, cultivated communities produced short-chain fatty acids under anaerobic conditions, and their growth and metabolic output provide evidence of their viability in the initial fecal communities. Overall, this study adds to the limited understanding of reptilian herbivore microbiota, and offers a path towards biotechnological translation based on the ability of the cultivated communities to convert lignocellulose directly to acetate, propionate, and butyrate.

AB  - The Stress Gradient Hypothesis predicts facilitation will become more important than competition where abiotic stress is high, and the framework successfully predicts positive interactions between species in many systems. Fewer studies have focused on intraspecific facilitation, and to our knowledge none examine intraspecific interactions in Pacific Coast salt marshes of North America. We used two species that tend to occur in large, monospecific patches to test for intraspecific facilitation in a restored California marsh, where tides and evaporation during summer create moisture and salinity gradients across elevation. We tested performance of Frankenia salina or Jaumea carnosa in restoration plots using two treatments: clustered plantings to promote facilitation, and widely spaced plantings to limit interaction between individuals. We characterized the soil water potential gradient and measured plant survival, cover, physiology, and susceptibility to herbivory across elevation and planting treatments. Soil water potential declined sharply with elevation, suggesting plant stress should be higher upslope. However, tissue water potential was unaffected by elevation, and survival was high-suggesting growing conditions remained benign. A seawater addition treatment did not alter the response of plants or plant interactions to the abiotic gradient. At 19 months, intraspecific competition prevailed across the entire elevation gradient for both species, with less transplant cover in clustered plantings. However, clustered Frankenia fared better during a transient period of heavy rabbit herbivory. Aside from this temporary benefit, clustering did not reduce stress and strongly suppressed growth-suggesting that restoration designs for the high marsh should minimize competition.

AB  - This article presents a broad overview of excavated animal taxa and methods of procurement at the Middle Iron Age site of Schroda (AD 900-1100), located in the Mapungubwe National Park. Here, a diverse animal resource base was exploited through various strategies - some of which drew on individual participation, while others relied on group effort and resource pooling. Cattle, sheep and goat herds provided a reliable supply of meat, milk and skins throughout the year, while a range of wild mammals, birds, reptiles and fish were also hunted, trapped and collected. Although procurement strategies and animals targeted generally remained unchanged for about 200 years, there is a small shift in the proportion of livestock relative to other animals and a related increase in the exploitation of wild animals. Reliance on a broad spectrum of subsistence strategies is often done as a risk management strategy in areas with unpredictable environmental conditions. Erratic rainfall patterns, evident at the end of the first millennium in the middle Limpopo Valley, would have necessitated such an approach. In addition, the updated taxonomic list for Schroda provides a deep-time record of animal presence and expands the former distribution ranges for some taxa in the Mapungubwe National Park area.

AB  - Simple Summary Giant pandas are facing the threat of habitat degradation. Both grazing livestock and sympatric animals have certain impacts on the giant panda habitat. This study evaluated the habitat suitability of giant panda in Wanglang Nature Reserve by simultaneously investigating livestock grazing and sympatric takin. Results for the giant panda habitat in Wanglang are not optimistic, and the extensive overlap of suitable habitats for livestock, takin and panda makes the situation worse. Habitat suitability provides essential information for the management of protected species. However, studies that jointly consider the impacts of human disturbance and sympatric animals in habitat suitability assessments of giant panda are limited, which may overestimate the habitat status. To address this issue, we evaluated the habitat suitability of giant panda in Wanglang Nature Reserve by simultaneously investigating livestock grazing and sympatric takin via MAXENT, a new attempt at the assessment of the habitat suitability of giant panda. We focused on describing the habitat suitability of giant panda and determining the habitat overlap between livestock, takin, and panda to evaluate the impacts of livestock grazing and sympatric takin on the suitable giant panda habitat. Results revealed that only 16.33% of the area in Wanglang was suitable giant panda habitat, of which 67.66% was shared by livestock, and 97.99% of the remaining suitable panda habitat not shared by livestock was revealed to be shared by takin. The results indicate an unfavorable habitat status of giant panda in Wanglang, with the potential extensive habitat overlap between livestock, takin and panda exerting further pressure. Thus, to effectively protect giant pandas and their habitats, grazing activity should be controlled. Furthermore, to accurately protect sympatric animals, the monitoring of panda and takin activities in the overlapping areas must be maintained.

AB  - This paper presents the first quantitative assessment of the rocky reef ecology of St Helena, a remote island in the central tropical Atlantic. Monitoring data were used to characterise different habitat types found around St Helena. These findings were compared with 9 other locations in the tropical Atlantic, in different biogeographic, oceanic and reef settings, along with the environmental variables known to limit coral reef formation. St Helena's rocky and boulder reefs had similar to 50% cover dominated by turf and other filamentous algae, with lower levels of sessile invertebrates (15%) and macroalgae (4%). Both coral and rocky reef comparison locations also showed a dominance of turf and filamentous algae, with higher levels of macroalgae and sessile invertebrates in areas with higher nutrient concentrations (e.g. south-east continental Brazil). Coral growth in St Helena appeared to be limited by cool average sea temperatures of 22 degrees C, which is near, but not below, accepted lower thresholds for reef formation. The main trophic groups of fish found on rocky reefs in St Helena were comparable to other Atlantic rocky and coral reefs, with a dominance of planktivores, mobile invertivores and roving herbivores, with the major difference in trophic structure being driven by more planktivores in oceanic vs. continental versus locations. St Helena's narrow rocky coastal strip varied little in terms of reef geomorphology, resulting in high homogeneity around the island. However, endemic fish were numerous, demonstrating that isolation has produced a unique tropical Atlantic marine assemblage.

AB  - Ecological communities consist of multiple species interacting in diverse ways. Understanding the mechanisms supporting coexistence requires accounting for such a diversity. Because most works focus either on mutualism or predation, how pollination and herbivory interactively determine the stable coexistence in plant-pollinatorherbivore communities is still poorly understood. Studying the typical three-species module of such communities, we determine the conditions allowing stable coexistence then investigate how its maintenance constrains the relative interaction strengths. Our results show that coexistence is possible if pollination is sufficiently strong relative to herbivory, while its stability is possible if herbivory is sufficiently strong relative to pollination. A balance between pollination and herbivory is therefore required. Interestingly, shared preferences for plant phenotypes, that would favor such balance, have been frequently reported in the empirical literature. The identified ecological trade-off between attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores therefore also appears as an emergent property of stable plant-pollinator-herbivore communities.

AB  - Understanding population trends is important when managing wildlife in protected areas. The common hippopotamus, Hippopotamus amphibius (hereafter hippo), is an iconic African species that, in South Africa, is mainly restricted to protected areas. Ndumo Game Reserve (NGR), South Africa, was established as a sanctuary for hippos in 1924. However, NGR and its hippo population are under increased anthropogenic threat, outlining the importance of long-term and current data on hippo population dynamics. We collated census data from 1951 to 2021 to identify trends in hippo population numbers. We also conducted monthly unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) censuses from August 2016- July 2017 to identify changes in the distribution of hippos in the most important water bodies in NGR. Historical census data were collected using a variety of methods, and observed trends revealed a decrease in the hippo population in the past 40 years. Monthly census data from 2016 to 2017 revealed that wading locations in NGR hold differing values as wading sites, with 85-95% of the population using the uSuthu and Phongolo Rivers and associated floodplains. Areas in NGR experiencing the greatest anthropogenic land invasions are also the areas that represent the best hippo habitat in NGR. We, therefore, recommend that the conservation management authority, sections of the South African government like the Department of Land Affairs and local communities work together to reinstate the boundary of NGR to protect hippo and other wildlife in this important protected area.

AB  - An analysis of the past geographical, altitudinal and chronological distribution of the European bison remains in Bulgaria is given. The Paper summarizes all scattered data published in the last 36 years on the distribution of the species. Data of 18 fossil and subfossil localities (Late Pleistocene to 17th c. AD) from 15 out of 28 provinces in the country are presented. The fossil/subfossil record in Bulgaria proves the wide distribution of the wisent in the lowland, plain, and lower hilly landscapes in Bulgaria. Most data originate from prehistoric, ancient, and medieval settlements. The wisent was distributed mainly in the plains in places up to 300 m a. s. l., where are located over 70 percent of the known sites, although it was found in the mountains at 1080 m. a. s. l. The species survived in the country until the 16th -17th c. AD, i.e. seven centuries longer than known so far.

AB  - Interest in using insects to treat surplus manure without environmental impacts is growing. Black soldier fly (BSF, Hermetia illucens L.) larvae show promising potential for transforming organic waste. Moreover, they can breed and grow in organic waste. In addition, using bulking agents in organic waste is effective in optimizing composting process like volume density. In this study, we focused on the decomposition and characteristics of a pig manure-sawdust mixture post-treatment at different growth stages of BSF larvae. For the experiments, 4 kg of pig manure was mixed with 1 kg of sawdust and then treated with 0.5 kg of either second instars (Group 1) or third instars (Group 2) of BSF larvae. The two experimental groups were randomly assigned three replicates per group. For Experiment 1, the results showed that the decomposition efficacy of the second-instar BSF larvae was better than that of the third-instar BSF larvae. In Experiment 2, the two BSF larval groups did not improve the characteristics, including pH, moisture, ADF, NDF, and hemicelluloses of the pig manure-sawdust mixture. These findings provide a scientific basis for improving the decomposition efficacy of second-instar BSF larvae reared on a pig manure-sawdust mixture. BSF larvae did not affect pH and moisture in treated pig manure-sawdust during composting.

AB  - Facilitation is an ecological interaction in which the presence of one species (e.g., ecosystem engineers) alters the environment in a way that enhances growth, survival or reproduction of a neighboring species. Wood-boring insects are considered facilitators for cavities-nesting ants, which experience intense intra and interspecific competition for these sites. But how do ants find these cavities? Here, we suggest that ants could be attracted by chemical/odorous cues emitted by the frass of wood-boring insects. Using captive colonies of Cephalotes pusillus (Klug 1824) in controlled conditions, we carried out a bioassay to test the following hypotheses: (i) the frass from beetles are more attractive to ants than those from caterpillars (Cossidae: Lepidoptera), since boring beetles are more common and produce more cavities for ant nest on the studied plant, Caryocar brasiliensis (Caryocaraceae). If this first hypothesis is true, (ii) in relation to the cavity substrate type, the insect frass will be an attraction for workers from captive colonies (colonies, hereafter): both from compromised colonies (colonies without nest and in vulnerable condition) and intact colonies in tubes and (iii) and workers from compromised colonies colonize tubes with frass more quickly than those from intact colonies. The three hypotheses were confirmed, and Cephalotes pusillus ants prefer beetle frass, moving more quickly (five times faster) into tubes with frass when in vulnerable conditions. Our findings revealed that frass from beetles is a trigger to workers of C. pusillus locate and then nesting on branches of C. brasiliensis in Brazilian Cerrado. We suggest that the selection for a nesting cavity by arboreal ants is not random, but guided by chemical/odorous cues.

AB  - Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St. Hil.) is a native tree species from South America, whose raw material covers the sectors of food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and hygiene products. In this work we study the soil chemical fertility, plant nutritional status and growth of yerba mate under effects of mineral and organic fertilization in two management systems, monoculture and intercropping with Mimosa scabrella Benth. Three soil fertilization treatments (control, mineral fertilization and organic fertilization as sheep manure) and two yerba mate provenances were studied. Soil chemical analysis was performed at 360 DAT (days after transplanting the plants to the field) in two layers (0-20 and 20-40 cm depth). At 360 and 460 DAT, foliar nutrient concentrations were determined and shoot height and collar diameter of the yerba mate plants were measured. Mineral or organic fertilization increased Mg, K and P contents of the soil, while the other soil fertility attributes were not affected by the fertilization treatments. Foliar concentrations of N, Ca, S Cu and B were affected by yerba mate provenances and management system. Soil fertilization affected the foliar concentrations of Mg, Fe and B. Foliar concentrations of the other nutrients (N, P, K, S, Mn and Zn) were not influenced by the fertilization treatments. Monoculture system had greater plant growth evaluated at 360 and 460 DAT than the intercropped system. Organic fertilization, added as sheep manure, had a similar effect to that of mineral fertilization on growth of yerba mate plants.

AB  - Climate and land use change are the primary drivers causing the reduction of habitat range for many species worldwide, especially wide-ranging and large-bodied ungulates. For instance, khulan (Equus hemionus hemionus), a flagship species inhabiting desert regions of Asia, exhibits heightened vulnerability to habitat loss and fragmentation due to their extensive habitat requirements. We simulated suitable khulan habitats in China across 20 scenarios, including the past (1980-2000), current (2001-2022), and future (2050 s and 2070 s) climate and land use change scenarios. For each scenario, we identified the suitable habitat area and evaluated the effectiveness of protected areas (PAs). Our findings revealed a decline in khulan habitat area from 133,006 km2 in the past to 60,141 km2 at present. Future scenarios indicate further reductions in potential khulan habitat, with more negative impacts resulting from climate change than land use change. Northern Xinjiang is expected to persist as a primary area of both in-situ and ex-situ refugia for khulan in future scenarios. Although suitable habitat within existing PAs is smaller than that outside, the rates of habitat loss and fragmentation outside the PAs surpass those inside PAs. These findings emphasize the importance of effective management strategies for PAs as crucial goals for ongoing conservation efforts for the khulan. Our models suggest that future suitable habitat for khulan will be situated along the international border between China and Mongolia, adjacent to protected areas in Mongolia utilized by khulan. Enhancing connectivity between these habitats could significantly contribute to improving both the climate and genetic resilience of khulan populations.

AB  - By considering the emergence and threat of African Swine Fever (ASF) in Europe, this paper demonstrates the growing role of veterinary rationales in reframing contemporary human-wild boar coexistence. Through comparative ethnographies of human-wild boar relations in the Czech Republic, Spain and England, it shows that coexistence is not a predictable and steady process but is also demarked by points of radical change in form, course and atmosphere. Such moments, or wild boar events, can lead to the (re-)formation or magnified influence of certain discourses, practices and power relations in determining strategies of bio-governance. Specifically, this paper highlights how the spread of ASF in Europe has accelerated an already ongoing process of veterinarization, understood as the growing prominence of veterinary sciences in the mediation and reorganization of contemporary socioecologies. This example highlights how veterinary logics increasingly influence localized human-wildlife relations and, through analogous practices of biosecurity and control, also connect different places and geographic contexts.

AB  - Leaf herbivory potentially affects carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. It is especially critical to study the leaf herbivory rates in mangroves to understand the pattern of resource changes from the detrital pathway to the grazing pathway. However, determinants of leaf herbivory rates in mangroves are poorly understood. We examined the differences in leaf herbivory rates among leaf phenotypes (sun or shade leaves), leaf ages (young or old leaves), and season (summer or winter) and investigated the relationships between the leaf herbivory rates and 12 leaf traits (including chemical, physiological, and physical/mechanical traits) in each of six communities from the seaward fringe to the inland of subtropical mangroves on Iriomote Island, southern Japan. The herbivory rates decreased from seaward to landward mangrove species, excluding one species in the landward mangroves. The herbivory rates also decreased as the concentration of condensed tannins or the tannins:nitrogen ratio increased but did not correlate with the other leaf traits. Overall, season, leaf phenotype, and leaf age had no effect on the herbivory rate. However, in the two seaward and one rhizophoraceous species, the herbivory rates were higher in summer than in winter and were affected by the leaf phenotypes. The concentration of leaf condensed tannins moderately influenced leaf herbivory, fluctuating from seaward to landward; therefore, it was one of the factors driving the grazing pathway in mangroves. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for a comprehensive appreciation of the high productivity of and nutrient cycling in mangrove forest ecosystems.

AB  - Dahongpao mother tree (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Ktze) is a representative of Wuyi rock tea. Whether there is a difference in rhizosphere soil microbial diversity and function between asexually propagated cuttings of Dahongpao (PD) and the parent Dahongpao mother tree (MD) has not been reported. In this study, high throughput sequencing technology was used to analyze rhizosphere soil microbial diversity, functions and their relationship with soil available nutrients and enzyme activities in MD and PD. The results showed that available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents and urease, protease, acid phosphatase and sucrase activities of rhizosphere soils in MD were significantly higher than those in PD. Both bacterial and fungal diversity were higher in rhizosphere soils in MD than in PD, and secondly, the bacterial community structure was less stable while the fungal community structure was more stable in PD compared to MD. There were significant differences between MD and PD tea tree rhizosphere soils in 6 genera of characteristic bacteria and 4 genera of characteristic fungi. The results of function and interaction effect analysis showed that the rhizosphere soil available nutrient content and enzyme activities in MD were significantly higher than those in PD, and their contributions mainly originated from Pirellula and Acidisphaera of characteristic bacteria and Alatospora of characteristic fungi. Secondly, MD maybe had a stronger ability to inhibit soil pathogens than PD, with the main contribution coming from Scopulariopsis and Tolypocladium of characteristic fungi. Overall, compared with PD, soil texture in MD was relatively better, and its soil nutrient cycling-related enzyme activities were stronger, which was more favorable to soil nutrient cycling and increased the available nutrient content of the soil, which in turn promoted the growth of tea trees. This study provides an important reference for the planting and management of tea tree cuttings and microbial regulation of tea tree growth.

AB  - The position of the Banwell Bone Cave mammal assemblage zone (MAZ) in the mammalian biostratigraphy of the British Isles has been the focus of debate for decades. Dominated by fauna typical of cold environments it was originally linked to the marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 4 stadial (ca. 72-59 ka). Subsequently it was argued that the Banwell Bone Cave MAZ more likely relates to the temperate interstadial of MIS 5a (ca. 86-72 ka). It is envisioned that "cold fauna" such as bison and reindeer moved into Britain during stadial MIS 5b (ca. 90 ka) and were subsequently isolated by the rising sea level during MIS 5a. Here we investigate environmental conditions during the Banwell Bone Cave MAZ using bone collagen delta C-13 and delta N-15 and tooth enamel delta O-18 and delta C-13 isotope analysis. We analyse bison and reindeer from the MAZ type-site, Banwell Bone Cave. Our results show unusually high delta N-15 values, which we ascribe to arid conditions within a temperate environment. Palaeotemperature estimates derived from enamel delta O-18 indicate warm temperatures, similar to present day. These results confirm that the Banwell Bone Cave MAZ relates to a temperate interstadial and supports its correlation to MIS 5a rather than MIS 4.

AB  - Apex predators exert suppressive effects on mesocarnivores; however, they also provide important carrion subsidies. Optimal foraging theory predicts that individuals respond to resource competition by using high-value resources, while competition theory predicts that individuals respond by partitioning resources. This study investigated how the return of wolves (Canis lupus Linneas, 1758) to Washington state impacted the diet of a subordinate carnivore-the coyote (Canis latrans Say, 1823). We collected coyote scats from two areas of northern Washington with differing wolf densities and used traditional analysis of undigested remains to infer diet. We tested for differences in the volumes of prey categories, the proportion of ungulate prey that was scavenged, and diet diversity between seasons, study sites, and inside and outside of wolf pack territories. Coyote scats contained more adult ungulate remains inside of wolf pack territories (27%) compared to outside (14%), while seeds and berries were more commonly consumed outside of wolf pack territories (23%) than inside of wolf pack territories (4%). These findings suggest that coyotes are taking advantage of wolf kills to increase ungulate carrion consumption, as predicted by optimal foraging theory, which may substantially affect plant and wildlife communities as wolves continue to recover and coyote diets shift in response.

AB  - Climate change is expected to intensify bark beetle population outbreaks in forests globally, affecting biodiversity and trajectories of change. Aspects of individual tree resistance remain poorly quantified, particularly with regard to the role of phenolic compounds, hindering robust predictions of forest response to future conditions. In 2003, we conducted a mechanical wounding experiment in a Norway spruce forest that coincided with an outbreak of the bark beetle, Ips typographus. We collected phloem samples from 97 trees and monitored tree survival for 5 months. Using high-performance liquid chromatography, we quantified induced changes in the concentrations of phenolics. Classification and regression tools were used to evaluate relationships between phenolic production and bark beetle resistance, in the context of other survival factors. The proximity of beetle source populations was a principal determinant of survival. Proxy measures of tree vigor, such as crown defoliation, mediated tree resistance. Controlling for these factors, synthesis of catechin was found to exponentially increase tree survival probability. However, even resistant trees were susceptible in late season due to high insect population growth. Our results show that incorporating trait-mediated effects improves predictions of survival. Using an integrated analytical approach, we demonstrate that phenolics play a direct role in tree defense to herbivory.

AB  - The Tibetan Plateau has experienced elevation-dependent climate warming, which has profoundly influenced the seasonal dynamics of plant growth. However, how peak photosynthesis timing (DOYPmax), a key component of plant growth seasonality, responds to climate change on the Tibetan Plateau remains unclear. Here, we investigated the change in the elevational gradient in DOYPmax on the Tibetan Plateau during 2001-2018 and its drivers. We mapped the primary climatic constraint on plant photosynthesis and found that it was temperature at 3000-4000 m a.s.l. in the central and eastern parts but soil water at 4000-5000 m a.s.l. in the southwestern part. DOYPmax increased by 1.0 & PLUSMN; 0.1 days/100 m with increasing elevation from 3000 to 5000 m a.s.l., but the elevational gradient in DOYPmax decreased by -0.8 & PLUSMN; 0.2 days/100 m/decade during 2001-2018 due to both direct and indirect effects of climate change. Specifically, at 3000-4000 m a.s.l., DOYPmax was delayed because of the direct effect of the increase in soil water. At 4000-5000 m a.s.l., DOYPmax advanced due to the warminginduced earlier green-up date in the central plateau and the drought-induced later spring phenology in the southwestern plateau. Such a change in plant growth seasonality should alter seasonal carbon cycle of alpine ecosystems, summer diets of the migrant herbivores and alpine plant-animal interactions along elevation gradients, but further efforts are needed to clarify how herbivores that migrate long distances, e.g., Tibetan antelope, adapt to changes in the elevational gradient in peak plant growth timing.

AB  - For many Indigenous Peoples in the Circumpolar North, cultural engagement and continuity across generations is directly related to relationships between and among people, animals, and landscapes. However, minimal research outlines the emotional responses and disruptions to culture and identity that are driven by ecological change, and the subsequent cultural dimensions of coping and adapting to this uncertainty. Through a case study that explores how caribou population declines and a caribou hunting ban are impacting Inuit in the Nunatsiavut and NunatuKavut regions of Labrador, Canada, this article examines the critical interplay between cultural continuity and adaptive capacity for responding to ecological uncertainty. More specifically, this study: 1) described the central role that caribou play for Inuit emotional wellness, identity, and cultural continuity; 2) explored how the rapid declines of caribou in Labrador are affecting Inuit emotional wellness, identity, and cultural continuity; and 3) characterized the ways in which Inuit are adapting to these emotio-social, cultural, and ecological changes. Drawing from an Inuit-led, multi-year, multi-media qualitative and visual media research program, data from video interviews (n = 84: Nunatsiavut region: n = 54; NunatuKavut region: n = 30) were analyzed using a video-based qualitative analysis, constant-comparative methods, and inductive qualitative approach. Results indicated that caribou are a foundational element for Inuit emotional wellness, identity, and cultural continuity. The changes in caribou populations are resulting in complex emotional responses, losses to cultural meaning and knowledge, and alterations to Inuit identities. The impacts on emotions, identity, and cultural continuity related to Inuit-caribou relations at an individual and collective level reflect the interconnections between cultural continuity and adaptive capacity that underlie the loss of this culturally important species. Though this research focuses on two Inuit groups and caribou in Labrador, the insights from these lived experiences highlight the ongoing cultural and identity consequences associated with species declines occurring globally.

AB  - Simple Summary The microbiota co-evolves with the host and plays an important role in the host's health, immunity, and nutrient absorption. Wild boars are the ancestors of domestic pigs. During the long evolutionary process, the physiological structure and living habits of modern pigs have undergone tremendous changes. However, there are few studies on the evolution of gut microbiota of wild boars and domestic pigs. In this study, by comparing the changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota of wild boars and domestic pigs, it was found that there were significant differences between the two groups, which indicated that the gut microbiota had changed during the evolution process. This study provides some data references for the evolution of gut microbiota. Gut microbiota diversity is a result of co-evolution between microorganisms and their hosts. However, there are few studies on the evolution of the gut microbiota of wild boars and domestic pigs. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the composition and function of the gut microbiota of wild boars and domestic pigs using 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region sequencing, 16S rRNA gene full-length sequencing, and metagenomic sequencing. This study showed that after a long evolution, as compared to wild boars, the domestic pigs exhibited significantly increased relative abundances of Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus sp.DJF_WC5, and Lactobacillus; s_uncultured bacterium, while the relative abundances of Bifidobacterium and Methanococcaceae decreased significantly. In addition, the relative abundances of "carbohydrate metabolism", "starch and sucrose metabolism", "valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis", "lysine biosynthesis", and starch-degrading CAZymes were significantly increased in the domestic pigs, while the relative abundances of "environmental adaptation", "immune system", "fatty acid degradation and synthesis", and cellulose-hemicellulose-degrading CAZymes were significantly increased in the wild boars. Finally, the diversity of ARGs and the "antimicrobial resistance genes" in domestic pigs also increased significantly. This study illustrates that the gut microbiota composition and function of wild boars and domestic pigs changed during the long evolution process. These findings provide a basic research theory for the evolution of gut microbiota and the treatment of health and disease.

AB  - Simple Summary The objective was to characterize the pastures by grazing cycle, as well as to evaluate the performance of buffaloes in intensive rotational grazing in a silvopastoral system in the eastern Amazon supplemented with agro-industry co-products in order to characterize the grazing cycles, the composition of the fractions and the carcass yield. Fifteen non-castrated, crossbred water buffaloes (Murrah x Mediterranean) were used. Forage protein varied: leaves contained 11.4% protein in the leaves and 50% FDA in the stems. The grass had higher amounts of B3/B2 proteins, which are less indigestible in leaves (17.16%). Forage production varied; the second cycle was better (leaf/stem 2.11). Despite a varied supplement intake, daily weight gain (1 kg/day) and carcass yield (49.23%) showed no differences, ensuring cost-effective, sustainable production. Incorporating supplements derived from coconut and palm kernel co-products enhances performance and carcass yield, comparable to standard supplements. This practice lowers production expenses, optimizes forage utilization, and enhances production chain sustainability, making it a recommended approach.Abstract The objective was to characterize the pastures by grazing cycle, as well as to evaluate the performance of buffaloes in intensive rotational grazing in a silvopastoral system in the eastern Amazon supplemented with agro-industry co-products in order to characterize the grazing cycles, the composition of the fractions, and the carcass yield. Fifteen non-castrated, crossbred water buffaloes (Murrah x Mediterranean) were used. All animals used in the study were clinically healthy and weighed approximately 458 kg. The animals were grazed in a single group, and supplementation (1% of live weight-LW/day) was divided into three treatments: control (control-conventional ingredients); Cocos nucifera coconut cake (Cocos nucifera) (coconut cake-70%); and palm kernel cake (Guinean elaeis) (palm kernel cake-70% palm kernel cake). The chemical composition of the forage is different in each part of the plant, with higher protein values in the leaves (11.40%) and higher acid detergent fiber (ADF) values in the stems (50.03%). Among the ingredients of the supplement, corn has the highest percentage of indigestible protein (35.57%), most of the protein in palm kernel cake is B3 (49.11%), and in Coco, B2 (51.52%). Mombasa grass has a higher percentage of B3 and B2 proteins; the indigestible fraction is lower in the leaves (17.16%). The leaf/stem ratio also varied between grazing cycles, being better in the second cycle (2.11%) and with an overall average of 1.71. Supplement consumption varied between cycles and was higher in the control treatment, with an overall mean of 4.74. There was no difference in daily weight gain and carcass yield, with an average of 1 kg/day and 49.23%, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that including supplements based on by-products from the coconut and palm oil agro-industries promotes performance and carcass yields compatible with conventional supplements. Their use reduces production costs, optimizes the utilization of forage mass, enhances the sustainability of the production chain, and, therefore, is recommended.

AB  - Parasites can modify host behaviour to increase their chances of survival and transmission. Toxoplasma gondii is a globally distributed protozoan whose ability to modify host behaviour is well known in taxa such as rats and humans. Less well known are the effects on the behaviour of wild species, with the exception of a few studies on primates and carnivores. Taking advantage of a culling activity conducted in Stelvio National Park (Italy), the serological status of T. gondii was studied in 260 individuals of red deer Cervus elaphus with respect to the risk of being culled. A temporal culling rank index was fitted as a response variable, and T. gondii serological status as the main explanatory variable in linear models, accounting for covariates such as sex, age, jaw length, bone marrow fat and culling location. The overall seroprevalence of T. gondii was 31.5%, and the selected models suggested that seropositive deer were culled earlier than seronegative ones, but this effect was only evident in females, in individuals with medium-good body condition, and in areas with greater human presence. Our results suggest that T. gondii may be involved in risk behaviour in large herbivores, supporting its role as a facilitator of predation risk.

AB  - 1. Land-use change and political-economic shifts have shaped hunting patterns globally, even as traditional hunting practices endure across many local socio-cultural contexts. The widespread expansion of oil palm cultivation, and associated urbanization, alters land-use patterns, ecological processes, economic relationships, access to land and social practices.
   2. In particular, we focus on the socio-ecological dynamics between KadazandusunMurut (KDM) hunters in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, and bearded pigs (Sus barbatus; Malay: 'babi hutan'), the favoured game animal for non-Muslim communities throughout much of Borneo. We conducted 38 semi-structured interviews spanning over 50 hr with bearded pig hunters, asking them about contemporary hunting practices and motivations, changes in hunting practices, changes in pig behaviour, and patterns of animal protein consumption in village and urban contexts.
   3. Amidst widespread land-use change, primarily driven by oil palm expansion, respondents reported substantially different characteristics of hunting in oil palm plantations as compared to hunting in forests. Additionally, 17 of 38 hunters- including 71% (10/14) of hunters who started hunting before 1985, compared to 26% (6/23) of hunters who started hunting in 1985 or later-mentioned that bearded pigs are behaving in a more skittish or fearful way as compared to the past. Our respondents also reported reductions in hunting frequency and wild meat consumption in urban contexts as compared to rural contexts.
   4. However, despite these substantial changes in hunting and dietary practices, numerous KDM hunting motivations, hunting techniques and socio-cultural traditions have endured over the last several decades. For some, bearded pig meat remains deeply tied to food provision, gifting and sharing customs, and cultural components of celebrations and feasts.
   5. Oil palm has cultivated new hunting practices that differ from those in forests, and has potentially contributed to altered bearded pig behaviour due to increased hunting accessibility. Together, oil palm and urbanization are helping reshape the KDM-bearded pig socio-ecological system. In light of these reshaped connections, we recommend location-specific management approaches that ensure fair access to the dietary and social benefits of bearded pig hunting while preserving the critical conservation needs of bearded pig populations and habitat. These twin goals are particularly urgent given the confirmed outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF), and mass deaths of domestic pigs and wild bearded pigs, in Sabah and Kalimantan in 2021.

AB  - Sarawak is known as the "Land of Hornbills", having the Rhinoceros Hornbill as the state emblem and with hornbills also being closely associated with important cultural symbols and beliefs among various local communities. However, up to date there is limited understanding on the perception, awareness, and beliefs of local communities towards hornbills. This paper aims to describe the aforementioned factors in western Sarawak, in hope of acquiring the socio-cultural information needed to fill the gap, and to clarify misconceptions towards hornbill conservation efforts in Sarawak. Data collection was accomplished using Open Data Kit (ODK). A total of 500 respondents were approached in five administrative divisions in western Sarawak, namely Kuching, Samarahan, Serian, Sri Aman, and Betong. The questionnaire was carefully formulated to control acquiescence bias that might arise. Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) modelling was conducted to evaluate the strongest demographic predictor variables influencing the answers and word clouds were used to visualise hornbill species by the local community. Sarawakians acknowledge the importance of hornbills as a cultural symbol (95%) despite hornbills being used for food, medicine, and decoration. Whilst this study describes the perceptions of hornbills in local communities, a comprehensive assessment throughout Sarawak is recommended for better understanding of hornbill importance in other communities. Such socio-cultural information is vital to ensure the success of conservation efforts and for effective management strategies of hornbills within Sarawak.

AB  - Food resources are the fundamental basis for the survival and reproduction of animals. Diet research is the foundation for understanding their ecological habits and is of great significance for evaluating their survival status and carrying out effective protection and management. South China sika deer (Cervus nippon kopschi) is the most endangered subspecies of wild sika deer in China, with a small population and a shrinking distribution area. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding technology to study the diet composition of C. n. kopschi in Taohongling Sika Deer National Nature Reserve in Jiangxi, China. Comparative analysis of diet composition among different areas (A-E) of C. n. kopschi was conducted, as well as C. n. hortulorum raised in the same areas. We found that the dominant families in the diet composition of C. n. kopschi were Rosaceae (46.73% of relative abundance), Anacardiaceae (6.02%), Poaceae (5.54%), and Fabaceae (3.92%), with Rubus (45.43%) being the absolute dominant genus. Thirty-two preferred plant species were identified in the diet of C. n. kopschi. The highest relative abundance (45%) was Rubus reflexus. The dominant family and genus in the diet composition of C. n. hortulorum were Fabaceae (33.89%) and Pueraria (32.87%), respectively. Of the 15 preferred plant species, the highest relative abundance was Pueraria montana (33%). The richness, diversity, and evenness of diet composition in Area B of C. n. kopschi were the highest among all areas, with significant differences compared to Areas C, D, and E. Diet composition of deer in Area A did not differ significantly from those in other areas. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) both indicated a significant separation in the diet composition of C. n. kopschi and C. n. hortulorum, while Area B showed significant separation from the other areas. This study elaborates on the diet composition information of C. n. kopschi and can provide a reference for the protection and improvement of the habitat of sika deer.

AB  - When a plant is introduced to a new ecosystem it may escape from some of its coevolved herbivores. Reduced herbivore damage, and the ability of introduced plants to allocate resources from defence to growth and reproduction can increase the success of introduced species. This mechanism is known as enemy release and is known to occur in some species and situations, but not in others. Understanding the conditions under which enemy release is most likely to occur is important, as this will help us to identify which species and habitats may be most at risk of invasion. We compared in situ measurements of herbivory on 16 plant species at 12 locations within their native European and introduced Australian ranges to quantify their level of enemy release and understand the relationship between enemy release and time, space and climate. Overall, plants experienced approximately seven times more herbivore damage in their native range than in their introduced range. We found no evidence that enemy release was related to time since introduction, introduced range size, temperature, precipitation, humidity or elevation. From here, we can explore whether traits, such as leaf defences or phylogenetic relatedness to neighbouring plants, are stronger indicators of enemy release across species.

AB  - Mobula hypostoma (Bancroft, 1831), Atlantic Pygmy Devil Rays, were observed during megafauna surveys in the shallow coastal waters off the Republic of the Congo. These are the first records of this species in its natural habitat in Congolese waters, which may well offer an important habitat for these coastal batoids, but further research is needed. There is an urgent need for management measures to protect M. hypostoma throughout its African range, particularly in view of the recent increase in fishing activities within the region.

AB  - Chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana is an ecologically and economically important species in Taiwan, with a high affinity for fog immersion. Our study aims to identify possible stress factors that induce seedling mortality and investigate how different ecological factors influence seedlings' early-stage safe site requirements. We focused on the effect of large-scale climatic variables, small-scale microhabitat conditions, and biotic interactions on seedling survival and establishment by applying seasonal seedling survival monitoring and establishment surveys on both regional and local scales. We identified two alternative ways of seedling death, by environmentinduced mortality and as a result of herbivory. Opposite effects of the same environmental factors on different causes of mortality showed that seedlings might need to balance the risks posed by both mortality causes to optimize their growing conditions. On a regional scale, we observed a limited effect of regional climatic variables (namely fog frequency) on seedlings' establishment and survival but noted a similar seasonal survival pattern among regions. We hypothesize that short-duration droughts during the transition from Plum rain to typhoon season are one of the key mechanisms of environment-induced mortality. On a local scale, we found that decayed coarse wood debris (CWD) facilitates seedling establishment by providing a "safe site", likely due to increased colonization of small-stature bryophytes and decreased litterfall accumulation. The effect of bryophytes on seedling establishment varies depending on their thickness, with thicker ones having stronger negative effects. Aside from the bryophytes, the accumulation of litter hindered seedling establishment. We argue that to safeguard the regeneration of Chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana population in natural forests, preserving CWD in the forest floor as a safe site for the seedlings after tree-replacing disturbance is essential, particularly under ongoing climate change where more frequent and prolonged drought events are predicted.

AB  - Natal habitat preference induction (NHPI) occurs when animals exhibit a preference for new habitat that is similar to that which they experienced in their natal environment, potentially leading to post-dispersal success. While the study of NHPI is typically focused on post-settlement home ranges, we investigated how this behavior may manifest during extra-home range movements (EHRMs), both to identify exploratory prospecting behavior and assess how natal habitat cues may influence path selection before settlement. We analyzed GPS collar relocation data collected during 79 EHRMs made by 34 juvenile and subadult white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) across an agricultural landscape with highly fragmented forests in Illinois, USA. We developed a workflow to measure multidimensional natal habitat dissimilarity for each EHRM relocation and fit step-selection functions to evaluate whether natal habitat similarity explained habitat selection along movement paths. Across seasons, selection for natal habitat similarity was generally weak during excursive movements, but strong during dispersals, indicating that NHPI is manifested in dispersal habitat selection in this study system and bolstering the hypothesis that excursive movements differ functionally from dispersal. Our approach for extending the NHPI hypothesis to behavior during EHRMs can be applied to a variety of taxa and can expand our understanding of how individual behavioral variation and early life experience may shape connectivity and resistance across landscapes.

AB  - Home range and activity patterns of animals are important elements for wildlife management and conservation practices. We examined seasonal home range and daily activity patterns of the endangered Swayne's hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei) in Maze National Park, Ethiopia. We tracked two groups of Swayne's hartebeests in open grassland for 1 year. Each group's daily activities (0700-1900 h) and GPS locations were recorded at 15-min intervals on 5 days every month. Activities were grouped into five behavioral categories: feeding, resting, traveling, vigilance, and other. In addition, we carried out nocturnal monitoring during full moon periods to further document movements patterns. We produced 95% and 50% kernel density estimates (KDE) of home range sizes for each group. Home range estimates did not vary across seasons. Feeding and traveling peaked during the early morning and late afternoon, whereas resting occurred most frequently during the midday hours in both seasons. The proportion of time spent feeding was higher during the dry season, whereas a greater proportion of time was spent resting during the wet season. Vigilance behavior occurred consistently throughout the day during both seasons. Time spent feeding and traveling did not vary significantly between seasons. Activity patterns of Swayne's hartebeests are strongly influenced both by time of day and season, while home range size is less influenced by seasonality and may instead reflect temporal variation in food availability. Our findings will help to inform management strategies and conserve one of the last two extant populations of Swayne's hartebeests.

AB  - Evolution of resistance to transgenic crops producing toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) threatens the sustainability of the technology. Examination of resistance mechanisms has largely focused on characterization of mutations in proteins serving as Bt toxin binding sites. However, insect microbial communities have the potential to provide host resistance to pesticides in a myriad of ways. Previous findings suggest the killing mechanism of Bt relies on enteric bacteria becoming pathogenic in the disrupted gut environment of the insect following Bt intoxication. Thus, here we hypothesized that resistance to Bt would alter the microbiome composition of the insect. Previous studies have manipulated the microbiome of susceptible insects and monitored their response to Bt. In our study, we characterized the associated bacterial communities of Bt-resistant and -susceptible western corn rootworms, a widespread pest of maize in the United States. We found resistant insects harbor a bacterial community that is less rich and distinct from susceptible insects. After feeding on Bt-expressing maize, susceptible insects exhibited dysbiosis of the associated bacterial community, whereas the community within resistant insects remained relatively unchanged. These results suggest resistance to Bt produces alterations in the microbiome of the western corn rootworm that may contribute to resistance. We further demonstrated that by itself, feeding on Bt toxin-expressing seedlings caused a shift in the microbiota. This work provides a broader picture of the effect stressors have on microbiome composition, and the potential heritable changes induced as a result of intense selection.

KW  - MORTALITY
AB  - White Crappie (Pomoxis annularis) and Black Crappie (P. nigromaculatus) were studied in three southeast Kansas reservoirs to assess exploitation and determine if current regulations were conducive for sustainable populations. Trap nets were used to sample crappie in Elk City Reservoir, Big Hill Reservoir, and Parsons City Lake. Crappie measuring 210 mm and greater received Floy FD-94 tags that served as entries for rewards to encourage tag reporting. Harvest and angler demographic information were collected when tags were reported. Postcard surveys and motion-sensed cameras were used in conjunction to estimate angler effort and reporting rate on Parsons City Lake. Annual exploitation rates (i.e., percent of fish harvested) determined by tag returns and corrected for nonreporting and tag loss were 28.3%, 21.8%, and 3.9% on Elk City Reservoir, Big Hill Reservoir, and Parsons City Lake, respectively. Overfishing was not occurring, so current statewide regulations were likely appropriate, and no changes may be necessary.

AB  - The enemy release hypothesis states that introduced plants have a competitive advantage due to their release from co-evolved natural enemies (i.e., herbivores and pathogens), which allows them to spread rapidly in new environments. This hypothesis has received mixed support to date, but previous studies have rarely examined the herbivore community, plant damage, and performance simultaneously and largely ignored below-ground herbivores. We tested for enemy release by conducting large scale field surveys of insect diversity and abundance in both the native (United Kingdom) and introduced (New Zealand) ranges of three dock (Rumex, Polygonaceae) species: R. conglomeratus Murray (clustered dock), R. crispus L. (curly dock) and R. obtusifolius L. (broad-leaved dock). We captured both above- and below-ground insect herbivores, measured herbivore damage, and plant biomass as an indicator for performance. In the introduced range, Rumex plants had a lower diversity of insect herbivores, all insect specialists present in the native range were absent and plants had lower levels of herbivore damage on both roots and leaves. Despite this, only R. crispus had greater fresh weight in the introduced range compared to the native range. This suggests that enemy release, particularly from below-ground herbivores, could be a driver for the success of R. crispus plants in New Zealand, but not for R. conglomeratus and R. obtusifolius.

AB  - As global warming persists, heat stress (HS) continues to affect animals, particularly those raised in extensive systems such as sheep. As a result, there is a growing body of research investigating the physiological and biological consequences of HS on these animals. Recent studies have specifically examined the effects of climate change, global warming, and HS on gametes. Heat stress has been shown to affect ram semen production, resulting in decreased sperm quality and volume in both fresh and stored samples. This is attributed to the effect of heat on hormone production in the testicles, which is critical for successful spermatogenesis. Such effects can have significant consequences on the fertility of female sheep, which could affect the farmers' revenue. Therefore, farmers and researchers are utilizing various strategies and laboratory techniques to mitigate these negative effects. This review aims to comprehensively evaluate the impact of HS on ram semen production and conservation and analyze the different mitigation strategies at various levels, including management and nutritional interventions. The findings of this review will serve as a critical foundation for the development of targeted interventions and sustainable practices in sheep farming, ensuring resilient and profitable operations in the face of ongoing global climate challenges.

AB  - Deer management has become an integral part of ecosystem recovery efforts across the globe. Within Scotland, annual deer culls have been implemented to control deer browsing, with the carcasses most often removed from the landscape. Given that animal bodies concentrate large quantities of nutrients, this practice may deplete ecosystems of vital nutrients. We quantified the nitrogen, phosphorous and calcium losses from the removal of culled deer carcasses using nationwide statutory cull reports for four deer species in Scotland between 2010 and 2021. We estimate that annual losses from carcass removal over this period averaged 195,652 kg of nitrogen, 152,834 kg of phosphorus and 251,188 kg of calcium across Scotland. While both red and roe deer were culled at a much higher rate than the other two species red deer culls accounted for approximately 70% of the nutrients lost. Further, while large quantities of all three nutrients were removed from the landscape, calcium losses were particularly high. We then calculated nutrient losses within the three land classifications used in statutory cull reporting-agricultural areas, open range and woodlands-across Scotland's Deer Count Areas. Using data from the literature, we considered these losses in the context of other major environmental inputs and outputs within each land classification. Our results demonstrate that while open range lost more nutrients compared to the other two land classifications, culling resulted in high rates of phosphorus and calcium loss throughout all land classifications when compared to other environmental inputs. Practical implication. Our findings suggest that current practices of carcass removal are gradually stripping nutrients from the Scottish landscape, potentially undermining habitat recovery goals. While this study offers a preliminary, coarse scale summary of the issue, the way forward requires further study of local effects from carcass removal on nutrient pools and balancing deer management with habitat function through interwoven deer and nutrient management strategies.

AB  - Chalicotheres are a peculiar group of large herbivorous mammals, closely related to extant tapirs, rhinoceroses, and horses, but with large claws instead of hooves. The family Chalicotheriidae consists of two subfamilies, the Schizotheriinae and the Chalicotheriinae. Herein we present chalicothere remains from the Upper Miocene locality of Pogana 1 in Romania, identifying the schizotheriine Ancylotherium pentelicum and an indeterminate chalicotheriine that were both found in the same stratigraphic layer. Thus, the Pogana 1 locality represents one of the very few confirmed cases of the co-occurrence of the two subfamilies within one fossiliferous horizon in the same fossil site. A detailed review of all localities where the two subfamilies have been reported to co-occur shows that this is a rare phenomenon that is almost exclusively observed in the Turolian of the Balkan-Iranian zoogeographical province. This is probably due to provincial differences in the palaeoenvironment. The data presented here support the hypothesis of a diverse mosaic environment in the Balkan-Iranian province with both closed environments and open habitats that was able to sustain a rich and diverse large mammal fauna.

AB  - Humid, subtropical grazing lands utilized for cattle production are significant agroecosystems that are important for economic production, global food security, and biodiversity. Prescribed fire, an important management tool, is used for controlling woody plant encroachment, maintaining wildlife habitat, and stimulating forage regrowth. Fire also interacts with grazing to maintain grassland structure and heterogeneity. Understanding this firegrazing interaction is important to producers because spatio-temporal cattle behavior has been linked to both livestock production and environmental impact through patterns of pasture utilization. The goal of the study was to understand how two fire regimes affected spatial and temporal grazing behavior, including grazing intensity, grazing evenness, and circadian and seasonal grazing patterns. A randomized block design experiment was established in 2017 with 16 pastures (16 ha each), at Archbold Biological Station's Buck Island Ranch in FL, USA. We examined two prescribed fire management techniques, one represented the prevailing practice of the region with prescribed fire applied to entire pastures (full burn = FB), and the other 'alternative' regime applied patchburn (PB), in which one-third of a pasture was burned each year. Here we present results from the first year of the study, after the first patch-burns and the full burns were implemented. Global Positioning System data loggers on cows recorded 5-min location fixes to track cows and cattle grazing behavior was inferred based on distances between GPS locations. Cattle behavior was significantly different in PB vs. FB pastures. Over a year with five grazing periods, cattle spent on average 38% more time grazing in burned vs unburned patches within PB pastures. PB burned patches were also grazed with a more even spatial distribution compared to unburned patches. In contrast, in FB pastures, cattle grazing intensity and evenness were similar across the entire pasture. Time of day, temperature, season, and fire treatment all had small effects on the circadian cattle grazing patterns. Our study suggests that PB can be a management tool to manipulate cattle behavior in humid subtropical grazinglands, with potential implications for pasture utilization and beef production, carbon and nutrient cycling, and wildlife habitat.

AB  - The transactional model of stress and coping (TMSC) provides a conceptual framework for understanding adaptations to stressors like chronic wasting disease (CWD). Understanding hunter response to stressors is important because decreased participation and satisfaction can affect individual well-being, cultural traditions, agency revenue, and local economies. Using TMSC, we explored how deer hunters coped with CWD. We also compared involvement, and impacts and emotions related to CWD, inside and outside a CWD management zone. Then we examined coping related to CWD presence, and if the disease affected human health. Most hunters would cope using product shift (i.e., eating meat after a negative test result) rather than displacement (i.e., hunting elsewhere) or dropout. Hunters who may be displaced reported lower involvement in deer hunting, and increased worry about CWD. Results suggest that CWD information and testing may increase hunter worry. Funding expanded testing without prompting displacement or dropout are important management considerations.

AB  - High-resolution paleoecological studies elucidate the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the diversity and distribution of insect herbivory in deep time. Previous analyses of fossil leaf assemblages from intervals of significant environmental change have shown that insect damage frequency and diversity are strongly influenced by temperature and carbon dioxide levels. Similar studies that span intervals of environmental quiescence are a necessary complement and can help disentangle the relative influences of biological versus abiotic factors. The 21.73 +/- 0.03 million year old (early Miocene) Mush Valley lagersta spacing diaeresis tten, Ethiopia, provides one such example. Insect damage censuses were conducted at six stratigraphic levels that span -50,000 years and whose plant ecology has been studied in detail. A total of 2200 leaves (47 morphotypes) were examined and 35 damage types (DTs) observed. We documented variations in insect damage frequency, diversity, and composition among plant host taxa and across stratigraphic levels and tested for correlations with abiotic and biotic factors. Interspecific variations in damage frequency and diversity among host plants at Mush with >20 leaves in the damage census could not be explained solely by leaf mass per area, presence/absence of trichomes, symbiosis with nitrogenfixing bacteria, or host plant abundance. The strongest predictor of insect herbivore damage on the bulk floras (all leaves) was the prevalence of legumes, whose symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria likely made them more nutrient-rich. This pattern was also observed across the climatically-variable PaleoceneEocene boundary in the Bighorn Basin, USA, suggesting that the soil microbiome, plant nutrient composition, and climate work synergistically in regulating insect herbivore distribution, population sizes, and feeding.

AB  - In recent years, the potential of Global Navigation Satellite System Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) for monitoring sea-level variations has been explored extensively. However, most studies have typically selected coastal sites with optimal GNSS-IR observation conditions, often limiting verification to one or two stations and overlooking other viable sites. This study introduces a site-evaluation strategy named facilitated interferometric reflectometry evaluation (FIRE), which utilizes two constructed indices-normalized available observation time and normalized sampling deficiency-to assess the suitability of GNSS sites for sea-level retrieval. Implemented in Hong Kong, China, the strategy was applied to all 19 sites within the local reference GNSS network. In addition to the two sites previously used, we identified five additional sites conducive to tidal GNSS-IR, demonstrating precisions between 0.07 m and 0.37 m and correlations ranging from 0.986 to 0.711. With denser GNSS-IR observations, we were able to map sea-level variations during three historic typhoon storm surges in the region more precisely: 2017 Typhoon Hato, 2018 Typhoon Mangkhut, and 2023 Typhoon Saola. Typhoon Saola presented a longer duration of six days and a slightly lower sea-level peak between 2.88 m and 3.13 m. The deployment of additional tidal GNSS-IR sites revealed variations in sea levels during typhoon storm surges, with differences influenced by coastline topography of up to 1.24 m observed during Typhoon Mangkhut. These sites offer a valuable supplement to traditional tide measurements, filling gaps in historical records. The FIRE strategy demonstrates the untapped potential of existing GNSS networks globally for sea-level monitoring and can be employed to unlock further observational opportunities.

AB  - To provide the most comprehensive picture of species phylogeny and phylogeography of European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), we analyzed mtDNA control region (610 bp) of 1469 samples of roe deer from Central and Eastern Europe and included into the analyses additional 1541 mtDNA sequences from GenBank from other regions of the continent. We detected two mtDNA lineages of the species: European and Siberian (an introgression of C. pygargus mtDNA into C. capreolus). The Siberian lineage was most frequent in the eastern part of the continent and declined toward Central Europe. The European lineage contained three clades (Central, Eastern, and Western) composed of several haplogroups, many of which were separated in space. The Western clade appeared to have a discontinuous range from Portugal to Russia. Most of the haplogroups in the Central and the Eastern clades were under expansion during the Weichselian glacial period before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), while the expansion time of the Western clade overlapped with the Eemian interglacial. The high genetic diversity of extant roe deer is the result of their survival during the LGM probably in a large, contiguous range spanning from the Iberian Peninsula to the Caucasus Mts and in two northern refugia.

AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions imperil humans, wildlife, and property. Collisions with moose (Alces alces) are especially consequential and there are indications they may increase during severe winters. We tested hypotheses regarding the influence of moose movements and vehicular traffic patterns on collision risk. We first modeled daily snow depth and accumulation across 5.6 million km(2) of the North American Arctic-Boreal region. Next, we analyzed the movements and road use of 113 GPS-collared moose in response to snow depth. Finally, we examined the influence of these snow properties on vehicular traffic and 7680 moose-vehicle collisions. As winter progressed and the snowpack deepened in each study area, GPS-collared moose migrated to lower elevations, leading them into areas with shallower snow but higher road densities. This elevational migration corresponded with a higher probability of road-use by moose (by up to ten-fold) in winter than in summer. Corresponding to these patterns, moose-vehicle collisions were 2.4-5.7 times more frequent from December through February (compared to early summer). Collision risk was highest when and where snow depth was less than 120 cm, indicating that migration into areas with shallower snow increased collision risk in those areas. Most (82%) moose-vehicle collisions occurred after dark. This pattern was strongest during winter, when nighttime traffic volumes were eight times higher than summer due to longer nights. Overall, our findings suggest that concurrent seasonal changes in human and wildlife behavior increase the frequency of moose-vehicle collisions during winter. Snow depth influences collisions primarily through its impacts on moose movement, while strong seasonal changes in daylight hours cause an increase in nighttime traffic that further contributes to risk. This information may help predict times and places where risk of moose-vehicle collisions are highest and to develop seasonally dynamic mitigation strategies.

AB  - BackgroundFamily ranches are major sources of livestock-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in global pastoral ecosystems. We conducted semi-structured interviews and collected data on livestock production and the livelihoods of 235 family ranches in a desert steppe of Inner Mongolia where intensive pastoral management is practiced. A cradle-to-farmgate life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed with functional units standardized as 1 kg live weight (LW) for beef cattle and meat sheep breeds. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to elucidate the socioeconomic forcing mechanisms on GHG emissions.ResultsLive weight GHG emission varied substantially by livestock type, descending from cows (59.89 kg CO2e/kg) to yearlings (36.32 kg CO2e/kg), bulls (22.26 kg CO2e/kg), calves (20.92 kg CO2e/kg) and meat sheep breeds (19.66 kg CO2e/kg), and GHG emissions from livestock production accounted 77.95% of the total GHG emissions of the family ranches, more than three times those from household life consumption (22.05%). Enteric fermentation in livestock was the dominant GHG emission source (68.15%), followed by food consumption (8.58%) and coal combustion (8.13%). Among demographic characteristics, economic status appears the primary factor influencing the total GHG emission.ConclusionsOur micro-scale analysis provides insight for addressing GHG mitigation in pastoral systems through coupling the socioeconomic forcing mechanisms on methane emissions. We advocate the use of methane-inhibiting feed additives and shifts toward heating systems that use renewable energy while sustaining pastoral life, offering actionable pathways for low-carbon transition in extensively grazed pastoral systems.

AB  - In polygynous species, secondary sexual traits such as weapons or elaborate ornaments have evolved through intrasexual competition for mates. In some species, these traits are present in both sexes but are underdeveloped in the sex facing lower intrasexual competition for mates. It is often assumed that these underdeveloped sexually selected traits are a vestige of strong sexual selection on the other sex. Here, we challenge this assumption and investigate whether the expression of secondary sexual traits is associated with fitness in female bighorn sheep. Analyses of 45 years of data revealed that female horn length at 2 years, while accounting for mass and environmental variables, is associated with younger age at primiparity, younger age of first offspring weaned, greater reproductive lifespan and higher lifetime reproductive success. There was no association between horn length and fecundity. These findings highlight a potential conservation issue. In this population, trophy hunting selects against males with fast-growing horns. Intersexual genetic correlations imply that intense selective hunting of large-horned males before they can reproduce can decrease female horn size. Therefore, intense trophy hunting of males based on horn size could reduce female reproductive performance through the associations identified here, and ultimately reduce population growth and viability.

AB  - Herbicides are used as management tools to improve habitat for native plants and animals, but their application may also have harmful effects on the native community. The federally threatened Oregon silverspot butterfly (Speyeria = Argynnis zerene hippolyta) resides in remnant native grasslands along the Pacific Northwest coast. However, like many grasslands, many of these areas have high incidences of invasive plants, such as false dandelion (Hypochaeris radicata) and velvet grass (Holcus lanatus). These and other invasive plants severely limit the abundance of the Oregon silverspot's larval host plant, the early blue violet (Viola adunca). Selective herbicides, such as clopyralid and fluazifop-P-butyl, can reduce invasive plant abundance. However, non-target effects of these herbicides, and of adjuvants applied with these herbicides, on Oregon silverspots are unknown. In our study, we applied herbicides and adjuvants to host plants and Zerene silverspot (S. z. zerene) larvae, a subspecies closely related to Oregon silverspots. Responses in silverspot larvae measured in two experiments included survival, sex ratio, development time, mass, morphology, fecundity, and behavior. Our results suggest that negative effects of herbicides, clopyralid and fluazifop-P-butyl, and adjuvants, Agri-Dex(R) and Nu-Film(R)-IR, are limited. However, we detected weak effects from clopyralid and fluazifop-P-butyl with and without Agri-Dex(R) on larval and pupal development time and pupal mass. Implications for insect conservation Our study contributes to the growing literature on non-target effects of herbicides on butterflies, which suggests that butterfly responses are species- and chemical-specific. For Speyeria species, our results indicate that the risks posed by the herbicides we examined are low. In management settings where herbicides are used to combat invasive species posing a conservation threat to native communities, monitoring the direct and indirect effects of herbicides on Oregon silverspots or other Speyeria butterflies will shed additional light on the risk-benefit tradeoffs.

AB  - Acute anomalous ocean warming events, including marine heatwaves (MHWs), have significant effects on reproduction and survival of piscivorous seabirds. Additionally, MHWs have negative effects on seabird fish prey, exacerbating these consequences and resulting in population implications for seabirds. We evaluated the relative body condition of Pacific sand lance Ammodytes personatus, an important seabird forage species, in Haro Strait, a highly productive region of southern British Columbia, Canada. We compared body condition and length of fish cohorts that experienced the 2016 MHW year (MHW cohorts) with fish hatched during 3 subsequent post MHW years (2017-2019). Age-0 MHW cohorts had a seasonal decline in body condition in age-0 fish from 100% in the summer to 81% in the winter, while age-1 fish showed a decline from summer-fall highs of 93.5% to wintertime low of 79.5%. In comparison, post MHW cohorts had a winter body condition that was 2-4 times higher than their MHW cohorts. Similar to previous studies in Alaska during the MHW, age-1 fish failed to grow and reach the typical size that distinguishes them from age-0 fish. Poor sand lance condition and growth in winter may explain the ramifications of a warming ocean for top predators, including seabirds and Pacific salmon, which depend on these prey fish in Haro Strait. Our results support the idea that Haro Strait, which is influenced by estuarine circulation resulting in cooler temperatures than surrounding areas, serves as a climate refugium for sand lance populations in summer and provides buffering capacity to ocean climate warming events.

AB  - Ancient Pu'er tea trees (Camellia sinensis var. assamica (J. W. Mast.) Kitam.) are an important ecological resource with high economic value. Knowledge of the environmental variables shaping the original distribution and the effects of climate change on the future potential distribution of these trees, as well as the identification of sustainable management approaches, is essential for ensuring their future health and production. Here, we used 28 current environmental variables and the future climate data to model the suitable areas for ancient Pu'er tea trees. We also compared the health of these ancient trees in areas under different local management strategies. The results suggested the general distribution is likely to remain stable, but there are environmentally suitable areas outside its current habitats. To achieve more sustainable management, the main areas in which the management of poorly-managed trees can be improved include learning from managers of well-managed trees and following the common technical management regulations stipulated by the local government. The suitable value ranges for environmental factors, potentially suitable areas under climate change, and assessment of management approaches will aid the future cultivation and transplantation of ancient Pu'er tea trees. The methodology includes management-level analysis and provides practical insights that could be applied to regions outside the most suitable areas identified.

AB  - The severity of parasitic infections can mediate the differential expression of signals among populations, creating variation in signal intensity. Male signals (patch size and brightness) were quantified in Florida scrub lizards (Sceloporus woodi) from populations that vary in ectoparasite load. Males without mites were caught before breeding and exhibited different correlations among body size, patch size, and brightness. Males with ectoparasites (range = 1-368) were captured throughout the breeding season and showed a habitat-dependent pattern of how ectoparasite load, body size, and body condition were correlated with badge characteristics. In the sand pine scrub habitat, large males in good condition that were heavily parasitized had the largest badges. There was no relationship between body size or ectoparasite load and badge darkness. Lizards from longleaf pine habitat shared only one pattern, i.e. larger males had larger badges, yet there were several key differences. Body condition and ectoparasite load were unrelated to badge size, and the most heavily parasitized males had the brightest, not darkest, badges. Instead, males with moderate and low parasite loads had the darkest abdomens, and those with low parasite loads had the darkest throats. Thus, parasite load and body condition have habitat-dependent effects on badge characteristics.

Free roaming ponies have a prominent ecological role in many Atlantic landscapes, where different habitats with conservation interest are linked to ponies' occurrence. The traditional management of wild ponies, which implies minimum human intervention, is declining in Galicia, NW Spain. Changes in the management regimes include the confinement of ponies in fenced areas, the use of improved pastures (IPs) and rotation between fields. Indirect effects of these changes are expected on the ecological condition of important habitats for conservation such as dry and wet heathlands and bogs. We studied social structure, spatial ecology and habitat use in 29 mares fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars and field observations in two areas of Galicia dominated by wet heaths and blanket bogs (Xistral), and dry heaths (Sabucedo). We used spatial location and field observations to identify each band, and calculated band size, sex ratio, home range (HR) and core areas size and overlap, and habitat use. We addressed differences and adjusted Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for these variables as functions of the type of management: free roaming vs rotation, use of IPs, fencing, and available ranging area. Larger bands were found in smaller commons, fenced and with rotation management. Home ranges, but not core area, varied as a function of the available ranging area. Bands overlap more on fenced areas with rotation management. Increasing management may concentrate grazing pressure by reducing HR and increasing bands overlapping areas, and this may have a long-term effect on habitat quality and conservation.

AB  - This account provides information on all aspects of the biology of Neottia nidus-avis (L.) Rich. (Bird's-nest Orchid) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, reproductive characteristics, herbivory, history and conservation. Neottia nidus-avis is a native mycoheterotrophic orchid; it is found most frequently in the deep humus of densely shaded beech woodlands, on limestone or chalky soils in the British Isles. The species extends throughout temperate Eurasia. Neottia nidus-avis is a perennial, mostly monocarpic herb with mixed mode of reproduction and many adaptations to autogamy. The perennating organ is a short rhizome; vegetative reproduction by rhizome branching or root-sprouting is rather infrequent. Because of its achlorophyllous nature, N. nidus-avis is entirely dependent on its mycorrhizal basidiomycetes from the family Sebacinaceae for nutrition. Plastid genome of N. nidus-avis has been reduced as a result of the relaxation of functional constraints on photosynthesis as in other mycoheterotrophic plants. Despite this, the plant has retained all enzymes to produce chlorophyll as well as some photoprotective metabolites, such as zeaxanthin and tocopherol, whose function in the mycoheterotrophic plant remains unresolved. The species flowers from May to June, depending on latitude and altitude. The flowers emit a sweet scent and produce little nectar. They may be pollinated by flies, crawling thrips and ants but self-pollination is presumed to be the main mode of reproduction. Between 75% and 97% of open flowers set fruits. Neottia nidus-avis is classified as Vulnerable in Great Britain. The species is scattered throughout much of the British Isles, but it is very scarce except in southern England, where it is locally abundant. The main threats are deforestation, changes in woodland management and coniferization.

AB  - Wild boars can cause crop damage and are vectors causing infectious diseases. Thus, population management is essential to mitigate the damage. Because home range and habitat selection is important for the management of target species, accurate spatial data would provide valuable information to establish population management scheme. In this study, we investigated the home range and habitat selection of wild boars and aimed to help implement effective population management. We captured seven wild boars in central Gifu Prefecture, Japan, and monitored each individual from October 2020 to June 2022. We calculated the home range size and investigated environmental characteristics during daytime and nighttime. The home range sizes estimated from the minimum convex polygon method ranged from 0.32 to 28.51 km(2). Moreover, wild boars avoided anthropogenic environments during the daytime and selectively used areas in the cropland category during the nighttime. Therefore, wild boars had narrow home ranges depending on the anthropogenic environments. Consequently, wildlife managers could reduce agricultural damage caused by wild boars by managing bamboo forests and abandoned cultivated lands in the rural landscape. For infectious diseases, moreover, they should implement countermeasures against wild boars around areas where infectious diseases are endemic.

AB  - A survey and characterization of entomogenous galls and their associated fauna were carried out in six remnants of Caatinga in the Northern Depressao Sertaneja, in the states of Paraiba, Rio Grande do Norte and Ceara. We identified 41 gall morphotypes in 24 plant species, belonging to 12 botanical families. Fabaceae had 29.2% (n = 12) of the total number of gall morphotypes found. Leaves (61%) and stems (25%) were the most attacked organs. Most morphotypes are glabrous (75.6%), while only 24.4% exhibit trichomes. Most galls were induced by insects of the Cecidomyiidae family. The associated fauna comprised successors, cecidophages, tenants, and parasitoids. Sucessors were found in four morphotypes of galls and included spiders and four orders of insects: Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera (Formicidae). The tenants were represented by Tanaostigmoides (Tanaostigmatidae). The parasitoids, found in 18 morphotypes (43.9%), were represented by six families of Hymenoptera. We recorded the occurrence of new types of galls in 12 species of host plants. These gall records are new references for the Northern Depressao Sertaneja in the studied states.

AB  - An understanding of individual variation in animal habitat selection is important for effective conservation and management as well as predicting species responses to a rapidly changing world. Functional responses to habitat availability can explain some of this variation, but not accounting for behavioral grouping may oversimplify inference and mask the diversity of habitat use strategies present in a population. We investigated within-home range habitat selection variation at the group level in a reintroduced population of elk (Cervus canadensis) in Kentucky, USA, during 2020-2022, analyzing satellite tracking data from 103 individuals to quantify variance in responses to seven landscape variables. We used group-level selection coefficients estimated with mixed-effects resource selection functions to model population-level functional responses and classify groups into within-season behavioral clusters. We then used cross validation to assess if these methods of generalizing group-level variation improved predictions of space use. We found that elk had highly variable responses to several covariates, and that some of this variation could be attributed to functional responses to either cover type availability or configuration. When we generalized behavioral tactics via clustering, we found significant increases in group-level predictive ability over the global model and, in some cases, the functional models. This suggests that clustered behaviors are also driving individual heterogeneity in this population. Our results highlight the importance of considering individual differences when studying wildlife-habitat relationships and underscore the need for a more complete understanding of the mechanisms behind this variation to inform habitat management and conservation efforts.

AB  - The context-depency of biological invasions makes it difficult to understand why some species become succesfull invaders and others not. Such understanding requires studying closely-related invasive and non-invasive alien taxa sharing the same introduction history in the same environment. We identified this unusual situation in Kenya where the individuals that founded invasive Prosopis juliflora and non-invasive P. pallida populations are still present in original plantations. We evaluated field-measured traits, conducted glasshouse experiments simulating different nitrogen and water availability treatments, and did reciprocal transplants to compare functional traits and plasticity between the founders of both species (i.e. 'invasive-non-invasive congeners' comparison), and between P. juliflora individuals from plantations and invaded sites (i.e. testing for rapid evolution during invasion). We found that planted individuals of P. julifora and P. pallida differed in a number of key traits related to performance and spread (root:shoot ratio, number of stems and susceptibility to seed damage) as well as in levels of phenotypic plasticity in growth responses to resource availability, which may explain their differential invasiveness. Offspring of invasive P. juliflora individuals had higher seed mass and production, germination, survival, produced more stems, matured earlier and had higher plasticity compared with those of founder individuals, indicative of rapid post-introduction evolution. By using this exceptional study system, we show that differences in values of only a few key traits, increased phenotypic plasticity and post-introduction evolution have all contributed to the success of P. juliflora as an invasive species in Kenya.

AB  - Trait-based approaches to paleoenvironmental reconstructions offer a powerful framework for inferring past climates and environments. While analytical methods have advanced empirically, their evolutionary-theoretical basis is rarely explicitly incorporated into methodological developments. Here, we integrate trait-based palaeoecological modelling with the Law of Energy Equivalence that follows from the Red Queen's hypothesis to refine how community-weighted trait means are computed. Using traits from present-day large herbivorous mammalian communities, we test four methods of weighting community trait means-by species, relative abundance, biomass, and energy intake to predict annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, and terrestrial net primary productivity at the continental scale. Our results show that energy intake-weighted traits provide the most accurate predictions in most environments in line with theoretical expectations, closely followed by species-weighted mean traits, while relative abundance-weighted traits perform best in climatically extreme sites. Refining trait-based methodologies for paleoenvironmental reconstructions contributes to a broader understanding of ecosystem dynamics across time.

AB  - Simple Summary Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal prion illness that affects deer, elk, moose, and other animals in the cervid family. One way to identify areas contaminated by CWD is to use detection dog-handler teams trained to find fecal matter from CWD-positive cervids. In this case, dogs are trained on white-tailed deer fecal matter. However, fecal matter from CWD-positive deer contains the infectious proteins (prions) that can spread CWD. Using this fecal matter as a training aid for these dogs can be risky, as it can contaminate soil in the training area and potentially infect other deer that come into contact with the prions. One solution is to use training aids that can replicate the odor of fecal matter from CWD-positive and CWD-negative deer but that do not contain prions; these would be safe to use in the environment. This study examined different materials, incubation times, and incubation temperatures for training aids to identify the aid that both maximizes the dogs' detection performance and is practical to use. Based on these criteria, the best-performing aid was made of cotton and was incubated with fecal matter from CWD-positive deer for 24 h at 21 degrees C.Abstract Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a highly infectious, fatal prion disease that affects cervid species. One promising method for CWD surveillance is the use of detection dog-handler teams wherein dogs are trained on the volatile organic compound signature of CWD fecal matter. However, using fecal matter from CWD-positive deer poses a biohazard risk; CWD prions can bind to soil particles and remain infectious in contaminated areas for extended periods of time, and it is very difficult to decontaminate the affected areas. One solution is to use noninfectious training aids that can replicate the odor of fecal matter from CWD-positive and CWD-negative deer and are safe to use in the environment. Trained CWD detection dogs' sensitivity and specificity for different training aid materials (cotton, GetXent tubes, and polydimethylsiloxane, or PDMS) incubated with fecal matter from CWD-positive and CWD-negative deer at two different temperatures (21 degrees C and 37 degrees C) for three different lengths of time (6 h, 24 h, and 48 h) were evaluated. Cotton incubated at 21 degrees C for 24 h was identified as the best aid for CWD based on the dogs' performance and practical needs for training aid creation. Implications for CWD detection training and for training aid selection in general are discussed.

AB  - Invasive subterranean termite species within the genus Coptotermes (Heterotermitidae) are important structural pests. However, they also cause extensive damage in live trees and pose serious risks to tree health as a result. The urban tree canopy in areas with established populations of Coptotermes are therefore at risk of loss of trees over time, and many urban forests within municipality parks in their introduced range may experience tangible canopy alteration. This can have wide-reaching negative impacts on the ecology of these parks and to the public that utilize them. This 5-yr long study utilized eight parks (1,304 trees) to demonstrate how a simple visual monitoring/bait approach can identify and eliminate termite colonies infesting trees and maintain minimal termite activity within public green spaces. Here, we demonstrate that the systematic direct application of an experimental above-ground chitin synthesis inhibitor (CSI) bait formulation to trees can eliminate termite activity and protect trees. However, owing to high termite pressure, colony reinfestation is likely over time, and municipalities may have to establish perennial programs that would include regular monitoring and treatment as needed. Such a long-term strategy would minimize tree loss, while using a termite-specific formulated pesticide with a low amount of active ingredient. This pilot study demonstrates that it can be achieved, but ultimately, the success of this approach relies on technically competent staff that can readily identify the signs of active Coptotermes infestation in trees and access to above ground CSI bait formulations.

AB  - The Nitrogen Footprint (N-Footprint) is the total amount of reactive nitrogen (Nr) released to the environment as a result of an entity's consumption patterns. N-Footprint assessments have mainly been consumer-oriented and country-sized, although concern has recently focused on single products, especially particular foods. While traditionally obtained from several software and/or calculators, the N-Footprint is here proposed to be evaluated by combining the Life Cycle (LCA) approach with a specific N based impact assessment modelling, as derived from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guidelines. The theoretical procedure is then applied to a real livestock case study (the Mora Romagnola pig that provides high quality pork), mainly based on primary data. The total amount of Nr released was about 40 kg per pig (live weight), mainly due to direct components (i.e. manure management - 85%). The results highlight the importance of more comprehensive and systematic quantification of emissions, especially direct ones that are neglected in the classical database and software. The Virtual N-Factor (VNF) was 2.3, which indicates that about 30% of N input by weight is incorporated in the meat, while most of it (-70%) is dispersed to different environmental compartments (38% atmosphere, 35% soil, 27% water). A comparative analysis to check the reliability of outcomes and the robustness of the accounting procedure is also offered and show that these results are consistent with those reported in the literature for other pork products. The main benefit of this procedure is that it produces a unique aggregate result of the entity of human pressure on nitrogen cycle. This ensures a high comparability for results, transparency, and reproducibility of the method.

AB  - Recent oligotrophication in Lake Michigan has contributed to reduced biomass of spring zooplankton and a shift in the zooplankton assemblage toward more calanoid copepods. These changes have likely altered prey availability for first feeding native fish species that hatch in early spring. While spring zooplankton densities and assemblage compositions are routinely monitored in offshore areas of Lake Michigan, zooplankton in nearshore areas such as shallow beach environments are less studied; and associated descriptions of diet characteristics among larval coregonine species are limited. In this study, we a) describe the nearshore (<1 m depth) zooplankton assemblage at four sites in northeastern Lake Michigan during early spring 2015-2019 and b) compare diets and diet selectivity of larval lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and Cisco (C. artedi). Zooplankton composition varied among years, but calanoid copepods and copepod nauplii consistently dominated the zooplankton assemblage. Cisco and lake whitefish larvae were captured regularly, with Elk Rapids containing the highest proportion of ciscoes each year. For both species, calanoid and cyclopoid copepods were common in diets and were positively selected as prey. Although previous research has indicated high consumption of cyclopoid copepods by larval coregonines, our results provide new evidence that larval lake whitefish and Cisco in northeastern Lake Michigan will also consume and select for calanoid copepods when they are abundant. As such, should calanoid zooplankton continue to dominate the copepod community in Lake Michigan, larval coregonines appear capable of exploiting this abundant prey resource to improve their likelihood of survival to later life stages.

AB  - The Chapopote Knoll at 3200 m depth, in the southern Gulf of Mexico harbors highly diverse benthic habitats, including massive asphalt flows and surficial gas hydrates with gas seepage. Its associated benthic megafauna includes endemic cold-seep species and background species. This study describes the benthic habitat preferences, distribution patterns and diets of three crustacean species, the caridean shrimp Alvinocaris muricola and the galatheids Munidopsis geyeri and M. exuta. High-resolution imaging recorded eight habitats and helped depict their spatial distributions. A. muricola aggregates on Siboglinidae clusters and in gas seepage sites. M. geyeri and M. exuta are less selective and occur in almost all habitats. The carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen (delta 15N) values of A. muricola show a nutritional preference of bacteria from mats and water column detritus retained among the Sibolindiae, whereas the two Munidopsis species have wider spectrum diets. Gut content analysis in all three species, validate the stable isotope values, food sources and confirm the secondary consumer's trophic level. This study recognizes coexistence of A. muricola and the two Munidopsis species in the benthic habitats while using different resources. Compound specific isotope analyses of galatheid guts revealed females to have more 13C-depleted lipids (-35 parts per thousand) compared to males (-28 parts per thousand), calling for more detailed analyses to clarify this trophic segregation.

AB  - The ACCOBAMS Survey Initiative (ASI) is the first synoptic large-scale survey of the entire ACCOBAMS Area and as such it plays a key role in filling the current gaps in our biological and ecological knowledge of large vertebrate species occurring in the region. Data gathered during the ASI were analyzed in a distance sampling surface-modelling framework to assess the summer distribution, densities and patterns, as well as to investigate the correlates of these parameters, for large vertebrate species and taxa in the Mediterranean Basin. Static and dynamic explanatory variables, including water depth (m), distance to depth contours (km), distance to canyons and seabed slope (km), sea surface temperature (degrees C), mixed layer depth (m) and levels of chlorophyll-a (mg/l), were considered to predict density and compute its variance spatially at a resolution of 10x10 km. A strong longitudinal gradient from low densities in the east to high densities in the west is shared by most taxa. In addition, several taxa also showed a less marked latitudinal gradient varying in direction according to species, and finally, a few of them exhibited patchy distributions.

AB  - Eliminating supplemental feeding is a common regulatory action within chronic wasting disease (CWD) management zones. These regulations target the potential for increased animal-animal contact and environmental contamination with CWD prions. Prions, the causative agent of CWD, have been detected on feeder surfaces in CWD-positive, captive deer facilities but not among free-ranging populations, and information on the relative risk of transmission at anthropogenic and natural food sources is limited. In this study, we established and maintained 13 gravity feeders from September 2022 to March 2023 in a CWD zone in northern Mississippi, USA (apparent prevalence similar to 30%). We set up feeders up in 3 ways: no exclusion (deer feeders, n = 7), exclusion of deer using fencing with holes cut at the ground-level to permit smaller wildlife to enter (raccoon feeders, n = 3), and environmental control feeders, which were fully fenced and not filled with feed (control feeders, n = 3). We swabbed feeder spouts at setup and at 4 intervals approximately 6 weeks apart to test for prion contamination via real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). We detected prions 12 weeks after setup on all deer and raccoon feeders. We compared relative transmission risk using camera traps at these feeders, 6 agronomic plantings for wildlife forage (i.e., food plots), and 7 oak mast trees. Weekly visitation rate by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter: deer) differed (P = 0.02) among deer feeders (median = 24.5 deer/week, range = 15.6-65.7), food plots (median = 12.7, range = 3.8-24.7), and mast trees (median = 2.0, range = 0.4-5.1). Contact rates between individual deer also differed between site types (P < 0.01): deer feeders (median = 2.1 deer-to-deer contacts/week, range = 0-10.1), food plots (median = 0.1, range = 0-4.0), and mast trees (median = 0, range = 0-0.3). Raccoons also visited feeders at greater rates than food plots and mast trees (P < 0.04). Finally, we swabbed 19 feeders in 2 areas where CWD was newly detected, finding prion contamination on swabs from 4 feeders. We show that deer feeders in free-ranging populations with high CWD prevalence become contaminated with CWD prions quickly, becoming a potential site of exposure of deer to CWD prions. Our results also demonstrate the ability to find evidence of prion contamination on deer feeders, even in areas where CWD is newly detected.

AB  - The Min pig is indigenous to China. The genetic background of this breed was previously unclear, limiting the utility of the Min pig. In this study, the whole genomes of ten Min pigs and four Northeast wild boars were sequenced and the analysis yielded 8,988,338 non-redundant SNPs plus 1,231,680 InDels. A phylogenetic tree was constructed and a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed based on previously published SNP data from 66 individual pigs. Both analyses indicated the Min pig fell between the European and Asian pigs, while the Northeast wild boar was closely related to the Asian domestic and wild pig breeds. Selective sweep analysis indicated that 181 genes in the Min pig genome had been subjected to selection, including several genes encoding zinc finger proteins. Additional genes associated with myokinesis and lipid metabolism were also identified as under selection. Only SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) interactions in the vesicular transport pathway were identified as under selection (P=0.0029). This study describes the genomic framework of the Min pig and identifies signatures of selection. These results provide a useful genomic background for further studies of the genetic mechanisms associated with important economic traits in the Min pig.

AB  - Cover crops are increasingly used for biogas production, a renewable energy source, without competing for food production. The behavior of the resulting digestates after soil application is poorly understood, which prevents their efficient recycling in agriculture and the environmental assessment of their application. The objective of this study was to quantify the nitrogen availability and potential carbon storage of cover crop-issued digestates after soil application. A total of 10 raw digestates, 2 liquid phases, and 3 solid phases after phase separation were sampled. Main cover crops used in the sampled biogas plants were winter barley, rye, and maize. Classical physicochemical analyses and laboratory incubations to study their C and N mineralization were conducted. Despite a moderate C mineralization of raw and liquid digestates after 91 days, their initial limited carbon content induced, in the end, a low contribution to soil organic carbon (13 and 11 kg remaining C Mg-1 FM, respectively), similar to a pig slurry and much lower than a bovine manure. With a higher initial carbon content and lower C mineralization, the contribution of solid digestates to carbon storage could be higher if applied at a sufficient rate. Organic N mineralization of raw and liquid digestates was moderate, but their N availability was high (3 and 4 kg available N Mg-1 FM, respectively), thanks to their mineral nitrogen contents, similar again to a pig slurry. In contrast, that of solid digestate was almost null with a very low mineral N content and no organic N mineralization. Finally, all the digestates also brought significant amounts of P and K.

AB  - In Central Poland, in the conditions of ASF threat, in January 2019, a series of battues was organised to reduce the wild boar population. Hunting took place in a typical Central European landscape of a mosaic of vast arable fields, fallow lands, wet reed beds and small forests ranging in size from a few to several hundred hectares. Battues were used to reduce wild boar quickly and drastically in the area directly adjacent to places with confirmed cases of ASF. Hunting organised at the same time took place on 29 neighboring hunting grounds with a total area of 150,000 ha. Usually, a few hunters with beaters led areas from a few to over 100 ha. Due to limitations in the availability of a reliable wild boar census method, it was assumed that during subsequent battues, the number of recorded and/or shot wild boars would consistently decrease because of previous hunts. 563 drives with a total area of about 20,000 ha resulted in the shooting of only 69 wild boars out of 359 counted during hunting. It was found that neither the average wild boar density recorded in the drives, nor the average number of animals shot per 100 ha drives decreased significantly between successive battues. The level of exploitation of the population expressed by the % of group reduction, was at a low level of about 30%, which does not guarantee population reduction. Battues as a traditional hunting technique, but also invasive method are not an effective and should not be used to reduce the wild boar population under ASF threat conditions in rural landscapes. What's more, their negative effects, e.g . dispersion of wild boar from areas covered by ASF, may outweigh the dubious benefits. The question about the effective and at the same time the least controversial method of wild boar depopulation from the social point of view remains open.

AB  - Stable isotope analysis is a tool used to provide information on species' ecology, including diet, trophic interactions, and migration patterns. Among biological tissues, fecal samples have the advantage of being relatively easy to collect, supporting studies on rare, elusive, and threatened species. Nonetheless, fecal samples from mammalian herbivores present some confounding factors for isotopic analysis, such as being divided into pellets with a heterogeneous mix of plant matter, the influence of preservation methods, and their decomposition stage. To assess the effects of these confounding factors, using a forest ungulate (Subulo gouazoubira) as a biological model, we conducted three experiments to test whether (i) small fecal portions are representative of an entire fecal pile, and if (ii) preservation of samples in absolute ethanol and (iii) decomposition stage in the field affect stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic values. Portions (4 mm(3)) from the same fecal pellet and different pellets within the same fecal pile were found to be representative of the isotopic values from the entire pile. Preserving fecal samples with low-fat content in absolute ethanol over time proved to be an effective method, with no substantial change in isotopic values. However, older samples may present biased results, as decomposition was found to increase nitrogen values over time (adj. R-2 = 0.15; p < 0.001). Our experimental approach improves the reliability of using herbivore fecal samples in isotopic ecology studies. We recommend, however, replicating these experiments with other species in different environments and urge caution when using older, degraded material.

AB  - The biogeography of irruptive insect herbivores is determined by host availability and climate conditions. As such, outbreak distributions are sensitive to climatic change, especially across large latitudinal gradients. Here, we investigate the outbreak distributions of two understudied defoliators, hemlock sawfly Neodiprion tsugae (Hymenoptera) and western blackheaded budworm Acleris gloverana (Lepidoptera), that have both recently impacted the greatest land area recorded across the Pacific coastal temperate rainforest since the establishment of aerial survey programs. We compiled polygon-based estimates of insect damage collected by aerial observers, forest inventory, and downscaled climatic data to develop gridded estimates of bioclimatic conditions across the extent of the Pacific coastal temperate rainforest, including the continental United States, British Columbia and Alaska. We leveraged these data to develop ensemble machine learning models with the goal of predicting the outbreak distribution of each insect. In this manuscript we: 1) describe the historical patterns of defoliator outbreaks, 2) identify and describe climatic conditions associated with outbreaks in both species and 3) assess whether historic outbreaks have tracked geographic shifts in climate conditions across the region. We demonstrate that outbreaks of hemlock sawfly and western blackheaded budworm have been observed across the Pacific coastal temperature rainforests of North America in each decade since the establishment of the Canadian and United States aerial survey programs. The distribution of outbreaks by both insects were best explained by host availability, a limited range of spring, summer, and winter temperatures, and minimum precipitation. Finally, we demonstrate that outbreaks have tracked the poleward shift in suitable climate over the last century. This study establishes a baseline understanding of the climatic constraints and biogeographic patterns of historic sawfly and budworm outbreaks across the Pacific coastal temperate rainforest and emphasizes the overarching importance of climate in driving the irruptive dynamics of these defoliator species.Keywords: climate envelope, defoliators, hemlock sawfly, Pacific coastal temperate rainforest, population dynamics, western blackheaded budworm

AB  - Scavenging is an alternative foraging strategy to predation for many carnivore species, as they shift between predation and scavenging in response to changes in resource availability. The use of carrion may lead to interspecific competition and is thus influenced by a risk-reward trade-off to balance coexistence with guild-members, where smaller species are expected to be more vigilant due to their vulnerability to larger competitors. We used cameras to investigate the utilization of viscera from the annual moose Alces alces hunt by four sympatric carnivore species: wolf Canis lupus, wolverine Gulo gulo, red fox Vulpes vulpes and pine marten Martes martes in south-central Scandinavia, in relation to body size and habitat. Red foxes had highest probability of visiting viscera sites in both open and forested habitats. Visits by both red foxes and pine martens were longer in open habitats, while number of visits or activity did not differ between habitats. For pine martens, the probability of visiting viscera sites was twice as high in forest compared to open habitat; consequently, red foxes showed the highest overall use of viscera. Red foxes were most vigilant, especially in open habitat, whereas wolverines and pine martens spent a higher proportion of time feeding. Increased vigilance of red foxes facilitates extended resources use in open habitat, while for pine martens, the risk-reward decision occurs before leaving forest cover and entering open habitats. Viscera were not used to a large extent by wolves or wolverines. Wolves are generally less prone to scavenging and wolverines probably use other food resources, more suitable for caching. Overall, competition did not prevent use of viscera, probably due to small-scale temporal segregation and limited use by the larger carnivores. Consequently, this pulse of human-subsidized food resources before winter may have important implications for the smaller facultative scavengers.Keywords: carrion use, interspecific competition, pine marten, red fox, wolf, wolverine

AB  - The Himalayan forest communities historically lived in harmony with their environment; however, anthropogenic activities have disrupted this balance. Deforestation, climate change, and habitat degradation have heightened vulnerability, compounded by human-wildlife conflicts (HWCs) and limited access to crucial livelihood capitals. Addressing these challenges requires a deeper understanding of factors associated with householdlevel vulnerability, prompting this study in the Buxa Tiger Reserve of sub-Himalayan India. Data from 345 households across ten villages reveal significant exposure to HWCs, particularly elephant crop raiding and leopard-induced livestock losses. Sensitivity arises from water scarcity, health issues, food shortages, and inadequate housing conditions, while limited adaptive capacity stems from infrastructural and financial constraints, among others. Spatial disparities emerge, with tribal households exhibiting lower exposure but lesser adaptive capacity compared to non-tribal communities. Proximity to different facilities (e.g., markets, financial institutions, primary healthcare centers) and government schemes significantly influence vulnerability, revealing unexpected associations. Besides, villagers' willingness to relocate demonstrates higher adaptive capacity and perceived benefits outside the reserve. By unraveling the layers of vulnerability at the household level, this study provides valuable guidance for policymakers, forest managers, and other stakeholders. It offers insights into sustainable development strategies, resonating globally to harmonize human actions with environmental conservation.

AB  - Short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) are a cryptic and iconic monotreme found throughout the continent of Australia. Despite observational records spanning many years aggregated in national and state biodiversity databases, the spatial and temporal intensity of sightings is limited. Although the species is of least conservation concern at the global level, a subspecies has been declared endangered on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. We need better population data over the whole continent to inform this species' conservation management. To increase the temporal and spatial resolution of observations which may be used for more accurate population assessments, we developed a mobile app for citizen scientists to easily record echidna sightings and improve the quantity, quality and distribution of data collected for monitoring this species. EchidnaCSI is a free, cross-platform (Android & iOS), open-source app that we developed to collect echidna observational data around Australia. EchidnaCSI has been in use since September 2017 and uses mobile phone sensors to transparently and automatically record metadata, such as species observation location and time and GPS location precision. We examine differences in spatial coverage between these observations and those in existing data repositories in the Atlas of Living Australia and state biodiversity databases, especially in relation to observations in protected areas and to an index of remoteness and accessibility. EchidnaCSI has contributed over 8000 echidna observations from around Australia, more than recorded in all state systems combined, with similar spatial distribution. Although coverage was more limited in some protected areas than the reference data sources, numbers of observations in all remote areas were greater than the reference scientific data except for very remote regions. EchidnaCSI has improved the spatial and temporal intensity of observations for this iconic species and provides a complement to scientific surveys, which might usefully focus on highly protected areas and very remote regions.

AB  - In response to the severe fragmentation of Elkhorn coral, Acropora palmata (Lamarck, 1816), stands caused by a major winter swell ("Holy Swell") in March 2008, an emergency community-based low-tech restoration was initiated in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. Over a 15-year period, coral demographic performance and fish assemblages were monitored across four restored and four control (non-restored) 100 m2 plots. The restoration effort proved to be highly successful, leading to successful coral survival and growth, and to sustained recovery of fish assemblages, particularly herbivore guilds. Significantly increased abundance, biomass, and diversity were observed across all trophic functional groups, fishery target species, and geo-ecological functional groups in both restored and control plots. These positive outcomes were attributed to enhanced spatial complexity by long-term coral growth, "nutrient hotspots" within restored plots, the refugia effect from enhanced benthic spatial complexity, and the recovery of fish dispersal paths promoting spillover effects from restored to adjacent non-restored areas. Restoring herbivore guilds and geo-ecological functional groups played a crucial role in restoring vital ecological processes promoting reef ecosystem resilience. Recommendations include integrating fish assemblage recovery into coral restoration strategies, establishing natural coral nursery plots for future coral sourcing, and incorporating the concept of nursery seascapes for a holistic and ecosystem-based approach to restoration.

AB  - Conflicts arising from the consumption of anthropogenic foods by wildlife are increasing worldwide. Conventional tools for evaluating the spatial distribution pattern of large terrestrial mammals that consume anthropogenic foods have various limitations, despite their importance in management to mitigate conflicts. In this study, we examined the spatial distribution pattern of crop-foraging sika deer by performing nitrogen stable isotope analyses of bone collagen. We evaluated whether crop-foraging deer lived closer to agricultural crop fields during the winter and spring, when crop production decreases. We found that female deer in proximity to agricultural crop fields during the winter and spring were more likely to be crop-foraging individuals. Furthermore, the likelihood of crop consumption by females decreased by half as the distance to agricultural crop fields increased to 5-10 km. We did not detect a significant trend in the spatial distribution of crop-foraging male deer. The findings of spatial distribution patterns of crop-foraging female deer will be useful for the establishment of management areas, such as zonation, for efficient removal of them.

AB  - Simple Summary An extensive countrywide study in Greece revealed that isolation of the zoonotic pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Listeria ivanovii from the milk produced in sheep or goat farms was infrequent: 1.2% of farms sampled. The presence of pigs on the farms, low average relative humidity in the environment and a high number of animals on the farms were found to be associated with the isolations. Detailed assessment of the L. ivanovii strains, for which there is a paucity of information worldwide, revealed that the isolated strains belonged to the L. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii branch. All strains of the branch appeared to be very similar, with the distance between them being small, which suggests that global spread of this clonal branch is a recent evolutionary event or that the branch is characterized by a slow evolutionary rate. A cross-sectional study was performed in 325 sheep and 119 goat dairy farms in Greece. Samples of bulk-tank milk were examined by standard microbiological techniques for Listeria spp. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from one (0.3%) and Listeria ivanovii from three (0.9%) sheep farms. No associations between the isolation of L. monocytogenes or L. ivanovii and milk quality were found. No resistance to antibiotics was identified. Three variables emerged as significant predictors of isolation of the organism: the presence of pigs, low average relative humidity and a high number of ewes on the farm. The three L. ivanovii isolates were assessed in silico for identification of plasmids, prophages, antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factors, CRISPRs and CAS genes. Phylogenetic analysis using the core genome revealed that the three strains belonged to the L. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii branch and were especially close to the PAM 55 strain. All strains of the branch appeared to be very similar, with the distance between them being small.

AB  - Single-tree selection (STS) silviculture has dominated management of northern hardwood forests (NHFs) in the Great Lakes region since introduction the 1960's. Periodic partial cuttings are assumed to promote and recruit well-stocked natural regeneration, resulting in balanced uneven-aged stand structure with sustainable harvest volumes. However, low sapling density of tree species desirable for management, including typically dominant and economically valuable sugar maple (Acer saccharum), suggests STS may not be effectively recruiting sugar maple in some regions. Few studies have analyzed sugar maple size-age structure to determine whether recruitment failure has been chronic since partial cutting began or is a more recent phenomenon. Here, we analyzed sugar maple age structure, regional patterns, and possible drivers for 51 selection-managed NHF stands located in northern Michigan, USA. Our data were 1499 aged basal discs collected from stumps of sugar maple trees >5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) harvested winter 2017-2018. Our results offer little evidence to suggest that partial cuttings have promoted well-stocked ingrowth of sugar maple saplings. For most stands, age and diameter were non-linearly related, with a wide range of larger-diameter trees having similar ages. Among stands, sugar maple sawtimber (>24 cm DBH) averaged 106 years old and poletimber (11.4-24 cm DBH) 91 years, along with older than expected saplings (5-11.4 cm DBH) averaging 67 years. Most stands were dominated by a similar to 100-year-old upper canopy cohort, with a majority having <= 2 younger cohorts typically of low density and >50 years old. Areas with greater snow water equivalent and lower January minimum temperatures, where deer populations have been historically low, generally have younger sugar maple saplings. Low density and generally old age of smaller size classes led to much lower stocking of age classes <70 years old than expected under STS. Together, this suggests long-term STS management for sugar maple may be unsustainable over large portions of the study region if current trends in forest and deer management continue. Our age structure analysis supports the growing consensus that alternative management may be needed for NHF in parts of the Great Lakes region.

AB  - Plant enemies can indirectly affect pollinators by modifying plant traits, but simultaneous tests of herbivore and pathogen effects are lacking, and the role of floral volatiles has seldom been assessed.In this study, we tested for indirect effects of insect herbivores and pathogens on pollinator attraction via altered floral volatile emissions, and its consequences for plant fitness in Brassica rapa. Plants in the field were exposed to either no damage or damage by caterpillars (Mamestra brassicae), aphids (Brevicoryne brassicae), a leaf fungus (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), or a bacterium (Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris). We then recorded pollinator visits and measured floral traits (flower number, volatiles) and plant fitness-correlates. We additionally performed a greenhouse experiment with artificial floral emitters to test for effects of target volatiles on pollinator attraction.In the field experiments, relative to controls, plants subjected to herbivory by the aphid B. brassicae (but not those exposed to the other enemies) exhibited a marked reduction in the emission of two volatile organic compounds (nonanal and 2-butyl-1-octanol), experienced lower pollinator visits and produced seeds of lower quality in terms of seed biomass and germination rate, while flower output itself was not affected. Consistently, artificial emitters with reduced amounts of these volatile organic compounds were less attractive to pollinators under greenhouse conditions.Synthesis. These results provide strong evidence for volatile-mediated indirect interactions between plant enemies and pollinators ultimately impacting plant fitness, and further point at enemy and compound specificity in such effects.

AB  - Visual perception is dynamic and depends on physiological properties of a species' visual system and physical characteristics of the environment. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are most sensitive to short-and mid-wavelength light (e.g. blue and green). Wavelength enrichment varies spatially and temporally across the landscape. We assessed how the visual perception of deer influences their movement decisions. From August to September 2019, we recorded 10-min locations from 15 GPS-collared adult male deer in Central Florida. We used Hidden-Markov models to identify periods of movement by deer and subset these data into three time periods based on temporal changes in light environments. We modeled resource selection during movement using path-selection functions and simulated 10 available paths for every path used. We developed five a priori models and used 10-fold cross validation to assess our top model's performance for each time period. During the day, deer selected to move through woodland shade, avoided forest shade, and neither selected nor avoided small gaps. At twilight, deer avoided wetlands as cloud cover increased but neither selected nor avoided other cover types. Visual cues and signals are likely more conspicuous to deer in short-wavelength-enriched woodland shade during the day, while at twilight in long-wavelength-enriched wetlands during cloud cover, visual cues are likely less conspicuous. The nocturnal light environment did not influence resource selection and likely has little effect on deer movements because it's relatively homogenous. Our findings suggest visual perception relative to light environments is likely an underappreciated driver of behaviors and decision-making by an ungulate prey species.

AB  - The factors that enable the coexistence of closely related species remain a major question in ecology, particularly in human-disturbed habitats. The effects of anthropogenic disturbance and interspecific competition can exacerbate the decline in populations of competing species. The adoption of different strategies in responding to anthropogenic disturbances and competitive avoidances may create opportunities for competing species to coexist. However, few studies have explored how disturbance and competition interact to shape species coexistence. In this study, we conducted long-term and large-scale camera trap surveys comprising 540 sampling sites from 2017 to 2021 at Xishuangbanna, southwestern China, and deployed a spatiotemporal analysis framework to determine the effect of anthropogenic disturbances and competitive avoidances on the coexistence of three sympatric macaque species: Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis; MA), northern pig-tailed macaque (M. leonina; ML), and rhesus macaque (M. mulatta; MM). Macaque species exhibited diverse responses to different types of anthropogenic disturbances. The occurrence probability of MM was positively associated with distance to road and relative abundance of human occurrence, and negatively associated with distance to cropland, which reduces the likelihood of sympatry between MM and the other two species due to their opposing responses to road, cropland, and human occurrence. Conversely, the similar responses to road and cropland increase the sympatry between MA and ML. Three macaque species did not avoid each other through shifting space use or their overall daily activity pattern. However, they delayed using the shared site after other species used it to avoid confrontation. We provide evidence that (1) the spatial co-occurrence pattern of sympatric macaque species was determined by anthropogenic disturbances rather than by competitive spatial avoidance and (2) fine-scale temporary avoidance is the strategy to alleviate their interspecific competition. These results enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to species coexistence of nonhuman primates in human-disturbed habitats.

AB  - The gut microbiota plays a vital role in the physiological functions and health of animals. Domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and wild boars (Sus scrofa scrofa), which share a common ancestor, present a unique model for exploring the evolutionary changes in gut microbiota due to domestication. Comparing the gut microbiota of these two groups provides a unique opportunity to identify microorganisms that may have been lost or altered during domestication. This study employed 16S rRNA sequencing to compare the gut microbiota compositions of domestic pigs and wild boars, analyzing 69 fecal samples from both groups. Our results indicate significant differences in the taxonomic profiles of the gut microbiota between the two groups. Specifically, the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, were found in higher abundance in wild boars. In contrast, domestic pigs exhibited a decreased variety of these potentially health-enhancing bacteria, likely due to factors such as simplified diets and antibiotic use. Functional gene analysis revealed that pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, immune response, and environmental adaptability were more enriched in wild boars. These findings demonstrate significant differences in the gut microbiota composition between domestic pigs and wild boars, underscoring the impact of domestication on microbial diversity. Further research is necessary to explore the potential of transferring beneficial microbes from wild to domestic populations.

AB  - One of the biggest challenges in more accurately forecasting the effects of climate change on future food web dy-namics relates to how climate change affects multi-trophic species interactions, particularly when multiple interacting stressors are considered. Using a dynamic food web model, we investigate the individual and com-bined effect of ocean warming and acidification on changes in trophic interaction strengths (both direct and in-direct) and the consequent effects on biomass structure of food web functional groups. To do this, we mimicked a species-rich multi-trophic-level temperate shallow-water rocky reef food web and integrated empirical data from mesocosm experiments on altered species interactions under warming and acidification, into food-web models. We show that a low number of strong temperature-driven changes in direct trophic interactions (feeding and competition) will largely determine the magnitude of biomass change (either increase or decrease) of high-order consumers, with increasing consumer biomass suppressing that of prey species. Ocean acidifica-tion, in contrast, alters a large number of weak indirect interactions (e.g. cascading effects of increased or de-creased abundances of other groups), enabling a large increase in consumer and prey biomass. The positive effects of ocean acidification are driven by boosted primary productivity, with energy flowing up to higher trophic levels. We show that warming is a much stronger driver of positive as well as negative modifications of species biomass compared to ocean acidification. Warming affects a much smaller number of existing trophic interactions, though, with direct consumer-resource effects being more important than indirect effects. We conclude that the functional role of consumers in future food webs will be largely regulated by alterations in the strength of direct trophic interactions under ocean warming, with ensuing effects on the biomass structure of marine food webs.

AB  - Protected Natural Areas have traditionally been employed to preserve natural ecosystems, although in recent decades, Payment for Ecosystem Services schemes has been added to complement these initiatives. However, the endemic Temperate Forests are exposed to strong pressures due to anthropic activities such as urban growth and high water demand to supply one of the largest cities in central Mexico. Evidence from Mexico shows that PES programs have had a limited impact on conservation, as in their early years, payments were allocated in areas with low risk of environmental degradation, mainly within the Protected Natural Areas. This association has sparked debates about their effectiveness in conservation and the provision of ecosystem services. The spatial effectiveness of Protected Natural Areas and the Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) system in conserving Ecosystem Services was quantified in the central zone of Mexico, specifically in the area known as the 'Water Forest' (Bosque de Agua). The services of water provision and climate regulation were modeled using the InVEST software, while services related to agricultural food provision and timber were estimated based on the biomass stock coverage developed by the program for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Utilizing these estimations at the finest analytical unit (1 ha), hotspot models were generated for each Ecosystem Service. Subsequently, areas with high values of these services ('hotspots') were overlaid with Protected Natural Areas and zones under Payment for Ecosystem Services. The results highlight that the Water Forest is not only a water provider but also hosts other significant services that require more effective protection. 62% of the total area of the Bosque de Agua (160,356 ha.) presents hotspots for at least one of the four measured services. However, 19% (28,864 ha.) of the service hotspots are not protected by any conservation instrument. This underscores the importance of reviewing and adjusting existing conservation approaches to ensure the sustainability of these valuable services provided by nature.

AB  - The winter tick (Dermacentor albipictus (Packard, 1869); Acari: Ixodidae) significantly affects the health and productivity of North American moose (Alces alces (Linnaeus, 1758); Artiodactyla: Cervidae). Survival of off-host stages of Ixodid ticks depends on microclimate driven in part by extrinsic factors resulting from weather, such as temperature, humidity, drought, and floods. The impact of some of these abiotic factors is unclear for D. albipictus. The effect of water submergence on biological parameters of engorged, adult, females, and unfed larvae was assessed in the laboratory. Survival of adult females after submergence for 3 days was 88% with significant effects on their ability to oviposit. After 5 weeks, 63% of larvae (1-month-old) survived submergence in water, whereas survival of larvae (3-month-old) was reduced to 23% after 7 days. The off-host stages of D. albipictus have variable tolerance to periods of submergence that may influence the number of larvae available on the landscape for recruitment to moose in autumn.

AB  - Understanding the ecological and human factors that shape the loss of livestock to wild carnivores can help target conservation efforts. We used 5 years of livestock depredation records (2009-2013, n = 1147) alongside Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, to investigate how spatial patterns vary by carnivore and livestock species. Dominant patterns across all species and seasons included an increased likelihood of depredation closer to protected areas (core carnivore habitat) and in more open areas closer to human settlements (where livestock are most abundant). Lions were less likely than spotted hyenas to attack livestock further from protected areas, while goat and donkey depredation was more concentrated around homesteads compared to cattle depredation. Leopards were more likely than other predators to attack livestock in areas of higher human density and nearer water sources, likely reflecting their preference for goats and sheep which generally remain near homesteads unless taken to watering holes. Carnivores make trade-offs between attacking livestock where it is most available (near human settlements) and where the risk of detection and retaliation by humans is lower (nearer protected areas, in more wooded habitats, and further from human activity). These results have helped target local mitigation strategies. They may also inform human-wildlife conflict mitigation at other sites globally by highlighting the need to understand species-specific differences in conflict patterns and tailor solutions accordingly.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - In temperate forests within Europe, early-flushing (EF) deciduous trees are often heavily infested by early spring leaf-eating Lepidoptera, while late-flushing (LF) trees are better protected in a phenological manner against such heavy infestations, as spring moth larvae begin to appear before their bud burst. The associational effects of EF trees on LF ones are only poorly known. We studied whether or not the infestation of LF trees by spring Lepidoptera can be affected by EF ones if they grow in the immediate vicinity. We compared spring assemblages of leaf-eating larvae of Lepidoptera on LF Quercus cerris L. with those on EF Q. pubescens Willd. in several microhabitats in Slovakia, Central Europe. Larvae were collected from mature and young trees. Mature trees sampled were growing: (1) in a closed-canopy forest; (2) in small groups; or (3) as a lone tree. Forest and tree groups are both constituted by oak species. Tree groups and lone trees were 20-50 m distant from forest edges. Young trees were growing (1) under mature Q. pubescens trees in a forest or (2) as a lone tree within forest gaps or near the edges. In the closed-canopy forest where LF trees (Q. cerris) were surrounded by EF ones (Q. pubescens), the caterpillars on mature LF trees were in abundance, almost as on mature EF ones. The species composition of larval assemblages on the two oak species was similar. In contrast, on small groups and on lone trees, the lepidopteran larvae were significantly less abundant on LF trees than EF ones. In the case of young trees, the abundance of larvae and their composition assemblages on both oaks were comparable in the forest. In the open habitat, LF trees were less infested by larvae than EF ones and the assemblages of moth larvae differed between the two. Our results reveal the effect (associational susceptibility) of EF trees on LF ones when growing in a close vicinity. It means that the phenological protection of LF trees may not be sufficient if they grow close to or are surrounded by EF ones.

AB  - Biodiversity in the Mediterranean is undergoing a decline resulting in reduced ecosystem service provisions. Here we analysed the functional diversity of ground beetles in Mediterranean vineyards and olive orchards using species traits connected to their ecosystem services. Since previous studies showed that habitat type can affect ground beetle trait composition we hypothesized that the proportion of selected traits (body size, feeding preferences, and wing development) would be influenced by integrated pest management (IPM) and organic management (OM), and this would differ from unmanaged habitats. We analysed published data originating from vineyards and olive orchards in several Mediterranean countries with similar agricultural management practices, and for which ground beetles were sampled in a comparable way. We found that significantly more carnivorous species than herbivorous and omnivorous were present from unmanaged habitats compared to OM sites, while there were no significant differences between OM and IPM sites for ground beetles feeding preferences. The proportion of large brachypterous species was highest at unmanaged sites and lowest at IPM sites. Conversely, functional diversities in feeding preferences and size ranges were significantly lower at unmanaged sites. In Croatian sites only, medium-sized macropterous carnivores were the most abundant beetle fauna, with more predatory individuals found in OM sites. Overall, unmanaged habitats supported a higher proportion of carnivorous ground beetle species, while size and wing development were more variable among the sites.

AB  - Milk is a complex biological fluid that has high-quality proteins including growth factors and also contains extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are a lipid bilayer containing vesicles that contain proteins, metabolites and nucleic acids. Several studies have proposed that EVs in cow milk can survive the gut and can illicit cross-species communication in the consuming host organism. In this study, we isolated and characterized extracellular vesicles from the raw milk of the four species of the Bovidae family, namely cow, sheep, goat and buffalo, that contribute 99% of the total milk consumed globally. A comparative proteomic analysis of these vesicles was performed to pinpoint their potential functional role in health and disease. Vesicles sourced from buffalo and cow milk were particularly enriched with proteins implicated in modulating the immune system. Furthermore, functional studies were performed to determine the anti-cancer effects of these vesicles. The data obtained revealed that buffalo-milk-derived EVs induced significantly higher cell death in colon cancer cells. Overall, the results from this study highlight the potent immunoregulatory and anti-cancer nature of EVs derived from the milk of Bovidae family members.

AB  - The genus Diaeretellus is a small group of Aphidiinae wasps, comprising five species from the Palaearctic so far. All members of the genus are highly specialised to semi-aquatic habitats and aphid hosts and plants that occupy them. Because they have practically no economic importance as biocontrol agents, the biology of Diaeretellus species is still somewhat unknown. We describe a new species of this genus, Diaeretellus nymphaealis sp. nov., another member of aphid-parasitoid guilds from wetland habitats and the first species of the genus to be described from the Nearctic. Wetland habitats are under considerable anthropogenic pressure and as such require intensive conservation efforts. Placing the focus of conservation strategies on hyperdiverse entomofauna, instead of only charismatic megafauna, can have positive effects on their outcomes.

AB  - Background: In polygynous species, the development of secondary sexual characters is usually decisive for male reproductive success. However, our understanding about the links between the growth of these traits and reproductive efficiency is still elusive. Most research efforts in this topic have been also focused on adult males, although the development of some secondary sexual characters, like bovid horns, typically starts after birth, continues during the puberty and in some species, such as the common eland, slows or even stops during adulthood. In this study, we investigated the relationships between horn size and testicular function during sexual development in common elands using a comprehensive approach that considers both spermatogenic and sperm parameters. Methods: Twenty-two non-sexually mature common elands were used for the present study. Horn size, body mass, testes mass, and gonadosomatic index were assessed. Spermatogenic activity was determined by cytological and histological analyses. Sperm concentration, morphology, morphometry, and intramale variation in sperm size were evaluated on epididymal sperm samples. Cluster analysis was performed to explore the influence of age on relationships between horn size and reproductive function. Results: We found that bigger horns are associated with increased Sertoli cell efficiency and reduced intramale variation in sperm size. Both parameters were not related to one another while they have shown to be associated with enhanced sperm quality in ungulates. Moreover, horn size was positively linked to the testis mass, sperm concentration, and testicular investment in the seminiferous epithelium. Spiral length and basal circumference were the horn traits most strongly correlated with spermatogenic and sperm parameters as well as those responsible for the sexual dimorphism in this species. Cluster analysis rendered two groups: the first one including males <= 30 months old, while the second one those >30 months old. Horn development and reproductive function were still correlated within age groups, with the strongest relationship found between horn size and sperm size homogeneity in males >30 months old. Conclusion: Taken together, our results indicate that horn size can be regarded as a good index of male reproductive potential during sexual development and provide insights into the role of secondary sexual characters in sexual selection dynamics.

AB  - Many plant species develop fruits to attract animals that will eat them and then disperse the seeds. However, there are many plant species, whose seeds are dispersed endozoochorically, but their fruits are not particularly attractive to animals. The "Foliage is the fruit" (FF) hypothesis proposes that entire biomass of the plant exists to encourage herbivores to eat it, in order to enhance seed intake and dispersal (Janzen, 1984). We tested the FF hypothesis by combining the results from the greenhouse seedling emergence method (GR) and DNA-metabarcoding of plant remnants in faeces of European moose (Alces alces L.). We processed 665 samples by the GR and 429 by the MB method, hypothesizing that if the safe passage of seeds through the gut of a large herbivore is the result of an evolutionary adaptation to endozoochoric dispersal, then the species composition of plants revealed by the two methods should largely overlap and the abundance of seedlings revealed by the GR method should be positively correlated in time with the read abundance of DNA of the same species. The large discrepancy between the lists of species detected by DNA metabarcoding and the GR method argues against the FF hypothesis. However, in the case of Urtica dioica, Lysimachia vulgaris and Lythrum salicaria, some clues of evolutionary adaptation to endozoochoric dispersal were revealed for: 1) their foliage is attractive to herbivores; 2) seeds are small, rounded in shape, yielded in large numbers and pass safely through the herbivore's gut; 3) the abundance of seeds (seedlings) was significantly and strongly influenced by the abundance of the plant biomass (DNA reads) in dung samples; 4) peaks in seed abundance and biomass consumption coincided in time. However, it should be considered that moose's diet is mostly composed of woody browse, which makes this animal not an optimal model for testing the Janzen's hypothesis and studies on typical grazers are needed in this respect.

AB  - In the Rocky Mountains, bighorn sheep restoration has been only marginally effective; this iconic wilderness species currently exists at a fraction of their historic abundance and often in fragmented and small populations. To inform bighorn sheep conservation and restoration efforts, it is critical to understand sources of variation in key vital rates. Our objectives were to characterize the spatiotemporal variations and factors affecting survival and pregnancy rates of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) using data from 19 bighorn sheep populations in Montana and Wyoming that occupied diverse landscapes ranging from the Northern Great Plains to the Rocky Mountains. We used a hierarchical modeling approach to estimate survival and pregnancy rates of adult females and identify the important intrinsic and environmental factors affecting these vital rates. Survival of prime-aged animals was relatively high and stable, and pregnancy rates for prime-aged animals showed more overall variation in response to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Summer growing season, as indexed by integrated NDVI, positively influenced the probability of pregnancy and winter survival. This highlights the important relationship between summer growing season conditions and bighorn sheep physiological status. An index of mountain lion population abundance was related weakly to winter survival of bighorn sheep, with mountain lion abundance on winter ranges negatively affecting winter survival. Our results regarding the distribution of the estimated probabilities of pregnancy and survival, and the identification of factors associated with regional variability in these vital rates provide a foundation for understanding the dynamics of bighorn sheep populations in the Rocky Mountains. The importance of summer growing season conditions suggests management efforts should focus on maintaining and improving nutritional resources on bighorn sheep summer ranges, in efforts to enhance the condition of animals entering the breeding season and nutrient-limited winter season. Although we document nontrivial changes in both pregnancy and winter survival rates associated with environmental variation, our results broadly support the dominant paradigm of ungulate demography insofar as survival rates of adult females were relatively higher and had less variation than pregnancy rates.

AB  - Individuals that isolate themselves to give birth can use more than one strategy in choosing birth sites to maximize reproductive success. Previous research has focused on the consistency in the use of the same birth-site across years (i.e., spatial fidelity), but individuals alternatively may use similar habitat conditions across years (i.e., habitat fidelity). Using GPS telemetry, we determined whether woodland caribou expressed spatial or habitat fidelity during calving, and evaluated intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with expressing either type of fidelity. We identified 56 individuals with >= 2 putative birth events, via a movement-based model, across northern Ontario between 2010 and 2014. Individuals were classified as expressing (1) spatial fidelity by comparing sequential calving locations to a random spatial distribution of available calving locations, (2) habitat fidelity using a logistic use model compared to a null (intercept only) model, (3) no fidelity (neither criterion met), or (4) both spatial and habitat fidelity (both criteria met). Across all individuals, 37% expressed no fidelity (36 of 98), 15% expressed only spatial fidelity (15 of 99), 35% expressed only habitat fidelity (34 of 98), and 14% expressed both spatial and habitat fidelity (14 of 98). Older individuals were more likely to express spatial fidelity, whereas lower availability of upland and lowland conifer forests without linear features increased the probability an individual expressed habitat fidelity. Our results indicate that managing for caribou calving needs to consider protecting both specific, known birthing sites, but also broad-scale areas of preferred habitat for calving. Understanding the mechanisms that influence caribou expressing calving fidelity, and associated fitness costs, is crucial for the conservation of the species.

AB  - Spatial and temporal associations between sympatric species underpin biotic interactions, structure ecological assemblages, and sustain ecosystem functioning and stability. However, the resilience of interspecific spatiotemporal associations to human activity remains poorly understood, particularly in mountain forests where anthropogenic impacts are often pervasive. Here, we applied context-dependent Joint Species Distribution Models to a systematic camera-trap survey dataset from a global biodiversity hotspot in eastern Himalayas to understand how prominent human activities in mountain forests influence species associations within terrestrial mammal communities. We obtained 10,388 independent detections of 17 focal species (12 carnivores and five ungulates) from 322 stations over 43,163 camera days of effort. We identified a higher incidence of positive associations in habitats with higher levels of human modification (87%) and human presence (83%) compared to those located in habitats with lower human modification (64%) and human presence (65%) levels. We also detected a significant reduction of pairwise encounter time at increasing levels of human disturbance, corresponding to more frequent encounters between pairs of species. Our findings indicate that human activities can push mammals together into more frequent encounters and associations, which likely influences the coexistence and persistence of wildlife, with potential far-ranging ecological consequences.

AB  - The incidence of tick-borne diseases has increased in recent decades and accounts for the majority of vector-borne disease cases in temperate areas of Europe, North America, and Asia. This emergence has been attributed to multiple and interactive drivers including changes in climate, land use, abundance of key hosts, and people's behaviors affecting the probability of human exposure to infected ticks. In this forum paper, we focus on how land use changes have shaped the eco-epidemiology of Ixodes scapularis-borne pathogens, in particular the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto in the eastern United States. We use this as a model system, addressing other tick-borne disease systems as needed to illustrate patterns or processes. We first examine how land use interacts with abiotic conditions (microclimate) and biotic factors (e.g., host community composition) to influence the enzootic hazard, measured as the density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.s. We then review the evidence of how specific landscape configuration, in particular forest fragmentation, influences the enzootic hazard and disease risk across spatial scales and urbanization levels. We emphasize the need for a dynamic understanding of landscapes based on tick and pathogen host movement and habitat use in relation to human resource provisioning. We propose a coupled natural-human systems framework for tick-borne diseases that accounts for the multiple interactions, nonlinearities and feedbacks in the system and conclude with a call for standardization of methodology and terminology to help integrate studies conducted at multiple scales.

AB  - <ol><li>Attracting pollinators to achieve successful reproduction is a key challenge for wild plants that may be disturbed by complex multispecies interactions in nature. Pairwise plant-pollinator interactions have traditionally been studied for decades, while ignoring other ecological players may obscure a comprehensive understanding on how plants recruit partners or combat enemies in the pollination process. Hence, integrated studies considering the inherent complexity of ecological interactions are needed, which may open up new perspectives for deciphering intricate systems and predicting ecological consequences.</li><li>We examined the presence of nectar yeasts using a combination of high-throughput sequencing, cultivation and microscopy and quantified floral herbivory by evaluating the incidence of flowers with visible holes in 13 natural populations of Iris bulleyana in the Hengduan Mountains of southwest China during 2017-2022. We combined yeast inoculation and herbivore manipulation treatments to illustrate the isolated and combined impacts of two contrasting nectarivorous organisms, the ascomycetous yeast Metschnikowia reukaufii and adult sawflies, on pollinator visitation and plant reproductive success in two populations. In the lab, we first employed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to profile the volatile metabolites of yeast-inoculated nectar relative to control, followed by a behavioural bioassay to test the preference of honeybees for these microbial volatiles.</li><li>Yeasts commonly inhabited floral nectar and insect herbivores frequently bit holes in the perianth tube to consume nectar and nectaries. Nectar yeasts indirectly facilitated plant reproduction through increased pollinator visits, probably because of microbial metabolism as honeybees preferred nectar volatiles produced by yeasts in behavioural bioassays. Insect herbivores increased total floral visits but reduced legitimate visits by inducing legitimate-to-robbing behavioural changes of honeybees, thus leading to lower seed production. The detrimental effect of herbivory was mitigated by the presence of yeasts, which diminished the relative proportion of robbing visits and thereby 'rescued' flowers from reproductive failure.</li><li>Synthesis: Overall, we found contrasting effects of non-pollinator species, including both micro- and macro-organisms, on plant-pollinator interactions in a biodiversity hotspot, where pollination deficit may be a ubiquitous phenomenon. Our findings suggest that both microbial and herbivory effects are likely to be important in explaining the exact causes of pollen limitation in species-rich areas, highlighting the biological context dependence of species interactions in natural ecosystems.</li> </ol>

AB  - Metabolic physiology and animal behaviour are often considered to be linked, positively or negatively, according to either the performance or allocation models. Performance seems to predominate over allocation in natural systems, but the constraining environmental context may reveal allocation limitations to energetically expensive behaviours. Habitat disturbance, such as the large-scale fire that burnt wetlands of Biebrza National Park (NE Poland), degrades natural ecosystems. It arguably reduces food and shelter availability, modifies predator-prey interactions, and poses a direct threat for animal survival, such as that of the wetland specialist root vole Microtus oeconomus. We hypothesized that fire disturbance induces physiology-behaviour co-expression, as a consequence of changed environmental context. We repeatedly measured maintenance and exercise metabolism, and behavioural responses to the open field, in a root voles from post-fire and unburnt locations. Highly repeatable maintenance metabolism and distance moved during behavioural tests correlated positively, but relatively labile exercise metabolism did not covary with behaviour. At the same time, voles from a post-fire habitat had higher maintenance metabolism and moved shorter distances than voles from unburnt areas. We conclude there is a prevalence of the performance mechanism, but simultaneous manifestation of context-dependent allocation constraints of the physiology-behaviour covariation after disturbance. The last occurs at the within-individual level, indicating the significance of behavioural plasticity in the context of environmental disturbance.

AB  - The Przewalski's Gazelles (P. przewalskii) are affected by disorders that are characterized by deprived appetites, pica, emaciation and dyskinesia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of high molybdenum (Mo) in forage leading to copper (Cu) deprivation. The mineral contents in forage, soil, and samples of hair and blood from affected ranges were compared to healthy pasture. Blood parameters were also determined. Our results showed that the mean content of Mo in forage and soil in studied pasture was 5.17 and 4.17 mu g/g, respectively. The Cu to Mo ratio in forage from affected and healthy areas was 1.26 and 5.89 mu g/g, respectively. The Cu concentrations in hair and blood from gazelles in affected pasture were extremely lower (p < 0.01) than those in unaffected animals. The Mo contents in hair were higher (p < 0.01) than those in unaffected gazelles. The levels of Hb, RBC, PCV, MCV, and MCH in unaffected gazelles were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than those in unaffected gazelles. The levels of TP, ALB and GLB in blood were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than those in unaffected gazelles, while the levels of AST, LDH, CPK and ALP in serum were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than those in unaffected gazelles. The activities in serum T-AOC, SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT in affected gazelles were extremely lower (p < 0.01) than those in unaffected gazelles, while MDA was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that in unaffected gazelles. Supplementation in copper sulphate (CuSO4) has prevented and cured this disorder. In summary, high molybdenum in feed and soil may lead to secondary Cu deficiency in gazelles, which can be alleviated by supplement of copper sulfate.

AB  - Reproductive traits that mediate differential fitness associated with mate acquisition and fertilisation success are often strongly linked to the overall condition. We investigated the effects of resource quality and parental provisioning in the phenotypic expression of sexual and non-sexual traits in a rainforest dung beetle, Onthophagus c.f. babirussa (Eschscholtz, 1822) from Singapore. F1 individuals were reared from wild-caught beetles and paired up to produce offspring (F2), and F2 larvae from the same F1 parents were reared on two dung substrates (herbivore and omnivore) in a full-sib design. Sexual traits displayed greater phenotypic variation in response to dung resource quality, with the precopulatory trait (horn length) responding more than the postcopulatory trait (testes weight). Notably, genotype-by-environment interactions between parental lines (genotype) and dung type (environment) affected male body size and horn length only, suggesting sex-specific variance in plasticity associated with sexually selected precopulatory traits. Dung type had significant effects on all measured traits. Offspring that were provisioned higher quality resource (omnivore dung) had larger absolute and relative trait values. Parental lines only significantly affected female body size but none of the male traits, suggesting an important role of environment and resource partitioning in determining precopulatory success of male offspring. Parental provisioning of larval resource varied with resource quality and brood sequence. Parents provisioned more dung when herbivore dung was presented than when they were given omnivore dung and provisioned more dung for their earlier broods when using herbivore dung but not omnivore dung. This suggests a trade-off between early offspring fitness and resource quality. We tested directly for genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions in the expression of several morphological traits relevant to dung beetle fitness and documented that offspring with similar phenotypes may result from completely different parental resource allocation strategies. We discuss the importance of studying parental investment on trait variation and its implications on dung beetle ecology.

AB  - We reassess the research on the impact of climate change on society and propose examining the social dimensions of climate change from a perspective of community well-being. We argue that to better understand community dynamics in the Arctic, it is helpful to shift the research focus from the environment and view the environment and climate change as a backdrop to social phenomena. Specifically, we consider the increasing living standards and expanding basic needs that fall under consumption, one of the three domains of economic activity. This represents a shift from the conventional anthropological perspective, which focuses solely on production (food procurement, subsistence) and distribution, to a more balanced consideration of the three economic domains and their intricate relations. This shift also involves moving away from the conventional anthropological theory, which posits that the relationship to the environment influences, organizes, and shapes people's lives, to the reverse: people's increasing needs reshape, rearrange, or alter the human-environment relationship. The perspective of community well-being considers the interplay between the environment, social (local assets), and economic domains (consumption and increasing needs) of community dynamics. To illustrate this perspective in Arctic studies, we draw on two examples from our experience in Greenland: sheep farming in South Greenland and Greenland halibut fisheries in North Greenland.

AB  - To investigate the food composition and overlap in trophic niches of sympatric sika deer (Cervus nippon hortulorum) and roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), we used plant DNA barcoding to qualitatively assess winter food composition in their feces. We collected feces from sika deer and roe deer in the southern Laoyeling and extracted fecal DNA, amplified it using primers for the rbcL gene region of the plant, and sequenced it using high-throughput sequencing techniques. We analyzed 40 valid fecal samples in winter (20 from sika deer and 20 from roe deer). The results showed 56 families, 84 genera, and 84 species of plants for sika deer and 51 families, 83 genera, and 84 species for roe deer. Unlike traditional methods, using DNA barcoding revealed a large number of herbage plants in the winter food composition (43.90% for sika deer and 51.50% for roe deer). NMDS plot reveals significant ecological niche differentiation (R = 0.3062, P < 0.05) between sika deer and roe deer. Our study successfully applied DNA barcoding to the study of ungulates' feeding habits.

   Pastoral management in Europe is an important element in protecting biodiversity and the landscape. Shepherding stimulates the development of the market of traditional and regional products, handicrafts and services. Pastoral farming in Europe is an important element of biodiversity and landscape protection. Shepherding stimulates the development of the market for traditional, regional products, handicrafts and services. For many years, wool was an important product obtained in mountain areas from local sheep breeds, now treated as a waste product. The aim of the study is to describe farming methods in mountain areas, indicating innovative possibilities of using sheep wool.
   Material and methods
   The material consisted of literature studies and own research on management in mountain areas. Own research and literature analyzes have shown that, due to its properties, wool obtained from mountain sheep can be used as a natural fiber in a biodegradable composite and constitute an alternative to plastic packaging. The introduction of natural fibers in the fertilizer composite can improve not only soil fertility but also bring economic effects, such as the use of wool of Polish mountain sheep as part of the circular economy.
   Results and conclusions
   Summarize, the search for alternative directions for the use of sheep wool is of strategic importance for maintaining and even increasing the sheep population in Poland and in other European Union countries. Occurring soil droughts in the summer period affect the reduction of plant yields, and for this reason, the application of biodegradable biocomposite to the soil will not have a negative impact on the environment of mountain pastures and meadows

AB  - Simple Summary The study was carried out in La Ribagorza County, Spain. We conducted 30 surveys on extensive sheep, Ovis aries, and goat, Capra hircus, farmers to discover their attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge of the current situation of this type of extensive farming and the conflicts that may arise between their activity and the presence of large carnivores such as the brown bear, Ursus arctos, or the grey wolf, Canis lupus. The coexistence of extensive livestock farming with the presence of large carnivores is one of the main challenges facing this sector. The studied farms are small family businesses, and so, in more than half of the cases, their continuity is not guaranteed. Livestock management is typical of a mountain system, in which the animals graze throughout the year in cultivated fields, sown meadows, forests near the farms, and mountain pastures during the three summer months. The herds always have the constant surveillance of a shepherd. Farmers consider the current infrastructure present in mountain grasslands insufficient to facilitate the management and care of their herd. Their activity conflicts with various species of wildlife, such as the wild boar, Sus scrofa, roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, or griffon vulture, Gyps fulvus, and large carnivores such as the brown bear, Ursus arctos, or the grey wolf Canis lupus, despite all of them taking preventive measures to defend their herds from predators. The most widely used prevention measures are the presence of mastiff dogs, Canis lupus familiaris, next to the herds and the use of electric fencing to lock up livestock at night. Farmers reject the presence of bears and wolves in their area, considering it a real threat to the continuity of their economic activity, which presents a high degree of vulnerability.

AB  - 1. Differences in botanical diet compositions among a large number of moose faecal samples collected during winter correlated with the nutritional differences identified in the same samples (Mantel-r = 0.89, p = 0.001), but the nutritional differences were significantly smaller (p < 0.001).
   2. Nutritional geometry revealed that moose mixed Scots pine Pinus sylvestris and Vaccinium spp. as nutritionally complementary foods to reach a nutritional target resembling Salix spp. twigs, and selected for Salix spp. browse (Jacob's D > 0).
   3. Available protein (AP) and total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) were significantly correlated in observed diets but not in hypothetical diets based on food availability.
   4. The level of Acetoacetate in moose serum (i.e. 'starvation') was weakly negatively associated with digestibility of diets (p = 0.08) and unrelated to increasing AP:TNC and AP:NDF ratios in diets (p > 0.1).
   5. Our study is the first to demonstrate complementary feeding in free-ranging moose to attain a nutritional target that has previously been suggested in a feeding trial with captive moose. Our results add support to the hypothesis of nutritional balancing as a driver in the nutritional strategy of moose with implications for both the management of moose and food resources.

AB  - Movements of moose are caused by variations in resource availability such as food, shelter and the energetic cost of foraging. These variables are important in forest and population management. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to estimate the influence of forest site types on the distribution of the non hunted moose population in February and March 2020 in the August & oacute;w Forest, a 1102.0 km(2) forest complex in north-eastern Poland. In the study area, 20 sampling plots were distributed over a total area of 91.4 km(2), where six teams, each consisting of 30 people, observed moose to estimate population numbers. The average population density was 1.22 +/- 0.19 moose per km(2) and ranged from 0.21 to 3.40 animals/km(2). The total population number estimated this way amounted to 1344 animals. Non-linear regression demonstrated a positive relationship between the percentage of hygric-wet forest site types in the sampling plot area and the moose population distribution (r = 0.735, n = 20, p = 0.0096). In winter, these habitats are a critical refuge for moose. For this reason, tree harvesting and hunting in hygric-wet forest site types should be limited during this period.

AB  - The sea bottom of Taiwan Strait harbors a Late Pleistocene paleo-ecosystem significantly distinct from the present ecosystem structure in Taiwan. The assemblage constitutes fossil remains from the genus Palaeoloxodon, the largest known lineage of proboscideans to have walked on Earth. Body mass holds a pivotal role in our understanding of an organism's biology, ecology, life history, and susceptibility to extinction, and thus, is a key trait while working with extinct taxa. Here we, for the first time, assess the body mass of Palaeoloxodon specimens from Taiwan using well-established allometric scaling equations derived from both extant and extinct species. Our results indicate that Palaeoloxodon individuals from Taiwan exceed 10 tonnes in body mass with a mean body mass of 9.32 tonnes, similar in size to Palaeoloxodon antiquus across Eurasia, and an average shoulder height of 3.49 m. Additionally, our statistical pairwise analysis of body mass distribution shows that Palaeoloxodon specimens from Taiwan significantly differ from the largest species in the genus, Palaeoloxodon namadicus. We further employ equations from extant proboscideans and show notable discrepancies due to differences in body shape between extinct and extant proboscideans. Our estimated body masses offer novel insights into the paleoecology and extinction pressures of the Palaeoloxodon population during the Pleistocene of Taiwan. Further research promises to reveal the habitats capable of sustaining megafaunal populations and extinction events along the easternmost margin of Eurasia.

AB  - Amid intensive transformations in the Arctic environment and biota, differences in population trends demonstrated by predominant and widespread Arctic herbivores are of great scientific interest. In this regard, the primary purpose of this study was to perform a comparative assessment of trophic selectivity in the barnacle goose and greater white-fronted goose in the area of their highest reproductive concentrations and estimate the role of competition in their population dynamics. The data indicate that differences in quantitative shares of plants consumed by these species are not sufficient to avoid competition and that the diet of barnacle geese is more selective (i.e., sensitive to food quality and energy consumption). However, the status of a relatively weak competitor contradicts the exponential growth of the barnacle goose population in the study area, as well as its entire Arctic population. We believe that differences in the population dynamics of barnacle goose and greater white-fronted goose are currently determined not by competition in reproductive concentration periods, but by effects exercised by anthropogenic and climatic factors far outside of their nesting range.

AB  - The current study aims to provide a new method for the identification of animal species by using the scanning electron microscopic study on the nasal skin around the nostril. The reference databases for animal identification using traditional ways (i.e., hair and bone analyses) were somewhat available. This study was conducted on the nasal skin of seven different animal species: large ruminants (Saidi buffalo and frozen Angus cattle); small ruminants (Egyptian goat and Rahmani sheep); camels (one-hump dromedary camel); equines (African domestic donkey and Arabian horse); carnivores (farm domestic cat, Egyptian Baladi dog, and red fox); swine (Danish Landrace pig); and rodents (albino rat and New Zealand white rabbit). The nasal skin was divided by grooves into different shaped raised areas in some examined animals, the mean diameter of these areas and width of the grooves of each animal species were recorded. The characteristic differential features of the nasal skin of each animal species have been documented. Few openings of the nasolabial glands were demonstrated in large ruminants and swine, which were H letter-shaped in buffaloes, oval-shaped in cattle, and whirlpool-shaped with several layers of folds on their margin in pig. Moreover, the openings of the lateral nasal glands were whirlpool, ovoid, and oval shaped in goats, sheep, and camels, respectively. In conclusion, the present study proved that the skin around the nostrils plays an important role as means of identification in forensic investigations and improves the field of veterinary forensic medicine in general, which is not well-developed in comparison with human forensics.

AB  - Measuring individual fitness empirically is required to assess selective pressures and predicts evolutionary changes in nature. There is, however, little consensus on how fitness should be empirically estimated. As fitness proxies vary in their underlying assumptions, their relative sensitivity to individual, environmental, and demographic factors may also vary. Here, using a long-term study, we aimed at identifying the determinants of individual fitness in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) using seven fitness proxies. Specifically, we compared four-lifetime fitness proxies: lifetime breeding success, lifetime reproductive success, individual growth rate, individual contribution to population growth, and three multi-generational proxies: number of granddaughters, individual descendance in the next generation, and relative genetic contribution to the next generation. We found that all proxies were positively correlated, but the magnitude of the correlations varied substantially. Longevity was the main determinant of most fitness proxies. Individual fitness calculated over more than one generation was also affected by population density and growth rate. Because they are affected by contrasting factors, our study suggests that different fitness proxies should not be used interchangeably as they may convey different information about selective pressures and lead to divergent evolutionary predictions. Uncovering the mechanisms underlying variation in individual fitness and improving our ability to predict evolutionary change might require the use of several, rather than one, the proxy of individual fitness.

AB  - Many winegrowers and sheep breeders are interested in wintertime grazing in vineyards, as an agroecological alternative to mowing or herbicide spraying, and additional supply of forage. Still, strong concern is raised by the use of copper-based fungicides, particularly in organic vineyards, since copper is known to induce chronic toxicosis in sheep. We conducted an on-farm study with n = 12 1-year-old Merinos x Mourerous ewes grazing the cover vegetation of vineyard plots during wintertime, in order to check whether this agricultural practice might be harmful to sheep. Our results indicate that most copper found in the cover vegetation originates from fungicide spraying versus plant uptake from the soil, and that rain-induced washing-off and plant growth-triggered dilution of copper are crucial to reach close-to-safe grazing conditions. Furthermore, we found that while sheep remained globally healthy during the 2 months of the experimental period, the plasma activity of Glutamate Dehydrogenase increased by 17.3 & PLUSMN; 3.0 U/L upon vineyard grazing (p < 0.001), reflecting liver storage of copper. We also discovered that the dynamics of molybdenum in sheep plasma are strongly affected by exposure to copper, suggesting a possible adaptation mechanism. Overall, our results suggest that winter grazing of sheep in organic vineyards is reasonably safe, but that care should be taken about grazing period duration. More research should be conducted with respect to long-term copper accumulation, spring and summer grazing, and possible protective mechanisms against copper chronic poisoning.

AB  - Microalgal biomass was produced outdoors over a 16-month period using 30 m(2) thin-layer cascade reactors. Diluted pig slurry was utilised as the nutrient source. The present work aimed to minimise the water requirements during microalgae production by (i) recirculating the outlet effluents back into the reactor and (ii) simultaneously reusing the effluents while covering the reactors with plastic covers. Overall, water recirculation negatively affected biomass productivity throughout the year; in summer, the biomass productivity decreased from 22.3 +/- 0.9 g center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1) (when there was no water recirculation) to 16.5 +/- 0.8 g center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1) (when using a recirculation percentage of 75%). The increase in the turbidity and colour of the diluted pig slurry makes the recirculation of outlet effluents back into the system a challenge. However, recirculating the water in the uncovered reactors reduced the water requirements for biomass production from 900-1,000 L center dot kg(-1) to 600-700 L center dot kg(-1), depending on the season. The experiments combining water recirculation and plastic covers were efficient at reducing water evaporation losses; however, the biomass productivity was negatively affected when using covers while the amount of water needed to produce 1 kg of biomass was, in general, not positively affected. The biomass productivity decreased on average by 16.6% when the reactors were covered. Operating the reactors with a recirculation percentage of 75% (the largest percentage studied) and plastic covers led to a reduction of over 50% in the amount of water required to produce 1 kg of biomass, from 900.8 L center dot kg(-1) to 444.8 L center dot kg(-1) (in winter).

AB  - Compensatory growth (CG) appears common in biology and is defined as accelerated growth after experiencing a period of unfavorable conditions. It usually leads to an increase in biomass that may eventually equal or even surpass that of sites not experiencing disturbance. In forestry, with sufficient time the stand volume lost in a disturbance such as a thinning operation could match or even exceed those from undisturbed sites, respectively called exact and overcompensation. The forest sector could benefit from enhanced productivity and associated ecosystem services such as carbon storage through overcompensation. Therefore, detection of CG in different types of forests becomes important for taking advantage of it in forest management. However, compensatory growth has not been reported widely in forestry, partially due to the paucity of long-term observations and lack of proper indicators. Legacy forest projects can provide a suitable data source, though they may be originally designed for other purposes. Three case studies representing different data structures of silviculture trials are investigated to evaluate if compensatory growth is common in forest stands. Our results showed that compensatory growth occurred in all three cases, and thus suggested that the compensatory growth might indeed be common in forest stands. We found that the relative growth (RG) can serve as a universal indicator to examine stand-level compensatory growth in historical long-term silviculture datasets. When individual tree-based measurements are available, both volume and value-based indicators can be used in detecting compensatory growth, and lumber value-based indicators could be more sensitive in detecting overcompensation.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that an increase in the population size of sika deer (Cervus nippon) decreases the abundance of rodents but increases that of several invertebrates (Scarabaeidae, Rhaphidophoridae, and earthworms) outside a deep-proof fence in Oku-Nikko, Japan. Therefore, the diet of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) feeding on these animals is expected to vary according to changes in prey abundance. As red foxes also scavenge deer carcasses, an increase in the number of deer is expected to lead to changes in the red fox diet. In this study, the diet and sightings of red foxes inside and outside the fence were compared. Generalized linear mixed models indicate that the sika deer remains, ground-dwelling insects (Scarabaeidae and Rhaphidophoridae as a group, and Carabidae), and earthworms increased in the fox diet outside the fence, while the ingestion of voles decreased. The difference in prey consumption by red foxes was probably caused by differences in prey availability inside and outside the fence or the presence of available alternative food. These results suggest that red foxes demonstrate dietary plasticity in areas where habitat structure has been substantially modified by deer grazing. Although the abundance of voles, the primary food of red foxes, decreased outside the fence, the sighting rates of red foxes obtained by spotlight count were not significantly different between inside and outside the fence, suggesting that the presence of the others increased or available alternative food may have compensated for the negative effects of decreasing vole abundance.

AB  - The biodiversity of copepods as examined in the present study is based on an oceanographic survey conducted on two ecosystems along the Algerian coast (central and eastern) in the early autumn of 2014. During that investigation, the thermocline was present at shallow depth, extending between 30 and 80 m. A total of 49 species were recorded in the samples, belonging to 20 families, among which six families, Calanidae, Eucalanidae, Metridinidae, Oithonidae, Paracalanidae, and Temoridae, appeared to be dominant. The total abundance of zooplankton at the 13 stations was less than 600 ind/m(3). Two geographic groupings have been distinguished: stations in the central sector (group 1) are in opposition to the other stations in the eastern sector (group 2). The quantitative levels of copepods are less abundant in the east (234.15 ind/m(3)) than in the centre (334.99 ind/m(3)). In the central regions, the trophic organization is dominated by omnivores (73.02%), with an inferior codominance of carnivores (14.02%) and herbivores (12.95%). In the east, copepods with omnivorous behaviour are strongly represented (82.14%), followed by phytophagous (13.85%) and carnivorous (4.01%) species. The distribution of the abundances over the copepod communities was found to be linked to the temperature, salinity, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, and phytoplankton biomass.

AB  - In medicine and public health, the Hippocratic injunction to 'first do no harm' has inspired a longstanding tradition of research and practice seeking to mitigate iatrogenic (doctor or practitioner-created) risks. Aiming to anticipate and prevent iatrogenic outcomes, dark logic models challenge practitioners to explicitly consider mechanisms through which harms may arise from the implementation of proposed interventions. Placing recent literatures on conservation (in)justice in closer dialogue with debates about the utility of dark logic models in the health sciences, this article explores how such approaches may or may not be useful for avoiding negative social impacts or injustices in conservation governance. Particularly considering resurgent spatial ambitions in global biodiversity conservation - as evidenced by the Half Earth and 30 x 30 conservation targets - we suggest that dark logic models may ultimately prove to be a worthwhile component of conservation practice vis -`a-vis the UN Convention on Biological Diversity's Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. In this context, dark logic models constitute an additional tool - which can be used in complementary fashion, alongside others - to better anticipate and prevent conservation harms, as well as to avoid further burdening those who have done the least to cause the biodiversity crisis with conservation's negative socioeconomic impacts.

AB  - Herbivorous molluscs represent one of the greatest grazing impacts on abundance and diversity of primary producers in benthic ecosystems. However, the effects of nutritional content of kelp species on the physiological rate of trochoid herbivorous snails inhabiting intertidal-subtidal environments are less well known. Here, we conducted manipulation experiments to compare the nutritional quality of two kelp species, Lessonia spicata and Macrocystis pyrifera, and their influence on the feeding behavior and physiological rates of the snail Tegula atra. Experimental results demonstrated that L. spicata had the highest nutritional value (i.e., high organic matter and protein content), and was the preferred alga, compared with M. pyrifera in a choice experiment. However, when the snails were raised with each of the algal species in no choice experiments, no significant differences were found. Absorption efficiency and oxygen uptake were higher for snails reared with L. spicata than M. pyrifera, but growth rate was similar. These results suggest that high metabolic activity was compensated by the high absorption efficiency of T. atra when it consumed the preferred L. spicata, which could explain the lack of relationship between preference and growth rate.

AB  - This study aimed to clarify the effects of stumping on preferential flow in the understory soils of Hippophae rhamnoides and to assess appropriate stumping height for optimization of preferential flow. Root properties, soil properties, and preferential flow for different H. rhamnoides stump heights (0, 10, 15, 20 cm, and no-stumping, labeled conditions S1, S2, S3, S4, and CK, respectively) were studied using in situ dye-tracing and laboratory analysis. The results showed that stumping significantly increased preferential flow development. This effect was maximized in condition S3, with dye-tracing coverage (DC) of 36.77%, maximum dye depth (MaxD) of 40.02 cm, uniform infiltration depth (Unifr) of 14.28 cm, preferential flow ratio (PFfr) of 23.85%, and length index (LI) of 96.72%. In terms of root length density (RLD), root mass density (RMD), root surface area density (RSAD), soil water content (SWC), soil total porosity (TP), mean weight diameter (MWD), and soil organic matter (SOM), the conditions were ranked S3>S2>S1>S3>CK; for root average diameter (RAD), they were ranked S3

AB  - The results of 289 encounters of wild boars, 123 measurements of the distances between the observer and wild boars (DM, average 66 m), 98 measurements of initial escape distances (EID or FID, average 84 m) of single or different groups of wild boar, 114 tiger snow tracking, and brown bear hunting wild boar are analyzed. Various methods of statistical comparison and normalization of some samples were used. DM characterizes the variety of remote contacts of a dangerous subject with wild boars in their typical environment of a protected forest. From 1974-1983 by 2003-2015, DM increased almost 1.4 times against the background of a significant (1.5-2.0 times) wild boar decline. Increasing the level of general vigilance of wild boars, leaders, and guards while their numbers decrease contributes to the survival of group members. The average values and indicators of variation of EID, which mark the critical line in response to a predator, changed less. DM and EID are formed under the conditions of wild boar abundances varying due to different frequencies of waiting, i.e. delaying the start of active avoidance from the predator after identifying the signs of danger and observing the dangerous subject from afar. Explicit hiding in adult wild boars was observed infrequently, which is due to the hunting methods of tigers and brown bears. Hiding is common in pigs and young of the year during the postpartum period, this being observed in the conditions difficult for locomotion, in animals weakened by hunger. The possibilities of camouflage in different environments affect DM and EID: in a coniferous forest, these indicators are lower than in a spacious oak woodlands alternating with meadows, during the growing season they are less (FID almost 1.7 times) than from late autumn to spring (= 93 m), when the possibility of detecting a predator also increased. With the average distance of a tiger attack on a wild boar being 22.7 m (for successful attacks, 13.8 m and unsuccessful attacks, 30.2 m), the success of hunting by a tiger and brown bear depends on the possibility of a silent approach to the prey (up to 4-6 m). The impossibility of a tiger approaching within the distance of a successful attack on the crunchy snow entailed long breaks between preys of ungulates. Predator attacks from long distances (35-80 m) were usually provoked by the wild boars that noticed the tiger in advance. The tiger is able to assess the prospects of a hunt from the very beginning, this probably determining its rather high effectiveness (49.1%) after choosing a specific prey.

AB  - Growing urban expansion can alter ecological processes within trophic networks. Predation on herbivores is known to vary with the size of the area covered by vegetation, successional stage, altitude and predator community structure; however there are gaps in understanding how this occurs in urban and suburban environments. The purpose of this study was to determine whether predation pressure on artificial models of caterpillars varied with the degree of urbanisation and type of substrate. Artificial caterpillars were placed on two types of substrates (leaf vs. stem) in two areas of the city (urban vs. suburban). Total predation was measured as the number of models with evidence of attack by predators, with the predation rate estimated on a weekly basis. Predation was affected by the degree of urbanisation, being higher in urban ((x) over bar = 9.88%; SD = 4.09%, n = 8) than suburban areas ((x) over bar = 5.75%, SD = 4.21%, n = 8). Attack marks were observed in 23.8% (n = 125) of artificial caterpillars. The weekly predation rate on leaves ((x) over bar = 9.63%, SD = 5.95%, n = 8) was higher than that on stems ((x) over bar = 6%, SD = 4.2%, n = 8). These results suggest that the incidence of predation might vary with the degree of urbanisation and by the type of substrate on which prey organisms are found.

AB  - There are mixed reports about the advantages and disadvantages of the presence of shade produced by trees over the understory-growing grasses; thus, it is urgent to test grass species and cultivars with potential to develop in shaded conditions associated with trees that occur in silvopastoral systems. The objective of the present study was to identify Brachiaria spp. ecotypes adapted for cultivation under tree shade, typical of silvopastoral systems. The study was conducted at Kampepen ranch, located 14 km south of Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. A factorial 6 (ecotypes) x 2 (sunlight intensities) treatment structure was used, arranged in split-plot design; with sunlight intensity levels being the plots and ecotypes the subplots, with three replications. The ecotypes were T1: Brachiaria hybrid cv. Mulato II, T2: Brachiaria hybrid cv. Cayman Blend, T3: Brachiaria hybrid cv. Talisman (BR05/1467), T4: Brachiaria hybrid cv. Camello Blend, T5: Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu and T6 (the control): M. maximus cv. Mombasa, while the two sunlight intensity levels were higher and lower sunlight reductions with respect to full sunlight (25% and 50% light transmission with respect to full sunlight, respectively). Variables were plant height, forage yield and chemical composition; leaf, stem and dead material fractions and leaf:stem ratio; plant canopy cover, plant maturity, and growth rate. Significant (p < 0.050) ecotype x sunlight intensity interactions were recorded for most of the studied variables. Independent of the shading levels, ecotype Talisman showed superior performance compared with the other assessed ecotypes, yielding up to 20 ton ha(-1) under the highest light intensity, means across light intensities for crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) of 11.8%, 59.7%, and 34.7%, respectively, and more than 90% plant canopy cover. It is concluded that Talisman has promising characteristics for cultivation under silvopastoral systems, where tree shading is common, in the dry tropics of Yucatan, Mexico.

AB  - Two strategic documents issued by the Chinese Central Government projected that, by the mid21st century, the linear transport infrastructure (LTI) network of China will rank at the forefront of ecological and sustainable transport networks globally. With this goal, it is urgent to summarize existing research, benchmark international research levels, and propose development directions and strategies for terrestrial vertebrate species protection around LTI in China. In this study, we searched for peer-reviewed papers before 2020 in both Chinese and international databases. A total of 170 academic articles were collected. Most focused on roads, but some focused on railways, of which the Qinghai-Tibet Railway occupied half. The most researched taxa were mammals, including the Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii), Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris), and Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), the number of bird research papers was less than half that of mammal research papers, and fewer amphibian and reptile studies. The impact of LTI on wildlife was classified to habitat effects, roadkill, behavioral influences, and barrier effects. Wildlife preservation efforts included wildlife and habitat surveys, route selection, subgrade and pavement design, and the design and monitoring of wildlife crossing structures. Studies were concentrated in five zoogeographical regions, i.e., the Qinghai-Tibet, South China, Central China, Northeast China, and Southwest China regions. Conservation suggestions, knowledge gaps, and future research directions for China were identified through comparisons with the state of international research. These focal priorities will help guide the development of road ecology in China. Multi-disciplinary, cross-departmental, and national level research is necessary. Based on this review, a national data integration platform should be established and efforts to cooperate with international research teams to mitigate the adverse effects of LTI should be made.

AB  - The alpine grasslands of the Kashmir Himalayas serve as a lifeline for the region's pastoral communities, providing the primary source of forage for their livestock. These high-altitude rangelands are not only crucial for the livelihood of these communities but also play a significant role in maintaining the ecological balance of the area. However, sustainable pastoralism in these fragile ecosystem hinges on a thorough understanding of forage availability and livestock carrying capacity. This study assesses the forage dynamics and livestock carrying capacity of these high-altitude grasslands. Through comprehensive biomass sampling across 23 strategically selected sites, we calculated an average dry matter above ground biomass yield of 5.10 metric tons per hectare, resulting in a total dry biomass weight of approximately 820,489.22 metric tons (820,489,220 kg), over the entire grassland area of 160,974 ha. Using a daily forage intake of 1.3 kg per Sheep Unit (SU) over 50 grazing days, time period which corresponds to the renewal period for new grass growth, the average carrying capacity of the rangelands was determined to be 39.08 Animal Units (AU) per hectare and the total carrying capacity was estimated as 62,78,556 SU. The current stocking rate of 4,661,800 SU utilizes about 74.21% of this Carrying capacity, leaving a surplus of 25.77% or 1,616,756 Animal Sheep Units. However, localized overgrazing in areas such as Thajwas and Mohand Marg highlights the need for targeted management practices to prevent rangeland degradation. This data is critical as it provides a baseline for understanding the potential of these rangelands to support livestock. This study underscores the importance of sustainable livestock management to optimize carrying capacity while maintaining the ecological balance of the grasslands. Engaging local pastoral communities in these efforts is essential for the effective and sustainable management of the alpine grasslands in the Kashmir Himalayas.

AB  - Amidst global concerns about land use change and its far-reaching impact on biodiversity and human well-being, there is a growing need to understand how land use stock and flow changes over time through land use accounting. While existing studies on land accounting have focused on historical land changes, little attention has been paid to future transitions. This study assessed historical patterns and projected future shifts in land use dynamics from 1987 to 2050 across Japan by combining high-resolution land use and land cover datasets, land change simulations, and land accounting. In the analyses, particular attention was paid to the historical and future trends of farmland abandonment by leveraging data at 100-m resolution built on national vegetation surveys. High-resolution analysis of farmland abandonment issue with national scale in Japan is a novelty. From 1987 to 1998, the land stock analysis results showed a pronounced marked increase in residential land (10.4%) and grassland (16.9%); the flow analysis results showed that urban residential sprawl expansion was mainly formed by secondary (32.6%) and plantation (21.1%) forest areas, coinciding with increasing population and economic growth. Projections from 2010 to 2050 indicate a marked increase in abandoned farmland (67.2% per decade), a trend influenced by rapid population decline and presumably agricultural policies, especially significant in regions such as Hokkaido and Kyushu. The findings of this study are crucial for shaping policy and decision-making, underlining the need for sustainable land management strategies that effectively balance urban growth, agricultural productivity, and environmental preservation in Japan.

AB  - Simple Summary The Formosan serow is a wild goat found only in the mountains of Taiwan. In this cross-over study, two different drug combinations were used to anesthetize five adult Formosan serows in a zoo environment, namely dexmedetomidine-tiletamine-zolazepam and dexmedetomidine-ketamine. Each animal received each of the drug combinations for general anesthesia at least once, with an interval of at least 12 months between anesthesia administrations. While dexmedetomidine-tiletamine-zolazepam induced anesthesia faster than ketamine-dexmedetomidine, these animals experienced problems such as paddling, prolonged recovery, and ataxia. The animals in the dexmedetomidine-tiletamine-zolazepam group had lower breathing rates and body temperatures than those in the dexmedetomidine-ketamine group. In summary, the dexmedetomidine-tiletamine-zolazepam combination anesthetized the Formosan serows rapidly but recovery was more eventful. Formosan serows are endemic to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. This crossover study aimed to assess and compare the anesthetic induction and recovery using either dexmedetomidine-tiletamine-zolazepam (DZ) or dexmedetomidine-ketamine (DK) by intramuscular injection from a blow-dart in a zoo environment. Ten anesthetic procedures were performed with five adult Formosan serows. Each participant was anesthetized with both combinations at least once with a minimal 12-month washout. The average dosages were 22.6 +/- 8.3 mu g/kg and 35.8 +/- 2.5 mu g/kg for dexmedetomidine and 185.6 +/- 123.6 and 357.8 +/- 25.2 mu g/kg for atipamezole for the DZ and DK groups, respectively. The doses of tiletamine-zolazepam and ketamine were 2.1 +/- 0.25 mg/kg and 3.6 +/- 0.3 mg/kg, respectively, in the DZ and DK groups. All participants were induced within 10 min (median: 8 min for both groups), except one serow in the DK group with an induction time of 22 min. Serows in the DZ group had a lower respiratory rate (p = 0.016) and lower rectal temperature (p = 0.008) than those in the DK group. The quality of recovery was poor for DZ because of paddling, prolonged recovery, and ataxia after antagonism of dexmedetomidine with atipamezole. The induction of anesthesia with dexmedetomidine-tiletamine-zolazepam was uneventful and rapid. However, recovery from this combination was not smooth.

AB  - 1. Rhodoliths, formed by free-living coralline algae, are distributed worldwide, and the rhodolith beds (RBs) that they form are recognized as structurally complex habitats. In the Mediterranean, they are generally distributed in the mesophotic zone, at depths of 30-100 m; so far, only a few shallow RBs (<2 m) have been reported (e.g. & Icirc;les Kuriat, Tunisia, and Stagnone Marsala, Italy).2. Here a shallow-water RB located in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (south-eastern Italy, Mediterranean Sea) is described. The diversity of associated invertebrates, the rhodolith-forming algal species, the type of sediments, and the bed extent are characterized.3. The RB investigated extends over 5 ha at depths of 0.5-1.5 m. The rhodoliths vary in shape and size, from pralines to large spherical structures, and are formed by a single species, Neogoniolithon brassica-florida, growing around nuclei of both natural and anthropogenic origin. The associated fauna consisted of 158 taxa, 79 (50%) of which were new basin records. The associated diversity was approximately twice that of the underlying and nearby sediments.4. The structural complexity of the RBs promotes biodiversity and provides shelter, food, and a breeding ground for numerous species, including seahorses, which are a conservation priority in this basin.

AB  - Deciphering the plastic (i.e., nonheritable) changes induced by human control over wild animals in the archeological record is challenging. Previous studies detected morphological markers associated with captivity in the cranium, mandible, and calcaneus of adult wild boar (Sus scrofa) but the developmental trajectories leading up to these changes during ontogeny remain unknown. To assess the impact of growth in a captive environment on morphological structures during postnatal ontogeny, we used an experimental approach focusing on the same three structures and taxon. We investigated the form and size differences of captive-reared and wild-caught wild boar during growth using three-dimensional landmark-based geometric morphometrics. Our results provide evidence of an influence of captivity on the morphology of craniomandibular structures, as wild specimens are smaller than captive individuals at similar ages. The food resources inherent to anthropogenic environments may explain some of the observed differences between captive-reared and wild specimens. The calcaneus presents a different contrasted pattern of plasticity as captive and wild individuals differ in terms of form but not in terms of size. The physically more constrained nature of the calcaneus and the direct influence of mobility reduction on this bone may explain these discrepancies. These results provide new methodological perspectives for bioarchaeological approaches as they imply that the plastic mark of captivity can be observed in juvenile specimens in the same way it has been previously described in adults.

AB  - Environmental heat stress is a major concern in livestock production especially in water buffalo, which are more sensitive to heat stress. Buffalo bulls experiencing heat stress exhibit reduced feed intake and semen production, triggering stress responses at multiple levels. This comprehensive study delves into the understanding of the complex nature of heat stress responses in Murrah bulls through gene expression analysis. Murrah bulls were categorized into a seasonally non-affected (n = 6) and seasonally affected (n = 6) groups, on the basis of semen quality in different seasons, classified as hot summer, comfort and winter. The study has revealed that heat stress having an impact on physiological variables including scrotal temperature and respiration rate as well as serum antioxidants levels. Additionally, the expression of genes in response to heat stress and oxidative stress was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cell of the categorized bulls. The study also includes expression analysis of targeted semen quality genes in spermatozoa of the target bulls. The seasonal fluctuations have been noticed to have an influence on the physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels among the bulls with varying semen quality under heat stress. Significant differences were observed in the scrotal infrared thermography and expression of heat shock proteins as well as leptin gene in the both groups, specifically during the summer season. The outcome of this study contributes to the holistic understanding of heat stress resilience in Murrah buffalo bulls and provides foundation for future strategies to improve their well-being and better reproductive efficiency under heat stress conditions.

AB  - Bio-invasions have the potential to provoke cascade effects that can disrupt natural ecosystems and cause ecological regime shifts. The Mediterranean Sea is particularly prone to bio-invasions as the changing water conditions, evoked by climate change, are creating advantageous conditions for Lessepsian migrants from the Red Sea. Recently, in May 2023, a new alien species was documented in the Mediterranean Sea-a soft coral of the genus Dendronephthya. This discovery was made by divers conducting 'Long-Term Ecological Research' surveys, along the coast of Israel, at a depth of 42 m. Genetic and morphological testing suggest that the species identity may be Dendronepthya hemprichi, an Indo-Pacific coral, common in the Red Sea. According to life history traits of this species, such as accelerated attachment to available surfaces and fast growth, we expect it to rapidly expand its distribution and abundance across the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Introduction: The Costa Rican southwestern region is considered one of the neotropical biodiversity hotspots. This geographically isolated forest embraces a rich diversity of moths and butterflies, which is still unknown for the most part. Objectives: (a) Describe and compare the diversity of moths and butterflies among different localities of the southwestern Costa Rican region, and (b) identify information gaps in this group of insects. Methods: Data for this study were collected in 12 different localities by parataxonomists and taxonomists for the national inventory of biodiversity led by INBio (National Biodiversity Institute) using different trap types, but relying mainly on light traps. We compared alpha and beta diversity of moths and butterflies among the six localities (Cort & eacute;s, Piedras Blancas, Rancho Quemado, Agujas, Los Patos, Sirena) with more extensive sampling. Results: The dataset consisted of 78 747 specimens, of which 2 096 were identified only to the order level. The remaining 76 650 specimens were classified to the family level (n = 48 families), genus, species, or morphospecies. Species and morphospecies were distributed across 37 families. The alpha and beta diversity varied across localities for the 12 families of moths and butterflies that were present in the six localities selected. In general, Piedras Blancas, Rancho Quemado, and Sirena stand out as the most diverse localities. The richness of species varied among different families. For most families Agujas, Los Patos, and Sirena contained more species, but some other families showed a different pattern. Conclusion: Differences in the diversity of moths and butterflies over a northern-southern gradient likely correspond to species (individuals within species) adapted to different biotic (e.g., availability of host plants and food resources) and abiotic (e.g., microclimatic conditions associated to the complex topography of the region) conditions. Despite the large effort made by INBio in knowing and mapping the biodiversity of Costa Rica, and the economic and biological importance of the biodiversity, there are still a huge number of species to be known, named, and properly used.

AB  - Understanding trophic cascades in terrestrial wildlife communities is a major challenge because these systems are difficult to sample properly. We show how a tradition of non-random sampling has confounded this understanding in a textbook system (Yellowstone National Park) where carnivore [Canis lupus (wolf)] recovery is associated with a trophic cascade involving changes in herbivore [Cervus canadensis (elk)] behaviour and density that promote plant regeneration. Long-term data indicate a practice of sampling only the tallest young plants overestimated regeneration of overstory aspen (Populus tremuloides) by a factor of 4-7 compared to random sampling because it favoured plants taller than the preferred browsing height of elk and overlooked non-regenerating aspen stands. Random sampling described a trophic cascade, but it was weaker than the one that non-random sampling described. Our findings highlight the critical importance of basic sampling principles (e.g. randomisation) for achieving an accurate understanding of trophic cascades in terrestrial wildlife systems.

AB  - BackgroundThe Luchuan pig is an indigenous breed from Luchuan County, China, with cultural and genetic significance. However, traditional knowledge and conservation status have not been systematically documented.MethodsUsing ethnobiological methods, we surveyed 72 Luchuan pig farmers in 7 townships during 2021-2023. Semi-structured interviews and participant observation were conducted to document traditional knowledge and management practices.ResultsThe locals reported 51 plant species used as pig feed, with 30 wild species. Growth-stage-specific feeding and seasonal adjustment practices were documented. We recorded 62 ethnoveterinary plant uses, mainly for treating pigs' heat stress and skin conditions. Luchuan pigs play central roles in local Hakka customs, rituals, and cuisine. Additonally, the new ecological farming models minimize the environmental impacts to the local community. However, there are still some challenges remained for conserving and promoting Luchuan pigs.ConclusionsThe Luchuan Hakka people possess rich traditional knowledge and management experience in raising Luchuan pigs. Our study provides extensive documentation of traditional knowledge and recommends integrating cultural and genetic aspects for sustaining this biocultural heritage. Findings can inform initiatives supporting local breed conservation globally.

AB  - The performance of Rumex nepalensis, an important medicinal herb, varies significantly among subalpine grasslands, shrublands and forest ecosystems in southwestern China. Plant-soil feedback is receiving increasing interest as an important driver influencing plant growth and population dynamics. However, the feedback effects of soils from different ecosystems on R. nepalensis remain poorly understood. A greenhouse experiment was carried out to identify the effects of different soil sources on the photosynthesis and biomass of R. nepalensis. R. nepalensis was grown in soils collected from the rooting zones of R. nepalensis (a grassland soil, RS treatment), Hippophae rhamnoides (a shrub soil, HS treatment), and Picea asperata (a forest soil, PS treatment). The chlorophyll contents, net photosynthetic rates, and biomasses of R. nepalensis differed significantly among the three soils and followed the order of RS > HS > PS. After soil sterilization, these plant parameters followed the order of RS > PS > HS. The total biomass was 16.5 times higher in sterilized PS than in unsterilized PS, indicating that the existence of soil microbes in P. asperata forest ecosystems could strongly inhibit R. nepalensis growth. The root to shoot biomass ratio of R. nepalensis was the highest in the sterilized PS but the lowest in the unsterilized PS, which showed that soil microbes in PS could change the biomass allocation. Constrained redundancy analysis and path analysis suggested that soil microbes could impact the growth of R. nepalensis via the activities of soil extracellular enzymes (e.g., beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG)) in live soils. The soil total soluble nitrogen concentration might be the main soil factor regulating R. nepalensis performance in sterilized soils. Our findings underline the importance of the soil microbes and nitrogen to R. nepalensis performance in natural ecosystems and will help to better predict plant population dynamics.

AB  - Host-microbiota interactions play critical roles in host development, immunity, metabolism, and behavior. However, information regarding host-microbiota interactions is limited in fishes due to their complex living environment. In the present study, an allodiploid hybrid fish derived from herbivorous Megalobrama amblycephala (female) x carnivorous Culter alburnus (male) was used to investigate the successional changes of the microbial communities and host-microbiota interactions during herbivorous and carnivorous dietary adaptations. The growth level was not significantly different in any developmental stage between the two diet groups of fish. The diversity and composition of the dominant microbial communities showed similar successional patterns in the early developmental stages, but significantly changed during the two dietary adaptations. A large number of bacterial communities coexisted in all developmental stages, whereas the abundance of some genera associated with metabolism, including Acinetobacter, Gemmobacter, Microbacterium, Vibrio, and Aeromonas, was higher in either diet groups of fish. Moreover, the abundance of phylum Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi was positively correlated with the host growth level. In addition, Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that the differentially expressed homologous genes in the intestine associated with cell growth, immunity, and metabolism were related to the dominant gut microbiota. Our results present evidence that host genetics-gut microbiota interactions contribute to dietary adaptation in hybrid fish, which also provides basic data for understanding the diversity of dietary adaptations and evolution in fish.

Today, wolves display considerable dietary plasticity over their range, characterised by their preferential consumption of large and medium-sized wild ungulates, supplemented by smaller prey, including small mammals, fish and plant foods. However, the origins of this dietary flexibility (arguably the key to the wolf's long persistence) are poorly understood in terms of responses to different drivers over the course of the Pleistocene, including changing climate, environment and competition from other large carnivores. Here, in the first study using direct palaeodietary measurements on British fossil wolves, carnivore competitors and potential prey species, we compare stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) evidence from three sites representing a late Middle Pleistocene interglacial (Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage [MIS] 7c-a, c.220-190ka BP), the early Devensian (last cold stage, MIS 5a, c.90-80ka BP) and the middle Devensian (MIS 3, c. 60-25ka BP). The results reveal clear patterns of changing wolf prey choice through time. Notwithstanding issues of collagen preservation obscuring some dietary choices in the oldest samples, both small and large prey (hare, horse) were taken by wolves in the MIS 7c-a interglacial, large prey only (reindeer, bison) during MIS 5a and a broader range of large prey items (horse, woolly rhinoceros, bison) during MIS 3. The results also reveal two further important aspects: (1) that where wolves and spotted hyaenas co-existed, they occupied the same dietary niche and the former was not outcompeted by the latter, and (2) that the stable isotope evidence indicates prey choices during MIS 7ca and MIS 3 that are not in synchrony with palaeodietary reconstructions from previous studies based on wolf cranio-dental morphology. This establishes for the first time a likely lag between changing predatory behaviour and morphological response but is interestingly not seen in the wolves from MIS 5a, where the prey choices are echoed by the cranio-dental morphology.

AB  - Sika deer (Cervus nippon) populations have damaged habitats, agricultural crops, and commercial forests in many parts of the world, including Asia, Europe, northern America, and New Zealand. Population management of sika deer is an important task in those areas. To better understand large-scale management and improve management efficiency, the authors estimated spatio-temporal changes of density distribution and population dynamics of a managed population of sika deer on Kyushu Island (approximately 36,750 km(2)), Japan. The authors estimated these changes by using fecal pellet count surveys conducted from 1995 to 2019 and results from a vector autoregressive spatio-temporal model. No decreasing trend of populations were observed at the island and prefectural scales, even though the management goal has been to reduce the population by half, and harvesting on the island increased annually until it reached about 110,000 sika deer in 2014. A possible explanation for the stable population dynamics is that the population used to determine the harvest number under the prefectural management plan was originally underestimated. This study highlights not only the difficulties of wide-area management of sika deer but also three important factors for successful management: reducing the risk of management failure, using an adaptive management approach, and appropriate management scale.

AB  - The Patagonian longfin squid Doryteuthis gahi has an annual life cycle with two seasonal cohorts (autumn and spring spawners). Previous studies estimated the trophic level of adult squid by stable isotope analysis of their muscle or gladius tissues, but few studies compared different sizes and spawning cohorts. In this study, mixed models were used to compare carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope signatures of muscle and gladius tissues of the autumn and spring spawning cohorts and squid of different sizes. A published isoscape model provided delta N-15 baselines to calculate the trophic level of D. gahi. Sampled herbivorous prey such as Euphausiacea, planktonic juveniles Munida gregaria and salps Ihlea supported the trophic level estimates. The autumn spawning cohort had higher delta C-13 values than the spring spawning cohort. delta N-15 values increased with increasing dorsal mantle length, suggesting an ontogenetic change towards larger prey. Muscle tissue was enriched in N-15 but slightly depleted in C-13 compared to gladius tissue. Adult squid had an estimated trophic level of similar to 3.2, with no significant differences between spawning cohorts. Stable isotope values followed a seasonal trend, with lower delta N-15 values and lower delta C-13 value between July and September. Large individuals of the spring spawning cohort were found to have the least niche overlap with other groups of D. gahi. Our study of the trophic levels and ecology of D. gahi can provide important information on its role in the food chain and can build the basis of studies on interaction with other species, and the impact of environmental changes on their populations. This information can inform the development of management strategies aimed at preserving the balance of the ecosystem and ensuring its sustainable use.

AB  - In 2018, the U.S. National Park Service announced a controversial plan to translocate 20-30 gray wolves (Canis lupus) to Isle Royale National Park to increase genetic diversity and ultimately the dwindling wolf population. Media were restricted physical access during the translocations, citing safety concerns for the wolves and management team, as well as logistical challenges because of the remoteness of the park. Given these restrictions, we used interviews and quantitative analyses of news stories and press releases to examine what communication strategies the National Park Service and its partners deployed and how access restriction affected the way news outlets covered the events. By identifying source diversity groups, we found U.S. government sources were predominately featured with few other source types included, and that coverage heavily relied on press release information. We discuss the implications of this communication strategy and potential consequences for access restrictions when covering divisive events in remote locations.

AB  - Based on the sampling of wild boars preferred habitat in north-eastern of Taihang Mountains around Beijing, China, we analysed the factors affecting their habitat selection using resource selection functions (RSFs) and principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that the number of stumps (2.22 +/- 0.62) in used sites was significantly higher (0.95 +/- 0.27) (P < 0.05) than in the random sample plots, while the ground plant cover was significantly lower (35.26 +/- 6.56 %, 61.04 +/- 2.92 %, P 0.05). In addition, wild boar preferred the mid-altitude (500-1000 m) habitat with more arbours (81.48 %, 50-100), away from the community (500 m, 66.70 %) and far anthropogenic dispersion (1500 m, 51.85 %). The selection and preference of habitat factors reflect the ecological needs for food, water and shelter. In order to reduce the intrusion of wild boars in forest and farmland areas, we propose to change the distribution of water sources and remove nearby key water source sites if necessary, which can also reduce human wildlife conflicts and economic losses.Y

AB  - We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the consequences of violating statistical assumptions of distance sampling (DS) on the bias and precision of population estimates of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Distance sampling is a method for estimating the density of organisms using a distribution of observed distances to individuals. A key assumption of DS is that sampling transects are randomly located with respect to the population being sampled. Most DS transects used in National Parks follow roads and trails, which are not positioned randomly. We constructed spatially explicit simulations of surveys using 7 different types of deer spatial distributions and 3 survey designs. A significant interaction between survey type and deer distribution type explained most of the variation in population estimates across simulations and this interaction was also a significant predictor of the coefficient of variation (CV) of population estimates. Simulation results suggested that 1) non-road surveys were more robust to bias than were road surveys, 2) effectiveness of each of 3 survey types was dependent on the way deer were distributed across the landscape, and 3) non-road surveys produced unbiased estimates of populations affected by roads, whereas road surveys did not. The results of our study suggest that DS surveys using pre-existing roads and trails have potential biases resulting from study design, something that could be considered by land managers when constructing surveys.

AB  - This study compares the amount of available biomass for wild herbivores (red deer (Cervus elaphus L.), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.), and hare (Lepus europaeus Pallas)) depending on three different types of forest silvicultural systems-presented using the example of beech and spruce stands in wintertime. During the winter period, spruce provided ten times more biomass for herbivores than beech. However, beech provided more metabolizable energy, 7.38 MJ/kg on average, whereas spruce only provided 6.57 MJ/kg. From the point of view of "risk of damage by herbivores", artificial regeneration suffered the worst damage after using the Clear Cutting method of forest regeneration, as there was the least amount of biomass available, and thus, herbivores caused the greatest damage. On average, 12% of shoots were damaged in clearings. Most at risk was young forest vegetation up to 1 m tall. In summer, the area was overgrown with available plants, but in winter, the herbivores focused mainly on eating woody shoots. Damage to the natural regeneration when using the Shelterwood Cutting and Strip Cutting regeneration methods ranged up to 3%. At the same time, a high amount of available biomass was measured there, most likely due to its frequent natural regeneration. Thus, both types of trees regenerated in this way were not as susceptible to damage by herbivores as when regenerated using the Clear Cutting method.

AB  - The Indian subcontinent has witnessed disproportionate declines in large mammalian herbivore communities. The northern swamp deer (Rucervus duvaucelii duvaucelii) exemplifies the conservation challenges of typical non-protected area species, where apart from distribution status other ecological information is limited for the upper Gangetic basin population. We combined elements of radio-telemetry and conservation genetics to evaluate dispersal patterns, population connectivity and assess genetic variation and inbreeding status of this population living across a highly human-dominated area. We genetically identified 266 unique swamp deer and further analyses revealed presence of two spatially-admixed genetic lineages with moderate heterozygosity (H-o=0.51, SD = 0.10) and low inbreeding (F-IS = 0.128) status. Multidisciplinary evidence suggests that the small, isolated grassland patches between Jhilmil Jheel Conservation Reserve (JJCR) and Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary (HWLS) are highly preferred by swamp deer during migrations and are genetically connected. The southern part of the area in HWLS showed early signatures of genetic discontinuity that require immediate conservation attention. We hypothesized that the human settlement history of this landscape, river dynamics and species' ability to negotiate various pressures and disperse has helped to maintain such connectivity. While these signatures are encouraging for this small, isolated cervid population, careful management interventions are required to ensure the integrity and functionality of this landscape. We recommend a scientifically robust population estimation approach across this landscape and multi-stakeholder-driven strategies to augment population and habitat recovery, combat poaching, plantation and riverscape management to ensure long-term survival of this species.

AB  - Mycorrhizal symbiosis influences plant growth and nutrition and can affect the performance of insect herbivores, but these effects are context-dependent. This study aims to investigate the influence of nitrogen fertilization and mycorrhizal symbiosis on maize and Spodoptera exigua performance and to explore the potential underlying mechanisms. Mycorrhiza promoted maize growth and reduced S. exigua performance, but these effects were dependent on nitrogen availability. We then assessed whether the consequences for S. exigua were mediated by its gut microbiota. Neither nitrogen nor mycorrhization affected S. exigua gut bacterial community. Reduced herbivore performance was instead potentially due to the effects of nitrogen-mycorrhiza interaction on the plant nutritional value.

AB  - Parrotfishes contribute to important reef processes through their feeding. Individuals may join groups with distinctive social behavior, with unknown implications for their feeding ecology and, ultimately, their functional roles in reef systems. Using Scarus iseri populations in Isla Colon, Panama, we investigated whether individuals belonging to the two main social groups formed by this species ('Territorial' and 'Stationary' groups) differed in their feeding preferences. Territorial groups had access to a diversity of potential food sources, yet showed selectivity for feeding on sandy substrate. Stationary groups showed high selectivity for filamentous algae, despite this resource being less available for this group than for territorial individuals. Initial phase fish had higher bite rates on plants than terminal phase individuals, while the latter had higher bite rates on soft substrata and sponges, both indicating detritus consumption. Parrotfish sociobiology may therefore influence their relative ecosystem impact, with territorial and terminal individuals in both social groups more involved in the detrital food web and stationary groups contributing to a greater extent on algal removal.

AB  - This study aims to explore the effects of climate on the performance and offspring development of aged Merino sheep relocated from an arid, cold environment with harsh grazing conditions to a dry, temperate-cold valley with irrigated pasture production. We utilized time series data from merino sheep in a dry temperate-cold climate in southern Argentina to characterize their growth curves, assess the impact of climate on performance, and compare offspring growth with maternal growth. Our approach involved developing a dynamic model, a non-autonomous differential equation growth curve based on the widely used Brody model. The model considered variables such as local temperature, age, sex, origin, and pregnancy status to determine the optimal combination of parameters for sheep growth in our dataset. The results have shown that moving the old sheep from the steppe to the valley resulted in an increase of an average of 1 kg in weight, but their offspring had an asymptotic weight of 65 kg, 17 kg more than their mothers. The optimum temperature for the growth rate was 15.7+/-0.56 C and 8.7+/-6.3C for the asymptotic weight.

AB  - Insect herbivory on fossil angiosperm leaves was recorded from the upper Lower Cretaceous Zhonggou Formation in the Hanxia Section of the Jiuquan Basin, Gansu Province, NW China. Four functional feeding groups, including hole feeding, margin feeding, skeletonisation, and galling were recognised on nine fossil angiosperm leaves belonging to three species of eudicot. Ten insect damage types (DTs), including DT01, DT02, DT03, DT12, DT14, DT15, DT26, DT32, DT34, and DT61, were identified based on the insect damage morphotypes. Combined with the fossil records of insects reported from the Lower Cretaceous Zhonggou Formation of Jiuquan Basin, these suggest that there were various herbivorous insects that are related to the insect DTs, such as Blattoidea, Hemiptera, Diptera, Orthoptera, and Coleopterathe, which can related to the insects DTs, and indicate a diversified herbivorous insectangiosperm community in Jiuquan Basin during the late Early Cretaceous. Moreover, the diversified terrestrial ecosystem and fluctuating wet and dry climate in Jiuquan Basin during the late Early Cretaceous, would provide a suitable condition for the radiation of herbaceous angiosperms in Jiuquan Basin during the Aptian-Albian gap and promoting the coevolution of early angiosperms and their related herbivores.

AB  - Management interventions are pivotal in shaping the ecosystems, particularly grassland habitats. This study examines the effects of cutting and burning treatments on vegetation composition, physical properties, and herbivore utilization patterns in Baghaura grassland, situated within Bardia National Park, Nepal. The study considers three treatment plots: cutting only, both cutting and burning, and burning only. Vegetation composition is evaluated using the point intercept method within 1 x 1 m quadrats. Grass samples are collected and weighed for fresh weight determination. Subsequently, samples are separated into green leaf, green stem, dead leaf, and dead stem components, and biomass and leaf-stem proportion are calculated. The burned plots, characterized by Imperata cylindrica dominance, exhibit the highest species diversity. Furthermore, the burned-only plots demonstrate significantly greater species height. Cut-only plots display a higher proportion of green leaves and green stems, while the burned-only plots exhibit higher mean dry biomass in dead leaves and dead stems. Grazing intensity is notably higher in the cut-and-burned plots. The regression model (y = -1.4095x + 98.4948) indicates a subtle, statistically nonsignificant relationship (R2 = 0.0395, p = 0.3205) between grazing intensity and grass height with low grazer diversity (H ' = 0.7). The study suggests that implementing small-scale cutting followed by controlled burning during the dry season can provide herbivores with fresh, high-quality forage throughout the year, thereby meeting their nutritional needs. These findings enhance our understanding of the effects of management interventions on grassland ecosystems and can inform the development of sustainable conservation strategies for similar habitats.

AB  - Although Aphrophora nr. permutata (Hemiptera: Aphrophoridae) is a reported vector of the plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa (Wells) (Xanthomonadales: Xanthomonadaceae), its ecology and role in Pierce's disease dynamics in coastal California vineyards are poorly understood. From 2016 to 2020, we surveyed the abundance of A. nr. permutata nymphs among potential host plants along the vineyard floor, the vineyard edges, and adjacent vegetation in vineyards in Napa and Sonoma county. In 2019 and 2020, vineyards adjacent to woodland habitat hosted larger A. nr. permutata populations than those next to riparian habitat, while in 2017 and 2018, the nymphal populations were similar among riparian and woodland sites. Among 2020 plant cover taxa, nymph abundance was positively associated with Helminthotheca echioides, Vicia sativa, and Daucus carota cover and negatively associated with Taraxacum officinale cover. In 2018 and 2019, we also tracked early-season occurrence and development of A. nr. permutata nymphs among potential host plants. Analyses showed a significant effect of site, year, and plant taxa on the first detection of nymphs and a significant effect of site and year on the estimated development time between first and fifth instars. In 2019, we conducted grapevine to grapevine X. fastidiosa transmission experiments with individuals and groups of five A. nr. permutata adults. In the transmission experiment, 5% (3 of 60) individual A. nr. permutata and 7.7% (1 of 13) of groups successfully transmitted X. fastidiosa. This study provides preliminary evidence of potential host plant associations with A. nr permutata abundance and phenology that should be explored further with field and greenhouse-based approaches.

AB  - Knowledge of animal responses to fire is fundamental to wildlife management in fire-prone ecosystems. Fire can influence the occurrence of large herbivores by altering the structure and composition of vegetation. However, how fire affects herbivore occurrence in many ecosystems is poorly understood. Large herbivores may be attracted to burnt areas due to higher foraging quality. Conversely, herbivores may avoid burnt areas due to heightened predation risk. We tested the influence of vegetation type and fire history variables on the occurrence of macropods at Booderee National Park in south-eastern Australia. We documented macropod occurrence at 107 long-term monitoring sites using spotlighting surveys conducted between 2003 and 2019. We modelled relationships between the occurrence of the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) and the swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) with three fire history variables; time since fire, fire frequency and burn context (the proportion of the area surrounding each site that was recently burnt), as well as their interaction with vegetation type. We found both macropod species selected recently burnt sites, likely due to a higher abundance of preferred plants at these sites. Increasing fire frequency was associated with a reduced occurrence of the eastern grey kangaroo. The occurrence of both macropod species was significantly higher in forest sites, possibly reflecting higher foraging quality of grass and shrub species compared to woodland, heathland and shrubland sites. We suggest that if fire is used as a management tool, it is important to recognise potential feedbacks from increased foraging pressure from large herbivores. Future fire management will need to avoid burning areas of sensitive vegetation if local herbivores display pyric herbivory responses, and/or avoid small-scale burns, which may concentrate foraging pressure.

AB  - A new Choiromyces species was discovered at local wild mushroom markets in Songpan County, Sichuan, southwest China where it has been considered as a Chinese white truffle. Based on both morphological and phylogenetic analyses, the collection was described as Choiromyces sichuanensis sp. nov. This study confirms the occurrence of members of Choiromyces in China. In addition, the mycorrhizal synthesis via spore inoculation between C. sichuanensis and Pinus armandii or two Picea species of Pi. likiangensis and Pi. crassifolia was attempted in a greenhouse. Both morphoanatomical and molecular analyses evidenced well-developed mycorrhization between C. sichuanensis and P. armandii, but not in Picea seedlings. Our current study provides data about the species diversity and mycorrhizal research of this genus for further studies. In addition, a successful mycorrhization between C. sichuanensis and selected tree species, irrespective of Pinus genus or other plant species, would broaden the set of species for a successful mycorrhization in greenhouse conditions and potential outplanting for cultivation purposes.

AB  - Essential oils (EOs) are mixtures of volatile organic compounds that mediate plant interactions and are also appreciated for their biological properties in aromatic plants. However, the study of EOs in wild plants with biological activity has been neglected. Ipomoea murucoides is a wild species with allelopathic and insecticide activities; however, the climate factors associated with EOs and their role in intra- and interspecific interactions are still unknown. We investigated the effects of temperature, rain, and solar irradiance for two years on the EOs of I. murucoides and documented the effect of herbivory (without, <20%, >20%, and mechanical damage) on their composition. We evaluated the receptivity to possible infochemicals in conspecific and congeneric neighbors to I. murucoides plants exposed to methyl jasmonate (MeJA), herbivory by Ogdoecosta biannularis and without an elicitor. We measured the stomatal density and aperture in the second leaf generation of the neighbor plants. The year and herbivory >20% affected the composition of EOs. Nerolidol could be a biological marker for herbivory. We concluded that herbivory and rain irregularity contribute to EOs changing. The response in the stomatal density in plants not consumed by I. pauciflora but near I. murucoides under MeJA or herbivory gives evidence of interspecific plant-plant communication.

AB  - Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are increasing in many parts of the world and vary considerably among lakes. As a result, it is important to understand the effects of DOC on zooplankton, which are a key component of freshwater food webs. Deep chlorophyll maxima (DCMs) also are common in many lakes and numerous studies suggest that they may be an important resource for zooplankton. In a survey of eight boreal lakes spanning a gradient of DOC (3.5-9.2 mg/L), we assessed variations in the occurrence of DCMs, zooplankton biomass and their use of basal resources using stable isotopes of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and hydrogen (H). DCMs occurred only in lakes with lower DOC concentrations and Bayesian stable isotope mixing models indicated that they contributed between 22% and 72% of the assimilated diet of zooplankton. Food quality as indicated by C:P and chlorophyll a: C ratios increased with depth and in DCMs. The proportion of C ultimately derived by zooplankton from terrestrial sources increased from 6% to 27% with DOC. Zooplankton biomass among lakes declined with increasing DOC concentrations, the absence of DCMs and with increasing allochthony. Our results suggest that increasing inputs of DOC may suppress zooplankton in many lakes by affecting both resource quality and the availability of metalimnetic phytoplankton resources. Because zooplankton occupy a central position in freshwater food webs, declines in their biomass may further affect phytoplankton dynamics and fish productivity.

AB  - Centella asiatica is a traditional herbaceous plant with numerous beneficial effects, widely known for its medicinal and cosmetic applications. Maximizing its growth can lead to beneficial effects, by focusing on the use of its active compounds. The use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is known to be an alternative to chemical fertilizers. In this study, we used the PGPR Priestia megaterium HY-01 to increase the yield of C. asiatica. In vitro assays showed that HY-01 exhibited plant growth-promoting activities (IAA production, denitrification, phosphate solubilization, and urease activity). Genomic analyses also showed that the strain has plant growth-promoting-related genes that corroborate with the different PGP activities found in the assays. This strain was subsequently used in field experiments to test its effectiveness on the growth of C. asiatica. After four months of application, leaf and root samples were collected to measure the plant growth rate. Moreover, we checked the rhizosphere microbiome between the treated and non-treated plots. Our results suggest that treatment with Hyang-yak-01 not only improved the growth of C. asiatica (leaf length, leaf weight, leaf width, root length, root width, and chlorophyll content) but also influenced the rhizosphere microbiome. Biodiversity was higher in the treated group, and the bacterial composition was also different from the control group.

AB  - Wild boar (Sus scrofa) is one of the most damaging invasive species in the world and can have a profound impact on the distribution of native species. Nevertheless, there still are limitations on the species' current fine-scale spatial information, which is needed to develop effective management measures. Here, we used Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and niche overlap analysis to estimate potential conflict areas between the wild boar and the native southern pudu (Pudu puda), which is a bioindicator of the forest conservation status within the Nahuel Huapi National Park (NHNP), Argentina. The two species' environmental niche overlaps by 40%, which results in a wide geographical overlap between wild boar and pudu distributions. The distribution model predicted that the wild boar potential distribution occupies 22% of the national park and overlaps up to 67% with the pudu distribution, which in turn occupies 20% of the park. Based on our models, we classified 12% of the park as extreme management priority areas, because both species are present. High priority areas, where wild boars have the potential to invade but will not overlap with pudu populations, represent 10% of the park. Medium priority areas, where wild boars do not threaten pudu populations, and low priority areas, with no potential presence of either species, are 8% and 68%, respectively. The results of this study show how SDMs developed at local scales can support the management and monitoring of native and invasive species and help guide the allocation of efforts and resources for management actions focused on protected areas.

AB  - In the southeastern Mongolian Plateau, climate records show drastic changes during the early Holocene and ecological environment underwent extensive amelioration. Meanwhile, a marked decline in residential mobility and an increase in occupational intensity suggest that hunter-gatherers in this region underwent important shifts in their subsistence strategies. This paper examines climate variability and environmental changes during the early Holocene (8.7-7.1 cal ka BP) and their impact on subsistence strategies at the Xinglong site by integrating archaeological, paleoenvironmental, macrobotanical, and faunal assemblage data. These chronologies indicate synchronous changes in climate amelioration, reduced mobility, a notable rise in the consumption of large ungulates, and a modest increase in millet cultivation. These multiple lines of evidence indicate that the warmer and wetter climate facilitated widespread forest expansion, leading to the formation of biomass-rich ecotones in the southeastern Mongolian Plateau. The forest-steppe environment enhanced the distribution and abundance of ungulates and caused resource amelioration likely enabled hunter-gatherers to decrease their residential mobility and concentrate on a narrower foraging spectrum. Millet cultivation was developing and was likely the concomitant of more settled lifeways, but millet starch could have been exploited at a very low level and contributed only minimally to the local economy.

AB  - Bats are a diverse and ecologically important group of mammals that play critical roles in ecosystems. Accurate identification is necessary to comprehend bat species' ecology and behavior to further the conservation of bats. Both phenotypic and genotypic methods have been used for bat identification, but their relative effectiveness remains unclear in the Afrotropics. This study compared the advantages and limitations of phenotypic and genotypic identification of bats to improve and ensure effective bat species identification. Bats were captured using mist nets within protected and unprotected areas in different vegetation zones in Nigeria. Morphological identification of all captured bats was done using the guide, Mammals of Africa. Genotypic identification was done by extracting genomic DNA and Sanger sequencing of the generated mtDNA PCR amplicons. We then compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the phenotypic to the genotypic outcomes of our identification. We trapped 91 bats, and the phenotypic identification of 90 individual species showed sensitivity ranges between 68% and 100%, except for Glauconycteris spp., whose sensitivity was low (14%). The specificity was generally good for all species > 96%. Phenotypic identification is accurate and reliable for most trapped bat species (Epomorphorus gambianus, Scotophilus spp., Micropteropus pusillus, Rhinolophus spp., Roussettus aegyptiacus, and Chaerephon spp.). However, phenotypic identification reveals its limitations in some bat species such as Banana pipistrellus and Glauconycteris spp., which had more variable results from their genetic characterization. Epomorphorus gambianus and Micropteropus pusillus had no distinct genetic differentiation in their mtDNA. This highlights the importance of using multiple methods for bat identification to ensure the most accurate results.

AB  - Sika deer (Cervus nippon) is the most abundant ruminant in the Japanese archipelago and has been the primary hunting target, including during the prehistoric ages. Abundant skeletal remains of sika deer have been excavated from archeological sites of the Jomon periods (ca. 15,000-2,400 BP). We reconstructed the feeding habits of sika deer from the Torihama Shell Midden site in Fukui Prefecture, western Japan. The Torihama site is one of the most well-preserved archeological sites of the Jomon period, and we investigated materials from the layers of the Early Jomon period (ca. 6,000 BP). In this study, we obtained three-dimensional tooth surface texture from the lower molars of excavated deer and measured microwear texture using international surface roughness parameters (ISO 25178-2) to infer their habitat use. Next, we estimated the percentage of grasses in the diet by using the reference dataset for extant sika deer with known diets. The results show that the Torihama deer overlapped with mixed feeding and grazing sika deer populations. Moreover, the proportion of grasses in the diet was estimated to be 50.7% on average but showed a wide range among the Torihama deer. This result implied that Torihama deer were mixed feeders of dicot leaves and grasses and had a flexible diet adapted to the vegetation of its habitat. Our results support the paleoenvironmental estimation that the Torihama Shell Midden site contained mixed vegetation of evergreen, deciduous, and coniferous trees around the Mikata Five Lakes in the Early Jomon period. These findings provide insights into the highly plastic diets of the extant sika deer in the Japanese archipelago.

AB  - Simple Summary In this paper, we study the inter-relationships among geography, climate, and genetics in Italian local cattle and sheep breeds. In terms of genetic diversity, geography (latitude and longitude) appears to play a larger role in sheep (26.4%) than that in cattle (13.8%). Once geography is accounted for, 10.1% of cattle genomic diversity and 13.3% of that of sheep are attributable to climatic effects. Stronger geographic effects in sheep can be related to a combination of higher predomestication genetic variability together with biological and productive specializations. The climate alone seems to have had less impact on the current genetic diversity in both species even if climate and geography are greatly confounded. Results confirm that both species are the result of complex evolutionary histories triggered by interactions between human needs and environmental conditions. Understanding the relationships among geography, climate, and genetics is increasingly important for animal farming and breeding. In this study, we examine these inter-relationships in the context of local cattle and sheep breeds distributed along the Italian territory. To this aim, we used redundancy analysis on genomic data from previous projects combined with geographical coordinates and corresponding climatic data. The effect of geographic factors (latitude and longitude) was more important in sheep (26.4%) than that in cattle (13.8%). Once geography had been partialled out of analysis, 10.1% of cattle genomic diversity and 13.3% of that of sheep could be ascribed to climatic effects. Stronger geographic effects in sheep can be related to a combination of higher pre-domestication genetic variability together with biological and productive specificities. Climate alone seems to have had less impact on current genetic diversity in both species, even if climate and geography are greatly confounded. Results confirm that both species are the result of complex evolutionary histories triggered by interactions between human needs and environmental conditions.

AB  - Temporal patterns in wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) correspond with animal behaviour and biology, predominantly occurring during breeding and dispersion seasons, as well as daily foraging and resting activities of animals. As a result, diverse taxonomic groups worldwide are affected by vehicle collisions, including reptiles, amphibians, mammals and birds. Ecologically, WVC results in population declines and can differentially affect animal populations. Yet, monitoring biodiversity and examining the factors influencing its alterations enable society to make informed decisions on conservation and enhance the management of human-wildlife conflicts. Effective mitigation techniques necessitate knowledge about the location and timing of traffic casualties involving wildlife. The objectives of this study were as follows: (i) to analyse the trends in WVC and (ii) to forecast future scenarios of WVC in the Hurungwe Safari Area (HSA), located in the Mid Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe. The study aims to develop evidence-based strategies tailored to the local context and feasibility for reducing WVC frequency and severity. We used WVC data for 22 different species collected by the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZPWMA), Marongora Field Station. This study performed a trend analysis and then forecast future WVC using time series methods. We used K-means to determine clusters in the species data. Time series forecasting was performed using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), a popular statistical method used for time series forecasting. Our results indicated an exponential growth in the number of WVC for some animal species, that is, civet, buffalo, hyena and waterbuck by the year 2030. Modelling trends in WVC is important for protecting wildlife, enhancing road safety and reducing economic costs. It informs conservation efforts, guides effective management strategies like wildlife crossings, and raises public awareness about the impact of driving on ecosystems. This data ultimately promotes coexistence between humans and wildlife.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is a serious social-ecological problem in Sri Lanka's elephant range regions, as between 200 and 400 elephants have been killed annually over the last years, and more than 1200 people have died from the consequences of elephant encounters within a decade. Crop foraging causes economic damage to farming households. The study aims to understand factors driving vulnerability to HEC among the population. Employing a cross-communal multi-item large-N field survey (N = 651), authors were able to describe living conditions and perceptions of Sri Lankan villagers affected by HEC. By running a multiple regression analysis with correlated variables, the study is able to correlate independent variables to vulnerability, namely socio-economic conditions, environmental change and land-use, and awareness. Furthermore, a vulnerability map has been created, identifying Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Matale, and Polonnaruwa districts as conflict hotspots. Private electric fences as a widespread protection measure were found to have unintended negative side-effects to non-protected households. The findings suggest the urgent need to upscale public policies mitigating the consequences of HEC on affected populations by reducing overall vulnerability to environmental hazards, including human-wildlife conflict.

AB  - Although birds have traditionally been considered anosmic, increasing evidence indicates that olfaction plays an important role in the foraging behaviours of insectivorous birds. Recent studies have shown that birds can exploit herbivore-induced plant volatiles and sexual pheromones of adult insects to locate their prey. Many insectivorous birds prey on immature insects, providing relevant ecosystem services as pest regulators in natural and agricultural ecosystems. We asked whether birds could rely on chemical cues emitted by the immature stages of insects to prey on them. To address this question, we performed field experiments to evaluate if insectivorous birds can detect the aggregation pheromone produced by the larvae of the carpenter worm, Chilecomadia valdiviana. Groups of five artificial larvae were placed in branches of 72 adult trees in a remnant fragment of a sclerophyllous forest in central Chile. Each grouping of larvae contained a rubber septum loaded with either larval pheromone as treatment or solvent alone as control. We found that the number of larvae damaged by bird pecks was significantly higher in groups with dispensers containing the larval extract than in control groups. Our results show that birds can rely on immature insect-derived chemical cues used for larvae aggregation to prey on them.

AB  - Climate change affects various scales of biotic interaction through phenological shifts. The emergence phenology of cicadas is ecologically important because these insects have large effects on the ecosystem as herbivores, as food resources, and in nutrient flux from subterranean resources. However, little is known about the weather factors affecting their emergence patterns in the field because their nymphal stages grow underground for several years. Here, we used long-term observation data on the first singing date (i.e. the first emergence of male individuals) of Graptopsaltria nigrofuscata, recorded by the Japan Meteorological Agency and citizen scientists throughout Japan, to (1) explore the most influential weather factors across a variety of time spans on the first singing date of G. nigrofuscata and (2) determine whether the temporal trend of the first singing date could be explained by temporal weather trends caused by climate change by using a state space model. Our results indicated that higher temperatures from midsummer to early winter in the previous year are bringing the cicadas' emergence forward, and the annual increase in temperature is causing the advancement of emergence patterns. Other weather factors, such as precipitation and humidity, did not have a strong effect. Our findings suggest that increased growth rates at the nymphal stage due to warming in the previous year influence cicada emergence timing. To understand the mechanisms of how rising temperatures are advancing cicada emergence, we need an approach based on the physiology and ecology of their nymphs.

AB  - The wooly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) and forest rhinoceros (Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis) were prominent representatives of the Middle and Late Pleistocene glacial and interglacial faunas of Eurasia. Their diet has traditionally been inferred on functional morphology of the dentition and skull. In rare cases, food remains are preserved in the fossas of the teeth or as gut content. New approaches to infer diet include the study of isotopes and mesowear. Here we apply all four methods to infer the diet of these emblematic rhinoceros' species and compare the food actually taken with the food available, as indicated by independent botanical data from the localities where the rhinoceros' fossils were found: Gorz acute accent ow Wielkopolski (Eemian) and Starunia (Middle Vistulian) as well as analysis of literature data. We also made inferences on the season of death of these individuals. Our results indicate that the woolly rhino in both Europe and Asia (Siberia) was mainly a grazer, although at different times of the year and depending on the region its diet was also supplemented by leaves of shrubs and trees. According to the results of isotope studies, there were important individual variations. The data show a clear seasonal variation in the isotope composition of this rhino's diet. In contrast, Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis was a browser, though its diet included low-growing vegetation. Its habitat consisted of various types of forests, from riparian to deciduous and mixed forests, and open areas. The diet of this species consisted of selected items of vegetation, also including plants growing near both flowing and standing waters. The food remains from the fossae of the teeth indicated flexible browsing, confirming the previous interpretations based on functional morphology and stable isotopes. Long-term data from mesowear and microwear across a wider range of S. kirchbergensis fossils indicate a more mixed diet with a browsing component. The different diets of both of rhinoceros reflect not only the different habitats, but also climate changes that occurred during the Late Pleistocene.

AB  - The primary goal of this study was to explore the social buffering effect that humans offer to goats and dogs with limited exposure to human socialization, particularly in situations involving interactions with unfamiliar humans. A total of 13 dogs and 14 goats were selected for the study, all of which had limited prior socialization with humans. Each animal was placed in a testing room with unfamiliar humans for 15 min. Three experimenters aimed to establish a comfortable environment, encouraging social interaction by offering food to the animals and assessing the animals' willingness to accept food and their response to being approached and petted. If both conditions were satisfied, the animals were classified as "social". If one or none of the conditions were met, the animals were classified as "not social". Cortisol levels were measured by collecting blood samples before and after the test. Non-parametric tests together with a GzLM showed that the effect of human social buffering in goats was different in comparison to dogs: goats exhibited higher cortisol levels after the test, while dogs did not show a significant change. Further analysis demonstrated that "social" goats had a lower likelihood of experiencing significant changes in cortisol levels than dogs. Thus, once human interactions are accepted, both species could benefit from social buffering. In summary, this study enhances our understanding of how dogs and goats respond to social interactions with humans in the social buffering effect.

KW  - Fighting
KW  - Intraspecific aggression
KW  - Wildlife capture
AB  - The public is occasionally concerned about the detrimental impact of wildlife research activities, particularly capture procedures such as the use of chemical immobilization. One of the risks inherent with chemical immobilization is aggression (or predation) to immobilized animals by conspecifics; yet, data on such occurrences are rarely reported in the literature. We chemically immobilized 25 dominant age-class, large-bodied adult male bison (Bison bison). We observed seven instances (28%) of dominant adult male bison attacking a conspecific that was lying down shortly after being chemically immobilized. Incidences of attacks by aggressive males were more frequent during ground-based versus helicopter-based captures, but this difference was not statistically significant. Contrary to our prediction, we found no difference in the frequency of attacks during mid-summer or late-winter. Our observations highlight the aggressive nature of dominant male bison toward conspecifics and serve as a cautionary note to others chemically immobilizing them. With a marked interest in restoring bison to, and better understanding their ecological role in, their native landscapes, it is anticipated that capturing bison for research and conservation purposes will become more common. We provide suggested best practices so that protocols may be implemented to reduce potential injuries to immobilized bison from conspecifics, and these may also apply to other large, aggressive ungulates.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between feeding selection by goats and changes in plant species abundance in the shrubland of a pine forest in Donana Natural Park along three years. The abundance of the shrub species was measured using the point-intercept method. Goat preferences for shrub species were determined through direct observation. Goats showed selective feeding, since their browsing behavior was not related to species abundance. Myrtus communis was the overall preferred species (almost half of the bites belonged to this species, despite its low abundance) throughout the monitored years and seasons. Half of the species were selected some years while discarded others; two species were never grazed (Daphne gnidium and Thymus mastichina) and nine others were always ingested below their abundance. Within a year, species were consumed in certain seasons but not in others. The detected changes in species abundance were not related to the feeding preferences of the goats. The influence that grazing selectivity exerts on vegetation composition and abundance has long been recognized, but our study suggests that the mechanical effect of grazing herbivores on vegetation (pawing, scratching, and lying) may portrait a more important role than attributed to date.

AB  - Aim: Organisms primarily influence ecosystems through their functional traits when they are physically active. Following the nocturnal bottleneck, the expansion of mammals into the daytime expanded mammalian functional diversity (FD), however there is also notable overlap in trait space across diel niches leading to redundant FD. We explore how the unique and redundant contribution of each diel niche varies spatially and in relation to natural variation in light and temperature.
   Location: Global.
   Taxon: Extant mammals.
   Methods: Based on five major functional traits (body mass, litter size, diet breadth, foraging strata, habitat breadth) for 5033 extant terrestrial mammals, we determine biogeographical variation in nocturnal, crepuscular, cathemeral and diurnal FD. We calculate the proportion of mammalian FD that is unique to each diel niche, and the proportion that is redundant across the daily cycle.
   Results: The diversification of mammals into the daytime resulted in the creation of new FD (28.5% of FD is not nocturnal; Lower Quartile 17.3%; Upper Quartile 38.2%). Most of this expansion occurred at higher latitudes where uniquely cathemeral FD dominates (> 55 degrees N, 41.1% of mammalian FD; Lower Quartile 33.3%, Upper Quartile 53.6%), associated with fewer hours of biologically useful moonlight and daylight. Where there are more hours of biologically useful daylight, unique diurnal FD is common. However, more than half of non-nocturnal FD is redundant, increasing ecosystem stability as different species carry out similar functions at different times of day, and suggesting that many mammals have not diversified far from their nocturnal ancestors.
   Main conclusions: Over much of the land surface more than a half of FD only occurs at night, underscoring the importance of nocturnal mammals for ecosystems. Understanding diel variation in FD not only informs on community structure and eco-system function but also on ecosystem functional persistence in the Anthropocene, with pressures at night being particularly concerning.

AB  - A female Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) harvested in West Tennessee (29 January 2024) in an area with high prevalence of chronic wasting disease (CWD), had 5 fetuses (3 males and 2 females). All fetuses had similar development (58 days old) determined by crown-rump length. We estimated conception occurred similar to 2 December 2023, typical for the area. This case suggests that high reproductive output might be possible even in the face of CWD. However, even with potentially high reproductive output, altered maternal behavior due to CWD infection could affect successful neonate recruitment.

AB  - Populations of feral goats Capra hircus Linnaeus, 1758, descended from escaped or released domesticates, are widespread in the islands of Greece. Although they behave like truly wild goats, many of these animals belong to someone and are exploited by their owner(s) primarily as a source of low-cost but high-value meat. While poachers also kill some of these animals for domestic consumption, many owners capture larger groups alive in traps or drives and then release most females but retain most males for sale to urban butchers. Apart from the status of many feral goats as private property, the distinction between such animals and nearby domestic herds is often obscured by the escape or release of domesticates, by the capture and taming of feral individuals, and by the provision of water and perhaps fodder to discourage feral groups from dispersing. Using information from interviews with herders and trappers, supplemented by first-hand observations, we first describe the formation, behaviour and management of recent feral goat populations on the southern Greek islands of Crete, Kythera and Proti. Although the radical changes in rural demography and land use of recent decades have facilitated the expansion of feral goat populations, the mass capture of these animals by trapping or driving is clearly not a recent innovation. We then discuss possible lessons from these observations for the formation of feral populations and for the management of wild, feral and domestic goats in prehistory.

AB  - The taxonomy-based response pattern of macroinvertebrates to pollution gradient is well established, with tolerant taxa increasing in impacted conditions, while sensitive taxa increase with decreasing deterioration, typical of rural pollution. This study identified rural indicator and sensitive traits of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa by examining their trait distribution pattern in relation to rural pollution. Physicochemical parameters and EPT were sampled seasonally from August 2016 to April 2017. Eight sites were selected and categorised into three site groups. Site group 1 served as the least impacted site group and Site group 2 as the moderately influenced, whereas Site group 3 was the most impacted. Seven traits were selected and categorised into 27 trait modalities. The response of EPT traits to physicochemical parameters was analysed using the simultaneous analysis of the information contained in three tables: R (environmental characteristics of samples), L (taxa distribution across samples) and Q (species traits) (RLQ) and confirmed with fourth-corner analysis. Three trait attributes, large (10-20 mm), swimming, shredding, streamlined body shape and large body size (>= 10-20), were considered tolerant signature traits of semi-urban pollution. These trait attributes were associated with the influenced Site group 3 and indicated a significant positive affinity with at least one physicochemical indicator of increasing semi-urban pollution (NH4-N, NO3-N, NO2-N, PO4-P, EC, turbidity, temperature and pH). Conversely, small body size (<10 mm), operculate gills, spherical body shape and a preference for sediments were correlated with the least influenced Site group 1 and were considered sensitive traits of semi-urban disturbance. Overall, this study provided critical insights into EPT responses to disturbance, revealing that semi-urban activities influenced EPT traits differently in the Tsitsa River.

AB  - Insects of forensic importance can be attracted to crime scenes, thus aiding in the estimation of post-mortem interval (PMI). For this, knowledge about the entomofauna of each particular region is essential, along with their life cycle, ecological and biological characteristics, and taxonomic identity. This study aimed to survey the sarcophagid flies of the genus Peckia Robineau-Desvoidy occurring in a fragment of the Atlantic Forest in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. For this purpose, pig carcasses were used as bait and monitored throughout their decomposition process during both dry and rainy seasons. Seven species of Peckia were recorded: P. chrysostoma (Wiedemann), P. collusor (Curran & Walley), P. lambens (Wiedemann), P. intermutans (Walker), P. pexata (Wulp), P. anguilla (Curran & Walley), and P. tridentata (Hall). The highest occurrence of Peckia species was observed in the gaseous and initial decomposition phases (dry period), as well as advanced decomposition (rainy period). Temperature, humidity, and rainfall showed a tendency to directly influence the duration of the carcass decomposition phases.

AB  - The long-spined sea urchin Diadema africanum is a key herbivore in sublittoral ecosystems of the Eastern Atlantic, mediating shifts between productive macroalgae beds and barren grounds. Historical increases in D. africanum densities have been linked to predator overfishing and rising temperatures favoring settlement. However, recurrent mass mortality events have recently decimated populations, reversing benthic communities from urchin barrens to macroalgal beds across the Canary Islands. We investigated the influence of biological factors, such as adult density and macroalgal coverage, alongside physical variables, including substrate rugosity, crevice presence, and slope, on the distribution of newly settled D. africanum prior to mass mortality events. In 2004, when D. africanum densities were high, early recruits were positively associated with adult habitats and negatively with areas dominated by erect, non-calcareous algae. These findings highlight that a combination of adult conspecifics, high structural complexity, and crustose coralline algae favored D. africanum recruitment, while macroalgal habitats were unfavorable. Surveys in 2024, following recurrent mass mortalities, revealed a dramatic phase shift from encrusting corallines to erect algae and a recruitment failure of D. africanum. This recent shift has altered former favorable habitats, potentially compromising recruit survival and hindering population recovery.

AB  - Female sperm storage (FSS) has been reported in Chondrichthyans species, and involves the prolonged maintenance of viable sperm after mating events, prior to egg fertilization. Along with multiple paternity (MP-female producing offspring of multiple males within the same litter), FSS has been hypothesized to be related to the increased reproductive fitness of cartilaginous fish lineages. The present study aimed to investigate if: (1) are FSS and MP evolutionarily related and share the same evolutionary history in Chondrichthyes? (2) How is the presence of FSS implied by extinction and speciation rates and thus related to the current species diversity of the group? To answer these questions, we obtained FSS and MP records for Chondrichthyes species from the literature and performed ancestral reconstruction analyses for each character in the phylogenetic tree. We employed MEDUSA and MiSSE to determine if the shifts in diversification rates were related to the characters along the phylogeny. Finally, we utilized HiSSE to calculate the net diversity rates for observed and unobserved states. The ancestral reconstruction indicates that both characters are plesiomorphic for the group; FSS is suggested to be absent in Lamniformes and Rhinopristiformes, whereas MP may be absent in Galeocerdo cuvier. MEDUSA and MiSSE revealed that all clades lacking FSS showed no increase in rates, while there was a higher diversification rates in clades with FSS. HiSSE identified lower net diversity rates in clades lacking FSS associated with hidden states. Therefore, FSS absence seems to contribute to increased extinction rates by reducing diversity among the Chondrichthyes.

AB  - Narrow-leaved ash (Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl), a highly valued European forest tree species, has been severely affected by a large-scale decline, which is most probably driven by a complex of multiple interacting factors including fungi, which contribute to and accelerate this process. Red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) can be considered as one of the contributing factors, as they inflict damage on the stems of young trees by stripping the bark. These wounds not only represent suitable entry points for fungi which can cause tissue necroses and decomposition, they can lead to changes in the wood structure as well. The aims of this research were to analyze chosen parameters of bark stripping wounds in narrow-leaved ash stands, identify fungi present in the tissue exposed by wounding, and inspect the effect of wounding on the wood structure. Bark stripping was observed on ash trees from 2 cm up to 18 cm of DBH and between 0.1 m and 1.9 m of stem height. The most susceptible trees were those with an average DBH of 5 +/- 2.5 cm. On most of the ash trees (51%), one-third to two-thirds of the circumference was damaged. In wounded tissue, 174 fungal isolates were found, most of which belonged to known endophytic fungi from the genera Trichoderma, Fusarium, and Clonostachys. It was observed that earlywood cells in the wounding zone had narrower lumens compared to ones in adjacent healthy zone with regard to different trees and stem heights.

AB  - Introduction and Objective. Lyme borreliosis (LB) causes hundreds of thousands of new human infections worldwide annually. This is the first study connecting the LB risk to children with environmental factors. Materials and Method. The potential impacts were assessed of environmental factors (deer density in forests, coverage of potential broadleaved forest plant communities, urbanization index) on the number of LB cases in children. Analysis covered the medical records of 196 children diagnosed with LB (ICD- A69.2) from 1 January 2012 - 30 October 2021 in Wielkopolska Province (Poland). Results. All examined factors were positively correlated with LB cases. The highest correlation with the number of patients diagnosed with LB was presented by the degree of urbanization (percentage of the population living in cities in the total inhabitants of the study region). The number of cases was much higher in the second research period (2017-2021). Conclusions. The number of LB cases in children is increasing as the coverage of potential broadleaved forest plant communities increases. The number of cases among males is positively correlated with the coverage. Deer density is positively correlated with the number of LB cases among children - the higher the deer density, the greater the risk of LB infection. LB cases in children are positively correlated with the urbanization index - the more people that live in cities, the the risk to children of LB infection.

AB  - Plants have long-lasting and complex interactions with herbivores, including insects and mammals. In response to high herbivory rates, plants either tolerate biomass loss or develop several defence mechanisms, such as physical defence. The resource availability hypothesis (RAH) predicts that plant defence investment is dependent on resource availability and plant's life history. However, the effect of resource availability on plant investment in defence is mediated through biotic pressure. We tested the effects of soil qualities and browsing pressure on the physical defence and reproductive investments in Acacia sieberiana at the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve in West Africa. We selected six populations, including three in the Pendjari River floodplain where soil moisture is high but with high elephant browsing pressure, and three populations on the plateau in the hunting zone where soils are drier and relatively poorer with a lower density of elephants. We found greater investment in physical defence for trees in the floodplain. Furthermore, A. sieberiana trees produced less fruit in the floodplain than in the plateau. Contrary to the predictions of the RAH, we found more and longer thorns in populations in the richer floodplains than on the plateau. This was linked to higher elephant browsing pressure in the floodplains. This physical defence was probably induced to cope with the episodic but high levels of herbivory observed in this environment. Surprisingly, the negative influence of thorn number and size on the likelihood of elephant damage was observed only in the rich floodplains and not in plateau sites. Altogether, our study demonstrates that the influence of resource availability (soil moisture, pH, and fertility) in shaping plant physical defence can be outweighed by high herbivory pressure.
   Plants defend themselves from herbivores using features like thorns. According to the resource availability hypothesis, a plant's defenses depend on soil quality and its life cycle. We studied Acacia sieberiana in West Africa's Pendjari Biosphere Reserve, comparing two areas: fertile floodplains with many elephants and drier plateaus with fewer elephants. Surprisingly, trees in the richer floodplains had more and longer thorns but fewer fruits. This suggests that high herbivore pressure, rather than just soil quality, influences plant defense. Interestingly, thorns helped reduce elephant damage only in the floodplain. Our study shows that herbivore pressure can be more important than soil quality in shaping plant defense strategies.

AB  - Seagrasses, a unique group of marine flowering plants, profoundly influence the marine environment by providing an array of critical ecological functions. They serve as the foundational habitat for several endangered and charismatic species, including sea cows, sea turtles, and sea horses, and are often referred to as coastal canaries. In comparison to boreal and tropical forests, they have an amazing ability for carbon storage. Despite their long evolutionary history, they are threatened by rapid environmental changes caused by climate change and human activity. Long-term monitoring is required to comprehend the changes in this fragile ecosystem. Conventional field survey methods for collecting long-term data are laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Hence, this work builds a time-series dataset of the seagrass coverage in the Kalpeni lagoon from 2003 to 2020 by analysing Landsat data on Google Earth Engine. We also evaluated the temporal changes in the seagrass coverage of the study area and studied the influence of selected environmental factors on the seagrass coverage. We observed a negative relationship between sea surface temperature and seagrass coverage. The results revealed a decline in more than 99% of seagrass coverage, indicating an alarming threat to this seagrass ecosystem of the region. With such a drastic shrinkage in the seagrass coverage, the hysteresis must be strong, and the recovery of these meadows may require intensive interventions. By establishing a long-term time series database of seagrass coverage, our study also opens up new avenues for future ecological research on the seagrass meadows.

AB  - Newly assimilated carbon (C) allocated to soil is the main source of C and energy for microorganisms and has a high impact on long-term C sequestration. The removal of aboveground plant biomass by grazing may increase, decrease or have no effects on belowground C allocation. Therefore, it is important to understand how grazing modifies the allocation of assimilates between above-and belowground. An in situ C-13 labeling experiment was carried out in a temperate grassland with three grazing intensities: no grazing, moderate grazing (6 sheep.ha(- 1)) and heavy grazing (9 sheep.ha(- 1)). Eighty-one days after C-13 labeling, plants under moderate grazing allocated more recently assimilated C (8.2% of assimilated C-13) to shoots than plants under no grazing and heavy grazing (5.5% each). Substantially more C-13 was allocated belowground under moderate grazing, and was mainly stored in roots (11%) and soil (15%), than under no grazing (3.2% in roots and 7.5% in soil) and heavy grazing (4.1% in roots and 6.9% in soil). Moderate and heavy grazing release less (CO2)-C-13 (15%) through root and rhizomicrobial respiration than no grazing (19%). Without grazing, the decomposition rate of rhizodeposits and their utilization for root and rhizomicrobial respiration (0.22 +/- 0.07 day(-1)) was much faster than that under grazing (moderate grazing: 0.050 +/- 0.01 day (-1), heavy grazing: 0.065 +/- 0.01 day (-1)). In summary, moderate grazing increases the stock and stability of newly assimilated C of soil by increasing belowground allocation of photosynthates and decreasing CO2 efflux from soil. Therefore, compared to without and heavy grazing (9 sheep.ha(- 1)), moderate grazing (6 sheep.ha(- 1)) may be more suitable for soil C sequestration in temperate grasslands.

AB  - Endemic Hawaiian forest birds have experienced dramatic population declines. The Big Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex (Refuge Complex) was established for the conservation of endangered forest birds and their habitats. Surveys have been conducted at two units of the Refuge Complex to monitor forest bird populations and their response to management actions. We analyzed survey data from 1987 to 2019 at the Hakalau Forest Unit (HFU) and from 1995 to 2019 at the Kona Forest Unit (KFU). We analyzed three strata at HFU: open-forest, closed-forest, and afforested-pasture, and two strata at KFU: upper (>1,524 m elevation) and lower (<,1,524 m). In all years, 'i'iwi Vestiaria coccinea, 'apapane Himatione sanguinea, and Hawai'i 'amakihi Chlorodrepanis virens virens were the most abundant species at HFU. Three endangered forest bird species, Hawai'i 'akepa Loxops coccineus, 'alawi Loxops mana (also known as Hawai'i creeper) and 'akiapola'au Hemignathus wilsoni, had much lower densities. The most abundant species at KFU was 'apapane, followed by Hawai'i 'amakihi at much lower densities. We found a continuation of several trends observed in previous analyses at HFU up to 2012, with most species' trends upward in afforested-pasture stratum, stable in the open-forest stratum, and downward in the closed-forest stratum. However, more species were showing downward trends in all three strata during the most recent decade. Results were mixed at KFU, with most species' trends downward in the upper stratum and upward in the lower stratum. Populations of endangered species were either locally extirpated at KFU or in numbers too low to reliably estimate population abundance. The Refuge Complex is important for conservation of forest birds on Hawai'i Island. Our results show that HFU supports the majority of three endangered forest bird species. Threats to forest birds at the Refuge Complex appear to be having a negative impact. These threats include habitat loss, disease, feral ungulates, and nonnative predators. Continuing and enhancing management actions, such as forest restoration and removal of invasive species, could help mitigate these impacts and allow the Refuge Complex to remain a key site for forest bird conservation in Hawai'i.

AB  - Zostera muelleri is an abundant seagrass species distributed through intertidal and shallow subtidal waters on the subtropical coasts of Australia. The vertical distribution of Zostera is likely defined by tidal influences, particularly desiccation and light reduction stresses. These stresses were expected to affect the flowering of Z. muelleri; however, it is difficult to quantify the effects of tidal inundation with field studies due to multiple confounding environmental factors affecting flowering (e.g., water temperature, herbivory, nutrients). A laboratory aquarium experiment compared the effects of two levels of tidal height (intertidal and subtidal) and light intensity (shaded and unshaded) on flowering timing, abundance, the ratio between flowering shoots and vegetative shoots, the morphology and duration of flower development. The earliest and greatest flowering intensity was recorded in the subtidal-unshaded group, with no flowers observed in the intertidal-shaded group. Notably, the peak flowering time was the same across shaded and unshaded treatments. Shading prolonged the timing of the first flowering and reduced the density of flowering shoots and spathes, while tidal inundation had a more significant effect on the density of flowering shoots and the density of spathes. Results showed that Z. muelleri could flower under low light conditions or tidal stress but not when exposed to both stresses simultaneously in a laboratory 'nursery setting'. Therefore, applying subtidal-unshaded conditions appears to be beneficial for seagrass nurseries aimed at improved flower abundance despite the plants previously being collected from and adapted to intertidal meadows. Further studies that explore the suitable conditions for triggering and optimising the flowering will be beneficial in designing cost-effective seagrass nurseries.

AB  - Background: The gut microbiota plays an important role in primates, which may be associated with their habitat. In Malaysia, pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) live in different habitat environments and have traditionally been used for coconut plucking for more than a century. There is currently no information regarding the gut microbiota of this macaque in Malaysia. To address this oversight, this study employed a fecal metabarcoding approach to determine the gut microbiota composition of pig-tailed macaques and establish how these microbial communities correspond with the macaque external environments of residential area, forest edge, and fragmented forest. Methods: To determine this connection, 300 paired-end sequences of 16S rRNA were amplified and sequenced using the MiSeq platform. Results: In the pig-tailed macaque fecal samples, we identified 17 phyla, 40 orders, 52 families, 101 genera, and 139 species of bacteria. The most prevalent bacterial families in the gut of pig-tailed macaques were Firmicutes (6.31%) and Proteobacteria (0.69%). Our analysis did not identify a significant difference between the type of environmental habitat and the gut microbiota composition of these macaques. Conclusions: There was great variation in the population richness and bacterial community structure. The abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria helps this macaque digest food more easily while maintaining a healthy gut microbiota diversity. Exploring the gut microbiota provides an initial effort to support pig-tailed macaque conservation in the future.

AB  - Introduction: Seagrasses are a key habitat for the green turtle (Chelonia mydas). At Cahuita National Park (CNP), seagrass have been monitored since 1999. Over time, the canopy complexity of the dominant seagrass species (Thalassia testudinum) has declined. However, seagrass spatial variability and the turtle's interactions with meadows at Cahuita remain poorly studied. Objective: We aimed to assess the distribution and composition of seagrass meadows in CNP and quantify the intensity of C. mydas herbivory. Methods: Seagrass meadows characterization was done in 2019 and 2021. Sampling points were distributed systematically every 200 m. When seagrasses were present, points were sampled every 50 m for greater resolution. Water depth and seagrass cover by species were quantified at each point. In 2019, additional metrics included sediment carbon content, shoot density, photosynthetic biomass, and leaf area index. Sea turtle density was calculated using aerial video transects, and abundance estimated from density and reef lagoon area. Herbivory rates were estimated by seagrass tethering experiments and underwater videos in 2021. Results: Seagrass meadows were found at depths between 0.4 and 5.3 m. Mean sediment organic carbon was 2 % and increased slightly at higher seagrass biomass. Carbonate was 40 % and did not vary spatially. Seagrasses at CNP were dominated by T. testudinum, with minimal presence of Syringodium filiforme, Halodule wrightii, and Halophila decipiens. Between 2019 and 2021, seagrass cover declined by 52 %, from 54.7 to 24.7 ha in the area sampled both years. Sea turtle length ranged from 20 to 80 cm. Estimated density was 0.6 +/- 0.6 turtles/ha and abundance was 36 to 211 turtles within the reef lagoon. Underwater videos showed that C. mydas is the main herbivore of T. testudinum in the meadow, with herbivory rates from 12 to 182 cm(2)/s. Conclusions: Chelonia mydas plays a significant role in shaping seagrass canopy complexity and distribution at CNP, highlighting the need for integrated ecological monitoring and conservation efforts, particularly under the challenges posed by climate change and anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - Ungulates play a large role in shaping ecosystems and communities by influencing plant composition, structure, and productivity. We investigated the summer diets of feral burros in two ecosystems in which they are found in the United States: a subtropical desert in Arizona and a temperate juniper shrubland in Utah. Between 24 June and 16 July of 2019, we gathered 50 burro fecal samples from each location and used plant DNA metabarcoding to determine the burros' diets. We found that during our sampling period the burros in the Sonoran Desert consumed a higher proportion of woody browse and had a narrower dietary niche breadth and lower degree of diet diversity compared to the burros in the juniper shrubland ecosystem, where the burros consumed higher proportions of graminoids and forbs and had a higher diet diversity index and broader dietary niche breadth. The burros in the Sonoran Desert relied primarily on Prosopis spp. (mesquite) and Poaceae grasses, whereas the burros in the juniper shrubland relied on a wider variety of forb and grass species, likely due to the greater variability in the forage species temporally and spatially available in that temperate ecosystem. We found that feral burros are highly adaptable with respect to diet and appear to be employing a mixed feeding strategy, similar to their ancestor, the African wild ass, to meet their nutritional needs in whichever ecosystem they are found.

AB  - razing affects grasslands worldwide. However, the global patterns and general mechanisms of how grazing affects plant reproductive traits are poorly understood, especially in the context of different climates and grazing duration. We conducted a meta-analysis of 114 independent grazing studies worldwide that measured plant reproductive traits in grasslands. The results showed that the number of tillers of plant increased under grazing. Grazing did not affect the number of reproductive branches of forbs, but significantly reduced the number of reproductive branches of grasses. Grazing increased the number of vegetative branches of all plants and reduced the proportion of reproductive branches. Grazing significantly reduced the number of flowers in forbs. Seed yield in the two plant functional groups was reduced compared with no-grazing. Under grazing, the sexual reproduction of grasses decreased much more substantially than that of forbs. This may be due to biomass allocation pattern of grasses under grazing (i.e., belowground versus aboveground).Under grazing, plants tended to adopt rapid, low-input asexual reproduction rather than long-term, high-risk sexual reproduction. This study represents the first large-scale evaluation of plant reproductive trait responses under grazing and demonstrates that grazing inhibits sexual reproduction and promotes asexual reproduction. The effect of grazing on plant sexual reproduction was influenced by grazing intensity, mean annual precipitation, and grazing duration. These results will assist in the development of sustainable grazing management strategies to improve the balance between human welfare and grassland ecosystem health.

AB  - The objective of the current study was to determine the prevalence of contagious ecthyma along with the association of various risk factors in goats and sheep through qualitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This technique is sensitive and cost-effective for detecting disease in large no of animals. For this purpose, serum samples from 350 goats and 91 sheep were collected on the 20th day post-infection for detection of antibodies, and essential information related to potential risk factors was collected through a questionnaire from fourteen districts of Punjab, Pakistan. Serologically positive samples were processed through PCR for confirmation using scab samples by identifying the GIF/IL-2 gene. This study found an overall 13.2% seroprevalence of contagious ecthyma infection, indicating a higher percentage in goats (14.6%) than in sheep (7.7%). In goats, the significant association (P<0.0001) of contagious ecthyma infection with seroprevalence was found in 4 districts; however, contagious ecthyma antibodies titers were found positive in sheep of Muzaffargarh only. The risk factors such as young age, female gender, grazing without stall feeding, presence of lesions on the lips, and injuries on the skin caused by prickly trees and cotton stubbles were found significantly (p<0.05) associated factors in goats; and age and injuries on the skin were important associated risk factors in sheep. The maximum occurrence of contagious ecthyma infection was found from September to December in both goats and sheep; having a significant association in goats (& chi;2=39.2) (P<0.0001). Likewise, the purchase of new animals and mixing up with the existing animals without quarantine measures cause contagious ecthyma to prevail in the vicinity. Moreover, contagious ecthyma antibodies were detected by ELISA kits up to 50th day post-infection in the current study. This is the first study that reported the seroprevalence of contagious ecthyma in Punjab, Pakistan. Comprehension of risk variables will not only be helpful to develop awareness amongst farmers but will also provide guidelines to government officials about the prevention and control of the disease.

AB  - Herbivory can threaten the persistence of palatable plant species and the fauna communities dependent upon diverse and structurally complex post-fire regeneration. This study compared the introduction success of the nationally Endangered Chalky Wattle (Acacia cretacea) in the South Australian mallee under different fire and browsing treatments. Recruitment from both seed and seedlings was enhanced by fire and was absolutely conditional on protection from herbivory, even though domestic stock were excluded and numbers of kangaroos, goats and rabbits were lower than regional averages. Several other fire-responsive plant species, including the ecologically important Porcupine Grass or spinifex (Triodia irritans), which provides habitat for threatened fauna, also benefited from herbivore exclusion. Conservation of wild populations of Chalky Wattle and other palatable fire-responsive plants, and the ecosystem processes they enable, is likely to be conditional on significant and sustained reduction in herbivore populations, especially kangaroos, following wildfires or control burns in the mallee.

AB  - Background: Data on the movement behavior of translocated wild pigs is needed to develop appropriate response strategies for containing and eliminating new source populations following translocation events. We conducted experimental trials to compare the home range establishment and space-use metrics, including the number of days and distance traveled before becoming range residents, for wild pigs translocated with their social group and individually.
   Results: We found wild pigs translocated with their social group made less extensive movements away from the release location and established a stable home range similar to 5 days faster than those translocated individually. We also examined how habitat quality impacted the home range sizes of translocated wild pigs and found wild pigs maintained larger ranges in areas with higher proportion of low-quality habitat.
   Conclusion: Collectively, our findings suggest translocations of invasive wild pigs have a greater probability of establishing a viable population near the release site when habitat quality is high and when released with members of their social unit compared to individuals moved independent of their social group or to low-quality habitat. However, all wild pigs translocated in our study made extensive movements from their release location, highlighting the potential for single translocation events of either individuals or groups to have far-reaching consequences within a much broader landscape beyond the location where they are released. These results highlight the challenges associated with containing populations in areas where illegal introduction of wild pigs occurs, and the need for rapid response once releases are identified.

AB  - Rumen microorganisms play important roles in the healthy growth of yaks. This study investigated changes in yak rumen micro-biome during natural grazing at the warm seasons and supplementary feeding at cold seasons. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and metagenome analysis were conducted to investigate the structures and functions of yak rumen microbial com-munities. The results indicated that Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the most abundant phyla. In addition, Bacteroidetes might play a more important role than Firmicutes during the supplementary feeding stage (spring and winter), but less during natural grazing stage (summer and autumn). KEGG analysis showed that the amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, glycolysis/ gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and fructose and mannose metabolism were the main pathways in the microbial community, which were significantly different between seasons. The carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme) annotation revealed that cellulose was an important carbon source for microorganisms in yak rumen. Glycoside hydro-lases (GHs) were the most abundant class of CAZymes, followed by glycosyl transferases (GTs), which were important to diges-tion of oil, cellulose, and hemicellulose in food. These results contribute to the understanding of microbial components and functions in yak rumen.

AB  - High human population growth and rapid urbanisation, particularly in Africa, have led to an increased interest in the impacts of this land-use change on bird communities. The African Bird Atlas Project, where species presence lists are collected in pentads, is a valuable source of data with which to explore the extent of these impacts. Here, for the first-time, we test for differences in species richness patterns across 50 matched pentad pairs from sub-Saharan Africa classified as either urban (or semi-urban) and rural. We found that species richness was lowest in pentads classified as urban (mean +/- SD: 132 +/- 59 species), compared with rural (172 +/- 54). However, species richness was similar, compared with rural pentads, when levels of urbanisation were maintained at intermediate levels (semi-urban: 141 +/- 69). Surprisingly, we found no significant differences in functional diversity measures between any land-use categories. Across most major dietary guilds (carnivores, herbivores, insectivores, granivores) species richness was lower in urbanised pentads and species were often small. However, the overall biomass of these guilds was similar between urbanised and non-urbanised areas, indicating the presence of common urban exploiter species. This resulted in no differences in functional diversity overall. Pollinators and piscivores showed little difference in metrics between rural and urban pentads. According to a model of the functional traits we consider, an African urban exploiter species is best described by being a scavenger, and less likely to be a habitat specialist, but fill a variety of niches. The urban spatial planning implications are that rare and range-restricted species in proximity to cities, as well as large bird species, will require particular attention and conservation measures as African cities continue to expand. Species richness could be maintained with intermediate levels of urban infrastructure development.

AB  - Animal hair is a useful biomonitoring tool for assessing the occurrence of trace elements in ecosystems. Essential (chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, and zinc) and nonessential (aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, palladium, platinum, rubidium, tin, and vanadium) elements were investigated in hair of badger (Meles meles), wild boar (Sus scrofa), marmot (Marmota marmota), wolf (Canis lupus), fox (Vulpes vulpes) and deer (Cervus elaphus) from Northwestern Italy. Badger was found to be the highest bioaccumulator of metals, while wolf, fox and deer recorded the lowest values. Essential elements contribute in higher degree to the sum of metals for all species except for wild boar. Results have shown that animals with omnivorous diet such as badger, marmot and wild boar have metal content (especially Al, As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, V) higher than carnivores (wolf and fox) and herbivores (deer) and could represent an effective sentinel of environmental exposure to metals.

AB  - Tree form evolution is an important ecological specialization for woody species, but its evolutionary process with adaptation is poorly understood, especially on the microevolutionary scale. Daphniphyllum macropodum comprises two varieties: a tree variety growing in a warm temperate climate with light snowfall and a shrub variety growing in a cool temperate climate with heavy snowfall in Japan. Chloroplast DNA variations and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms across D. macropodum populations and D. teijsmannii as an outgroup were used to reveal the evolutionary process of the shrub variety. Population genetic analysis indicated that the two varieties diverged but were weakly differentiated. Approximate Bayesian computation analysis supported a scenario that assumed migration between the tree variety and the southern populations of the shrub variety. We found migration between the two varieties where the distributions of the two varieties are in contact, and it is concordant with higher tree height in the southern populations of the shrub variety than the northern populations. The genetic divergence between the two varieties was associated with snowfall. The heavy snowfall climate is considered to have developed since the middle Quaternary in this region. The estimated divergence time between the two varieties suggests that the evolution of the two varieties may be concordant with such paleoclimatic change.

AB  - Animal diet and health influence fitness, making individual variation in these markers essential for understanding how individuals and populations respond to their environments. Faecal and hair samples provide a record of this information and can be non-invasively collected from animals in the field. However, physiology, diet, and susceptibility to parasitic infections vary within individuals, requiring repeated samples from individuals. We developed a technique using biotelemetry data for individual identification of non-invasive faecal material and hair sampled from female elk (Cervus canadensis). We non-invasively collected individually genotyped faecal and hair samples from resting sites, then compared the accuracy of supervised machine learning models to predict the individual identities of the samples. We found both the tightness of global positioning system point clusters and activity level surrounding the sample allowed us to positively identify samples belonging to specific individuals with 77% accuracy. Our approach can be applied to other populations for which biotelemetry data are available and is potentially adaptable for other species. Furthermore, application of our approach will reduce the need for individual identification of non-invasive samples using genetic analysis, which is costly and prone to low recovery success. Increased access to physiological, dietary, and health information obtainable from individual non-invasive samples will strengthen our understanding of animal responses to their environments.

AB  - Plant belowground buds are important agents for examining the effects of small semi-fossorial herbivores on plant population regeneration in perennial grasslands. In this study, we used the plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) as a focally small semi-fossorial herbivore to investigate its effects on tiller, rhizome, and root-derived bud densities. The study was conducted in alpine grasslands from Gangcha County to Gonghe County in Qinghai Province, China. A paired experimental design was employed, with 20 plots established in areas with plateau pikas and 20 plots plateau pikas established in without plateau pikas. The results indicated that total belowground, rhizome, and root-derived bud densities were 49.31%, 84.68%, and 91.73% higher in the presence than in absence of plateau pikas, respectively. The contributions of rhizome and root-derived buds to total belowground buds were 8% and 3% higher in the presence than in the absence of plateau pikas, respectively, whereas the contribution of tiller buds to total belowground buds was 11% lower in the presence than in the absence of plateau pikas. Total belowground buds were positively correlated with soil moisture and negatively correlated with plant aboveground biomass in the absence of plateau pikas. In contrast, they were positively correlated with total soil phosphorus and rhizome biomass in the presence of plateau pikas. These results suggested that the phosphorus supplementation is an alternative way to improve plant population regeneration and facilitate alpine grassland sustainability when plateau pikas are present in alpine grasslands.

AB  - The pressures of global change acting on wild plants and animals include exposure to environmental toxins, the introduction of non-native species, and climate change. Relatively few studies have been reported in which these three main classes of stressors have been examined simultaneously, allowing for the possibility of synergistic effects in an experimental context. In this study, we exposed caterpillars of the Melissa blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa) to three concentrations of chlorantraniliprole, under three experimental climates, on a diet of a native or a non-native host plant throughout larval development in a fully factorial experiment. We find that high pesticide exposure and a non-native diet exhibit strong negative effects on caterpillars, resulting in 62% and 42% reduction in survival, respectively, while interactive effects tend to be weaker, ranging from 15% to 22% reduction in survival. Interactive effects have been shown to be strong in other contexts, but do not appear to be universal; however, our study shows that the cumulative effects of stressors acting in isolation (additively) are sufficiently strong to severely reduce survival and by extension population persistence in the wild.

AB  - The impact of climate change on insect pests is an emerging topic in forestry and forest science. This study investigates the relationships between two broadleaved forest pests - spongy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) and brown-tail moth (Euproctis chry-sorrhoea L.) - and oaks (Quercus sp.) as their hosts. Oak forests cover almost one-third of the total forest area of Serbia and are ecologicallyvery valuable, but at the same time vulnerable, as being affected in adverse ways by several primary pests and pathogens. Since 1862, Serbia experienced several extremely large outbreaks of spongy moth with more than a hundred thousand hectares completely defoliated each time, while brown-tail moth occurred periodically with a much lower spatial extent. The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of UV radiation (UVR) and air tempe-rature on spongy moth and brown-tail moth in Serbian forests. We used simulations of the coupled regional climate model EBU-POM (Eta Belgrade University-Princeton Ocean Model) for the A1B scenario for the period 2001-2030 as main input and diffe-rent statistical methods to explore relationships between observations of pest spread and climate change impacts. Our results suggest(i) increasing the areas affected by spongy moth due to its sensitivity on UVR in May, and(ii) altitudinal spreading of brown-tail moth population up to 800 - 1000 m.This research indicates that in situ forest observations in Serbia are not only affected by climate change, but also by the combined effect of climate on forest pests. For fur-ther research, we recommend exploring other forest stressors or dieback phenomena in European forests by applying the same or similar regional climate model dataset.

AB  - Invasive species pose a major threat to global diversity, and once they are well established their eradication typically becomes unfeasible. However, certain natural mechanisms can increase the resistance of native communities to invaders and can be used to guide effective management policies. Both competition and herbivory have been identified as potential biotic resistance mechanisms that can limit plant invasiveness, but it is still under debate to what extent they might be effective against well-established invaders. Surprisingly, whereas biotic mechanisms are known to interact strongly, most studies to date have examined single biotic mechanisms separately, which likely influences our understanding of the strength and effectiveness of biotic resistance against invaders. Here we use long-term field data, benthic assemblage sampling, and exclusion experiments to assess the effect of native assemblage complexity and herbivory on the invasion dynamics of a successful invasive species, the alga Caulerpa cylindracea. A higher complexity of the native algal assemblage limited C. cylindracea invasion, probably through competition by canopy-forming and erect algae. Additionally, high herbivory pressure by the fish Sarpa salpa reduced C. cylindracea abundance by more than four times. However, long-term data of the invasion reflects that biotic resistance strength can vary across the invasion process and it is only where high assemblage complexity is concomitant with high herbivory pressure, that the most significant limitation is observed (synergistic effect). Overall, the findings reported in this study highlight that neglecting the interactions between biotic mechanisms during invasive processes and restricting the studied time scales may lead to underestimations of the true capacity of native assemblages to develop resistance to invaders.

AB  - 1. Despite numerous studies examining the fitness consequences of animal personalities, predictions concerning the relationship between personality and survival are not consistent with empirical observations. Theory predicts that individuals who are risky (i.e. bold, active and aggressive) should have higher rates of mortality; however, empirical evidence shows high levels of variation in behaviour-survival relationships in wild populations.
   2. We suggest that this mismatch between predictions under theory and empirical observations results from environmental contingencies that drive heterogeneity in selection. This uncertainty may constrain any universal directional relationships between personality traits and survival. Specifically, we hypothesize that spatiotemporal fluctuations in perceived risk that arise from variability in refuge abundance and competitor density alter the relationship between personality traits and survival.
   3. In a large-scale manipulative experiment, we trapped four small mammal species in five subsequent years across six forest stands treated with different management practices in Maine, United States. Stands all occur within the same experimental forest but contain varying amounts of refuge and small mammal densities fluctuate over time and space. We quantified the effects of habitat structure and competitor density on the relationship between personality traits and survival to assess whether directional relationships differed depending on environmental contingencies.
   4. In the two most abundant species, deer mice and southern red-backed voles, risky behaviours (i.e. higher aggression and boldness) predicted apparent monthly survival probability. Mice that were more aggressive (less docile) had higher survival. Voles that were bolder (less timid) had higher survival, but in the risky forest stands only. Additionally, traits associated with stress coping and de-arousal increased survival probability in both species at high small mammal density but decreased survival at low density. In the two less abundant study species, there was no evidence for an effect of personality traits on survival.
   5. Our field experiment provides partial support for our hypothesis: that spatiotemporal fluctuations in refuge abundance and competitor density alter the relationship between personality traits and survival. Our findings also suggest that behaviours associated with stress coping and de-arousal may be subject to density-dependent selection and should be further assessed and incorporated into theory.

AB  - The inclusion of trees in pastures have emerged in recent years due to the benefits they generate towards livestock ecosystems. In the province of Chiloe, Chile, family farmers still maintain different designs that integrate the tree component and grasslands. The objective of this papper is to identify designs that integrate forestry components in livestock in the Chiloe Province, Los Lagos Region, Chile, to know the functionality attributed to them by family sheep farmers, and to verify if the participation of farmers in agroecological networks influences their perception of the benefits of silvopastoral systems (SSP). The present work identified 5 types of traditional SSP, and 8 benefits were associated with them by sheep farmers. The forest patch system is the most widespread in farms. Sheep farms under agroecological management have had greater adoption of forest patch SSP in relation to those that are not agroecological. Shade is the benefit most cited by ranchers and native species predominate in their designs.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of three insect larvae on decomposition abilities and survival rates in Experiment 1 or on pH, total nitrogen, total carbon, and C/N ratio in Experiment 2. A total of hatched 7,500 Tenebrio molitor (TM) larvae, hatched 501 Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis (PBS) larvae, and hatched 15,000 Ptecticus tenebrifer (PT) larvae were randomly subjected to three treatments with three replicates. The treatments were as follows: (1) TM, 5,000 g pig manure + 250 g TM larvae; (2) PBS, 5,000 g pig manure + 250 g PBS larvae; and (3) PT, 5,000 g pig manure + 250 g PT larvae. In Experiment 1, there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the decomposition abilities of the pig manure from the three insect larvae-treated groups for 15-30 days. No significant differences in survival rates were observed for any of the in all treatments over time. Decomposition ability and survival rates in pig manure were higher in the PT larvae group than in the PBS and PT larvae groups. In Experiment 2, three insect larvae-treated pig manure treatments had an effect on total nitrogen for 20 and 30 days, total carbon for 10 and 30 days, and C/N ratio for 20 and 30 days. Thus, our results suggest that the three insect larvae have the ability to decompose pig manure to increase for increasing survival rates or might represent a valuable alternative as organic fertilizer, which could increase the total nitrogen content and decrease C/N ratio.

AB  - Numerous gut microbial studies have focused on bacteria. However, archaea, viruses, fungi, protists, and nematodes are also regular residents of the gut ecosystem. Little is known about the composition and potential interactions among these six kingdoms in the same samples. Here, we unraveled the complex connection among them using approximately 123 gut metagenomes from 42 mammalian species (including carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores). We observed high variation in bacterial and fungal families and relatively low variation in archaea, viruses, protists, and nematodes. We found that some fungi in the mammalian intestine might come from environmental sources (e.g., soil and dietary plants), and some might be native to the intestine (e.g., the occurrence of Neocallimastigomycetes). The Methanobacteriaceae and Plasmodiidae families (archaea and protozoa, respectively) were predominant in these metagenomes, whereas Onchocercidae and Trichuridae were the two most common nematodes, and Siphoviridae and Myoviridae the two most common virus families in these mammalian gut metagenomes. Interestingly, most of the pairwise co-occurrence patterns were significantly positive among these six kingdoms, and significantly negative networks mainly occurred between fungi and prokaryotes (both bacteria and archaea). Our study revealed some inconvenient characteristics in the mammalian gut microorganism ecosystem: (1) the community formed by members of the analyzed kingdoms reflects the life history of the host and the potential threat posed by pathogenic protists and nematodes in mammals; and (2) the networks suggest the existence of predicted mutualism among members of these six kingdoms and of the predicted competition, mainly among fungi and other kingdoms.

AB  - Managing wildlife diseases is a constant challenge in wildlife management and may require increasing attention as climate change increases the range, spread, and transmission cycles of some of these diseases in North America. The present study quantified hunters' compliance with chronic wasting disease (CWD) risk-reduction practices across 26 deer management units (DMUs) in Ohio. We assessed self-reported, typical deer processing behaviors among hunters who reported hunting in and near the Disease Surveillance Area (DSA). Results indicate that noncompliance with deer processing recommendations was considerably higher in the DMU encompassing the DSA. Addressing noncompliance will likely require locally focused communication and outreach centered on the risk of CWD in the area. Communication that highlights the wider prevailing norms of the following recommendations (60-70% of Ohio hunters either take their deer to a processor or put unused parts in the trash or landfill) may influence behavior change, especially in combination with more tailored, culturally driven outreach.

AB  - Simple Summary Liquid-preserved boar semen is widely used in the pig breeding industry. Preservation and transportation can affect the fertilizing ability of sperm, reducing the efficiency of artificial insemination. Betaine, a natural plant extract, has been shown to benefit male fertility. However, it remains unclear whether it exerts a protective effect on liquid boar sperm during preservation and transportation. The results showed that the addition of appropriate amounts of betaine to boar semen extenders effectively mitigated the adverse effects of road transport and room temperature storage on sperm quality. Specifically, betaine supplementation showed significant protective effects against temperature fluctuation and vibration stress that inevitably occurred during transportation. The increased antioxidant capacity of boar sperm may underlie its beneficial effects. These findings offer a theoretical foundation for the use of betaine in artificial insemination procedures.Abstract Boar semen is commonly used in artificial insemination (AI) for pig breeding, but its quality can be negatively affected by liquid preservation and transportation, leading to reduced fertility rates. Vibration and temperature fluctuations are critical factors that significantly impact semen quality during storage and transportation, influencing the success rate of AI procedures. Betaine, a naturally occurring compound known for its role in maintaining male fertility, demonstrates potential for improving the preservation and transportation of liquid-preserved boar sperm. The present study demonstrated that betaine supplementation in the semen extenders at 0.5 mg/mL had a significant protective effect on boar sperm motility during storage at 17 degrees C for 3 to 5 days. During road transportation, 2.5 mg/mL betaine showed significant protective effects on boar sperm progressive motility, while 0.4 mg/mL betaine notably improved boar sperm mitochondrial activity and antioxidant capacity, and reduced lipid peroxidation damage. Simulation models also demonstrated that betaine supplementation increased the proportion of sperm displaying progressive motility and possessing intact acrosomes, regardless of the storage temperature (17 degrees C or 25 degrees C), and effectively mitigated the damage caused by vibration at a speed of 200 r/min. Overall, supplementing liquid-preserved boar semen extenders with betaine shows promise in mitigating damage to sperm quality during storage and transportation.

AB  - In Europe, the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) has suffered from intensive persecution due to competition with hunters, resulting in its extermination in the late 19th-early 20th century in most central and western European countries. Restoration of suitable prey and conservation efforts allowed the lynx to recolonize parts of its historical range. Understanding the predation patterns of one of the top European predators is crucial for setting appropriate conservation and management measures. Using GPS telemetry data from three resident lynx males in combination with camera trapping and snow tracking, we estimated kill rates, feeding and searching time and compared lynx impact to human harvest on wild ungulates. The average annual kill rates for each individual were 65, 73 and 81 ungulates/year; 17-30% of kills were parallel to other kills. Male lynx annual kill rates were equivalent to 8.59% (19.73% roe deer, 2.48% red deer, 0.32% wild boar) of the average annual human harvest within lynx home ranges. Our results provide the first insight into hunting and feeding behaviour of the Eurasian lynx in the Western Carpathians.

AB  - Forage cactus responds positively to organic fertilization. However, little is known about the mineralization dynamics of the various sources of existing organic fertilizers. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the release of nutrients from different manure types and the nutrient accumulation in forage cactus across different cropping systems. Different manure sources (cattle, goat, sheep, and broiler litter) were evaluated for the following cropping systems: (i) Gliricidia sepium intercropped with cactus cv. IPA-Sertania; (ii) Leucaena leucocephala intercropped with cactus cv. IPA-Sertania; and (iii) Cactus cv. IPA-Sertania in monoculture, in the tropical semiarid region of Brazil. The rate of decomposition and release of N, P, and K from manure was determined by incubating a litterbag, evaluated in different periods (0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 days). Broiler litter released the greatest amount of N and P. Sheep manure released the greatest amounts of K. The greatest accumulations of N, P, and K in cactus biomass occurred when broiler litter was applied. Cactus monoculture accumulated less N over 256 days, indicating that the presence of tree legumes favors the accumulation of N in cactus. Broiler litter promoted the best synchronism between N release and N uptake in different cropping systems.

AB  - Plankton represents the main source of carbon in marine ecosystems and is consequently an important gateway for contaminants into the marine food webs. During the MERITE- HIPPOCAMPE campaign in the Mediterranean Sea (April-May 2019), plankton was sampled from pumping and net tows at 10 stations from the French coast to the Gulf of Gabe`s (Tunisia) to obtain different size fractions in contrasted regions. This study combines various approaches, including biochemical analyses, analyses of stable isotope ratios (813C, 815N), cytometry analyses and mixing models (MixSiar) on size-fractions of phyto-and zooplankton from 0.7 to >2000 mu m. Pico-and nanoplankton represented a large energetic resource at the base of pelagic food webs. Proteins, lipids, and stable isotope ratios increased with size in zooplankton and were higher than in phytoplankton. Stable isotope ratios suggest different sources of carbon and nutrients at the base of the planktonic food webs depending on the coast and the offshore area. In addition, a link between productivity and trophic pathways was shown, with high trophic levels and low zooplankton biomass recorded in the offshore area. The results of our study highlight spatial variations of the trophic structure within the plankton size-fractions and will contribute to assess the role of the plankton as a biological pump of contaminants.

AB  - Heterogeneous pathogenic stress can shape major histocompatibility complex (MHC) diversity by influencing the functional plasticity of the immune response. Therefore, MHC diversity could reflect environmental stress, demonstrating its importance in uncovering the mechanisms of adaptive genetic variation. In this study, we combined neutral microsatellite loci, an immune-related MHC II-DRB locus, and climatic factors to unravel the mechanisms affecting the diversity and genetic differentiation of MHC genes in the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), a species with a wide geographical distribution that has three distinct genetic lineages in China. First, increased genetic differentiation at the MHC locus among populations compared using microsatellites indicated diversifying selection. Second, the genetic differentiation of MHC and microsatellites were significantly correlated, suggesting that demographic processes exist. However, MHC genetic differentiation was significantly correlated with geographical distance among populations, even after controlling for the neutral markers, suggesting a major effect of selection. Third, although the MHC genetic differentiation was larger than that for microsatellites, there was no significant difference in the genetic differentiation between the two markers among genetic lineages, indicating the effect of balancing selection. Fourth, combined with climatic factors, MHC diversity and supertypes showed significant correlations with temperature and precipitation, but not with the phylogeographic structure of R. ferrumequinum, suggesting an effect of local adaptation driven by climate on MHC diversity. Moreover, the number of MHC supertypes varied between populations and lineages, suggesting regional characteristics and support for local adaptation. Taken together, the results of our study provide insights into the adaptive evolutionary driving forces at different geographic scales in R. ferrumequinum. In addition, climate factors may have played a vital role in driving adaptive evolution in this species.

AB  - In northern Sweden, large forest areas are affected by extensive damage caused by moose, fungi, beetle and other biological pests. For non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners this leads to large losses of value, not only in economic terms but also in the form of loss of biodiversity and amenity values. Therefore, several research projects are underway to develop new silvicultural methods and other measures to reduce damage. However, a successful implementation of these will often depend on the willingness and knowledge of the forest owners. The objective of this study was, therefore, to elucidate NIPF owners' knowledge about forest damage and their preferences regarding forest management alternatives that potentially could mitigate the damage situation. Data were collected through a questionnaire that was distributed to a random sample of 1,177 NIPF owners in northern Sweden, and the response rate was 31% (n = 368). The results show that 19% of the NIPF owners did not know the current damage situation in their own forest. In addition, NIPF owners judged that their knowledge to identify damage themselves is quite limited, except for damage caused by moose. Regarding future management options, many were positive towards avoiding clear-cuts in suitable areas, while many were negative towards implementing alternative tree species such as larch and lodgepole pine. The study concludes that there is a clear need to inform and educate NIPF owners about forest damage, but also that there will be challenges in reaching all types of owners.

AB  - Simple Summary: African savannah elephants are able to greatly modify the vegetation around them through their foraging activities. Accordingly, studying the factors that affect elephant foraging behaviour during different seasons are important to understand their impact on the environment and will also aid in predicting how elephants might react to potential threats such as climate change and land transformation. This article aimed to reinforce current knowledge regarding elephant foraging behaviour by examining how the behaviour is affected across (a) season (wet versus dry); (b) time of day (before or after noon); (c) presence or absence of other elephants; and (d) reproductive state; for six adult elephant bulls monitored in Kruger National Park. Results indicated that elephant foraging behaviour is indeed affected by seasonal and social factors. This highlights how these animals are able to adjust their foraging behaviour during the day to aid in thermoregulation, or during different seasons to fulfil their nutritional requirements. Furthermore, this study opens the door for further research regarding how reproductive activity affects the foraging behaviour of male elephants.
   African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana) are well-known as ecosystem engineers with the ability to modify vegetation structure. The present study aimed to examine how male elephant foraging behaviour is affected across (a) season (wet versus dry); (b) time of day (before or after noon); (c) presence or absence of other elephants; and (d) reproductive state (musth versus no musth). Six radio-collared adult elephant bulls were observed twice per week from June 2007-June 2008 in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. Using generalized linear mixed effect modeling, results indicate that elephant bulls graze more during the wet season and browse more during the dry season. To potentially offset the costs associated with thermoregulation during the heat of the day, KNP elephants spent more time foraging during the morning, and more time resting during the afternoon. Male elephants also foraged significantly less when they were associated with females compared to when they were alone or with other males. This is likely due to male-female associations formed mainly for reproductive purposes, thus impeding on male foraging behaviours. In contrast, the condition of musth, defined by the presence of related physical signs, had no significant effect on foraging behaviour.

AB  - Excessive mineral fertilizer input results in little extra yield but exacerbates insect herbivory and affects environmental health and ecosystem services. The use of organic fertilizer is considered to have promise for mitigating those impacts. How organic fertilizer amendment modifies crop resistance to insect herbivory and modulates biocontrol services on a landscape scale has not been well studied. We conducted a series of field experiments on a large spatial scale with three fertilization regimes (mineral fertilizer, mineral fertilizer amended with organic matter, and no fertilizer control) in Shandong Province, northern China. Soil nutrient content, wheat plant metabolism, cereal aphid abundance, parasitism rate, and wheat yield were quantified. Maize straw amendment combined with mineral fertilization significantly reduced cereal aphid abundance and promoted parasitism during the peak aphid period, compared with mineral fertilizer alone and the no fertilizer control. Modeling simulations showed increased biological pest control when a larger proportion of fields were additionally treated with maize straw amendment. Foliar chemical analyses revealed that the types and content of plant free amino acids, rather than plant defensive compounds, most likely accounted for the variation in aphid abundance and biological control efficiency. A mineral fertilization regime plus plant straw amendment may promote wheat resistance to herbivory and benefit biocontrol via bottom-up effects. Heterogeneity in fertilizer regimes between fields may be the key ecological force shaping pest control at a landscape scale.

AB  - The loss of resource-rich non-crop habitat is a hypothesized driver of arthropod decline on farms, implying recovery with restoration. Alternatively, chronic arthropod loss may limit colonization to abundant taxa, especially crop pests. Here, we test the impact of restoring marginal farmland on agriculturally important arthropods on 13 conventional farms across a 10,000 km(2) region of central North America with approximately 92% crop cover. We examined local richness by habitat (crops, restored prairie, remnant forest), spatial turnover among habitat and farms, and regional comparisons between farm and non-farms using iNaturalist data. Sampling approximately 13,000 individuals identified to family or lower, restored prairie had twice the abundance of arthropods compared to crop and forest, with 44% of all families detected, 66% of beneficial families, and 94 unique taxa despite their recent construction (<10 years) and small size (similar to 9.6% of farm area). There was some compositional overlap between crop and prairie, while farm forest had mostly unique taxa. Larger restored areas supported more diverse and taxonomically uniform arthropod assemblages, while crop fields were family-depauperate with primarily herbivorous taxa. Unexpectedly, the abundance and richness of arthropods between farms with restored habitat and non-farm areas regionally were similar, although farms possessed more herbivorous species and fewer butterflies and aquatics. The extensive and rapid colonization of restored habitat by beneficial arthropods implies that conventional farms may be habitat limited for many taxa. Our work supports calls for farm redesign that includes habitat reconstruction, which can support arthropods with known benefits to food production.

AB  - The growing interest in fermented dairy products is due to their health-promoting properties. The use of milk kefir grains as a starter culture made it possible to obtain a product with a better nutritional and biological profile depending on the type of milk. Cow, buffalo, camel, donkey, goat, and sheep milk kefirs were prepared, and the changes in sugar, protein, and phenol content, fatty acid composition, including conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs), as well as antioxidant activity, determined by ABTS and FRAP assays, were evaluated and compared. The protein content of cow, buffalo, donkey, and sheep milk increased after 24 h of fermentation. The fatty acid profile showed a better concentration of saturated and unsaturated lipids in all fermented milks, except buffalo milk. The highest content of beneficial fatty acids, such as oleic, linoleic, and C18:2 conjugated linoleic acid, was found in the cow and sheep samples. All samples showed a better antioxidant capacity, goat milk having the highest value, with no correlation to the total phenolic content, which was highest in the buffalo sample (260.40 +/- 5.50 mu g GAE/mL). These findings suggested that microorganisms living symbiotically in kefir grains utilize nutrients from different types of milk with varying efficiency.

AB  - We investigated species composition, relative abundance, habitat association and density of small mammals in Maze National Park, Ethiopia. Data were collected using the capture-mark-recapture technique in three representative habitat types (grassland, bushland and riverine forest) from November 2021 to August 2022. Descriptive statistics and indices for diversity and evenness were used to analyse the data. A total of 679 rodents and insectivores were collected during a span of 2 646 trap nights. Of these, 534 (76.64%) individuals were newly captured, while 145 (23.36%) were recaptures. Overall trap success was 20.18%. Five species of rodents were captured: four from the family Muridae (Mastomys natalensis, Arvicanthis niloticus, Rattus rattus and Lemniscomys macculus) and one (Xerus rutilus) from the family Sciuridae; and one insectivore species (Elephantulus rufescens) from the family Macroscelididae. Mastomys natalensis (178; 33.3%) was the most abundant, while X. rutilus (1; 0.2%) and E. rufescens (1; 0.2%) were the least abundant. Small mammal species varied significantly with habitat types (chi 2 = 6.101, df = 2, p <= 0.05), with the highest count in the bushland habitat (197; 36.89 %) and the lowest in riverine forest (152; 28.46%). The bushland and riverine forest habitats supported the highest (H' = 1.04) and the lowest (H' = 0.506) diversity of small mammal species, respectively. A relatively high number of small mammal species were caught during the wet season (n = 336) compared to the dry season (n = 198). Future studies using more trapping grids covering additional habitat types and genetic analyses for small mammal species confirmation are necessary for a better understanding of the Park's small mammal fauna.

AB  - Community-based conservation (CBC) is a wildlife governance approach popular in areas projected to experience a decline in precipitation due to climate change. A survey of residents in four Namibian CBC areas found that the overwhelming majority of respondents felt that (a) a prolonged drought coincided with an increased rate of human-wildlife conflict (HWC), and (b) costs from HWC outweighed any CBC benefits they received. Perceptions of increased HWC frequency were negatively associated with the likelihood of respondents feeling that wildlife benefits exceeded costs. These findings raise questions about the impact of predicted climate change effects on CBC programs across much of the global south.

AB  - Deer abundance and occupancy areas are currently increasing worldwide, with unknown consequences for birds. Deer impacts on birds have mainly been assumed to be indirect through mechanisms that negatively influence vegetation complexity and reduce habitat quality. Information on the direct negative impacts on bird breeding success is scattered and rudimentary. Here we documented, through videos filmed with camera traps, non-native deer preying on bird nests. We supported this finding by investigating nest predator behaviour in other areas of the world both in the scientific literature and audio-visual platforms. We suggest that our scientific naturalist records and the collected information might reflect poorly understood deer behaviour, in both native and non-native populations. In areas with a high number of individuals, nest predation by deer could have severe consequences for native birds, causing serious alterations in their breeding biology. Future studies are needed to address questions about the consequences of an increase in deer density on avian populations.

AB  - The utility of non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP) as palaeoecological indicators and indicators of anthropogenic disturbances is rapidly growing because of their potential to comprehend palynological reconstructions of past communities and environments. Moreover, the initiation and development of pastoralism in India is poorly understood. We, in the present study, analyzed the NPP, especially the fungal NPP and the spores of coprophilous fungi (SCF), to understand the ecology, herbivore grazing (pastoralism) and human pressure during the Middle Holocene from a 2.75-m-long sediment profile from the Rawatsera palaeolake, Kumaun (Lesser Himalaya), India. The study demonstrated that between similar to 8327 and 8041 cal yr BP (Zone I), herbivore grazing and human pressure was noticed, based on the recovered SCF. Subsequently between similar to 8041 and 7406 cal yr BP (Zone II), the grazing activity (human pressure) intensified. Between similar to 7406 and 6999 cal yr BP (Zone III), compared to Zone I, pastoralism and local herbivore grazing increased. The detrended correspondence analysis also supports the findings of intensified herbivore grazing (pastoralism), based on the SCF. Moreover, soil erosion, compared to Zone II (similar to 8041-7406 cal yr BP), was more during similar to 8327-8041 cal yr BP (Zone I), but comparatively increased during similar to 7406-6999 cal yr BP (Zone III) around the study area. Anthropogenic disturbance of varying degrees in the form of soil erosion (and grazing too) was, therefore, suggested, based on the recovery of fungal spores, especially Glomus sp., as well as the SCF during the Middle Holocene (similar to 8327-6999 cal yr BP) from Kumaun, Central Himalaya, India.

AB  - The dynamic interactions between predators and their prey have two fundamental processes: numerical and functional responses. Numerical response is defined as predator growth rate as a function of prey density or both prey and predator densities [dP/dt = f(N, P)]. Functional response is defined as the kill rate by an individual predator being a function of prey density or prey and predator densities combined. Although there are relatively many studies on the functional response in mammalian predators, the numerical response remains poorly documented. We studied the numerical response of Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) to various densities of its primary prey species, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), and to itself (lynx). We exploited an unusual natural situation, spanning three decades where lynx, after a period of absence in central and southern Sweden, during which roe deer populations had grown to high densities, subsequently recolonized region after region, from north to south. We divided the study area into seven regions, with increasing productivity from north to south. We found strong effects of both roe deer density and lynx density on lynx numerical response. Thus, both resources and intraspecific competition for these resources are important to understanding the lynx population dynamic. We built a series of deterministic lynx-roe deer models, and applied them to the seven regions. We found a very good fit between these Lotka-Volterra type models and the data. The deterministic models produced almost cyclic dynamics or dampened cycles in five of the seven regions. Thus, we documented population cycles in this large predator-large herbivore system, which is rarely done. The amplitudes in the dampened cycles decreased toward the south. Thus, the dynamics between lynx and roe deer became more stable with increasing carrying capacity for roe deer, which is related to higher productivity in the environment. This increased stability could be explained by variation in predation risk, where human presence can act as prey refugia, and by a more diverse prey guild that will weaken the direct interaction between lynx and roe deer.

AB  - The best ways to maximize electricity production in places where there is not enough room for the installation of renewable power generation systems are to optimize the operational efficiency of already-existing plants and select an optimal location for newly constructed Photovoltaic (PV) power plants that will offer a favorable climate and surrounding environment. Sustainable energy development strategies must be developed using renewable generation technologies to drive energy transition towards sustainability. Based on battery technology and energy storage assets, the study proposed a new hybrid Gazelle-Nelder-Mead (GOANM) algorithm for solar power storage solutions to satisfy the growing need for reliable and convenient renewable energy sources. This model looks at the sustainability of solar energy generation. At this crucial juncture, the research helps pave an intellectual and useful path toward a more promising and ecologically conscious future. It promotes solar energy as a clean, renewable energy source to mitigate climate change and severely cut carbon emissions. The study focuses on sustainable solar panel manufacturing methods, addressing issues with materials and industrial processes. The simulation result of the proposed GOANM algorithm highlights the importance of sustainable management methods and adequate site selection in mitigating the negative consequences of solar plant development.

AB  - Vulture declines in South Asia were caused by accidental poisoning by the veterinary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac. Although veterinary use of diclofenac has been banned, other vulture-toxic NSAIDs are legally available, including aceclofenac, which has been shown to metabolise into diclofenac in domestic cattle. We gave nine domestic water buffalo the recommended dose of aceclofenac (2 mg kg-1 body weight), collected blood at intervals up to 48 h, and carried out a pharmacokinetic analysis of aceclofenac and its metabolite diclofenac in plasma. Aceclofenac was rapidly converted to diclofenac, and was barely detectable in plasma at any sampling time. Diclofenac was present within 20 min, and peaked 4-8 h after dosing. Aceclofenac is a prodrug of diclofenac, and behaves similarly in domestic water buffalo as it did in domestic cattle, posing the same risk to vultures. We recommend an immediate ban on the veterinary use of aceclofenac across vulturerange countries.

AB  - Subtropical reefs host a dynamic mix of tropical, subtropical, and temperate species that is changing due to shifts in the abundance and distribution of species in response to ocean warming. In these transitional communities, biogeographic affinity is expected to predict changes in species composition, with projected increases of tropical species and declines in cool-affinity temperate species. Understanding population dynamics of species along biogeographic transition zones is critical, especially for habitat engineers such as sea urchins that can facilitate ecosystem shifts through grazing. We investigated the population dynamics of sea urchins on coral-associated subtropical reefs at 7 sites in eastern Australia (28.196 degrees S to 30.95 degrees S) over 9 years (2010-2019), a period impacted by warming and heatwaves. Specifically, we investigated the density and population size structure of taxa with temperate (Centrostephanus rodgersii, Phyllacanthus parvispinus), subtropical (Tripneustes australiae) and tropical (Diadema spp.) affinities. Counter to expectation, biogeographic affinity did not explain shifts in species abundances in this region. Although we expected the abundance of tropical species to increase at their cold range boundaries, tropical Diadema species declined across all sites. The subtropical T. australiae also showed declines, while populations of the temperate C. rodgersii were remarkably stable throughout our study period. Our results show that temporal patterns of sea urchin populations in this region cannot be predicted by bio-geographic affinity alone and contribute critical information about the population dynamics of these important herbivores along this biogeographic transition zone.

AB  - The Iberian Peninsula is a primary entry point for non-native species (NNS) into Europe via maritime routes, and is a significant tourist destination. This positions the highly diverse Spanish National Parks at high risk from invasive species, necessitating proactive adaptation and mitigation strategies. We present a comprehensive analysis of the risks posed by NNS to the network of 15 continental and marine National Parks in Spain under climate change, aiming to align management strategies with international Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) targets. We identified 200 NNS across the network of National Parks, including 78 listed in national NNS regulations. Park managers helped identify 22 priority NNS, including the water hyacinth, American mink, Cape fig and wakame, among others. Over half of the 22 priority NNS (55%) were classified as having a "Major" impact on native biodiversity according to EICAT standards, with another 23% considered "Massive". Distribution models suggest that rising minimum temperatures could enable NNS to expand in altitude within the parks, particularly in high-mountain parks. Species like the barbary sheep, water hyacinth and largemouth bass may particularly benefit from global warming. Our findings prioritize national parks most vulnerable to the double threat posed by climate change and invasive species, such as Islas Atl & aacute;nticas, Do & ntilde;ana and Archipelago de Cabrera. We conclude that, in order to progress towards achieving GBF goals, it is essential to: (i) coordinate NNS management efforts across administrations (national and regional), (ii) integrate resources and expertise in a unified strategy against invasion across the network and (iii) enhance public awareness about the risks of introduction and impact of NNS.
   La Pen & iacute;nsula Ib & eacute;rica es el principal punto de entrada de especies ex & oacute;ticas invasoras en Europa a trav & eacute;s de las rutas mar & iacute;timas, adem & aacute;s de un importante destino tur & iacute;stico. Esto sit & uacute;a a los Parques Nacionales espa & ntilde;oles, de extraordinaria diversidad, en una situaci & oacute;n de alto riesgo frente a las invasiones biol & oacute;gicas, lo que requiere estrategias proactivas de adaptaci & oacute;n y mitigaci & oacute;n. En este estudio presentamos un an & aacute;lisis exhaustivo de los riesgos que suponen las especies invasoras para la red de 15 Parques Nacionales de Espa & ntilde;a, con el objetivo de alinear las estrategias de gesti & oacute;n con los objetivos internacionales del Marco Global de Biodiversidad (GBF). Identificamos m & aacute;s de 200 especies ex & oacute;ticas presentes en la red de Parques Nacionales. Si bien no todas han de ser da & ntilde;inas, al menos 68 est & aacute; incluidas en el Cat & aacute;logo Nacional de Especies Ex & oacute;ticas Invasoras. El personal t & eacute;cnico de los parques nos ayud & oacute; a identificar 22 especies ex & oacute;ticas invasoras de preocupaci & oacute;n para la Red de Parques, como el jacinto de agua, el vis & oacute;n americano, la u & ntilde;a de gato y el wakame, entre otras. El 55% de las especies de preocupaci & oacute;n se clasific & oacute; como de impacto "Mayor" sobre la biodiversidad aut & oacute;ctona seg & uacute;n los criterios de la EICAT, y otro 23% se consider & oacute; "Masivo". Los modelos de distribuci & oacute;n sugieren que el aumento de las temperaturas m & iacute;nimas podr & iacute;a permitir a las especies ex & oacute;ticas invasoras expandirse en latitud y altitud dentro de los parques, especialmente en las zonas de alta monta & ntilde;a. Especies como el arru & iacute;, el jacinto de agua y la carpa americana podr & iacute;an beneficiarse especialmente del calentamiento global. Nuestros resultados ayudan a priorizar las especies ex & oacute;ticas y los parques nacionales de mayor riesgo, como Islas Atl & aacute;nticas, Do & ntilde;ana y el Archipi & eacute;lago de Cabrera. Concluimos que para avanzar hacia la consecuci & oacute;n de los objetivos del GBF, es esencial: i) mejorar la coordinaci & oacute;n entre las administraciones competentes en la gesti & oacute;n de especies invasoras (nacionales y regionales), ii) integrar recursos y la experiencia ganada en los distintos parques hacia una estrategia de lucha contra las especies invasoras de aplicaci & oacute;n en toda la red y iii) trabajar en la divulgaci & oacute;n y concienciaci & oacute;n p & uacute;blica respecto a los riesgos de introducci & oacute;n y el impacto sobre la biodiversidad de las especies invasoras.

AB  - The effect of key ecological and anthropic factors on the recruitment of the common yew (Taxus baccata L.) in Sardinia (Italy) has been analyzed. After bibliographic and cartographic research, followed by field surveys, we found 232 sites where yew grows in Sardinia (as opposed to 69 previously reported in the literature). Among them, we selected 40 sites, located in 14 different mountain chains, characterized by a number of individuals ranging from 11 to 836 adult yews with an average diameter at breast height (DBH) from 13 to 130 cm. By means of generalized linear modeling, we investigated and weighted the effect of ecological, structural, and anthropic factors on the amount of T. baccata recruitment. Our analyses showed that stand recruitment was positively correlated to shrub cover and soil moisture. In particular, shrub cover had a stronger effect, clearly showing that a thicker shrub layer, both bushy and/or spiny, corresponded to a higher number of yew seedlings and saplings. Secondarily, moister sites had a higher number of seedlings and saplings, showing that habitat suitability improved with higher humidity. On the contrary, recruitment was negatively correlated to browsing (both from livestock and wild animals). Our data confirm that the presence of a protective layer of shrubs is a crucial factor for seedling and sapling survival, mostly in relation to protection from summer drought and the browsing of large herbivores. Finally, guidelines for the conservation and restoration of T. baccata communities, referred to as the EU priority habitat 9580* (Mediterranean Taxus baccata woods), have been outlined.

AB  - Asynchronous migration of insect herbivores and their host plants towards higher elevations following climate warming is expected to generate novel plant-insect interactions. While the disassociation of specialised interactions can challenge species' persistence, consequences for specialised low-elevation insect herbivores encountering novel high-elevation plants under climate change remain largely unknown. To explore the ability of two low-elevation Lepidoptera species, Melitaea celadussa and Zygaena filipendulae, to undergo shifts from low- to high-elevation host plants, we combined a translocation experiment performed at two elevations in the Swiss Alps with experiments conducted under controlled conditions. Specifically, we exposed M. celadussa and Z. filipendulae to current low- and congeneric high-elevation host plants, to test how shifts in host plant use impact oviposition probability, number of eggs clutches laid, caterpillar feeding preference and growth, pupation rate and wing size. While our study shows that both M. celadussa and Z. filipendulae can oviposit and feed on novel high-elevation host plants, we reveal strong preferences towards ovipositing and feeding on current low-elevation host plants. In addition, shifts from current low- to novel high-elevation host plants reduced pupation rates as well as wing size for M. celadussa, while caterpillar growth was unaffected by host plant identity for both species. Our study suggests that populations of M. celadussa and Z. filipendulae have the ability to undergo host plant shifts under climate change. However, these shifts may impact the ability of populations to respond to rapid climate change by altering developmental processes and morphology. Our study highlights the importance of considering altered biotic interactions when predicting consequences for natural populations facing novel abiotic and biotic environments.
   Our study is the first to our knowledge exploring consequences for specialised low-elevation insect herbivores facing novel, congeneric, high-elevation plants. Importantly, our study highlights that considering altered biotic interactions, such as those between specialised insects and their host plants, is crucial to predict how species will respond to climate change.image

AB  - Exotic herbivores can exert profound impacts on terrestrial communities, but their ecological effects on marine habitats are not sufficiently quantified. The exotic crab Percnon gibbesi, which is rapidly spreading throughout the Mediterranean Sea, grazes almost exclusively on benthic macrophytes, providing an opportunity to study the potential impacts of herbivores in the marine realm. Here, we first quantified the abundance of P. gibbesi in Mallorca (Balearic Islands; Spain) in 2023/2024 and reported average densities of 61 individuals 100 m-2, approximately 30 times greater than those recorded in 2003 on the islands. We then performed a feeding preference experiment using common native and invasive species of macroalgae (Caulerpa cylindracea, Halimeda incrassata, Haliptilon virgatum, Halopteris scoparia, Padina pavonica, and Ulva compressa) from the Mediterranean Sea. The per capita grazing rates of P. gibbesi (3.83 +/- 1.71 WW g crab-1 day-1), which can ingest almost 75% of their body weight daily, were higher than those recorded for most native herbivorous species in the Mediterranean. The estimated daily grazing rates for P. gibbesi average 23.59 +/- 15.17 kg WW macroalgae ha-1 day-1, value that corresponds with 0.1% to 10.9% (average 5.5%) of the total macroalgae production in this area. Our experiment revealed clear preferences of P. gibbesi for three species of macroalgae, which were not explained by the nutritional content. Overall, our results generate great concern and, coupled with the large extent of the invasion, indicate that the ecological impacts of this exotic herbivore on Mediterranean marine communities could be substantial, and have, until now, gone largely unreported.

AB  - Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) Latreille biting midges are the vectors of several viruses of veterinary significance. The larvae of some biting midge species develop in semiaquatic habitats that are affected by the activity of vertebrates. However, the importance of vertebrate animal activity in biting midge density has not been satisfactorily quantified. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact that three different hooved animals representing agricultural (cattle), wild (cervids), and intermediate (bison) animal populations have on the density and emergence of Culicoides from larval habitats. Trail cameras recorded vertebrate activity at eight sites at the Konza Prairie Biological Station with cattle, cervids, and/or bison, which was paired with larval substrate sampling to investigate midge density. The total time spent by all 3 target animals over the previous month and the average time spent by bison were significantly positively correlated with overall biting midge emergence. Species-specific analyses revealed significant positive associations of C. crepuscularis Malloch with several cattle variables including number of cattle days and events and average number of cattle, while more bison variables were found to be significant for C. haematopotus Malloch (bison days and bison events, negative associations) and C. variipennis Coquillett (negative associations for bison days and average number of bison; positive relationship with average bison time). Significant results for cervids included negative associations of C. crepuscularis with average cervid time and C. variipennis with cervid days. These results show that different ungulates impact midge abundance and emergence in different ways, improving our understanding of midge population drivers.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are found in a wide range of ecosystems, from the Arctic to the deep ocean. However, there is no data on their presence in terrestrial mammals that inhabit the Selva Maya. The aim of this study is to detect the presence of MPs in the feces of the Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii) from the region of Calakmul, located in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We analyzed 129 fecal samples collected during 2017 and 2018, obtaining 57 and 72 samples during the rainy and dry seasons respectively. Sixty-eight percent of the samples contained 743 MPs with a mean of 19.3 +/- 28.1 MPs/kg of dry weight (DW) feces in both years. An inter-annual variation in the average abundance of microplastic was observed during the two-year period (2017-2018), with a 72 % increase in these plastic particles in feces. Fourteen polymers were identified, with ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polypropylene (PP) and polyester (PES) being the most abundant during both years. Although the effects of MPs on the health of tapirs are not known, their presence is cause for concern. There is an urgent need for the implementation of appropriate plastic waste management programs in communities of the Selva Maya to diminish the consumption of MPs in species including humans where they pose a significant risk to health. Environmental implications: The use of plastics worldwide is increasing every day, so the presence of microplastics is and will continue to be a major environmental problem. It is known that contaminants can adhere to plastics, making them hazardous materials. Microplastics can contaminate remote areas such as Biosphere Reserves. Terrestrial species such as the tapir can ingest microplastics, putting their health at risk. Knowing the dispersion of microplastics is very important in order to manage them properly, taking into account their emission sources and type of polymer.

AB  - Deer hunter surveys commonly employ hypothetical chronic wasting disease (CWD) prevalence scenarios to measure behavioral intentions. These surveys may suffer from hypothetical bias (i.e. respondents describe unrealistic behaviors in hypothetical situations) and it is unclear how hypothetical bias affects results. We used an online-based survey of Arkansas deer hunters to (1) investigate how behavioral intentions change as CWD prevalence hypothetically varies, and (2) explore the presence of hypothetical bias in behavioral intention by comparing responses across hypothetical prevalence rates from those whose primary hunting counties had CWD detected versus not. We found undesired behaviors (e.g. hunting less often, hunting cessation) were unlikely to change substantially as prevalence increased, and assistance with some CWD monitoring and management behaviors may increase. We found some evidence of hypothetical bias in anticipated behavior change. Agencies should be aware that survey respondents may overstate behavioral intentions, and should consider this when making CWD management decisions.

AB  - Seed dispersal is a fundamental process that is highly threatened by the rapid decline of large-bodied frugivores worldwide. The Brazilian Cerrado, the largest savanna in the world, represents an ideal site for investigating seed dispersal because of its biodiversity, environmental challenges, and knowledge shortfalls. We performed a systematic literature review to analyze the seed dispersal network in the Cerrado and the potential impacts of the defaunation of large-bodied frugivores on it. We considered network metrics, calculated the defaunation index of the frugivore assemblage, and compared traits among different fruit-sized plants and their respective dispersers in the network. We retrieved 1565 interactions involving 193 plant species and 270 animal species. Results show that the Cerrado seed dispersal network is slightly nested and considerably modular, dominated by small- to medium-sized generalist species, such as passerines, marsupials, and mesocarnivores. Nonetheless, large-bodied frugivores like the lowland tapir have a key role in the network due to their great foraging and network integration capacity. The Cerrado frugivore assemblage is moderately defaunated, with possible effects in its interactions with large-fruited plants. The Cerrado's defaunation and functional loss of large vertebrates deserve urgent attention to further understand the impacts on seed dispersal mechanisms and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Simple Summary: This study was designed to find the cause of microcytic anemia in the Przewalski's gazelle by investigating the mineral contents in its habitat. We found that the cause of the disease was selenium deficiency in the habitat, and then, a cure for the disease was discovered. It is extremely beneficial to protect the rare species of the Przewalski's gazelle. Due to the fencing of the Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii), the microcytic anemia incidence rate continues to increase. The primary pathological symptoms include emaciation, anemia, pica, inappetence, and dyskinesia. To investigate the cause of microcytic anemia ailment in the Przewalski's gazelle, the Upper Buha River Area with an excessive incidence was chosen as the experimental pasture, and the Bird Island Area without microcytic anemia disease was chosen as the control field. Then, the mineral contents in the soil, forage, blood, and liver, as well as the blood routine parameters and biochemical indexes were measured. The findings showed that the experimental pasture had much lower Se content in the soil and forage than the control field (p < 0.01), while the impacted pasture had significantly higher S content in the forage. The damaged gazelles had considerably lower Se and Cu contents and higher S content in the blood and liver than the healthy gazelles (p < 0.01). The presences of Hb, HCT, MCV, and MCH were significantly decreased compared to those in healthy gazelles (p < 0.01). The experimental group had a significantly lower level of GSH-Px activity in their serums compared to the control group (p < 0.01). In the treatment experiment, ten gazelles from the affected pasture were orally administered CuSO4, 6 g/animal once every 10 days for two consecutive times, and all gazelles were successfully cured. Therefore, it is possible that low Se content in the soil induced an increase in the absorption of S content by forage, leading to the deficiency of secondary Cu in the Przewalski's gazelles, resulting in microcytic anemia.

AB  - Simple Summary We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes as ecological tracers to investigate isotopic niche overlap between 21 odontocete (toothed whale) species inhabiting neritic, mesopelagic, and bathypelagic waters. Results showed a clear niche separation for the bathypelagic Gray's beaked whales (Mesoplodon grayi) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), but high isotopic niche overlap and potential interspecific competition for neritic and mesopelagic species. This study represents the first insights into the coexistence of odontocetes in a biodiverse hotspot and provides a critical baseline for a system already undergoing ecosystem changes via ocean warming and its subsequent effect on prey abundance and distribution. Species occurring in sympatry and relying on similar and limited resources may partition resource use to avoid overlap and interspecific competition. Aotearoa, New Zealand hosts an extraordinarily rich marine megafauna, including 50% of the world's cetacean species. In this study, we used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes as ecological tracers to investigate isotopic niche overlap between 21 odontocete (toothed whale) species inhabiting neritic, mesopelagic, and bathypelagic waters. Results showed a clear niche separation for the bathypelagic Gray's beaked whales (Mesoplodon grayi) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), but high isotopic niche overlap and potential interspecific competition for neritic and mesopelagic species. For these species, competition could be reduced via temporal or finer-scale spatial segregation or differences in foraging behaviour. This study represents the first insights into the coexistence of odontocetes in a biodiverse hotspot. The data presented here provide a critical baseline to a system already ongoing ecosystem change via ocean warming and subsequent effects on prey abundance and distributions.

AB  - Parturition and the early neonatal period are critical life history stages in ungulates with considerable implications for population growth and persistence. Understanding the changes in behaviour induced by ungulate parturition is important for supporting effective population management, but reliably identifying birth sites and dates presents a challenge for managers. Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis canadensis) are one such highly valued and ecologically important species in montane and subalpine ecosystems of Western North America. In the face of changing patterns of anthropogenic land use, wildlife managers increasingly require site-specific knowledge of the movement and habitat selection characteristics of periparturient sheep to better inform land use planning initiatives and ensure adequate protections for lambing habitat. We used movement data from GPS collared parturient (n = 13) and non-parturient (n = 8) bighorn sheep in Banff National Park, Canada to (1) identify lambing events based on changes in key movement metrics, and (2) investigate how resource selection and responses to human use change during the periparturient period. We fit a hidden Markov model (HMM) to a multivariate characterization of sheep movement (step length, daily home range area, residence time) to predict realistic lambing dates for the animals in our study system. Leave-one-out cross validation of our model resulted in a 93% success rate for parturient females. Our model, which we parameterized using data from known parturient females, also predicted lambing events in 25% of known non-parturient ewes in a test dataset. Using a latent selection difference function and resource selection functions, we tested for postpartum changes in habitat use, as well as seasonal differences in habitat selection. Immediately following lambing, ewes preferentially selected high-elevation sites on solar aspects that were more rugged, closer to escape terrain, and further from roads. Within-home range habitat selection was similar between individuals in different reproductive states, but parturient ewes had stronger selection for low snow depth, sites closer to barren ground, and sites further from trails. We propose that movement-based approaches such as HMMs are a valuable tool for identifying critical parturition habitat in species with complex movement patterns and may have particular utility in study areas without access to extensive field observations or vaginal implant transmitters. Furthermore, our results suggest that managers should minimize human disturbance in lambing areas to avoid interfering with maternal behaviour and ensure access to a broad range of suitable habitat in the periparturient period.

AB  - The species of gastrointestinal nematodes found during necropsies of 26 moose from four regions of European Russia (Tver', Smolensk, Ryazan' and Voronezh) were determined. In total, eight species of nematodes were registered: Aonchotheca bovis, Ashworthius sidemi, Mazamastrongylus dagestanica, Nematodirella alcidis, Ostertagia antipini, Spiculopteragia asymmetrica, Trichostrongylus capricola and Trichuris ovis. Beside this, a minor morph of O. antipini ("Ostertagia lyrataeformis") was found in seven moose from all of the studied regions. Ashworthius sidemi, a blood-sucking nematode, was found in moose in Voronezh region, and this fact indicates the further spreading of this Asian parasite among ruminants in Europe. Apparently, the reason for the relatively low species diversity of nematodes noted in this study is the small number of contacts of moose with other ruminants in the study areas. The intensity of infection was also relatively low and ranged from 87 to 1660 nematodes. The extensity of infection ranged from 3.8% for Aonchotheca bovis to 100% for Mazamastrongylus dagestanica. No nematode species more typical for domestic ruminants was found, which indicates the absence of contacts between the studied moose and livestock.

AB  - The grazing activities of ungulates are closely related to their own energy expenditure and the pasture status, but few studies have considered the mechanism under mixed grazing in desert steppe. Here, we statistically analyzed the spatio-temporal distribution pattern of ungulates' grazing activities by equipping GPS collars with triaxial acceleration sensors on mixed grazing cattle and sheep. Then, based on the spatial distribution and seasonal changes of pasture vegetation, a structural equation model of ungulates' grazing characteristics and energy expenditure was established, and the response model of mixed grazing cattle and sheep to grassland resources in desert steppe was discussed. The results showed that the cattle's daily grazing ODBA, grazing time and range increased over time, while the sheep's decreased. Both cattle and sheep showed spatial and temporal differences in daily grazing activity on pasture, and the differences between plots (spatial) tended to be more significant than the differences between months (temporal). The grazing activities of cattle and sheep on mixed pasture in desert steppe were influenced by vegetation cover (NDVI) as well as by the composition of the vegetation species, especially the distribution of poisonous forages (Ephedra sinica). This study provides a new idea for the mixed grazing of ungulates and the sustainable utilization of grassland resources in desert steppe, and suggests that human management should be used to intervene in the distribution of poisonous forages on pastures.

AB  - In order to investigate seasonal changes in diet, environment and climate, we analyzed the stable carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of intra-tooth sequential profiles (14 teeth, 282 enamel samples) of Hippopotamidae, Equidae, Bovidae and Suidae from Melka Kunture, Upper Awash Valley, central Ethiopian Highlands (2000-2200 m a.s.l.). We found that during the Early Pleistocene, between 1.95 and 1 Ma, most of the analyzed hippos display a seasonally stable C4 diet, even if the delta 13C values within hippos show a degree of variability that we interpret as the outcome of feeding on plants that use different C4 photosynthetic pathways. Several hippo specimens display a seasonal shift from C4 to mixed C3-C4 diets. The sampled equid, bovid and suid specimens recorded both stable C4 diets and mixed C3-C4 feeding with a seasonal progressive increase of delta 13C values. When affected by seasonal changes, the serially analyzed taxa show different niche partitioning: hippos increase the consumption of C3 vegetation, whereas equids and suids include more C4 vegetation in their diets. The intra-individual delta 18O variability in the analyzed taxa is interpreted as the outcome of different water sources, depending on animal habitat, behavior and mobility patterns. Our data are placed in controlled stratigraphic and chronological sequences and combined with the outcome of other proxies, allowing us to evaluate the site paleoecology comprehensively. We suggest that the central Ethiopian Highlands, where MK is located, possibly acted as a refugium-like area during the Early and Middle Pleistocene, characterized by a specific type of montane vegetation (DAF) and diverse faunal and hominin species that demonstrated their resilience and adaptability to changing environments and climates.

We analyzed partial sequences of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (808 bp) of 62 loggerhead turtles collected in Korean foraging grounds (East, West, South, and Jeju Seas) between 2014 and 2022 to determine their genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and rookery origins. The sampled loggerhead turtles had 5 haplotypes, with haplotype diversity of 0.439 +/- 0.075 and nucleotide diversity of 0.00228 +/- 0.00052, which originated from 3 Northwest Pacific management units (MUs): Ryukyu Islands (RYI), Yakushima Island (YAK), and mainland Japan (MLJ). In distance-rookery size-weighted mixed stock analysis, mean (+/- SD) contributions of sampled loggerhead turtles to Korean foraging grounds were 4.2 +/- 1.6% for RYI, 71.6 +/- 16.7% for YAK, and 24.2 +/- 15.2% for MLJ. These contributions varied depending on the season and Korean feeding grounds. Our findings on the connectivity of loggerhead turtles between Korea and Japan highlight the necessity for international cooperation in their conservation.

AB  - Seasonal water-level fluctuations may lead to changes in river nutrients, which causes corresponding changes in the trophic structure of an aquatic food web, and finally affects the whole ecosystem. In this study, we focused on the Ganjing River, a tributary of the Yangtze River, China. Common organisms were sampled and measured for carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, and the relative contributions of different food sources were combined to construct the food web, so as to realize the influence of water-level fluctuation on aquatic food web. Our results showed that basal food sources for fish consumers were endogenous carbon sources such as POM, zooplankton and zoobenthos in the dry season, while high water level exposed fish to more diverse and abundant food sources, and the contribution proportions of exogenous carbon sources (e.g., terrestrial detritus) to consumers increased in the wet season. In parallel, the abundance and species diversity of fish were higher than those in the dry season. Most fish species had relatively higher trophic levels in the dry season compared to the wet season, because the increase in fish densities led to an increase in piscivores fish. The food web was composed of planktonic and benthic food chains in the dry season. During the wet season, the planktonic food chain was dominant, followed by the herbivorous food chain, and the benthic food chain was relatively less important. Therefore, water-level fluctuation may alter the trophic linkages within fish communities, which contributed to a more complex and interconnected food web. Moreover, as we expect, the stable isotope analysis food web was broadly in line with the gut content analysis food web.

AB  - IntroductionThe Asian chestnut gall wasp (Dryocosmus kuriphilus) is a major pest of chestnut trees worldwide, seriously affecting chestnut cultivation. Information concerning the effects of gall wasp attack on diameter growth of chestnut trees is currently scarce and limited to coppice stands and to use of the growth of a non-target control species (unaffected by the pest) for reference purposes. The effects of the pest on widely-spaced plantations (grown at a much lower density than chestnut coppices) and the use of explicitly-observed annual infestation rate data remain to be explored. MethodsIn the present study, we analyzed the impact of the chestnut gall wasp on the diameter growth of chestnut trees, using data from 16 experimental plots established in widely-spaced plantations located in good quality sites. Two of the plots are in plantations where a susceptible hybrid chestnut clone and a chestnut clone resistant to the gall wasp coexist, whereas the remaining 14 plots are in Castanea sativa plantations where the level of gall wasp infestation varies across trees and years. The plots were surveyed to determine the diameter growth of the trees and the level of infestation during 5 years (2017-2021). ResultsThe infestation level corresponding to the theoretical damage threshold was surpassed inmost plots during the study period. Nevertheless, there were no differences in the growth of attacked and unaffected plants in the two plots planted with hybrid clones with contrasting susceptibility to the gall wasp. The attack had a modest effect in C. sativa plots, with a mean reduction in annual basal area increment of 9.9%. DiscussionThese findings apparently contradict previous reports of a marked reduction in radial growth of chestnut coppice trees due to gall wasp attack. The difference in findings may be related to increased compensation for herbivory with increasing levels of resources (especially light) in the plantations under study, which were less dense than previously studied stands. The study outcomes add to existing knowledge on the impact of chestnut gall wasp on wood formation and may have implications regarding planting site recommendations and subsequent stand management.

AB  - Establishing conservation management requires an understanding of local livelihoods, human-wildlife interactions, and community risk perceptions of wildlife, particularly in fragile landscapes with residing human populations. The Iona National Park in Angola is characterized by a harsh but unique arid environment and is home to semi-nomadic human residents. Due to the prolonged civil war, the park's management only resumed in the early 2000s. To understand the socio-ecological needs of such systems, we conducted semi-structured questionnaires with 356 respondents across all villages in the national park. We identified main livelihood strategies in Iona National Park as livestock production of goat and cattle, and cultivation of maize. Estimates of livestock biomass (8.42 kg ha(-1)) indicated severe overstocking. Seventeen wild mammal species were reported as threatening livelihoods, of which leopard and cheetah presented the highest risk for cattle; leopard, fox species, and caracal for goats; and porcupine and baboon for crops. The complexity of human-wildlife conflict was highlighted by contrasting perceptions of species abundance, perceived risk, and culprit species. The restoration of arid African landscapes may require the implementation of community-based natural resource management that is aligned with ecosystem carrying capacity. This study therefore provided new insights and baseline information for effective conservation management, both for the Iona National Park and for areas with a similar socio-environmental context.

AB  - Allergenic pollens produced by some tree species in urban parks, a part of the urban flora, cause pollinosis, allergic rhinitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and asthma. The allergenic pollen levels of four urban parks in Aydin (Turkey) were determined using the Index of Urban Green Zones Allergenicity (I-UGZA). The potential allergenicity value (PAV) of each species and the crown volume of each individual belonging to the species were used in the index calculation. According to their PAV values, tree species were classified as nil (0), low (1-6), moderate (8-12), high (16-24), and very high (27-36) allergenicity. The Shannon Diversity Index (SHDI) was used to calculate the parks' biodiversity levels. Canonical correspondence analysis, one of the ordination methods, was used to identify the species distribution among the four parks and reveal the relationship between the SHDI, number of species, tree density, and I-UGZA. The ratio of allergenic tree species in the four parks examined varied between 97.90 and 100%. The PAV of 9 tree species, including the genus Cupressus in the Cupressaceae family, was determined as very high, while the PAV of 20 tress species, including the genus Prunus, was revealed to be low. While the park with the lowest I-UGZA value (0.17) was Aytepe Recreation Area, the park with the highest I-UGZA value (0.52) was Pinarbasi Recreation Area. The lowest Shannon Diversity Index (SHDI) value (0.70) was detected in Aytepe Recreation Area, whereas the highest value (2.90) was determined in Nevzat Bicer Park. There was no correlation between the I-UGZA value and species count, tree density, and SHDI variables. Ismet Sezgin Park and Pinarbasi Recreation Area pose a risk to human health at any time of the year. The results, which focused on allergenic flora, should be used to design new parks and revitalize existing ones.

AB  - The impact of various ecological factors, biogeographical position and both former and current anthropogenic activity in Plitvice Lakes National Park greatly influenced the development of different habitat types, including forest clearings. Due to the insufficient knowledge of this habitat type, based primarily on general descriptions within the National Habitat Classification of the Republic of Croatia (NN 27/2021, NN 101/2022), this paper deals with presenting their vegetational and structural characteristics in the national park area. The following taxonomic keys were used to determine plant species: Tutin et al. (1964-1980), Pignatti (1982), Javorka and Csapody (1991) and Martin & ccaron;i & ccaron; et al. (1999). Furthermore, scientific nomenclature of plant species was conducted using Flora Croatica Database (Nikoli & cacute; 2012), while threat status was aligned by the Red Book of Vascular Flora of Croatia (Nikoli & cacute; and Topi & cacute; 2005). Also, protection level was adjusted according to the Regulation on strictly protected species (NN 144/2013, NN 73/2016). Spectrum of life forms and chorological types were aligned according to Pignatti (2005). Vegetation was studied in accordance with the principles of the Braun-Blanquet approach (Braun-Blanquet 1964). Together with the basic parameters of the selected plots, the research also included the collection of structural parameters of forest clearings according to Medak et al. (2023). Based on conducted research, a total of 98 plots of forest clearing habitats were established with a total of five different forest clearing communities. The largest number of forest clearing communities belonged to Salicetum capreae , followed by Eupatorietum cannabini , Atropetum bella-donae , Telekium speciosae and Rubetum idaei . A total of 257 species of vascular plants were identified in the area and classified into 60 families. The most represented family was Asteraceae, while the highest relative representation of lifeforms belonged to hemicryptophytes (H). Furthermore, the most represented chorologycal type in the area was Eurasian (20.6%). The habitat type contained a total of 11 strictly protected (SZ), 6 nearly threatened (NT), 3 vulnerable (VU), 2 data -deficient (DD) and 4 endemic species. In addition, the largest number of plots had an anthropogenic origin, irregular type (shape), occupied a small area (less than 1000 m 2 ) and were located along the edges of both forests and forest roads. The results of this paper represent the first vegetational and structural data of forest clearings in the national park area which contribute to an expansion of our knowledge and understanding of this habitat type, and form a starting point for the necessary future research.

AB  - Sanjiangyuan National Park (SNP), the first national park in China, is one of the most important biodiversity conservation areas in the Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve (SNNR) and even the world. The threatened ungulates play an irreplaceable role in maintaining the ecosystem diversity and stability in SNNR. Here, based on 1434 occurrence records of six ungulates, the maximum entropy model, with two different strategies, was utilized to determine the priority reserves. The results indicated that the priority reserves in SNNR was mainly located in and around SNP, which were mainly distributed in the middle east, middle west, and southwest of SNNR. Six ungulates shared preference for altitude ranging 4000-5000 m, the average annual temperature below -3.0 degrees C, and average annual precipitation ranging 200-400 mm on meadow, steppe, and unused land. The proportion of high and medium suitable areas for ungulates in SNP was higher than that in SNNR. As the SNP is not contiguously spaced in space, and some core wildlife habitats are not included, it is suggested to optimize the functional areas and adjust the boundary range on the basis of the pilot scope of SNP, so as to enhance the integrity and connectivity of each functional area.

AB  - Climate projections predict major changes in alpine environments by the end of the 21st century. To avoid climate-induced maladaptation and extinction, many animal populations will either need to move to more suitable habitats or adapt in situ to novel conditions. Since populations of a species exhibit genetic variation related to local adaptation, it is important to incorporate this variation into predictive models to help assess the ability of the species to survive climate change. Here, we evaluate how the adaptive genetic variation of a mountain ungulate-the Northern chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra)-could be impacted by future global warming. Based on genotype-environment association analyses of 429 chamois using a ddRAD sequencing approach, we identified genetic variation associated with climatic gradients across the European Alps. We then delineated adaptive genetic units and projected the optimal distribution of these adaptive groups in the future. Our results suggest the presence of local adaptation to climate in Northern chamois with similar genetic adaptive responses in geographically distant but climatically similar populations. Furthermore, our results predict that future climatic changes will modify the Northern chamois adaptive landscape considerably, with various degrees of maladaptation risk.

AB  - Anaerobic gut fungi of the class Neocallimastigomycetes are of great importance for herbivorous animals. Their immediate colonization and mechanical breakdown of plant particles pave the way for highly efficient enzymatic fermentation of complex plant polysaccharides. Neocallimastigomycetes are found in a variety of herbivores, yet so far studies almost exclusively investigated domestic or captive animals. Here, the occurrence and diversity of Neocallimastigomycetes in two different populations of sympatric, wild African forest elephants and forest buffaloes were determined. In both hosts together, a total of 16 species-equivalent Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) (0.05 cut-off level) were generated. Buffaloes harboured four and elephants five anaerobic fungi genera or genus-equivalent taxa, respectively, with four genera occurring in both hosts. In elephants the majority of gut fungi group within a cluster of yet unknown Neocallimastigomycetes. Similarly, some anaerobic fungi found in buffaloes form a genus-equivalent cluster with likewise undescribed gut fungi. Sequences grouping in these two clusters could potentially qualify as representatives of new anaerobic fungi genera. Further, three sequences have not yet been encountered in any study and cannot be assigned to any genus or genus-equivalent Neocallimastigomycetes taxon. Whether these sequences also represent putative new lineages needs further investigation.

AB  - BackgroundParental care is indispensable for the survival and development of dependent offspring, often requiring a delicate balance of time and energy allocation towards offspring by parents. Among ungulates employing a hider strategy, deciding when and where to provide care while also maintaining a sufficient distance to not reveal the offspring<acute accent>s hiding place is likely crucial in determining their fate.MethodsIn this study, we analyzed the timing and spatial distribution of mother-offspring interactions in roe deer females (Capreolus capreolus L.). We fitted roe deer mothers and their neonates with GPS-collars combined with a proximity sensor in south Germany to address the spatial and temporal distribution of mother-fawn interactions during the first two months of the fawns' lives.ResultsWe observed variations in the distance between mother and fawn, which initially increased over the first month and then decreased as the fawns grew older. The timing of mother-fawn contacts was strongly linked with the circadian rhythm of the mother, aligning closely with their typical bimodal activity peaks at dawn and dusk. Furthermore, we observed differences in habitat use between mother and offspring, reflecting the mother's requirements for food and protection (e.g. greater use of forests, higher distances to roads), as well as the fawn's priority requirement for protection (e.g. higher use of unmown grassland). We documented variations over time, highlighting how these requirements changed as the fawn ages. Interestingly, during the initial two weeks, most of the contacts occurred in habitats that were particularly favored by mothers. However, as the fawns aged, contacts occurred increasingly often in habitats that were routinely used by fawns.ConclusionsUnderstanding the timing, frequency, and spatial distribution of mother-offspring interactions provides valuable insights into the care strategies of hider ungulates. The observation that mothers leave their fawns in agricultural fields during the first few weeks of life has strong implications for wildlife management, as this behavior constitutes a kind of evolutionary trap under current agricultural practices and mowing regimes. Whether females can adjust their maternal care tactics to these novel selection pressures in human-altered landscapes is likely key to predicting the population dynamics of this obligate hider.

AB  - Global warming is expected to shift the distribution ranges of many species towards higher latitudes and altitudes. This will rewire plant-herbivore food webs as new combinations of herbivore species encounter novel host plants. We investigated the effects of a simulated altitudinal shift in an herbivore-host community of bark and ambrosia beetles on fig trees in a tropical mountain forest on Mt. Wilhelm, Papua New Guinea. We reared beetles from wood baits cut from five local Ficus species in their natural altitudinal ranges, between 200 and 1700 m a. s. l. Further, we transplanted baits from three of these tree species 500 m below the limits of their natural distribution range, to simulate a mean temperature increase of 2.7 degrees C. Beetle species richness declined, and their species composition changed with increasing elevation. Furthermore, while altitude explained a large proportion of variance in beetle composition, host tree species was more important for bark beetles than ambrosia beetles. Beetle communities that assembled on the transplanted baits were similar in diversity and host specificity to those on the fig trees native to the same elevation, but also contained a number of unique species. Overall, these results indicate that saproxylic beetles in this tropical forest are highly resilient and flexible to the potential effects of climate change.Abstract in Cesky is available with online material.

   Bark and ambrosia beetles were reared from Ficus wood baits along altitudinal tropical forest gradient. Some baits were transplanted below their trees' range of distribution to simulate the effects of climate change. While there was a distinct turnover in community composition along the gradient, beetles were readily colonizing the transplants, thereby indicating a considerable resilience of this group potential effects of climate change.image

AB  - The Brazilian state of Acre is located in the southwestern Amazon and it is characterized by a humid tropical forest vegetation that covers plains and mountains. Up to this point, the composition of termite species in the state is not known. The aim of this study was to provide a checklist of termite species or recognizable taxonomic units for the state of Acre. Sampling was conducted through field expeditions at the Serra do Divisor National Park, Chandless State Park, Humaita Forest Reserve, and Chico Mendes Environmental Park using a standardized rapid termite inventory protocol in the first two areas and active searching collections in the others, without a specific protocol. This study also included occurrence records published in the scientific literature. A total of 128 species and morphospecies of termites were found in Acre, distributed across 59 genera and four families. The most frequently occurring species in Acre was Heterotermes tenuis (Hagen, 1858). The study also identified six new species records for Brazil. The predominant feeding groups were soil-feeders and wood-feeders, as expected from data obtained from surveys in humid tropical forests. Despite the significant number of new records for Acre (112), it is concluded that a larger sampling effort is still required, as many areas of the state have not yet been studied for termites.

AB  - This paper presents the results of stable carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen (delta 15N) isotopic analysis of bulk bone collagen from faunal remains from the Bronze Age site of Kaymak & ccedil;& imath; in western Anatolia. We use the isotopic values in conjunction with zooarchaeological data and contextual archaeological information to examine human-environment interactions; in particular, animal management and husbandry. Middle and Late Bronze Age agricultural systems in western and central Anatolia remain poorly understood, and this research aims to contribute to rectifying this research gap. We obtained stable isotopic values from both wild and domestic species, including deer, hare, birds, catfish, dogs, pigs, caprids and cattle. The delta 13C values range from -22.0 parts per thousand to -16.9 parts per thousand and the delta 15N values range from 2.3 parts per thousand to 10.3 parts per thousand. For cattle, the delta 13C values suggest that some specimens were subject to different management strategies, likely related to feeding or herding patterns or even the movement of animals in and around the region through some exchange mechanism. There appears to be no fixed location or strategy for the management of caprids and, furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that the herding/management areas of some caprids overlapped with those of wild animals such as deer and hare. Variation in delta 15N values for pigs may indicate that whilst some animals in the sampled assemblage were free-roaming, others were penned. For the pigs and some other herbivorous domesticated species variation in delta 15N values may also point to the exploitation of the wetland areas around Lake Marmara.

AB  - The yak is a unique creature that thrives in low-oxygen environments, showcasing its adaptability to high-altitude settings with limited oxygen availability due to its unique respiratory system. However, the impact of hypoxia on alveolar type II (AT2) epithelial cell proliferation in yaks remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the effects of different altitudes on 6-month-old yaks and found an increase in alveolar septa thickness and AT2 cell count in a high-altitude environment characterized by hypoxia. This was accompanied by elevated levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. Additionally, we observed a significant rise in Ki67-positive cells and apoptotic lung epithelial cells among yaks inhabiting higher altitudes. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that exposure to hypoxia activated HIF-1 alpha, EGF, and EGFR expression leading to increased proliferation rates among yak AT2 cells. Under normal oxygen conditions, activation of HIF-1 alpha enhanced EGF/EGFR expressions which subsequently stimulated AT2 cell proliferation. Furthermore, activation of EGFR expression under normoxic conditions further promoted AT2 cell proliferation while simultaneously suppressing apoptosis. Conversely, inhibition of EGFR expression under hypoxic conditions had contrasting effects. In summary, hypoxia triggers the proliferation of yak AT2 cells via activation facilitated by the HIF-1 alpha/EGF/EGFR signaling cascade.

AB  - The interplay between top-down and bottom-up processes determines ecosystem productivity. Yet, the factors that mediate the balance between these opposing forces remain poorly understood. Furthering this challenge, complex and often cryptic factors like ecosystem engineering and trait-mediated interactions may play major roles in mediating the outcomes of top-down and bottom-up interactions. In semiarid grasslands of northeastern China, we conducted a large-scale, three-year experiment to evaluate how soil engineering by ants and plasticity in plants independently and jointly influenced the top-down effects of grazing by a ubiquitous herbivore (cattle) on aboveground standing biomass of the dominant perennial grass, Leymus chinensis. Herbivory had strong top-down effects, reducing L. chinensis AB by 25% relative to baseline levels without cattle or ants. In contrast, soil engineering by ants facilitated weak bottom-up effects in the absence of herbivory. However, in the presence of herbivory, soil engineering effects were strong enough to fully offset herbivore removal of aboveground biomass. This outcome was mediated by L. chinensis's plasticity in reallocating growth from below- to aboveground biomass, a result linked to additive effects of engineers and herbivores increasing soil N availability and engineering effects improving soil structure. Soil engineering increased soil N by 12%, promoting aboveground biomass. Herbivores increased soil N by 13% via defecation, but this increase failed to offset their reductions in aboveground biomass in isolation. However, when combined, engineers and herbivores increased soil N by 26% and engineers improved soil bulk density, facilitating L. chinensis to shift resource allocations from below- to aboveground biomass sufficiently to fully offset herbivore suppression of aboveground biomass. Our results demonstrate that soil engineering and trait-mediated effects of plant plasticity can strongly mediate the outcome of top-down and bottom-up interactions. These cryptic but perhaps ubiquitous processes may help to explain the long-debated phenomenon of plant compensatory responses to large grazers.

AB  - Understanding consumer trophic status and long-term dietary changes can yield information about impacts of altered habitats on their ecology. In Hawai'i, coastal ecosystems have been significantly modified by the introduction of invasive seaweeds and mangroves, high nutrient load and overfishing, but so far, much is still to be understood about how these changes have affected the green turtle (Chelonia mydas). This study analyzed stable carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isotope ratios in the bone tissue of modern and museum specimens of green turtles collected from 1901 to 2020 in Oahu and the North-western Hawaiian Islands to understand how their isotopic niche has changed through time, a crucial step towards restoring the ecological role of a formerly decimated species. The standard ellipse size and the total area of the convex hull of the isotopic niche of green turtles in three periods (1901-1951, 1992-2008, and 2018-2020) were calculated. The stable isotope values of ancient green turtles (1901-1951) suggest that they relied heavily on macroalgae even before the introduction of exotic species and eutrophication promoted the development of algal pastures. However, a few ancient green turtles relied heavily on seagrasses, and others complemented their macroalgae-based diets with significant amounts of animal matter. Such diet specialists were missing from the sample of current green sea turtles, suggesting that these foraging strategies are less common or perhaps even absent in the current population. The results suggest that green turtles have converged on the use of the most abundant resource, red macroalgae, likely because of the homogenization and simplification of coastal habitats and food webs due to anthropogenic influences. Restoring the population size of herbivorous fishes and a more diverse ecosystem structure may be necessary to recover the array of trophic strategies formerly present in the Hawaiian green turtle population.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict is considered one of the significant challenges that conservation authorities face in managing protected areas and the surrounding lands. This study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal trends and characteristics of conflicts between rural communities and wild animals in a protected area in northeastern Iran. We collected data on wild animals' attacks on humans and livestock and damages to crops within the Ors-e-Sistan Protected Area (OSPA) and its 5 km buffer zone for 2010-2020 via official reports and questionnaire surveys (n = 373). We found that multiple species-specific and human-related factors determine conflict hotspots in space and time. Wild boars (Sus scrofa), wolves (Canis lupus) and leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor) were perceived to be responsible for the highest number of attacks on humans and livestock. Wild boars were responsible for more than 90% of attacks on agricultural lands. Hotspots of attacks on livestock were located in the pastures around villages and pastures within the protected area. In contrast, hotspot areas of attacks on humans and damage to crops were located in the orchards and farms of villages on the protected area's northern and southern fringes. Temporal patterns in the variability of conflict revealed that grazing seasons and species' nocturnal behaviors caused more attacks and damages during warm seasons and nights. Conflict hotspots and their temporal clustering, identified in this study, can guide managers to focus mitigation activities in prioritized areas and allocate management resources that reduce conflicts between people and wild animals. The assessment of the type of species and their characteristics, land-use type, and distribution of human settlements is recommended when identifying locations and occasions of conflicts.

AB  - Beef producers in the mulga lands of south-western Queensland and north-western New South Wales, Australia, face the challenges of inherently low productivity and profitability, exacerbated by widespread pasture degradation and high climate and market variability. Our objective was to use the farm-management economics framework to assess the ability of management strategies and investment options to improve profitability and build the overall resilience of beef cattle properties in the mulga lands. Options were assessed for a hypothetical, representative beef cattle property in south-western Queensland (20 000 ha; initial stocking rate 600 adult equivalents). Firstly, strategies were assessed for their ability to improve profitability when operated as a beef business. Secondly, two alternative investment options were assessed: (1) conversion to rangeland meat goat production; and (2) conversion to carbon farming through carbon sequestration. Herd and economic modelling software were used to conduct property-level, partial discounted cash-flow budgets to assess each strategy over a 30-year investment period. Results indicated very limited potential to improve the profitability and resilience of an existing beef cattle enterprise in the mulga lands. However, full or partial conversion to rangeland meat goat production or carbon farming improved property-level returns and viability.

AB  - Background and aimsPlant invasion is a major component of global environmental change and can significantly alter soil biota, and soil biological activities through rhizosphere inputs, which are essential for organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the relationship between plant invasion, invasive plant's growth form, allelopathy, soil biota and soil enzymatic activity remains unclear. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of plant invasion, plant and ecosystem type on soil biota, soil biological activity and nutrients.MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis from 107 studies and extracted 688 paired observations. We examined the responses of soil biota functional groups, enzymatic activity, microbial biomass, soil respiration, N-mineralization, N-nitrification, and soil nutrient levels (available nitrogen, and available phosphorus) to plant invasion, allelopathy of invasive plants, growth forms, and ecosystem types. The effect sizes of invasive plants on the response variables were calculated using log response ratio. The ratio was computed using the mean values obtained from a pair of response variables in the invasive and native plants. Moreover, a fail-safe number calculated to detect the biasness of the studies.ResultsPlant invasion affected soil biota functional groups, the abundance of some soil enzymes, microbial biomass and soil nutrients. Our results showed that invasive plants reduced the abundance of herbivores by 45%, detritivores by 27% and omnivores by 45%, but increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) biomass by 29%, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) by 19% and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) by 32%, respectively. Soil microbial biomass, N-mineralization, soil respiration, available (N, P) nutrients, NH4+-N and nutrient stocks were all higher in invasive than native plants rhizosphere soils. Furthermore, the effects of invasive plants on soil enzyme activities were inconsistent, showing higher C-decomposing (invertase, phenol oxidase and beta-glucosidase) and N- and P-releasing enzyme activities (+\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$+$$\end{document} 18% to +\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$+$$\end{document} 27%) under invasive plant soils compared to native plant soils. ConclusionResults showed that a decrease in certain soil functional groups, and an increase in symbiont abundance under invasive plants soils compared to native plants soils. However, invasive plants enhanced soil nutrient-releasing enzymes and available nutrients, thereby accelerating nutrient cycling and promoting their persistence and success.

AB  - The saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica), a keystone migratory species of the Central Asian steppes and deserts, is increasingly threatened by habitat fragmentation due to the rapidly expanding transport infrastructure in Kazakhstan, which hosts approximately 95% of the species' global population. This study provides a spatial assessment of railway and road infrastructure across the contemporary ranges of the Betpaqdala, Ustyurt, and Ural saiga populations. Using the literature and our field data from the 1980s to the present day, combined with geographic information system (GIS)-based analysis of 80,427 km of roads and 4021 km of railways, we have quantified infrastructure densities and identified critical barriers to saiga migration using kernel density and minimum convex polygons (MCP) estimations. The results reveal a negative connection between infrastructure density and occurrences of saiga herds, particularly in the Ustyurt population, where a high railway density coincides with severely reduced migratory activity and a reduction in this population's winter range by 79.84% since 2015. Major railways such as Sekseuildi-Zhezqazgan, Zhezqazgan-Zharyk, and Shalqar-Beineu intersect essential migratory pathways and have contributed to significant range contraction, subpopulation isolation, and northward shifts in seasonal habitats. In contrast, the Ural population (subject to minimal railway infrastructure interference) has shown robust demographic recovery. While roads are more widespread, their impact is less severe due to greater permeability. However, upcoming projects such as the China-Europe transit corridor and the "Center-West" regional development corridor could amplify future threats. We recommend immediately implementing wildlife-friendly infrastructure, including overpasses and ecological corridors, to preserve the connectivity of saiga ranges and support the long-term conservation of this ungulate species.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal welfare is an important aspect of conservation programs for endangered species. Wild species can be bred and kept in captivity but, unlike domestic animals, there is a lack of welfare-assessment protocols for most of these species. In this study, we developed a protocol for the assessment of the welfare of Patagonian huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) in conservation, centers. We gathered the existing research on the behavior, ecology, conservation and captive management for this species. We used a welfare-assessment protocol for cattle as our starting point and suggested 23 indicators to assess welfare in Patagonian huemuls. This proposed protocol, which is the first protocol for assessing Patagonian huemul welfare, is rigorous and systematic, but also simple and practical. Further research is needed to validate the protocol in conservation centers; nevertheless, this protocol could be used as a basis for the development of new welfare-assessment protocols for other deer species. Animal-welfare-assessment protocols are important for identifying welfare problems in conservation programs. This study aimed to develop a baseline welfare protocol for the assessment of the welfare of Patagonian huemuls (Hippocamelus bisulcus) in conservation centers. This protocol is based on the Welfare Quality(& REG;) (WQ) framework for cattle and was developed with the consideration of the available research on the behaviors, ecology, conservation, and captive management of this species, as well as welfare-assessment protocols for other ungulate species. As a result, the protocol was specifically developed for Patagonian huemuls and included four principles, 12 criteria, and 23 animal- and resource-based indicators. The twelve criteria of the WQ protocol were reduced to nine, and three new criteria were added because they were both feasible and essential for welfare assessment in captive Patagonian huemuls. This protocol is mainly intended to identify welfare problems in endangered species in the context of conservation centers (reproduction, rescue, rehabilitation, or treatment centers). Thus, the aggregation of different measures to obtain a global score was not proposed. However, a scoring system that assigns a value on a 0-2 scale (0 = no welfare concern; 1 = welfare concern; 2 = urgent welfare concern) was proposed for each category. Although further research is still needed to fully validate the protocol, this is the first development of a protocol to assess Patagonian huemul welfare, and it can be used as a basis for the development of welfare-assessment protocols for other deer species in captivity.

AB  - Across fifty-eight boreal caribou study areas in Canada, survival and recruitment decrease with the percentage of the study area that is disturbed. There is variation in demographic rates among study areas, particularly where anthropogenic disturbance is low, but no populations inhabiting areas with high anthropogenic disturbance are considered viable. Demographic projections derived from local population-specific data are uncertain for populations with limited monitoring. We propose a simple Bayesian population model that integrates prior information from a national analysis of demographic-disturbance relationships with available local demographic data to improve population viability projections, and to reduce the risk that a lack of local data will be used as a reason to delay conservation action. The model also acknowledges additional uncertainty and potential bias due to misidentification of sex or missing calves, through a term derived from a simple model of the recruitment survey observation process. We combine this Bayesian model with simulations of plausible population trajectories in a value of information analysis framework to show how the need for local monitoring varies with landscape condition, and to assess the ability of alternative monitoring scenarios to reduce the risk of errors in population viability projections. Where anthropogenic disturbance is high, reasonably accurate status projections can be made using only national demographic-disturbance relationships. At lower disturbance levels where initial uncertainty is high local data improve accuracy but each additional year of monitoring provides less new information. The estimated probability of viability indicates whether more information is needed to improve accuracy of population viability projections.

AB  - In total, 57 ticks were collected from six white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and three mule deer (O. hemionus) in northern Mexico during the 2017, 2018 and 2019 hunting seasons. Morphological features of adult male and female ticks were observed and photographed using a stereo-microscope and scanning electron micrography. The ticks were identified as Dermacentor albipictus based on taxonomic keys. Molecular analysis using DNA amplification of the 16S rDNA and cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI) genes was employed to resolve the phylogenetic relationships from 18 strains of Dermacentor species. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed in order to obtain a phylogenetic tree based on the concatenated sequence in the D. albipictus clade. The geometric morphometric analysis compared the body shape of ticks collected from specimens of two deer species by analyzing nine dorsal and ventral landmarks from both males and females. The results suggest that body shape variation in dorsal structures might be related to the host.

AB  - Extreme regional ocean warming events, like marine heatwaves (MHWs), could have severe and long-lasting impacts on species and ecosystems. Extreme and persistent warming of the ocean could directly threaten survival of marine species, as exceeding their thermal tolerance often leads to massive mortality events. Similarly, MHWs could further threaten species persistence indirectly, by altering food webs, leading to cascading effects that are expected to be more pronounced for species at a lower trophic position. Green turtles, a representative species of the charismatic marine megafauna, are largely herbivorous; thus, their food availability is tightly linked to environmental conditions. Here, we explored the degree to which foraging areas of green turtles along the Southeast Asian region could be subjected to MHWs in the future. For this, we applied a series of climatic niche models to spatially delineate important foraging habitats for adult green turtles, Chelonia mydas, across the marine region of Southeast Asia. Our analysis revealed that marine sites, which could host foraging grounds for adult green turtles, cover around 37% of the Southeast Asian region, with high probability of experiencing prolonged and intense MHWs for the vast majority of these sites. The annual number of days subjected to MHWs could increase by 16-fold from the very recent past period, leading to even a permanent MHW state. These results offer some alarming messages for scientists and conservation planners, highlighting the need to improve our knowledge on the potential response of species to MHWs and design climate adaptation strategies.

AB  - Forest-steppe ecosystems represent a heterogeneous small-patch landscape important as a biodiversity hotspot and habitat for many endangered species. In this work, we examine threatened forest-steppe communities using structural indices, browsing intensity and indices that consider herbivorous game preferences. The study aims to assess the abundance of natural regeneration and the browsing intensity in relation to different stand structures and to identify woody species threatened by selective browsing at three study sites on the Krupina Plateau in the southern part of central Slovakia. At each study site, three circular permanent research plots (PRPs), each 500 m2 in size, were established for stand structure analysis. Within each PRP, nine circular subplots with a radius of 2 m were established for detailed analysis of natural regeneration. The results of this study suggest that forest patches in the forest-steppe mosaic suffer from a long-term lack of natural regeneration, which is induced mainly by increasing aridity and ungulate pressure. Positive effects on the amount of natural regeneration were noted in association with the aggregated structure of forest patches and the presence of dead wood. Differentiated stand structure influenced the regeneration number in a negative way and at the same time significantly increased browsing intensity. In relation to a more advanced regeneration, shrubs had a protective effect against browsing. The feeding preferences of the animals can positively modulate the species composition and eliminate the imbalances in the regeneration in favor of the increasingly rare Quercus pubescens Willd.

AB  - Abscesses are among the diseases affecting the survival of captive musk deer and are difficult to identify in their early stages. In this study, metagenomic sequencing, 16S rRNA sequencing, and paraffin sectioning were used to analyze the microbiota in the abscess musk deer pus group (AMP), abscess musk deer oral group (AMO), and healthy musk deer oral group (HMO) to compare the differences in microbiota in musk deer. By detecting differences in the oral microbiota through throat swabs, we aimed to monitor the early onset of abscess disease to facilitate timely intervention and treatment. The results showed that the alpha diversity of HMO microbiota was significantly higher than that of the AMP and AMO samples. Beta diversity results indicated that there were significant differences in the bacterial communities of HMO and AMO samples, and no significant difference was found between AMO and AMP samples. A taxonomic analysis of the bacterial species indicated that differences between HMO and AMP groups were found in the Fusobacterium and Trueperella species. Fusobacterium and Trueperella were the main pathogenic bacteria responsible for the occurrence of abscess diseases in forest musk deer in this study. Furthermore, the appearance of Fusobacterium and Trueperella in the oral cavity can serve as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of abscess disease in musk deer.

AB  - Populations of many tropical tree species are regulated by negative distance- and density-dependent processes (NDD), yet most studies on the effects of conspecific seedling and adult neighbors on seedling survival have focused on animal-dispersed species. Species with seeds dispersed by wind may not be moved as far on average as seeds dispersed by animals, but some seeds may be dispersed a lot further, suggesting that knowledge of dispersal mechanism may help in our understanding of NDD. In this study, we took advantage of a high-fecundity reproductive event that occurred for an individual isolated canopy tree of Vataireopsis iglesiasii in a tropical lowland rain forest site in Amazonian Ecuador to document seed dispersal and seedling survival to 1-year post-dispersal. Most seeds did not disperse far: 86% of germinated seedlings were found within 100 m. Mortality was high: only 49 of the 1732 monitored seedlings survived one year and only five survived a further four years. We found a significant negative effect of conspecific seedling density (but no effect of distance from the parent tree) on 1-year survival. Rare long-distance dispersal events may increase the probability of a seed reaching specific habitats, such as high-light patches, and surviving beyond one year, thereby shifting the population recruitment curve outwards away from adult trees and maintaining diversity in species-rich forests. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - Background and Aim: The native range of the African hippo has contracted significantly due to various anthropogenic threats such as poaching and habitat destruction, thus making the species highly prone to extinction. Protected areas can safeguard hippo populations through legal restrictions and other effective strategies. However, knowledge, perceived threats, and benefits of the species can influence local people's attitudes towards their conservation. Yet, gaps in our understanding of what people know about hippos and their conservation persist, especially in Ghana, where their population is vulnerable, thus requiring urgent research. Methods: To improve this knowledge deficit, we employed a mixed-methods research approach to collect data from household heads in five communities in the Bui National Park (BNP) landscape for descriptive and regression-based statistical analyses. Results: Our findings revealed that respondent's knowledge of hippos was significantly influenced by education and exposure to the species. Several respondents reported relatively stable or declining population patterns for hippos and attributed the causes to poaching and the construction of the hydropower dam in the BNP. Most respondents wanted hippo populations to increase in the future due to the potential benefits they could derive through tourism while the remaining respondents wanted their numbers to decline due to perceived conflict situations such as boat capsizing and crop damage. Conclusion: Local people's knowledge of the hippo and its conservation is influenced by education and exposure to the species, and its population is perceived to be declining due to human activities. Implications for Conservation: Authentic and meaningful engagements among diverse stakeholders (e.g., farmers, fishermen, and park authorities) in the BNP landscape are critical to ensuring hippo conservation based on our findings. In particular, community-wide education to enhance hippo literacy, avoidance of farming along riverbank habitats, and adoption of sustainable livelihood approaches may benefit the aquatic environment, hippos, and local people.

AB  - Numerous faunistic and ecological studies have been conducted throughout the Indo-Pacific Ocean to assess its biodiversity. Despite the abundance of research, studies on the species that inhabit the Indo-Pacific are still necessary due to its extent and high species richness. The major species richness of the genus Okenia Menke, 1830 (Nudibranchia, Goniodorididae) is found in the Indo-Pacific Ocean, including 38 of 60 valid species. Nevertheless, this number does not represent the real biodiversity, since at least 20 more species are already reported in field-guides as undescribed species belonging to this genus. The systematics of the genus Okenia are still unclear since it has been the subject of only a few and incomplete studies. In the present paper, we describe five new Okenia species from the coastlines of Japan, Mozambique and Australia: Okenia aurorapapillata sp. nov., Okenia elisae sp. nov., Okenia nakanoae sp. nov., Okenia siderata sp. nov. and Okenia tenuifibrata sp. nov. Moreover, anatomical details not previously described of Okenia atkinsonorum, Okenia barnardi, Okenia cf. echinata, Okenia hallucigenia, Okenia hiroi, Okenia japonica, Okenia pellucida, Okenia pilosa and Okenia rhinorma are provided. New partial sequences of standard markers (COI, 16S rRNA and H3) were obtained and a phylogenetic analysis that included all species with available data was performed.

AB  - . Rangifer tarandus is a keystone species in the Arctic and has shaped human land use in this region for tens of thousands of years. The migratory ecotype requires large landscapes and long migrations between summer and winter ranges to meet their nutritional needs. The extent to which these ranges have remained the same has been controversial and uncertain. Archaeological caribou herd identity is usually ascribed based on modern caribou herd distribution. However, no study has assessed the validity of the implicit assumption of multi-thousand years of range stasis. Given that a caribou herd's distribution and landscape use may change in response to ecological or climatic changes, it is important to assess whether past and present calving ground locations may have shifted. In this study, we applied strontium isotope analysis to identify calving grounds of archaeological caribou from the pre-contact/historic Lake Kaiyak site (MIS-00032) near the calving grounds of the modern Western Arctic caribou herd (WAH). We found that the 87Sr/86Sr values of the molars were consistent with those predicted for WAH ranges. The dental enamel from the neonatal line (NNL), a pathological marker of birth, was consistent with the modern WAH calving grounds and early summer range. These results suggest that the archaeological specimens were WAH animals. Broadly, this supports the use of strontium isotope analysis of permanent molars with an emphasis on the NNL to determine the herd identity of ungulates in the archaeological record, which has important implications for archaeology and modern wild ungulate herd management.

AB  - Population reduction through hunting and nuisance control has been practiced in many parts of the world to prevent an overabundance of ungulates; however, there is limited knowledge regarding the quantitative impact of intensified hunting management and nuisance control on local dynamics within managed populations. This study examined spatial variations in the local dynamics of sika deer (Cervus nippon) along with hunting and nuisance control across 256 mesh units (23 km2/mesh unit) within the Kushiro subprefecture of Hokkaido, Japan, from 1994 to 2020 (27 years). Under enhanced management, the population declined twice but only by about 14% from the previous peak each time. Since 2017, however, the population has remained stable without further decline. Local densities ranged from 1 to 120 deer/km2 within the area, with higher densities producing higher harvest rates (i.e., density-dependent harvesting). Temporal trends in local densities varied across the mesh units: in some mesh units, sika deer at a high density (>= 50 deer/km2) consistently decreased by more than half, whereas in others, medium densities (25-50 deer/km2) increased following temporal fluctuations, and low densities (<25 deer/km2) remained stable throughout the same period. Thus, the extent of human-induced population reduction locally differed and was likely larger at high-density mesh units. Consequently, the impact of intensified management at the prefecture scale varies locally. Therefore, allocating management efforts to high-density mesh units is preferable for more efficient population control across the entire area.

AB  - Climate change will impact the distribution of species and their preferred habitat, thereby influencing the ecological processes intrinsic to these species. To investigate these phenomena, we analyzed the habitat distribution, structure, and connectivity of 6 forest ungulate species in Southwest China under current and future climate scenarios. Habitat projections indicate that forest ungulates will migrate to the southwest at higher elevations and the northwest at higher latitudes and elevations in the study area under climate change. The extent to which climate change affects the 6 forest ungulates is quite different. By 2050, there will still be a certain range of habitats for migration in the study area, but the habitat quality of species will have decreased to varying degrees after migration. By 2070, most forest ungulates will begin to experience significant habitat loss and habitat quality decline. The migration of species habitat also leads to a change in species habitat structure. Habitat landscape quality declines for most forest ungulate species. The loss of patches at the junction habitat has a huge impact on species habitat connectivity. The number and distance of corridors between the marginal habitat patches and the core habitat patches increase to a certain extent. To better achieve biodiversity conservation, we should strengthen the restoration and connectivity management of fragmented habitats to protect and restore the current habitats of species. Examples include the management of specific key areas and the establishment of large-scale integrated protected areas such as the Giant Panda National Park.

AB  - Moschus chrysogaster (hereafter - musk deer) is an endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and surrounding areas in China. Due to historical overutilisation and habitat degradation and loss, the musk deer is endangered and faces serious threats to its survival. Besides in situ conservation, musk deer farming is an important and effective means for ex situ conservation and sustainable supply of musk resources. Wild musk deer are solitary and highly territorial, but in captivity they are subjected to intensive farming practices that confine them to a limited space, leading to the development of a hierarchy structure. This study was carried out from January 2021 to December 2023 at the Musk Deer Farm in Zhuanglang County, Gansu Province, China. Focal sampling and all-occurrence recording were used to measure conflict behaviour of captive musk deer. Social network analysis was used to study the relationships between social conflict and social learning within the captive community. Our finding revealed a significant positive correlation between the hierarchy rank of the conflict initiator and the receiver, and individuals tended to initiate conflict against individuals close to their ranks, which reflected the individual identification of the hierarchy within the community. The social learning behaviour of musk deer in various ranks was significantly different. The social learning behaviour of middle rank (40.7%) was significantly higher than that of high rank (14.5%) and low rank (14.0%). Compared with the social learning behaviour of musk deer before conflict (37.9%), the social learning behaviour of musk deer after conflict (62.1%) was significantly increased, but there was no significant difference in non-social learning behaviour before conflict (46.7%) and after conflict (53.3%). This research reveals the majority of conflicts unfolding among the higher ranks of the captive population. To improve musk deer farming, it is imperative to assess the conflict potential and sociality of individuals within the broader hierarchy. In addition, we found a significant surge in socially learning behaviours among musk deer post-conflict, indicative of the essential spread of information on individual rank and fighting capabilities within the captive population. Recognising the pronounced social learning in captive individuals with middle ranks, managers should focus on these key members. The alleviating conflict level by rationally translocating individuals while maintaining a hierarchical structure within the group is critical to the successful musk deer conservation and farming.

AB  - The rock shelter of La Vi (n) over tildea, located on the northern Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, contains a rich archaeological sequence dated from the Mousterian to the Magdalenian. This site preserves an extended Gravettian occupation where a diversified assemblage of fauna, lithic and bone tools has been attested. In this paper, we undertake the archaeozoological and taphonomic study of the macromammals found in the Gravettian levels X and IX of the Western Sector, recovered during the campaigns directed by Fortea between 1987 and 1992. The taphonomy indicates a high presence of fire-altered bone elements and butchery marks related to ungulate skinning and disarticulation activities, with a low presence of carnivore modifications, being Cervus elaphus, followed by Rupicapra rupicapra and Capra pyrenaica the most common taxa, therefore confirming the anthropogenic origin of the bone assemblage. Given the high fragmentation of the infantile remains identified, a biomolecular study by Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) was carried out to increase the taxonomic data and unravel the hunting strategies and site seasonality. Proteomic results revealed a high presence of newborn red deer and ibex, thus suggesting females herd captures during late spring/early summer.

AB  - Simple Summary The study examines how different factors influence the nutritional content of faeces from three gazelle species, with particular interest in the inter-specific factor. Through the contents of nitrogen and fibre, faeces can tell us about their digestive process. The research focuses on 193 captive individuals of three gazelle species and applied Near InfraRed Spectroscopy technology. The results show that different species have varying faecal nutrient levels. Cuvier's gazelle had lower nitrogen content, suggesting less efficient digestion than other gazelles. Factors like sex and age also played a role, but their effects were not the same for all species. Fibre content, related to diet quality, remained consistent. This study shows that factors affecting faecal nutrients are species-specific.Abstract Various environmental, individual, and species-specific factors may affect digestive efficiency in wild ruminants. The study of faecal nutritional components is a commonly used technique to understand these effects, assuming that faecal nitrogen and fibre contents reflect the diet's nutritional quality and digestibility. Recent studies have highlighted the relatively high influence of factors like sex, age, weight or body condition on digestive efficiency. This manuscript is focused on the inter-specific variability in faecal nutritional components under the same feeding regime, using three captive populations of closely related gazelles as model species. Faecal samples from 193 individuals were analysed through Near InfraRed Spectroscopy. Species, sex and age influence on faecal nitrogen and fibres (ADF and NDF) were investigated. We found inter-specific differences in the faecal content of the three studied nutritional components. Cuvier's gazelle showed lower faecal nitrogen content, suggesting lower digestive efficiency than dorcas and dama gazelles. Sex and age also had a moderate effect, especially in faecal nitrogen, but these effects were not constant across the three studied species. On the contrary, faecal fibres were highly constant (i.e., dependent on diet quality). These results confirm that individual factors affecting faecal nutritional components are also species-specific.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms that drive community assembly in species-rich tropical forest remains a fundamental challenge in ecology. Here, we integrated multivariate functional trait dimensions, phylogeny and metabolomics to test fundamental predictions concerning the role of differentiation with respect to abiotic and biotic niche axes in the maintenance of high local diversity of woody plants in the Euphorbiaceae. We measured 40 functional traits related to resource acquisition, photosynthetic capacity, hydraulic efficiency and secondary-metabolite profiles generated using untargeted metabolomics in all 26 Euphorbiaceae species in a 20-ha forest dynamics plot in tropical southwestern China. We examined the correlation structure of 40 traits using a trait networking approach. We coupled these traits with variation in soil nutrients, light environment, soil water content and herbivore pressure within the plot to assess niche differentiation in space. We compared phylogenetic signal among multivariate trait dimensions and secondary metabolites to assess niche differentiation in evolutionary time. Network analysis revealed that a small number of traits with high network centrality reflected variation in ecological strategy among the Euphorbiaceae. Using these high-centrality traits, we observed significant functional turnover along environmental gradients defined by light, soil moisture, soil nutrients and leaf herbivory, respectively. Most resource utilization traits showed significant phylogenetic signal, whereas almost all defensive traits lacked phylogenetic signal, including species similarity with respect to plant secondary metabolites. Synthesis. Our results suggest that resource-utilization traits and the habitat associations play a significant role in the niche segregation of co-occurring woody plants in the Euphorbiaceae. Secondary metabolites, however, may enhance diversity at a finer spatial scale by allowing closely related species with similar functional traits to partition biotic niche space within shared habitats in tropical rainforest.

AB  - Stressful conditions, such as mechanical damage, can significantly compromise the survival of algal beds by reducing their biomass, reproductive output, and even altering their production of defensive chemical compounds. In the present work, the effect of different intensities of trampling (no trampling, low and high trampling intensities) on reproduction, morphology, and phenolic content of Sargassum species was studied in three sites along the southwestern Atlantic Coast, Brazil, from March to October 2015. The parameters were evaluated in distinct periods (0, 90, and 180 days) after trampling, using 40- x 40-cm quadrats along transects. Trampling reduced algal reproductive biomass in two of the three studied sites (Pernambuco and Fortaleza beaches) shortly after the experimental treatment (T0). The mean thallus length was higher in trampled plots in all study sites, and the dry biomass of the individuals were higher in Pernambuco and Cigarras beaches, which also presented lower phenolic levels after damage. These results suggest a probable trade-off in resource allocation, with an immediate compromise of the individuals' reproduction followed by a decrease in the production of defense compounds, probably due to an investment in damage repairing of vegetative portions, maximizing the individuals' survival in the long term. Although the individuals reach larger sizes, they reproduce less and are more susceptible to other sources of stress that can compromise Sargassum spp. fitness.

AB  - Seasonal windows of opportunity are intervals within a year that provide improved prospects for growth, survival, or reproduction. However, few studies have sufficient temporal resolution to examine how multiple factors combine to constrain the seasonal timing and extent of developmental opportunities. Here, we document seasonal changes in milkweed (Asclepias fascicularis)-monarch (Danaus plexippus) interactions with high resolution throughout the last three breeding seasons prior to a precipitous single-year decline in the western monarch population. Our results show early- and late-season windows of opportunity for monarch recruitment that were constrained by different combinations of factors. Early-season windows of opportunity were characterized by high egg densities and low survival on a select subset of host plants, consistent with the hypothesis that early-spring migrant female monarchs select earlier-emerging plants to balance a seasonal trade-off between increasing host plant quantity and decreasing host plant quality. Late-season windows of opportunity were coincident with the initiation of host plant senescence, and caterpillar success was negatively correlated with heatwave exposure, consistent with the hypothesis that late-season windows were constrained by plant defense traits and thermal stress. Throughout this study, climatic and microclimatic variations played a foundational role in the timing and success of monarch developmental windows by affecting bottom-up, top-down, and abiotic limitations. More exposed microclimates were associated with higher developmental success during cooler conditions, and more shaded microclimates were associated with higher developmental success during warmer conditions, suggesting that habitat heterogeneity could buffer the effects of climatic variation. Together, these findings show an important dimension of seasonal change in milkweed-monarch interactions and illustrate how different biotic and abiotic factors can limit the developmental success of monarchs across the breeding season. These results also suggest the potential for seasonal sequences of favorable or unfavorable conditions across the breeding range to strongly affect monarch population dynamics.

AB  - Seasonal life history events are often interdependent, but we know relatively little about how the relationship between different events is influenced by the abiotic and biotic environment. Such knowledge is important for predicting the immediate and evolutionary phenological response of populations to changing conditions. We manipulated germination timing and shade in a multi-factorial experiment to investigate the relationship between spring and autumn phenology in seedlings of the pedunculate oak, Quercus robur, and whether this relationship was mediated by natural colonization of leaves by specialist fungal pathogens (i.e., the oak powdery mildew complex). Each week delay in germination corresponded to about 2 days delay in autumn leaf senescence, and heavily shaded seedlings senesced 5-8 days later than seedlings in light shade or full sun. Within seedlings, leaves on primary-growth shoots senesced later than those on secondary-growth shoots in some treatments. Path analyses demonstrated that germination timing and shade affected autumn phenology both directly and indirectly via pathogen load, though the specific pattern differed among and within seedlings. Pathogen load increased with later germination and greater shade. Greater pathogen load was in turn associated with later senescence for seedlings, but with earlier senescence for individual leaves. Our findings show that relationships between seasonal events can be partly mediated by the biotic environment and suggest that these relationships may differ between the plant and leaf level. The influence of biotic interactions on phenological correlations across scales has implications for understanding phenotypic variation in phenology and for predicting how populations will respond to climatic perturbation.

AB  - Trap cropping has long been an important component of integrated pest management schemes in agricultural ecosystems. Spatial dispersion and the strength of attraction of trap crops relative to principal crops, along with insect movement behavior, may all moderate the efficacy of trap cropping in controlling pests. Here we employ a simple differential-equation patch model to explore the interplay of trap cropping and biological control. In particular, we vary attraction strength to trap crops along with predator foraging behavior (mobility and directedness) to determine the relative influences of these factors on herbivore suppression. Our results highlight the fact pest suppression is mediated by the relative palatability of trap crops to both pests and predators, and somewhat mediated by the spatial dispersion of trap crops. We discuss the potential for using trap crops in combination with natural enemies to boost pest suppression in annual cropping systems.

AB  - In recent years, drought stress has emerged as the most significant threat to agricultural crop cultivation in Iran, primarily due to decreasing precipitation and water resources. To investigate the yield and physiological changes of new rapeseed varieties influenced by salicylic acid under water stress, an experiment was conducted in Qazvin, Iran during the years 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. The experiment was conducted as a factorial split plot with three replications. Irrigation in 2 levels (normal irrigation and irrigation interruption after flowering stage), salicylic acid in 2 levels (water (control) and salicylic acid concentration of 0.3 g/L) as main plots and 6 varieties (FJL425, FJL153, FJL330, FJL424, FJL290, and Okapi) in sub plots were considered. Drought stress is indicated by increased proline content in leaves. The application of salicylic acid resulted in decreased proline content. FJL330 and FJL290 varieties had the highest proline content while the lowest proline content was observed in cv. Okapi is under water stress. The mean comparison of irrigation x variety interaction indicated that FJL330 had the most grain yield under normal irrigation. Okapi had the most grain yield under irrigation interruption after the flowering stage. Results showed a significant negative correlation between grain yield and proline content which means proline content was decreased in normal irrigation and increased under water stress conditions. This situation was reversed in grain yield. In general, physiological indicators affected by drought stress can impact grain yield, and using salicylic acid as a foliar spray can effectively help to partially mitigate yield reduction.

This also holds for the European hot spot of bat diversity, the Mediterranean region, where human land use and, more recently, global warming, continue to promote a large-scale replacement of forests by sparsely wooded areas. To analyse how different bat species cope with this change in habitat availability, we studied bat activity and distribution on Asinara island, Sardinia. Call recordings were performed in different habitat types (forest, semi-open, open, settlement) and classified as echolocation, social call, or feeding, contacts. We checked for effects of habitat type, temperature, relative humidity, moonlight, and availability of potential prey insects on bat activity. Habitat type was the predominant factor explaining bat activity, which was highest at forest sites and lowest at open sites. Thus open-space foragers did not benefit from the ample presence of open areas. On the other hand, some edge and narrow space foragers reacted with habitat switching to forest loss. Thus, Rhinolophus hipposideros was predominant at semi-open sites, reflecting a flexible use of foraging habitats. Finally, contact types differed across habitat types with species-related preferences for social interactions and foraging activity. Our results suggest that sparsely wooded areas promote a change of bat community composition, and a loss of certain species, but also that a more balanced mix of habitat types by partial reforestation may help to maintain, and even increase, bat species diversity on Mediterranean islands.

AB  - Scope Currently knowledge is weak about which plant species boundaries are determined directly by climate and soil factors, versus which are mediated by biotic interactions, such as exclusion by superior competitors or by pathogens. Under moving climate zones the difference is important. For example, will warm boundaries shrink poleward of their own accord, or only following invasion by other species? What research will most effectively strengthen our understanding of this fundamental issue in ecology? Conclusions Traditionally the required experiment has been transplant beyond the species boundary, together with density manipulation of putative competitors, herbivores, pathogens or facilitators. But now climate zones are being moved across species distributions, creating a different sort of experiment. In order to learn efficiently from this massive inadvertent experiment, exposure to new climate needs to be combined with experimental manipulation of other factors. Because range extensions are likely to be spatially patchy, these experiments need to be geographically extensive, to be sustained over 2-4 decades, and to be twinned with wide-area population monitoring via drones and other remote sensing. Highest priorities for experimental manipulation would be removal of competition, and provision of seedlings. Highest priorities for locations would be zones where vegetation physiognomy changes, such as woodlands into grasslands, or rainforest into fire-prone forest.

AB  - Effective management of charismatic large carnivores requires robust monitoring of their population at local, regional and global scales. While enormous progress has been made to estimate carnivore populations at local scales, estimates at regional and global scales remain elusive. In the first systematic effort at a large regional scale, we estimated the population of the elusive snow leopard Panthera uncia over an area of 26,112 km(2) in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. We stratified the entire snow leopard habitat in Himachal Pradesh based on an occupancy survey. Subsequently, we conducted camera trapping surveys at 10 sites distributed proportionately, that is with similar coverage probability across the three strata. We conducted simulations to understand how unidentified captures could affect our model estimate. We also assessed populations of the primary wild ungulate prey of snow leopards - blue sheep Pseudois nayaur and Siberian ibex Capra sibirica. Our results yielded a mean estimated density of 0.19 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12-0.31) snow leopards per 100 km(2) and population size of 51 (95% CI: 34-73) snow leopards in Himachal Pradesh. The density estimates for individual sites ranged from 0.08 to 0.37 snow leopards per 100 km(2). Simulations showed that unidentified snow leopard captures did not seem to affect the accuracy of our model estimate but could have affected the precision. Wild ungulate prey density ranged from 0.11 to 1.09 per km(2). Snow leopard density showed a positive linear relationship with prey density (slope = 0.25, SE = 0.08, P = 0.01, R-2 = 0.51). Our study shows the earlier opinion-based estimate for Himachal Pradesh to have been significantly positively biased. Using occupancy surveys to stratify large areas in order to design camera trap surveys addresses one of the common spatial sampling biases, that is limited sampling of only prime snow leopard habitats. Our work validates two-step approach recommended in the ongoing initiative of the 12 snow leopard range countries for Population Assessment of World's Snow leopards (PAWS program), and cautions against the use of opinion-based estimates for assessing the status of species of critical conservation importance.

AB  - Loss of migratory behavior or shifts in migratory ranges are growing concerns to wildlife managers. How ungulates prioritize safety from predators at the expense of high-quality foraging opportunities during calving may be key to understanding these shifts and long-term reproductive success. We compared trade-offs in selection for forage and predation risk by elk (Cervus canadensis) following 3 migratory tactics (western and eastern migration and resident) during 2 time periods in a declining (by almost 70% from 2002-2016), partially migratory elk population adjacent to Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. We hypothesized that regardless of migratory tactic, maternal elk would show stronger trade-offs between high-quality foraging associated with higher predation risk and forage resources of lower-quality yet lower risk on calving ranges than on ranges used during summer because of vulnerability of their offspring. Additionally, we hypothesized these trade-offs would occur at high (2002-2006) and low (2013-2016) elk population sizes. We used a machine-learning algorithm to predict dates of parturition based on global positioning system (GPS) movements of elk equipped with vaginal implants (n = 60) and predictions were within 1.43 +/- 0.85 (SE) days of the known date. We applied the model to an additional 58 GPS-collared elk without vaginal implants. Based on changes in localized movements, we defined calving areas as the 26 days post-parturition and compared habitat characteristics of calving areas to 10 similar-sized areas centered on random locations during summer for the same individual in a latent selection framework. Across the 2 time periods, parturition occurred from 8 May-11 July with median parturition dates differing among migratory tactics and residents shifting towards an earlier parturition date in the later period. All elk, regardless of migratory tactic and time period, selected calving areas with greater forage resources than were available on areas used during summer, with no evidence for greater selection of areas that reduced predation risk at the expense of higher-quality foraging. Calving season selection for areas with abundant forage exposed western migrants to high risk of bear (Ursus spp.) predation, residents to high risk of wolf (Canis lupus) predation, and eastern migrants to low risk of bear and wolf predation. Patterns in exposure to predation risk during calving between migratory tactics were consistent with the recent decline in western migrants and increase in eastern migrants, implying that conditions on calving areas contributed to observed changes in the number of elk following these tactics.

AB  - Understanding the ecology of the often dense white-tailed deer populations in urban and suburban landscapes is important for mitigating a variety of conflicts that arise with dense human populations, such as issues surrounding zoonotic disease mitigation. We collared white-tailed deer in highly suburban areas of Howard County, Maryland with high-resolution GPS collars. Then, we created autocorrelated kernel density home ranges for broader land use analyses and concurrently used general additive models to characterize fine-scale hourly measures of speed, activity, and proximity to residential buildings. Suburban deer home ranges encompassed approximately 35% direct residential land, and an average of 71 and 129 residential properties were found within female and male core ranges, respectively. Sex, time of day, and day of year all influenced fine-scale speeds, activity levels, and proximity to residential property buildings. Deer moved into residential areas nightly, especially in winter, and exhibited bouts of increased speed and activity shortly after sunrise and sunset, with distinctive seasonal changes. We discuss how variation in home ranges and movements may influence population management success and explore year-round periods of increased risk of deer transporting ticks to residential areas. These findings focus our broad understanding of deer movements in suburban and urban landscapes to improve deer population management and to mitigate the spread of ticks into residential areas.

AB  - Plant transpiration is a key component of the hydrological cycle that moves water from the soil through plants to the atmosphere and is largely determined by environmental conditions. The challenges of highly variable climatic conditions and water scarcity in the semi-arid savannas of southern Africa drive trees to exhibit different water use strategies.An additional challenge for savanna trees arises from the browsing of large mammals, and its potential impact on transpiration has largely been overlooked.To assess water use strategies and the impact of browsing on transpiration in three common savanna woody species (Colophospermum mopane, Catophractes alexandri, Senegalia mellifera), we conducted an extensive field experiment in a wildlife reserve in Namibia. We established a browsing gradient ranging from 0% to 100% leaf removal to disentangle complex relationships, and we measured sap flow representing whole-tree transpiration, stomatal conductance as a proxy for leaf level transpiration, and environmental factors including soil moisture, solar radiation, air temperature and air humidity.We discovered a unimodal relationship between browsing intensity and sap flow, consistent across all species, and peaking at low to moderate browsing levels equivalent to approximately 30% leaf removal. This universal pattern is remarkable since we found water use strategies to differ among species: Colophospermum mopane and C. alexandri exhibit a water-saving behaviour to reduce water loss under unfavourable conditions while S. mellifera demonstrates water-spending characteristics.The deviation from a negative linear effect of browsing does not meet the functional expectation when browsing is translated into a simple leaf area reduction. Instead, it can be attributed to stomatal adjustments that partially compensate for transpiratory surface loss. We propose that this conceptual mechanism can be generalised to other woody species and various ecosystems. In addition, common transpiration models relying solely on leaf area indices and abiotic factors can be improved by including a non-linear relationship to reproduce the effect of browsing accurately.Our findings highlight the role of herbivores in shaping the connection between the Earth's spheres and improve our understanding of ecohydrological and vegetation dynamics in Southern African savannas.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - The effective management of species with small and fragmented populations requires an in-depth understanding of how the effects of human-induced habitat disturbance shape the structure and gene flow at fine spatial scales. Identi-fication of putative environmental barriers that affect individual exchange among subpopulations is imperative to pre-vent extinction risks. Here, we investigated how landscape affects the gene flow and relatedness structure of a population of the endangered lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros). We also assessed the effects of sexbiased dispersal on genetic relatedness. We genotyped 287 bat samples collected across southern Portugal and developed re-sistance surfaces for landscape variables hypothesized to affect gene flow. Then, we used spatially explicit models to fit relatedness distance through the resistance surfaces. We found genetic evidence of sex-biased dispersal and identified a significant fine scale structuring in the relatedness regarding females, the philopatric sex. Males displayed uniform levels of relatedness throughout the landscape. The results indicated less relatedness between the female ' from roosts located on proximity of roads than in roosts away from roads. Also, when analysing the sexes together the relatedness on roosts separated by highway were subtly less related in comparison to those occurring on the same side. Roads seem to be major shapers of the contemporary population structure of females, regardless of being relatively recent struc-tures in the landscape. Furthermore, the relatedness patterns detected suggested that high tree density among roosts and continuity of forest patches in broader surrounding areas, promotes the relatedness among individuals.

AB  - Stick and leaf insects (Phasmatodea) are large terrestrial herbivorous arthropods known for masquerading as plant parts such as bark, twigs and leaves. Their evolutionary history is largely shaped by convergent evolution associated with adaptive radiations on geographically isolated landmasses that have repeatedly generated ground-dwelling ecomorphs. The members of one lineage, however, the Oriental Heteropterygidae, are morphologically rather uniform, and have a predominantly ground-dwelling lifestyle. The phylogeny of Heteropterygidae that comprises approximately 130 described species is controversial and remains uncertain. In particular, the systematic position of the giant Jungle Nymph Heteropteryx dilatata, whose males are capable of flight and exhibit the most plesiomorphic wing morphology among extant phasmatodeans, is of major interest to the scientific community. Here, we analysed a set of seven nuclear and mitochondrial genes to infer the phylogeny of Heteropterygidae covering the group's overall diversity. The divergence time estimation and reconstruction of the historical biogeography resulted in an ancestral distribution across Sundaland with long distance dispersal events to Wallacea, the Philippines and the South Pacific. We were able to resolve the relationships among the three principal subgroups of Heteropterygidae and revealed the Dataminae, which contain entirely wingless small forms, as the sister group of Heteropteryginae + Obriminae. Within Heteropteryginae, Haaniella is recovered as paraphyletic in regard to Heteropteryx. Consequently, Heteropteryx must be considered a subordinate taxon deeply embedded within a flightless clade of stick insects. Within Obriminae, the Bornean Hoploclonia is strongly supported as the earliest diverging lineage. Based on this finding, we recognize only two tribes of equal rank among Obriminae, the Hoplocloniini trib. nov. and Obrimini sensu nov. Within the latter, we demonstrate that previous tribal assignments do not reflect phylogenetic relationships and that a basal splitting event occurred between the wing-bearing clade Miroceramia + Pterobrimus and the remaining wingless Obrimini. The Philippine genus Tisamenus is paraphyletic with regard to Ilocano hebardi, thus, we transfer the latter species to Tisamenus as Tisamenus hebardi comb. nov. and synonymize Ilocano with Tisamenus. We discuss character transformations in the light of the new phylogenetic results and conclude that the current taxonomic diversity appears to be mainly driven by allopatry and not to be the result of niche differentiation. This radiation is thus best described as a nonadaptive radiation.

AB  - Infectious wildlife diseases that circulate at the interface with domestic animals pose significant threats worldwide and require early detection and warning. Although animal tracking technologies are used to discern behavioural changes, they are rarely used to monitor wildlife diseases. Common disease-induced behavioural changes include reduced activity and lethargy ('sickness behaviour'). Here, we investigated whether accelerometer sensors could detect the onset of African swine fever (ASF), a viral infection that induces high mortality in suids for which no vaccine is currently available. Taking advantage of an experiment designed to test an oral ASF vaccine, we equipped 12 wild boars with an accelerometer tag and quantified how ASF affects their activity pattern and behavioural fingerprint, using overall dynamic body acceleration. Wild boars showed a daily reduction in activity of 10-20% from the healthy to the viremia phase. Using change point statistics and comparing healthy individuals living in semi-free and free-ranging conditions, we show how the onset of disease-induced sickness can be detected and how such early detection could work in natural settings. Timely detection of infection in animals is crucial for disease surveillance and control, and accelerometer technology on sentinel animals provides a viable complementary tool to existing disease management approaches.

AB  - Feeding habits of herbivorous fishes play an important role in shaping the form and function of coastal marine ecosystems. Rabbitfishes (Siganidae) are important consumers of macroalgae on Indo-West Pacific coral reefs. However, it is unclear how their diet varies among and within species at biogeographical scales, casting doubt on their precise functional roles across different regions. The present study assessed the inter- and intra-specific diet variation of four rabbitfishes (Siganus trispilos, Siganus corallinus, Siganus virgatus and Siganus doliatus) factored by morphological relatedness among populations from Ningaloo Reef (western Australia), the Great Barrier Reef (GBR, eastern Australia) and the Yaeyama Islands (Okinawa Prefecture, Japan). Results showed that the region had a strong effect on diet, effectively reducing the expected effect of morphologic similitude. While intra-specific differences were only significant when populations inhabited different regions; interspecific differences were not as predicted, with different morphotypes having similar diets when populations inhabited the same regions. Rabbitfishes consumed more corticated and filamentous macroalgae on the GBR, more foliose and membranous macroalgae at the Yaeyama Islands, and more leathery macroalgae at Ningaloo Reef. The findings indicate that rabbitfishes have high diet plasticity, and hence their functional role as mediators of competition between macroalgae and corals can change across biogeographic regions. Local context is therefore important when assessing the diet and functional role of herbivorous fishes. As climate change unfolds, shifts in the distribution, trophic behaviour and function of species are expected, making the study of trophic plasticity more important.

AB  - Large terrestrial wildlife negatively impacts agricultural livelihoods on all continents except Antarctica. There is growing recognition of the need to reconcile these impacts to achieve socially and ecologically sustainable wildlife conservation agendas. Elk populations in northern California are estimated to have doubled in the past 35 years, marking a conservation success, but also increasing forage loss and damage to infrastructure on private land. Wildlife managers are pursuing the goal of increasing elk numbers on public lands, but elk are preferentially utilizing private pasture and rangeland, driving conflict with beef and dairy producers. We conducted 17 semistructured interviews with private landowners, primarily beef and dairy producers, in northern California to understand their experiences and reactions to elk conflict and state wildlife management. Landowners report that elk density on private rangeland has steadily increased in recent years and poses a threat to their businesses due to loss of forage, damage to fences, and the corresponding liability risk posed by breached fences and errant cattle. The absence of crop and forage loss compensation, difficulty obtaining depredation permits, and low harvest quotas for recreational hunting limit landowner mitigation options and foster resentment toward the state wildlife agency. Most landowners believe that current elk management policies, including restricted hunting opportunities, do not adequately address elk conflict, creating novel challenges for wildlife officials tasked with reconciling elk restoration goals with a variety of stakeholders experiencing economic losses and threats to rural livelihoods. We discuss these issues in the context of common wildlife management challenges, such as building social capital, defining tolerable impacts, and building institutional capacity for alternative solutions within rigid regulatory frameworks. We draw upon environmental economics and common-pool resource theory to suggest that a rethinking of elk management based on local conditions, facilitating damage compensation mechanisms while reducing transaction costs, and increasing participation of local stakeholders in decision making might improve outcomes.

AB  - By-catch, the unintentional capture of non-target species in fishing gear, is often described as a rare event when it pertains to marine mammals. Yet, it is the greatest threat to many marine megafauna species, especially small cetaceans. How can both of these statements be true simultaneously? The adjective "rare" is itself rarely defined in a precise and quantitative way. Data collection features are crucial to understand the processes leading to a perception of rarity in samples on by-catch of marine mammals and other protected, endangered and threatened species (PETS). Statistical principles in the design of monitoring schemes must be upheld to ensure sample representativeness when scaling up impact estimates to the level of whole fisheries. Random allocation of observers or monitoring technologies (e.g. Remote Electronic Monitoring) can be strengthened to test the hypothesis that by-catch is a rare event and not only a rarely registered event, especially in monitoring schemes that are not dedicated to PETS by-catch. Even if by-catch is a rare event at the level of a single fishing operation, given the large total number of the latter, and their expansive spatial and temporal extent, by-catch may still impact significantly marine mammal populations.

AB  - The use of manure, organic mulch, and legume-based fertilizers can increase soil fertility in semiarid regions. However, the effects of such practices on soils prone to desertification are unknown. This study aimed to evaluate soil fertility and herbaceous stratum yield on soils amended with different organic inputs in the desertification hotspot of Iraucuba, Ceara state, Brazil. The experiments were performed in two areas with different soils (Planosol and Cambisol), in randomized blocks with a 2 x 2 x 3 + 1 factorial design. The factors consisted of (i) mulch (presence or absence of Copernicia prunifera [carnauba palm] straw), (ii) manure (sheep or cattle), and (iii) legume-based fertilizer (Mimosa tenuiflora [jurema], Mimosa caesalpiniifolia [sabia], and Leucaena leucocephala [leucena]), in addition to an untreated control, with three replicates. Soil chemical attributes and herbaceous stratum yield were assessed in the two areas. Positive effects of the combined use of carnauba palm straw, manures, and legume-based fertilizers on soil fertility were more evident for Planosol than for Cambisol. The combination of sheep manure with sabia-based fertilizer in Planosol, and cattle manure and leucena-based fertilizer in Cambisol increased herbaceous stratum yield. Herbaceous stratum yield in Planosol is more responsive to the input of great amounts of soil nutrients (especially P) and it increases soil organic matter levels, while in Cambisol, herbaceous stratum yield is more associated with the ability of inputs to make nutrients readily available. The use of organic amendments can reverse, in the short-term, degradation and desertification processes of soils in the Brazilian semiarid region.

AB  - Our understanding of the benthic communities on arctic seamounts and descriptions of such communities in habitat classification systems are limited. In recent years, Schulz Bank (73 degrees 52 & PRIME;N 7 degrees 30 & PRIME;E), a seamount on the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge (AMOR), has become well studied but the work has primarily focused on an arctic sponge ground at the summit. This has compounded a general assumption that the most biologically interesting community is on the summit alone. With the potential threat of deep-sea mining on nearby sites on AMOR, it is crucial to form a baseline understanding of the benthic megafaunal communities not only on the summit, but on the slopes and base of the seamount as well. Using video footage collected by a remotely operated vehicle in 2017 and 2018 to survey the seamount from 2700 to 580 m depth, several distinct megafauna communities on Schulz Bank were identified. Specifically, five biotopes, two of which were dominated by large structure-forming sponges, appeared to follow a depth gradient and change with the type of substrata present. The spongedominated communities on the summit and lower slope had the highest average community densities and number of morphotaxa per image compared to the upper slope and seamount base communities. Most notably, sponge-dominated bedrock walls on the lower slopes challenge the assumption that the summit is the most dense and diverse community on Schulz Bank. The results from this study lay the foundation for future research and conservation efforts of arctic sponge grounds by looking beyond the seamount summit to bring a full view of enigmatic sponge dominated ecosystems.

AB  - Avoidance of intensive rice cultivation (IRC) and soil amendments are potential practices to enhance soil properties. There is only limited information on the effects of reduced IRC and its mixture with compost or silicate fertilizer (Si) on the soil nematode community in salt-affected soils. This study aimed to assess the shifts of soil nematode community by reducing a rice crop from triple rice system (RRR) to a double rice system and mixed with compost or Si in paddy fields in acid sulfate soil (ASS) and alluvial soil (AL) in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Field experiments were designed with four treatments in four replicates, including RRR and a proposed system of double-rice followed by a fallow (FRR) and with 3 Mg ha(-1) crop(-1) compost or 100 kg ha(-1) crop(-1) Si. Soils were collected at harvest after the 2 year experiment, reflecting the fifth and third consecutive rice crop in RRR and FRR system, respectively. Results showed that reduced IRC gave a significant reduction in abundance of plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN), dominated by Hirschmanniella and increased abundance bacterivorous nematodes when mixed to compost and silicate fertilizer in ASS. In addition, reduced IRC increased nematode biodiversity Hill's indices and reduced herbivorous footprint in ASS. Proposed system having compost or Si had strongly increased in bacterivorous and omnivorous footprints. Particularly, reduced IRC mixture with Si increased abundance of Rhabdolaimus, Mesodorylaimus and Aquatides, metabolic footprints (structure footprint, bacterivorous, omnivorous and predator) and diversity Hill's N1 index in ASS. Our results highlighted that reduced IRC was a beneficial practice for decreasing abundance of PPN in salt-affected soils and increasing abundance of FLN in ASS. IRC mixture with compost or Si had potential in structuring the nematode communities with increasing biodiversity, trophic structure, and metabolic footprints.

AB  - 1. Variation in habitat quality affects individual fitness through the accumulation of benefits and costs over time. Although an individual's fitness and susceptibility to mortality are consequences of these past experiences, current analytical models do not quantify the cumulative effects of resources, risks, and environmental conditions on survival. 2. We developed the Survival and Habitat Quality model (SHQ), which redefines survival as a cumulative process and measures habitat quality by its aggregate effect on survival through time. SHQ is an autoregressive time-series model that uses fine-scale tracking data, remotely sensed environmental data, and computational power to quantify the cumulative effects of spatial variation in habitat quality on survival without relying on subjective, user-defined lag effects. 3. We tested SHQ on simulated data and on pronghorn data in South Dakota, USA. Compared to a traditional survival model, SHQ was more precise and accurate at estimating cumulative effects of habitat on survival. Using model output, we were also able to generate maps predicting areas of high and low pronghorn survival. 4. SHQ is a conceptual and methodological advance that explicitly integrates individuals' day-to-day interactions with their surroundings to identify ultimate sources of mortality. The model is a novel and accurate tool for assessing habitat quality and identifying management actions that increase individual survival and population growth. More broadly, SHQ's flexible mathematical framework captures the full spatial and temporal scope of processes affecting survival, providing a powerful means for understanding the environmental basis of fitness.

AB  - Plant functional traits reflect species ecological strategies and determine how plants respond to environmental changes, however, how dominant species in the Inner Mongolia grassland adapt to different grazing systems by changing their functional traits has not been systematically investigated. In this study, we established four 7-year grazing treatments in the Inner Mongolia grassland: cattle grazing, sheep grazing, mixed sheep and cattle grazing, and no grazing. Fourteen functional traits of three dominant species (Stipa grandis, Leymus chinensis, and Cleistogenes squarrosa) were measured under the different grazing treatments. We found convergences of plant functional traits that indicate herbivory avoidance or tolerance. Plants reduced their vegetative height (VH) and stem: leaf ratio (SLR) to avoid grazing; increased their ability to acquire resources by increasing their specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), and leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC); and reduced their leaf dry matter content (LDMC) to tolerate grazing. Moreover, plants may adapt to grazing by increasing the intraspecific variability of their functional traits. Sheep-only grazing adversely affected L. chinensis growth and survival, while cattle-only grazing hindered S. grandis growth and increased the intraspecific variability of its plant functional traits. Our study emphasizes that intraspecific variability is an important indicator of the responses of plant functional traits to grazing. Since single grazing is more detrimental to the functional traits of dominant plants, we suggest that mixed cattle and sheep grazing may be a more environmentally friendly and sustainable practice for the Inner Mongolia grassland than single grazing.

AB  - Southern China and Southeast Asia were favourable habitats for foragers during the Last Glacial Maximum (similar to 25-18 ka BP) and the Last Deglaciation (similar to 18-11.7 ka BP), despite various climate fluctuation. However, the underlying subsistence strategies in these areas remains unclear, due to the lack of systematic chronological and archaeological data. The current study reports new results of radiocarbon dating, U-series dating, and zooarchaeological analysis from the Naminan cave site, located at the boundary between Southern China and Southeast Asia. It reveals that deer was consumed as the primary source of meat (91.7 %), supplemented by turtles, wild oxen, monkeys, wild boars, and mustelids during similar to 17.35-16.49 ka BP. The subsequent period of similar to 15.55-15.35 ka BP saw a radical declining proportion of deer, with various new species being consumed, such as shrews, porcupines, fish, crab, canidae, and wild cat. Human occupation of the Naminan cave site might have lasted until the Early Holocene. Comparing archaeological and paleoclimate evidence from Southern China and Southeast Asia, it is reasonable to argue that a progressively drier and colder climate during similar to 17.35-15.35 ka BP appeared to trigger a remarkable decline in human activity but greater range of diets in locations such as the Naminan cave and Yuchanyan sites, facilitating further expansion of hunting-gathering groups during the late phase of the Last Deglaciation with warm and humid climate. This study contributes fresh data and perspective to a greater understanding of the evolution of human-climate interactions in low-latitude regions during Late Paleolithic period.

AB  - The early growth stage of plants is vital to community diversity and community regeneration. The JanzenConnell hypothesis predicts that conspecific density dependence lowers the survival of conspecific seedlings by attracting specialist natural enemies, promoting the recruitment and performance of heterospecific neighbors. Recent work has underscored how this conspecific negative density dependence may be mediated by mutualists - such as how mycorrhizal fungi may mediate the accrual of host-specific pathogens beneath the crown of conspecific adult trees. Aboveground mutualist and enemy interactions exist as well, however, and may provide useful insight into density dependence that are as of yet unexplored. Using a long-term seedling demographic dataset in a subtropical forest plot in central China, we confirmed that conspecific neighborhoods had a significant negative effect on seedling survival in this subtropical forest. Furthermore, although we detected more leaf damage in species that were closely related to ants, we found that the presence of ants had significant positive effects on seedling survival. Beside this, we also found a negative effect of ant appearance on seedling growth which may reflect a trade-off between survival and growth. Overall, our findings suggested that ants and conspecific neighborhoods played important but inverse roles on seedling survival and growth. Our results suggest ants may mediate the influence of conspecific negative density dependence on seedling survival at community level.

AB  - Background Dataset of annual monitoring of herbivory effects on the conservation status of the endangered species Androcymbium europaeum (Lange) K. Richt and its associated plant communities is presented in this manuscript. This dataset encompasses the annual monitoring of herbivory effects on the conservation status of the endangered species Androcymbium europaeum. Since 2010, the SERPAM Department (Service of Evaluation, Restoration and Protection of Mediterranean Agrosystems) at the Zaidin Experimental Station, belonging to the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC-EEZ), has conducted annual sampling to assess the impact of both domestic and wild livestock, specifically rabbits, on the pastures where A. europaeum lives. The study consisted of a randomised block design, implementing three distinct treatments to evaluate different management strategies: (1) rabbit and domestic herbivory, (2) exclusion of domestic livestock and (3) exclusion of rabbits and domestic livestock. Within each treatment, two types of monitoring were conducted. Firstly, the abundance of A. europaeum was estimated by counting individuals within 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats. Secondly, plant species diversity was assessed along 2-m long transects using the modified Point -Quadrat method. The research was conducted within the Cabo de Gata-Nijar Natural Park in southern Spain, specifically in the Amoladeras Nature Reserve in Almeria. New information The dataset contains information spanning from 2010 to 2023, providing valuable insights into the annual monitoring of herbivory effects on the conservation status of A. europaeum, contributing to our understanding of the species' interaction with domestic and wild animal in the studied area.

AB  - Goat willow (Salix caprea L.) is an ecologically important, cold-tolerant pioneer species that spreads from central Anatolia to Black Sea regions in Turkiye. Completed and ongoing construction of hydroelectric plants, especially in northeastern Turkiye, threaten the genetic resources of goat willow in the region due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Therefore, it is important to assess genetic diversity structure and magnitude of goat willow populations in the northeastern Black Sea Region for effective conservation and utilization of genetic resources of the species. To characterize the genetic diversity of goat willow, 180 trees were sampled from 5 river systems and screened by using ten microsatellite markers for genotyping, consequently analysis were carried out to estimate population genetic diversity parameters of populations. The results revealed that both observed (Ho = 0.50) and expected (He = 0.53) genetic diversities were low, but observed genetic diversity was less than expected due fragmentation and reduction in population sizes. Genetic structure analysis of populations suggested the presence of three major groups. This structuring appeared to be caused by the restricted gene flow (pollen, seed or vegetative material) through insects, wind and water due to geographical barrier (the east Black Sea mountain ranges) acting as geographic isolation mechanism between the populations of the coruh river and the river systems located in the west of coruh river. To prevent further deterioration of genetic diversity due to habitat loss and fragmentation in the studied river systems in the region, we suggest that one population with high genetic diversity, unique alleles and low inbreeding from each genetic structure cluster should be designated as in situ conservation sites. The genetic resources from such in situ designated populations will facilitate future efficient restoration, genetic resource management and utilization works with the species.

AB  - A growing body of work has revealed that differences in body size of ungulates follow ecoregion and soil boundaries and that these size differences are nutritionally influenced. Currently, it is unclear if these patterns of body size result from differences in quantity or quality of forage produced. We quantified differences in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimm.) body mass and antler size captured at four sites in South Texas, United States. We sampled available forage to determine if long-term differences in average body and antler size could be explained by forage quantity or quality, or some combination of the two. Data collected from 2011 to 2019 indicated female body mass was > 3 kg smaller on the eastern edge of the Coastal Sand Plain ecoregion as compared with those from the western transition zone of the Coastal Sand Plain and Tamaulipan Thornscrub ecoregions. Similarly, male body mass and antler size were > 6 kg and > 20 cm smaller, respectively, in coastal habitats compared with more interior sites. We found that forb biomass, browse and forb diversity, and the nutritional landscape, quantified using digestible energy, crude protein, phosphorus, and neutral detergent fiber, differed between sites. However, differences between sites were inconsistent with predictions that would have supported our hypothesis. Overall, we found no support for the hypothesis that forage quantity drives ecogeographic variation in physical traits of white-tailed deer but were unable to fully refute or support the hypothesis that forage quality, specifically plant diversity, drives ecogeographic variation in physical traits of ungulates.

AB  - Swine influenza A viruses (S-IAV) circulate in wild boar populations worldwide. Subtypes primarily reflect those actually present within the respective pig industry. Accordingly, infections with swine H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 have been reported for several regions of Germany. As pigs are susceptible not only to S-IAV but also to avian and human influenza A viruses, it is necessary to consider the possibility that new reassortant viruses with pandemic potential may arise in these new hosts. Therefore, in this study the impact of recent IAV epidemics on antibody prevalences in Bavarian wild boar was assessed. Important events considered were the H1N1pdm09 pandemic, which affected humans and swine, and the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 panzootic in 2016 and 2017, affecting wild and domestic birds. IAV seroprevalences were determined analysing 1,396 samples from before and after the H5N8 panzootic, from various regions in Bavaria, a large administrative region in the South of Germany. Taken together, seroprevalences varied markedly from 1.44% to 12.59%, relative to region and time. However, no discrete correlation was found to population density either in wild boar or in pigs. Antibodies against H1N1 were the most prevalent. In addition, antibodies were detected reacting against H1N2 and against H1pdmNx reassortant viruses, already known to circulate in domestic pigs in Bavaria and notably also against the avian influenza A virus H5N8; the latter in samples taken in 2017. These results confirm the exposure of wild boar to IAV of diverse origin and the increasing variability of S-IAV present in the field. The necessity for continuous IAV surveillance not only of domestic swine but also of wildlife is emphasized.

AB  - We studied the diet of Western Hog-nosed Snakes (Heterodon nasicus) that were captured opportunistically from 1988 to 2017 at a wetland complex in the Sandhills of western Nebraska. Only 30 of 92 snakes (33%) held food most as eggs), rodents (3 cases), and an unidentified vertebrate bone (1 case). The large, local population of Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta), producing up to 3 clutches of up to 22 eggs per clutch each year from mid-May to mid-July, no doubt explains the preponderance of turtle eggs in the snakes' diet. It may also explain why Western Hog-nosed Snakes seem to be most abundant near wetlands in this and other parts of their range.

AB  - Encounters between animals occur when animals are close in space and time. Encounters are important in many ecological processes including sociality, predation and disease transmission. Despite this, there is little theory regarding the spatial distribution of encounters and no formal framework to relate environmental characteristics to encounters. The probability of encounter could be estimated with resource selection functions (RSFs) by comparing locations where encounters occurred to available locations where they may have occurred, but this estimate is complicated by the hierarchical nature of habitat selection. We developed a method to relate resources to the relative probability of encounter based on a scale-integrated habitat selection framework. This framework integrates habitat selection at multiple scales to obtain an appropriate estimate of availability for encounters. Using this approach, we related encounter probabilities to landscape resources. The RSFs describe habitat associations at four scales, home ranges within the study area, areas of overlap within home ranges, locations within areas of overlap, and encounters compared to other locations, which can be combined into a single scale-integrated RSF. We apply this method to intraspecific encounter data from two species: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and elk (Cervus elaphus) and interspecific encounter data from a two-species system of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and coyote (Canis latrans). Our method produced scale-integrated RSFs that represented the relative probability of encounter. The predicted spatial distribution of encounters obtained based on this scale-integrated approach produced distributions that more accurately predicted novel encounters than a na & iuml;ve approach or any individual scale alone. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the conditional nature of habitat selection in estimating the habitat associations of animal encounters as opposed to 'na & iuml;ve' comparisons of encounter locations with general availability. This method has direct relevance for testing hypotheses about the relationship between habitat and social or predator-prey behaviour and generating spatial predictions of encounters. Such spatial predictions may be vital for understanding the distribution of encounters driving disease transmission, predation rates and other population and community-level processes.
   We use a novel application of resource selection functions to relate the locations of animal encounters to extrinsic resources and predict encounter distributions.image

AB  - In degraded coral reef ecosystems, allelopathic macroalgae have received increasing attention from marine ecologists because their secondary metabolites (also known as allelochemicals) kill corals that grow adjacent to them and weaken the recovery of degraded reefs. One well-known coral-killing macroalga is the calcareous red seaweed Galaxaura. However, our knowledge of how coral reef fishes interact with allelopathic algae like Galaxaura is very limited. Here, we documented novel observations of feeding interactions of 17 species of coral reef fishes (herbivorous and carnivorous) with the filamentous Galaxaura divaricata on degraded lagoon patch reefs in Dongsha Atoll (South China Sea). Video analyses showed that territorial farming damselfishes (i.e., Dischistodus perspicillatus, D. prosopotaenia, Hemiglyphidodon plagiometopon, Pomacentrus grammorhynchus, P. adelus, and Neoglyphidodon nigroris) and juvenile parrotfishes (Scarus schlegeli, S. ghobban, S. rivulatus, and Chlorurus spilurus) likely used G. divaricata as a feeding substratum. Further, microscopic analyses revealed that the filamentous surface of G. divaricata harbored a wealth of epiphytic microalgae, such as filamentous cyanobacteria (i.e., Leptolyngbya, Lyngbya, Rivularia, Oscillatoria, and Stigonema), diatoms (i.e., Synedra, Nitzschia, Mastogloia, and Pleurosigma), and filamentous red algae (i.e., Heterosiphonia), suggesting that these fishes targeted the nutrient-rich microscopic epiphytes rather than the nutrient-poor host. Juvenile benthic carnivores (i.e., Labridae, Parupeneus multifasciatus, and Meiacanthus grammistes) form feeding assemblages with roving parrotfishes to feed on small invertebrates (i.e., amphipods, copepods, isopods, gastropods, and polychaetes) associated with G. divaricata. Given that coral reef fishes appear to target the epiphytes associated with Galaxaura rather than the alga itself, these observations thus substantiate the threat posed by the overgrowth of G. divaricata to coral recovery in degraded reef systems due to the lack of natural grazers.

AB  - Diet and body mass are inextricably linked in vertebrates: while herbivores and carnivores have converged on much larger sizes, invertivores and omnivores are, on average, much smaller, leading to a roughly U-shaped relationship between body size and trophic guild. Although this U-shaped trophic-size structure is well documented in extant terrestrial mammals, whether this pattern manifests across diverse vertebrate clades and biomes is unknown. Moreover, emergence of the U-shape over geological time and future persistence are unknown. Here we compiled a comprehensive dataset of diet and body size spanning several vertebrate classes and show that the U-shaped pattern is taxonomically and biogeographically universal in modern vertebrate groups, except for marine mammals and seabirds. We further found that, for terrestrial mammals, this U-shape emerged by the Palaeocene and has thus persisted for at least 66 million years. Yet disruption of this fundamental trophic-size structure in mammals appears likely in the next century, based on projected extinctions. Actions to prevent declines in the largest animals will sustain the functioning of Earth's wild ecosystems and biomass energy distributions that have persisted through deep time.
   Analysis of diet and body size in terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates shows that a U-shaped relationship between body size and trophic guild prevails across extant vertebrates with the exception of marine mammals and seabirds. Analysis of fossil data shows that, for terrestrial mammals, this pattern has persisted for at least 66 million years, despite anthropogenic perturbance, which may have greater effects in the next centuries.

AB  - Exotic plants can affect native plants indirectly through various biotic interactions. However, combinations of the multiple indirect effects of exotic plants on native plants have been rarely evaluated. Herbivory can either positively or negatively influence plant-pollinator interactions. Here, we addressed whether the pollinator-mediated plant interaction between exotic and native plants is altered through the introduction of exotic herbivores by conducting a 2-year common garden experiment. We compared the effects of pollinator-mediated indirect effects of an exotic plant, Solidago altissima, on the co-flowering native plant Aster microcephalus in geographically different populations reflecting differences in insect herbivore communities. We found a positive effect of co-flowering S. altissima on pollinator visitation of A. microcephalus, which varied between gardens and years. The co-flowering S. altissima did not significantly affect the seed set of A. microcephalus in the first year but had a negative effect in the second year. The facilitative effect of S. altissima on A. microcephalus pollination was suggested to be negatively affected by an exotic aphid, while it was not significantly affected by an exotic lace bug. Our study suggests that the phenology and feeding guilds of the herbivores may be critical for predicting the effect of exotic plants on native plants through herbivore-pollinator interactions. Integrated effects between plant interactions via multiple species interactions under different abiotic and biotic environments are necessary to understand the impact of exotic plants under complex interactions in nature.

AB  - In this study, we present the mammal sample collected from Stratigraphic Unit 8 of the external excavation area of Grotta di Santa Maria di Agnano (Apulia, southern Italy). The material was collected during the 2011, 2015, and 2016 excavation seasons and it is described here for the first time. In this level, lithic tools consistent with the Gravettian techno-complex have been identified. Grotta di Santa Maria di Agnano is renowned for the Upper Palaeolithic burials, Ostuni 1 and Ostuni 2, found inside the cave and dated between 29,495-28,766 years cal BP and 27,809-27375 years cal BP. Thousands of lithic tools, shells, and vertebrate remains have also been found during more than twenty years of excavations. These data provide valuable information about the terrestrial ecosystems of Mediterranean Europe at the end of the Pleistocene and human-animal interactions in the course of the period of dramatic climatic changes that occurred over the last 40,000 years. Finally, we compare this assemblage with other faunal assemblages recovered in Gravettian contexts across the Italian Peninsula, offering an overview of marked regional differences in climatic and environmental conditions reflected in the diversity of mammalian palaeocommunities.

AB  - The site of Grandson-Corcelettes, Les Pins is located at Lake Neuchatel, Switzerland and was occupied during several phases of the Late Neolithic (between roughly 3000 and 2500 bc). Archaeobotanical analyses of the cultural layers revealed that, besides the cultivation of food plants, the inhabitants of Grandson used wild plant resources for many purposes. An estimation of the proportion of a selection of collected wild plants within the plant diet - based on calories - showed that they accounted for more than half of the calorific intake. This is in line with similar calculations performed for other Neolithic circum-Alpine settlements. The wild food plant spectrum indicates that most of them were gathered in the woodlands and semi-open habitats close to the village, whereas the riparian forest only seemed to play a marginal role. The analysis of macrofossils and pollen from dung pellets of goat and/or sheep showed that wild plants were also important as food for domestic animals, and that grazing took place in a variety of places, including forests, fallow fields and grassland-like habitats outside the village and throughout the year. Besides, there are indications that the nearby Jura mountains (reaching 1,600 m a.s.l. near the lakeshore villages) were exploited.

AB  - Background In the present study, the potential of different groups of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC's) for in vitro maturation (IVM) and embryonic development was assessed in two groups of COC's of water buffalo. Further, the expression pattern of cumulus-associated GJA1, PTX3, PRSS35, and SERPINE2 genes and their effects on embryonic development was analyzed. Slaughterhouse-derived buffalo COC's were graded into groups A and B. An equal number of 410 COC's were taken in both groups. IVM was carried out using Slaughterhouse-derived buffalo epididymis. A remarkable degree of cumulus expansion was noticed in group A (92.68%) as compared to group B (81.25%) oocytes. On in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo culture, group A produced a significantly higher rate of cleavage and blastocyst (92.682 +/- 0.7179% and 42.682 +/- 0.9683%) as compared to group B (85.365 +/- 0.7608% and 31.707 +/- 0.9688%). Also, the transcriptional analysis of cumulus-associated genes revealed significantly higher expression in group A as compared to group B. Results It was revealed that oocytes having good cumulus mass had a higher developmental potential. Based on differential gene expression of cumulus-associated genes, different quality of COC's, and the resultant embryos after IVF, it was concluded that these genes could be used as a marker for predicting the developmental competence of the oocytes. Conclusion We concluded that morphologically good quality of COC's had a higher developmental competence, and also the differential expressions of cumulus-associated genes in cumulus cells and embryos. So, we can conclude that these genes could be used as marker genes for predicting the developmental competence of buffalo's oocytes.

AB  - The horse-chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.), a popular ornamental tree widely cultivated throughout Europe since the 16th century, has a very limited natural range. The work presented was intended to shed light on the human-mediated spread of this species from natural Balkan populations to artificial sites. For this purpose, chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) regions were used. We sampled 670 individuals from 83 locations, including 17 natural populations and 66 artificial stands. We detected 11 haplotypes, with haplotype I dominating in the artificial range and the northern part of the species natural range, particularly in Albania and Northern Greece. This result supports historical records suggesting initial introductions from the northern part of the Pindos Mountains to Istanbul. The results also suggest potential later episodes of introduction, probably from eastern Greece. Seven haplotypes were detected only in the natural range, indicating the isolation of particular populations. Significant reduction in genetic diversity in artificial stands compared to natural ones may suggest a founder effect during its introduction. The presented work highlights the importance of preserving genetic diversity in natural horse-chestnut populations to enhance resilience against pests and diseases. It also contributes to a better understanding of the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms of tree species colonisation, which may have implications for improving conservation strategies in the face of climate change.

AB  - The deciduous tree-herbivorous caterpillar-insectivorous bird food chain is a well-studied system for investigating the impacts of climate change across trophic levels. To date, across Europe, most attention has focused on the impacts of increasing spring temperature on changes to phenology in Oak-dominated (Quercus spp.) woodlands. Paridae species and Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca are the most studied secondary consumers, all of which demonstrate an advancement in reproductive phenology with increases in spring temperature. Shifts in climate and phenology may also impact on reproductive investment in clutch size, and the effects of climate on phenology and clutch size may vary depending on woodland composition. To date, the effects of among-habitat variation in phenology and reproductive investment have received little attention. Insectivorous birds inhabiting woodlands that differ in tree composition may differ in the timing of breeding, due to local tree leafing phenology acting as a cue for egg-laying date and/or clutch size. Moreover, for most insectivorous birds, woodland composition within a territory is likely to be the main determinant of food availability for both adults and chicks. Consequently, if warming springs affect the temporal patterns of food availability differently across different woodland compositions, this may affect the optimal average local phenology for nesting birds. Here, using data from 34 long-term (mean 15 years) nest monitoring sites across the UK, we investigate the effect of woodland tree composition and temperature on Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus first egg date (FED) and clutch size. We supplemented the nest monitoring data by quantifying woodland composition, at a site level, through modified point counts. We predict that birds breeding in woodlands with greater proportions of late-leafing species, such as Oak and Ash Fraxinus excelsior, will breed later than those breeding in woodlands with greater proportions of early-leafing species, such as Birch Betula spp. and Beech Fagus sylvatica. We found no evidence for differences in Blue Tit FED or clutch size in relation to the proportion of any of the tree species investigated, after controlling for temperature and latitude (FED: -3.4 and 2.2, clutch size: -0.4 and - 0.2 eggs for one-unit increase in temperature and latitude, respectively). In recent decades and across all sites, clutch size has decreased as spring temperatures have increased, a strategy which could allow birds flexibly to adjust their breeding phenology such that nestling demand coincides with peak food availability. The lack of an effect of woodland composition on Blue Tit phenology suggests Blue Tits do not fine-tune their reproductive phenology to the local tree composition. Whether this lack of evidence for phenological divergence is due to an absence of divergent selection on breeding phenology and clutch size or to gene flow is not clear.

AB  - The Bazhou yak, a major native meat yak breed in Xinjiang, China, is renowned for its fast growth rate, strong adaptability, and particularly high intramuscular fat (IMF) content. However, limited knowledge regarding its phylogenetic history and genomic composition has hindered its long-term conservation and utilization. This study evaluated the genetic diversity, population phylogenetics, and genome-wide selective sweep analysis (GWSA) of 100 newly obtained Bazhou yaks through genome resequencing, as well as 340 public yak genomes from nine other populations on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results revealed moderate diversity, lower genomic inbreeding levels, and rapid linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay in Bazhou yaks. Principal component analysis (PCA) and phylogenetic analysis showed a clear separation of Bazhou yaks from other yak populations, indicating the Bazhou yak as an independent genetic population. Furthermore, less genetic differentiation was found between the Bazhou yak and the Huanhu yak, while ADMIXTURE analysis revealed a common ancestral lineage between Bazhou yaks and Huanhu yaks, indicating an important genetic contribution of the Qinghai yak population to Bazhou yaks. The GWSA identified a total of 833 selected genes in Bazhou yaks using the top 5% interaction windows of both parameters (FST, Pi ratio, and XP-EHH). A significant number of these genes are related to fat synthesis and deposition, such as MTOR, APOA1, and GPAT4. In summary, this study sheds light on the phylogenetic status and distinctive genomic features of Bazhou yaks, which facilitates our understanding of the genetic basis of the IMF phenotype in Bazhou yaks.

AB  - As white-tailed deer populations increase in developed and urban areas, lethal management is necessary to control population growth. However, concerns about safety and negative attitudes towards lethal control and using firearms near houses have prompted many communities to pursue nonlethal techniques. Therefore, in 2014 we initiated a 5-year project to attempt to stabilize the local deer population on Bald Head Island (BHI), North Carolina, using the immunocontraceptive GonaCon (TM). Since 2014 we captured and inoculated 77 female deer with GonaCon (TM) From 2017 to 2018 we evaluated the efficacy and cost of GonaCon (TM) at reducing pregnancy in adult female white-tailed deer on BHI. We obtained blood samples from 49 deer that had received either 1 or 2 doses of GonaCon (TM), and from 19 female deer that had received no GonaCon (TM) for pregnancy analysis using the pregnancy specific protein B assay. All untreated deer sampled were pregnant (n = 19), whereas 67% of deer sampled that received only a single dose were pregnant (n = 27), and 14% of deer that received 2 doses (n = 22) were pregnant. Thus, 2 doses of GonaCon (TM) were necessary to reduce pregnancy rates below 50%. The total direct cost of the 5-year immunocontraception project was $320,030.52 and averaged $2,078.12/capture with an overall efficacy of 33% for one dose and 86% for 2 doses of GonaCon (TM) Conversely, the estimated cost for the local government (i.e., Village of Bald Head Island) to cull 30 deer in 2018 was $16,163.63, or $538.79/deer. The estimated deer population was 113 in 2014 and increased to 198 individuals by 2018. Further population projections suggested the white-tailed deer population is projected to reach 342 individuals by 2022. Although 2 doses of GonaCon (TM) were effective at reducing pregnancy, administration across the BHI deer population was not successful in reducing the deer population, and culling will likely be necessary to reduce the population.

AB  - Microbial communities can rapidly respond to stress, meaning plants may encounter altered soil microbial communities in stressful environments. These altered microbial communities may then affect natural selection on plants. Because stress can cause lasting changes to microbial communities, microbes may also cause legacy effects on plant selection that persist even after the stress ceases. To explore how microbial responses to stress and persistent microbial legacy effects of stress affect natural selection, we grew Chamaecrista fasciculata plants in stressful (salt, herbicide, or herbivory) or nonstressful conditions with microbes that had experienced each of these environments in the previous generation. Microbial community responses to stress generally counteracted the effects of stress itself on plant selection, thereby weakening the strength of stress as a selective agent. Microbial legacy effects of stress altered plant selection in nonstressful environments, suggesting that stress-induced changes to microbes may continue to affect selection after stress is lifted. These results suggest that soil microbes may play a cryptic role in plant adaptation to stress, potentially reducing the strength of stress as a selective agent and altering the evolutionary trajectory of plant populations.

AB  - Public participation is commonly performed through public hearings which are largely shaped by modern ontology - the dominant Western paradigm - as reflected in Habermas' communicative norms privileging rationality, argumentation, language, formality, expertise, and institutional authority. Yet silence and performative storytelling serve as meaningful communicative practice for many Inuit. In Nunavut, participatory democracy is practiced through public hearings - a key way in which the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board engages communities in decision-making. Hearings were convened in 2020 on Government of Nunavut proposals to further restrict caribou harvesting, affecting four communities. Analyzing public participation as communicative practice, this paper explores the act of sharing country food - dried Arctic char, or piffi - by a community member at the caribou hearings, and unveils critical discourses of harvesting evoked by this act. As embodied and emplaced communicative practice, this act not only asserted sovereignty, but reshaped deliberative space through generative refusal of Habermas' communicative norms, opening a world enlivened by Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit. Yet, sharing piffi was largely invisibilized - neither detailed within the official transcript, nor elaborated upon in formal proceedings. Strengthening participatory democracy necessitates careful attention to whose voice is heard, and the creation of ontologically pluralist spaces of decision-making.

AB  - The bushmeat trade, or the trade in wild animals for meat, is a primary threat to wildlife and ecosystems in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Hunting for trade and consumption can hasten the local extirpation of vulnerable species, such as fruit bats and the protected babirusa and Sulawesi crested black macaque. This study provides a much-needed step in understanding the bushmeat trade by describing longitudinal trends in the amount of bushmeat (animal carcasses) observed for sale in markets in North Sulawesi, a particularly biodiversity-rich area. Surveys were conducted in 10 markets in 2011, 2015, 2018 and 2019. At each market, total counts of all taxa for sale were noted, and encounter rates per market sample were derived to account for variable sampling effort across years and markets. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to compare encounter rates across years, months and markets. Our results show that although animal carcasses are still sold in high numbers, there has been an overall decrease between 2011 and 2019, particularly between 2011 and 2018 (encounter rate fell by 99%). However, bats, rats and Sulawesi warty pigs were still present at high levels, indicating a persistent demand for bushmeat in North Sulawesi. The encounter rate of protected taxa for sale was low, but steady throughout the study period. We identified which markets sold the greatest amount of bushmeat to inform future conservation actions and management. Based on our results, the persistent demand for bushmeat in the region, and the continued presence of protected taxa in the markets, we recommend further research to establish the sustainability of the bushmeat trade at its current rate.

AB  - IntroductionSmall stock animal manures have the potential to be used in arid countries to produce vermi-leachate or vermi-teas that can be effectively utilised in the hydroponic production of both leafy and fruity vegetables.Materials & MethodsOur study evaluated the potential of sheep and goat manure vermicompost (SGMVC) as an amendment to cocopeat at varying levels, as well as sheep and goat manure vermi-leachate (SGMVL) diluted at 5%, 10%, and 20%, on crop phytotoxicity, seedling growth, and crop growth and yield.ResultsThe 100% inorganic Hygrotech fertiliser and SGML showed consistently high values for relative root elongation (RRE) and germination index (GI), with values above 90% for most treatments. However, the treatments with less SGMVC incorporation showed phytotoxic effects, with cocopeat alone having the lowest GI and RRE values. However, for direct seed germination, all treatments showed germination percentages above 80% for Swiss chard and above 70% for tomato, including the cocopeat alone treatment, indicating the complementary effects of the SGMVL irrigation source. For Swiss chard, the use of 10% and 20% leachate alone resulted in a 141.8% and 137.5% lower leaf area, respectively, compared to the treatments irrigated with Hygrotech fertiliser. Similarly, for tomatoes, the use of 10% and 20% leachate alone resulted in 129.2% and 143.4% lower leaf areas, respectively, compared to the Hygrotech irrigated treatments. For Swiss chard, the application of 0% VC resulted in an overall 43% reduction in leaf yield, whereas in tomato, it resulted in an overall 44% reduction in tomato fruit yield. The increased yield under 50% VC clearly indicated increased nutrient availability and enhanced water holding capacity of the media compared to when no SGMVC was added.ConclusionThis study showed that Swiss chard and tomato have different nutrient requirements, and the use of SGMVC should not be based on blanket recommendations from one crop. In addition, the use of reduced inorganic soluble fertilisers in combination with SGMVC has no economic benefits, as this reduced yield is almost proportional to the level of soluble fertiliser reduction.

AB  - Organisms can reduce their metabolism and/or decrease energy allocation to reproduction in order to survive starvation during extended periods of food limitation. This is especially important for coastal rocky reefs where widespread kelp deforestation has become increasingly common in recent decades. This deforestation often results in the formation of urchin barrens that have high densities of herbivorous sea urchins and little macroalgae for them to consume. While it is known that these barrens can persist for years to decades, and it has been suggested that urchins can reduce their metabolisms and/or consume microalgae during these periods, the mechanisms that allow for such prolonged survival in adverse conditions, and if these are mechanisms are reversible are not entirely understood. Here, we provide experimental evidence to show that urchin metabolism and gonad mass both decrease significantly when the urchins are deprived of macroalgae, and that these urchins regain normal metabolic activity and gonad masses when access to this food resource is restored. Our results have important implications for consumers in other ecosystems where access to energetic resources is spatially or temporally variable and can point to new avenues of research to explain how organisms adjust their energetic needs to survive extended periods of starvation.

AB  - Potentially hazardous element (PHE) contamination of aquifers is an issue of global concern, as this not only affects soil and plants but also exerts a negative impact on livestock. The current study assessed the extent of PHE (cadmium, copper, nickel, and lead) contamination of groundwater, soil, and forage crops in Shorkot, Punjab, Pakistan. Low concentrations of PHEs, particularly Cd and Cu, were found in drinking water which remained below detection limits. The concentrations of Ni and Pb in water samples were 0.1 and 0.06 mg L-1, respectively. Calculated risk indices showed that there was a high carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk to livestock (sheep and cow/buffalo) from the ingestion of Ni- and Pb-contaminated water. Soil irrigation with contaminated water resulted in PHE accumulation (Cd: 0.4 mg kg(-1), Cu: 16.8 mg kg(-1), Ni: 17.6 mg kg(-1), Pb: 7.7 mg kg(-1)) in soil and transfer to forage crops. The potential impact of PHE contamination of the groundwater on fodder plants was estimated for animal health by calculating the average daily dose (ADD), the hazard quotient (HQ), and the cancer risk (CR). While none of the PHEs in forage plants showed any carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic risk to livestock, a high exposure risk occurred from contaminated water (HQ: 12.9, CR: 0.02). This study provides baseline data for future research on the risks of PHE accumulation in livestock and their food products. Moreover, future research is warranted to fully understand the transfer of PHEs from livestock products to humans.

AB  - Remote sensing has been shown to be a promising technology for the detection and monitoring of plant stresses including insect feeding. Popillia japonica Newman, is an invasive insect species in the United States, and a pest of concern to soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., in the upper Midwest. To investigate the effects of P. japonica feeding injury (i.e., defoliation) on soybean canopy spectral reflectance and yield, field trials with plots of caged soybean plants were established during the summers of 2020 and 2021. In each year, field-collected P. japonica adults were released into some of the caged plots, creating a gradient of infestation levels and resulting injury. Estimates of injury caused by P. japonica, ground-based hyperspectral readings, total yield, and yield components were obtained from the caged plots. Injury was greatest in the upper canopy of soybean in plots infested with P. japonica. Overall mean canopy injury (i.e., across lower, middle, and upper canopy) ranged from 0.23 to 6.26%, which is representative of injury levels observed in soybean fields in the Midwest United States. Feeding injury from P. japonica tended to reduce measures of soybean canopy reflectance in near infra-red wavelengths (similar to 700 to 1000 nm). These results indicate that remote sensing has potential for detection of injury from P. japonica and could facilitate scouting for this pest. Effects of P. japonica injury on total yield were not observed, but a reduction in seed size was detected in one of the two years. The threat to soybean yield posed by P. japonica alone appears minimal, but this pest adds to the guild of other defoliating insects in soybean whose combined effects could threaten yield. The results of this research will guide refinement of management recommendations for this pest in soybean and hold relevance for other cropping systems.

AB  - Global warming affects the metabolism of ectothermic aquatic breathers forcing them to migrate and undergo high-latitudinal distribution shifts to circumvent the temperature-induced mismatch between increased metabolic demand and reduced water oxygen availability. Here the authors examined the effects of temperature on oxygen consumption rates in an Arctic stenotherm, the Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, and calculated the optimal temperature for maximum aerobic scope, AS(T-opt,T-AS), which was found to be 2.44 & DEG;C. They also investigated cardiac performance as limiting the oxygen transport chain at high temperatures by measuring maximum heart rate (f(Hmax)) over acute temperature increases and found various metrics related to f(Hmax) to be at least 3.2 & DEG;C higher than T-opt,T-AS. The authors' measured T-opt,T-AS closely reflected in situ temperature occurrences of Greenland halibut from long-term tagging studies, showing that AS of the species is adapted to its habitat temperature, and is thus a good proxy for the species' sensitivity to environmental warming. The authors did not find a close connection between f(Hmax) and T-opt,T-AS, suggesting that cardiac performance is not limiting for the oxygen transport chain at high temperatures in this particular Arctic stenotherm. The authors' estimate of the thermal envelope for AS of Greenland halibut was from -1.89 to 8.07 & DEG;C, which is exceptionally narrow compared to most other species of fish. As ocean temperatures increase most rapidly in the Arctic in response to climate change, and species in these areas have limited possibility for further poleward-range shifts, these results suggest potential severe effects of global warming on Arctic stenotherms, such as the Greenland halibut. The considerable economic importance of the species raises concerns for future fisheries and species conservation of Arctic stenotherms in the Northern Hemisphere.

AB  - Two plants can influence one another indirectly by affecting population dynamics of shared exploiters and/or shared mutualists, giving rise to apparent competition or apparent mutualism, respectively. Indirect interactions between plants also occur when the preferences of exploiters and mutualists adapt to changes in relative plant densities. Here we study simultaneous effects of adaptive herbivore and pollinator preferences on the dynamics of two competing plant populations. As a result of feedbacks between plant dynamics and adaptive animal preferences, plants coexist at alternative stable states. This outcome is favored at low abundances of herbivores and pollinators when consumers tend to specialize on a single plant. As herbivore and pollinator abundances increase, generalism becomes more common. This promotes plant coexistence by balancing antagonistic and mutualistic effects between plants. Plant community dynamics become also more predictable due to reduction in the number of alternative stable states. This shows that the global decline in insect populations can lead to structural changes in plant communities that are difficult to predict.

AB  - Consumptive effects (CEs) of predation have been well-studied in most aquatic systems, but nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) on prey have only recently received limited attention. As aquatic consumers, tadpoles have traditionally been considered strict herbivores, leaving their predatory impacts via CEs and NCEs largely unexplored. We quantified omnivory among wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles and characterized their CEs and NCEs on invertebrate communities. Tadpoles from natural ponds were dissected to quantify the frequency of omnivory generally, as well as specifically in relation to pond size and tadpole morphology. Additional tadpoles were employed in a mesocosm experiment that manipulated tadpole presence (absent, caged, or free-swimming) to quantify CEs and NCEs on freshwater zooplankton and macroinvertebrate communities. Over 70% of tadpoles in natural ponds engaged in omnivory, primarily on zooplankton, and tadpoles with wider heads and deeper tails were more likely to be omnivorous. Tadpoles in mesocosms exhibited CEs and NCEs on invertebrate communities, with stronger effects exerted on zooplankton than macroinvertebrates. The NCEs of tadpoles on invertebrates likely included production of predatory chemical cues that influenced invertebrate behavior, abundance, and community composition. Because tadpoles are often the dominant vertebrate predators in ephemeral aquatic ecosystems, this study stresses their ecological importance in structuring aquatic communities.

AB  - Landscape change alters species' distributions, and understanding these changes is a key ecological and conservation goal. Species-habitat relationships are often modelled in the absence of syntopic species, but niche theory and emerging empirical research suggests heterospecifics should entrain (and statistically explain) variability in distribution, perhaps synergistically by interacting with landscape features. We examined the effects of syntopic species in boreal mammals' relationship to landscape change, using three years of camera-trap data in the western Nearctic boreal forest. Using an information-theoretic framework, we weighed evidence for additive and interactive variables measuring heterospecifics' co-occurrence in species distribution models built on natural and anthropogenic landscape features. We competed multiple hypotheses about the roles of natural features, anthropogenic features, predators, competitors, and species-habitat interaction terms in explaining relative abundance of carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores/scavengers. For most species, models including heterospecifics explained occurrence frequency better than landscape features alone. Dominant predator (wolf) occurrence was best explained by prey, while prey species were explained by apparent competitors and subdominant predators. Evidence for interactions between landscape features and heterospecifics was strong for coyotes and wolves but variable for other species. Boreal mammals' spatial distribution is a function of heterospecific co-occurrence as well as landscape features, with synergistic effects observed for most species. Understanding species' responses to anthropogenic landscape change thus requires a multi-taxa approach that incorporates interspecific relationships, enabling better inference into underlying processes from observed patterns.

AB  - The negative anthropogenic impact on the Rangifer tarandus fennicus population in the Republic of Karelia (Russia) is primarily driven by direct human persecution and habitat loss resulting from forestry activities. Understanding the species' habitat selection preferences in transformed landscapes is essential for developing effective conservation strategies. This study examines the habitat use patterns of R. t. fennicus in an area subjected to prolonged intensive logging. We analysed movement data from three female R. t. fennicus equipped with GPS-collars. The collared individuals moved within the Loukhsky district and Kemsky district of the Republic of Karelia in 2015-2018. The analysis revealed that more than one-third of the recorded positions of R. t. fennicus during the entire observation period were located in intact forests, although these habitats comprise a relatively small proportion of the study area. A multifactorial analysis of variance demonstrated that the habitat use was primarily influenced by habitat type, followed by seasonal variation and individual space-use preferences of the collared females. The representation of various habitat types within seasonal home ranges (kernel density estimation) varied significantly throughout the year. This proportion was the highest in winter in forests unlogged for over 40 years (more than 41.1%). The proportion of intact forests increased during summer and the rut period, reaching 58.3% and 48.4%, respectively. Analysis of habitats within seasonal home ranges confirmed that habitat type played a decisive role in selection. Habitat selectivity analysis using Jacobs' index revealed a strong preference for intact forests during summer and the rutting period. Forests, unlogged for over 40 years, as well as clear-cuts aged 16-40 and 6-15 years, were used in proportion to their availability in winter but were avoided in summer. Seasonal differences in shoreline utilisation with Jacobs' index calculations indicate a preference for areas within 500 m from the water edge during summer. To ensure the conservation of R. t. fennicus, it is essential to preserve intact forests in key habitat areas and prevent their economic exploitation. This can be accomplished by designating these areas as Protected Areas or specially managed forest zones. Establishing a network of Protected Areas within core habitats and along seasonal migration corridors for R. t. fennicus will enhance population connectivity and contribute to its long-term viability across its range.

AB  - Southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina are top predators in the Southern Ocean and significant consumers of mesopelagic mid-trophic level prey while spending most of the year foraging out at sea. Yet, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding variability in the dietary composition between individuals and over time. We ran a suite of mixing models using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios from the vibrissae of 54 adult female southern elephant seals from the South Georgia population (2005-2009) and potential fish, squid, and krill prey. Our goals were to (1) estimate the dietary composition of this population as a whole, (2) compare the dietary composition of individuals between previously identified foraging strategies, and (3) quantify the degree of dietary consistency at the individual level throughout a long foraging migration. Models indicate that myctophid fish were the dominant prey item consumed (mean 45% of diet), followed by Antarctic krill and Antarctic jonasfish. However, there was considerable variability within and among groups of seals regarding specific prey items consumed and the degree of individual dietary specialization, possibly as a means of reducing intraspecific competition. Finally, our models provide evidence of most seals displaying dietary consistency throughout a foraging migration. These findings have important management implications for the South Georgia population in an uncertain future and highlight the need for more effective krill management along the western Antarctic Peninsula.

AB  - The Ogallala Aquifer region, located in the Great Plains of the central United States, is the largest freshwater aquifer in North America, supporting one of the most agriculturally productive regions in the world. In this paper, we discuss the history of settlement and water use in this region, from the Homestead Act and the Dust Bowl to modern irrigation systems. While many improvements to irrigation technology and water-efficient crops have helped to prolong the life of the Ogallala, continued use of this finite resource is leading to a tragedy of the commons, wherein difficult land management decisions will have to be made by this century's end. We posit that the art and science of rangeland management stands uniquely poised to tackle this challenge directly through creative integration, where appropriate, of native rangeland restoration, improved pasture management, integrated crop-livestock systems, and regenerative agricultural practices aimed at preserving soil and rangeland health, thereby providing continuity in the ability of the Ogallala region to continue to provide food, fiber, and other ecosystem services both locally and globally. Furthermore, we provide discussion on future research, extension, and educational needs to consider as the exploration for adaptive solutions are developed and evaluated in the coming decades.

AB  - Large herbivores are often considered keystone species, driving the structure composition and dynamics within ecosystems, particularly for rangelands, which are often defined in terms of their productive capacity for livestock and game products. Grazing and foraging ecological research have been instrumental in developing a theoretical and empirical understanding of the role these herbivores play in natural and agricultural systems. We used a variety of text analysis techniques (e.g., topic modelling, geoparsing, taxonomic entity extraction) to assess key questions in the academic literature on grazing and foraging ecology research. These relate to understanding of the spatial and temporal trends and the main topics encapsulated within this research. We identified clear and distinguishable topics of research activity that spanned across methodological and analytical fields and subject matter. The subject matter topics related to specific areas of research (e.g., seed germination and dispersal), systems and modeling (e.g., modeling grazing systems), and management (e.g., rangeland management). Our analyses showed how the prevalence of these topics in the literature changed over time. Rangelands were the most common biome for research, with deer (Cervus and Odocoileus) as the most mentioned genera. The United States produced the most research, but China's output has grown over time. The research demonstrates that grazing and foraging ecology of ungulates (livestock and wildlife) is increasing; is highly dynamic in topic, space, and time; and that rangelands are, and have been, important in the development of research in the fields. Trends suggest that rangelands and rangeland management will continue to be important areas of research with modeling and greenhouse gas emissions growing in prevalence, particularly as China increases its contribution to the corpus.

AB  - Demand for organic aquaculture is rising, but its viability will depend on the availability of economically viable raw materials to formulate organic diets. In the current work, organic diets were formulated based on different alternative protein sources distinguished by their ecological origin, insect meal (IN), seabass by-products (SB) and Iberian pig by-products (IB) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and their effects on growth, efficiency, productivity, and intestinal health. Fish with an initial weight of 67.2 g were fed two times a day until apparent satiation for 150 days. The control diet containing fish meal (FM) originated the highest final weight (298 g). Results obtained in the final body weight and the specific growth rate feed conversion ratio average daily gain indicate that the SB-FM, SB-IB, and SB-IN-IB diets presented a lower performance (272 g, 257 g, and 258 g final weight respectively) and FM-IN and IN-IB diets had the lowest final weight (215 g and 183 g respectively). An improvement in growth performance and nutrient utilization was observed in the SB-FM, SB-IB, and SB-IN-IB diets concerning the FM-IN and IN-IB diets. The lowest retention efficiencies of protein, fat, and essential amino acids were found in the IN-IB diet. The highest apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) of protein, energy, calcium, and phosphorus are found in Control and FM-IN diets. Results of enzymes showed that both trypsin and chymotrypsin are relatively low in IN-IB and SB-IN-IB. Fish-fed FM-IN and IN-IB diets showed histological changes in the liver and intestine. Considering the intestinal microbiota composition, the three dominant phyla were Firmicutes (59-89%), Spirochaetota (5-35%), and Proteobacteria (3-16%), but no differences between diets were obtained. No significant differences were observed on the Alpha diversity Shannon index. Therefore, although differences in growth were observed, the high substitution of fishmeal did not imply an alteration of the intestinal microbiota, possibly due to the high dominance of Firmicutes. Nevertheless, from an economic point of view, SB-IB diets gave the lowest economic conversion index and the highest economic profit index. In conclusion, the substitution of fishmeal affected the growth of the animal, registering the best results in the control followed by diets containing fishmeal of marine origin, but the lowest price of animal by-products originated the best economic results.

AB  - The wild boar population has increased rapidly during the last 2 decades in Southern and Central Sweden. This rise in population size has caused severe damages to agricultural fields through their foraging behavior. Given the hierarchical nature of habitat and resource selection, wildlife management needs to understand the selection on both levels to better understand the ecology of nuisance species and mitigate the damages they infer. Thus, there is an urgent need for more knowledge on the factors that influence habitat selection as a tool in the evidence-based management of wild boar to reduce the losses they cause in the agricultural sector. This study aims to evaluate a common management action (feeding stations) influencing wild boar selection of (1) habitats and (2) resources i.e., crop types, in South-Central Sweden during summer. Eleven wild boars were fitted with GPS/GSM-collars to record movement among different habitats and crops. Wild boar shows a high preference for clear-cuts, agricultural fields, and deciduous forests. The animals showed a high preference for crop fields with oat, spring wheat, and mixed crops. A binary logistic model revealed both a positive and negative significant influence of distance to feeding stations on the selection of different habitats and crop fields. In general, feeding stations influenced the selection of different habitats and crops negatively i.e., the closer a habitat or crop field is to a feeding station, the higher the likelihood of its selection. The study recommends adjustments to wild boar management and cropping systems to reduce damages on highly selected crop fields.

AB  - The growth of boars may be inhibited because of aggressive and/or sexual activity. Dietary Br, Mg and tryptophan (Trp) as well as immunocastration may reduce these behaviours. In Experiment 1, 200 boars and 40 barrows were allocated to six groups of four pens of 10 pigs per treatment. Control and immunocastrate (Improvac-vaccinated at 13 and 17 weeks, Imp) boars and barrows were fed a finisher ration while the others were fed diets supplemented with Mg (5 g Mg proteinate/kg), Br (140 mg NaBr/kg) and Trp (5 g Trp/kg). In experiment 2, 300 boars were stratified by weight and within three weight classes allocated to two pens of ten pigs per treatment. Control and Imp boars were fed a finisher ration while the other diets were supplemented with Br, Trp or both Br and Trp. In Experiment 1, average daily gain (ADG) was not affected by diet but the Imp boars had higher ADG than controls. Feed intake (FI) tended to be higher in all treatments compared to controls except for the Trp group. In Experiment 2, Imp boars had higher ADG and FI than other treatments while Br+Trp boars had higher ADG and FI than controls. These data suggest that immunocastration and dietary Trp and Br show promise for improving performance in group-housed boars.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of water restriction and low- and high-energy diets on sheep's thermoregulatory responses and ingestive behavior. Forty sheep, non-castrated, with an average body weight of 18.85 kg (SD = 2.80 kg) and an average age of 5 months were assigned to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, comprising 2 diets (high- and low-energy) and 2 water offers (ad libitum and 50% water restriction), with 10 replicates. Thermoregulatory responses were evaluated in two periods (morning and afternoon). There was an interaction effect of Diet x Water supply x Periods on respiratory rate (P < 0.05). High-energy diets resulted in increased heart rate, idleness, dry matter feeding and rumination efficiency, and water intake. Low-energy diets increased feeding time, rumination time, the number of ruminal cuds, chews per day, total chewing time, neutral detergent fiber intake and rumination efficiency, number of ruminations per day, average duration of rumination, and defecation frequency. Water supply affected heart rate and idleness (P < 0.05). Sheep had higher values of heart rate and rectal and surface temperatures during the afternoon (P < 0.05). Water restriction combined with a low-energy diet and high environmental temperature leads to a reduction in the respiratory rate of Santa In & ecirc;s crossbred sheep. Regardless of the dietary energy value, water restriction by 50% of the daily requirement of sheep reduces dry matter intake and increases idleness.

AB  - Little is known about the effects of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on tropical insect communities, even though they are suffering rapid declines in complexity and stability due to climate change. We explore the impact of fluctuations in local climate imposed by ENSO on the performance of herbivore defences mediating enemy interactions. In a widespread rainforest edge community, we quantified the mortality caused by five enemy guilds on the immature stages of the herbivorous beetle, Acromis sparsa. ENSO was a significant determinant of beetle mortality. During warmer, drier El Nino years, the survival of beetles decreased. This was due to increased egg parasitism by wasps, which reduced hatching. Additionally, ant predation on beetle larvae increased. Flies and wasps were in competition for larval prey in wetter, cooler La Nina years. Experimental removal of maternal guards or chemical shields revealed which ENSO-related parameters predicted larval mortality. Guarding was most effective against social wasps in La Nina, whereas shields proved most effective in El Nino. Two ENSO-related defence-enemy breakdowns occurred: (1) decoupling whereby the efficacy of a narrow defensive adaptation was reduced to increase mortality, and (2) mismatching whereby the resistance of a narrow defensive adaptation against non-targeted enemies was further reduced to increase mortality. These results highlight that defence efficacy against natural enemies can vary predictably with biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. ENSO events will increase breakdowns in defence-mediated interactions, shifts in competition among enemies, and species loss.

AB  - Restoration structures such as post-harvest woody debris piles on large clearcut openings may provide habitat for many mammal species. Mustelids such as the American marten (Martes americana) and several weasel (Mustela spp.) species are important furbearers in temperate and boreal forests and are negatively affected by clearcutting. We ask if constructed piles of woody debris on large (e.g., 30-50 ha) openings will be used by these mustelids and their small mammal prey species? We tested the hypotheses (H) that (H1) the presence (index of activity patterns) of small mustelids, (H2) abundance, species richness, and species diversity of the forest-floor small mammal community, and (H3) reproduction of the major species: southern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi), long-tailed vole (Microtus longicaudus), and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), would be greater on sites with woody debris piles than on sites with dispersed debris. A fourth hypothesis (H4) predicted that the above response variables would be similar across a linear configuration of debris piles on the large openings. Mustelid presence and populations of forest-floor small mammals were sampled on four replicated (n = 4) large (30-50 ha) clearcut sites from 2017 to 2022 in south-central British Columbia, Canada.Mean presence of mustelids was significantly higher (4.5 to 8.0 times) in piles than dispersed sites during the first four post-harvest years, thereby supporting H1. Mean index of mustelid activity per line was similar among pile index-lines across these clearcut openings. Mean abundance of C. gapperi was similar statistically between treatment sites but with numbers 3 to 10 times higher, on average, in the piles than dispersed sites and was likely biologically important. Mean abundance of M. longicaudus was significantly higher (1.2-4.4 times) in the piles than dispersed sites. Mean abundance of P. maniculatus and Sorex spp. were similar between treatment sites. Mean abundance of total small mammals, including the less common species, was significantly higher (1.4-1.9 times) in piles than dispersed sites. Similarly, mean species richness and diversity were both significantly higher in piles than dispersed sites. Mean number of total recruits was higher in piles than dispersed sites for M. longicaudus and P. maniculatus, but most measures of reproductive attributes were similar, thereby providing only partial support for H3. As per support for H4, response variables were similar across a linear array of debris piles on large openings. Our study is the first to measure responses of small mustelids and forest-floor small mammals to constructed piles of woody debris as a means of habitat restoration on relatively large (mean area 40.5 ha) openings created by conventional clearcutting. Piles of debris seem to act as oases for mustelids and their prey species in ecological restoration of cutover forest land.

AB  - Consideration of plant phylogenetic diversity in ecological restoration carries substantial potential, as communities with a greater diversity of lineages with older evolutionary histories can increase the diversity of niches and thus are likely to recover larger species networks than communities clustered in specific clades with reduced variation in functional traits. In this study, we experimentally assessed how arthropod communities were affected by the phylogenetic diversity of a set of tropical tree species. We established 12 experimental restoration plots with either high or low plant phylogenetic diversity while maintaining constant the number of plant species. After 1 and 3 years, arthropods with different feeding habits (herbivores, predators, pollinators, and detritivores) were collected and identified as morphospecies or operational taxonomic units using metabarcoding techniques. We provide insights on the influence of plant phylogenetic diversity on arthropod abundance and species diversity, particularly among predator, pollinator, and detritivore common and dominant species, which increased with plant phylogenetic diversity. The trend, however, was the opposite for the diversity of herbivore common and dominant species, which decreased as plant phylogenetic diversity increased. These findings highlight the importance of considering plant species richness when designing restoration strategies, but also their evolutionary histories, as the same number of plant species can produce different outcomes for higher trophic levels, as a function of their phylogenetic relationships.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.
   Considerar la diversidad filogenetica de las plantas en la restauracion ecologica tiene un potencial importante, ya que comunidades de especies pertenecientes a distintos linajes con historias evolutivas mas antiguas pueden incrementar la diversidad de nichos y tienen el potencial de recuperar redes de interaccion mas amplias que comunidades agrupadas dentro de clados con una menor variacion funcional. En este estudio evaluamos como las comunidades de artropodos son influenciadas por la diversidad filogenetica de especies de arboles tropicales. Realizamos un experimento en 12 parcelas de restauracion con alta o baja diversidad filogenetica de plantas. Despues de uno y tres anos de la siembra, colectamos artropodos con diferentes habitos alimentarios (herbivoros, depredadores, polinizadores y detritivoros), los cuales fueron identificados como morfoespecies y/o unidades taxonomicas operativas utilizando tecnicas de metagenomica. Reportamos una influencia positiva de la diversidad filogenetica de las plantas en la abundancia y diversidad de artropodos, particularmente de las especies comunes y dominantes de depredadores, polinizadores y detritivoros. En contraste, la diversidad de especies comunes y dominantes de herbivoros se redujo conforme la diversidad filogenetica de plantas aumento, lo que sugiere la colonizacion por especies raras en comunidades con alta diversidad filogenetica. Estos hallazgos resaltan la importancia de considerar no solo la riqueza de especies de plantas sino tambien sus historias evolutivas al disenar estrategias de restauracion ecologica, dado que un numero similar de especies de plantas puede dar lugar a distintos resultados en niveles troficos superiores, en funcion de las historias evolutivas de las plantas.
   We assessed the impact of plant phylogenetic diversity on arthropod communities in 12 experimental restoration plots with either high or low plant phylogenetic diversity. Arthropods with different feeding habits (herbivores, predators, pollinators, and detritivores) were collected after 1 and 3 years and were identified as morphospecies or operational taxonomic units using metabarcoding techniques. We provide insights on the influence of plant phylogenetic diversity on arthropod abundance and species diversity, particularly among predator, pollinator, and detritivore common and dominant species, which increased with plant phylogenetic diversity, whereas the opposite was found for herbivores. These findings highlight the importance of considering the evolutionary histories of plants used in restoration strategies, as the same number of plant species can produce different outcomes for higher trophic levels, as a function of their phylogenetic relationships.image

AB  - Aim Mesoplankton of the Southern Ocean is the key trophic link between phytoplankton and other consumers and an important part of the biological carbon pump, a critical component of climate regulation. Although general patterns of mesoplankton distribution and life cycles are known, we still cannot estimate mesoplankton standing stocks at specified ocean-basin scales. Location Southern Ocean, 34.4-56.9 degrees S, 0-14.4 degrees E. Time period December 2009. Major taxa studied All mesoplankton 0.2-20.0 mm. Methods We assessed biomass of dominant taxa and total wet mesoplankton biomass (B, mg/m(3)) using surface chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass and surface temperature (ST), a basic hydrological parameter. We sampled three strata within the layer 0-300 m at 43 stations with a Judey net (0.1 m(2), 180 mu m). Results We identified 163 taxa and calculated their biomass, biomass of major trophic groups, and total mesoplankton biomass. Monthly Chl and ST derived from satellite imaging were averaged at various temporal and spatial scales. B in the upper layer and in the integrated layer 0-300 m was significantly linked to antecedent Chl signals; the most significant regressions were found between B and monthly Chl and ST averaged two months prior to the survey and 10 degrees upstream of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Larger mesoplankton fractions showed longer response periods to Chl signal than smaller fractions. Main conclusions Our results suggest the integral mesoplankton stock is 2.47-3.69 Gt wet weight w(tot) (ww), or 0.12-0.18 Gt C, in the whole Southern Ocean. Mesoplankton was dominated by omnivores (69%-74%) followed by carnivores (25%) and herbivores (20%), which suggests the leading role of omnivory in the Southern Ocean pelagic during the austral summer. We anticipate that these results will help to provide a deeper insight into the Southern Ocean ecosystems and will benefit models predicting changes in the carbon-climate Earth system.

TI  - Are shrubs a necessary component of the habitat for Ammospermophilus nelsoni in the San Joaquin Desert?
T2  - WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST
LA  - English
AB  - San Joaquin antelope squirrel (Ammospermophilus nelsoni; SJAS) is a state-listed Threatened species in California that evolved in the shrublands of the San Joaquin Desert. Due to livestock overgrazing and fires, much of the desert has lost its shrub cover, which would be a conservation concern if shrubs are a necessary component of the habitat for squirrels. We established two 64-trap plots on the Lokern area of Kern County, California: one covered by saltbush scrub (Atriplex spp.) and another nearby without shrubs. We trapped quarterly starting in January 2019 and ending in November 2021 (12 trap sessions). When a squirrel was found in a trap, we permanently marked it with a passive inte-grated transponder (PIT) tag, recorded its trap location on the plot, and assessed its sex, weight (using a spring scale), age (young or adult), and reproductive condition. In the 3 years of trapping, we marked 90 SJAS on the shrub plot and 194 on the shrubless plot. On both plots, numbers of squirrels trended upward for the 3 years, with significantly higher numbers of SJAS on the shrubless plot in 2021. Survivorship did not differ significantly between plots, but we recorded more young squirrels on the shrubless plot. Although our plots were not replicated, our results and those of recent other studies show that shrubs are not a necessary component of the habitat for SJAS.

AB  - Moose (Alces alces; mooz [singular], moozoog [plural] in Anishinaabemowin, Ojibwe language) are an important species to many Indigenous rights-holders and stakeholders throughout their circumpolar range. Management of moose can often lead to conflict when various perspectives of Indigenous nations are not recognized or appreciated. During the 55th North American Moose Conference and Workshop held in Grand Portage, Minnesota, USA, we held a workshop with 145 participants centered around co-stewardship of moose among various Indigenous nations, federal, state, and provincial governments, academia, and non-governmental agencies. Using a facilitator, the participants identified opportunities and challenges surrounding issues related to moose management. Participants then further identified priority improvements and action steps for co-stewardship. Six core principles of Indigenous co-stewardship were developed: 1) recognition of Indigenous Sovereignty, which specifies that co-stewardship must begin with a recognition of the sovereignty of Indigenous nations and their inherent rights to manage, conserve, and preserve natural and cultural resources within their ancestral lands; 2) shared responsibility, where co-stewardship is a shared responsibility between Indigenous nations, federal governments, and state governments; 3) cultural and ecological respect, which stipulates that co-stewardship should honor the cultural significance of moose to Indigenous nations and recognize the ecological importance of moose within the broader ecosystem; 4) inclusive decision-making, which details that co-stewardship requires inclusive and equitable decision-making processes that involve meaningful consultation and consent from Indigenous nations; 5) resource sharing and capacity building, where co-stewardship involves the sharing of resources and knowledge between Indigenous and non-Indigenous partners; and 6) adaptive management and sustainability, specifying that co-stewardship should embrace adaptive management principles, where management strategies are continuously evaluated, adjusted, and improved based on new information and changing conditions. Some of the key takeaways from the workshop included that it will be essential to integrate Indigenous ways of knowing into an equitable and inclusive management system, there are existing models of co-stewardship that can be built upon, it is critical to build trust among all key stakeholders and rights-holders, and it will be important to establish formal and informal collaborative systems among all partners to support co-stewardship at all levels. We discuss a study and synthesis on Indigenous co-stewardship of moose and offer a synopsis and recommendations to advance restoration of moose in North America.

AB  - Mediterranean climate mountain areas are characterized by stressful abiotic conditions for plants. Drought, high photosynthetically active photon flux density and extreme temperatures are the main abiotic factors that drive shrub biodiversity in these areas. However, little is known of the extent to which herbivory may additionally influence the physiology of these shrub communities. We studied the incidence of abiotic and biotic stresses in a representative Mediterranean shrub, Cistus albidus L., growing under natural conditions, with an emphasis on the seasonal occurrence of abiotic stress and herbivory, and the possible influence of mountain aspect and plant ageing on the stress response. Reductions in maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) occurred during early summer and coincided with a combination of drought, high light and high temperatures (above 35 degrees C in July). East-facing plants experienced greater reductions in PSII quantum yield during July and leaf water content during September than west-facing ones. However, east-facing plants also showed less herbivory-related damage during winter than west-facing plants, particularly from goats. Plant age did not influence herbivory pressure or the stress response to abiotic factors. It is concluded that C. albidus is a highly tolerant shrub to both abiotic and biotic stress factors in Mediterranean mountain areas. It only shows slight photoinhibition during early summer and mild symptoms of herbivory attack in winter.

AB  - Fire has been suggested to be an initiation mechanism of landscape instability and coastal dune transgression, but modern evidence showing a shift to a transgressive dune phase is lacking. Following the largest wildfire in historical records on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, bimonthly uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys were conducted on three coastal dune sites to study their post-fire responses. The three sites studied here represent the landscape diversity of the temperate dunes of Kangaroo Island with both active coastal and inland relict stabilised dune fields studied. UAV surveys were used to reconstruct landscapes with structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry and compared over time to illustrate significant changes in the landscape. The geomorphic and vegetation changes are compared in net and intra-survey comparisons to illustrate the post-fire dunefield response and trends towards stabilisation. Because of a lack of reliable baseline pre-fire data, satellite geomedians are used to compute spectral indices to show the trajectory of ground cover in the study sites in the years preceding and following the fire. Satellite indices are used to separate 3D changes according to ground cover types and show their differing post-fire responses. Local and regional wind, temperature and rainfall records are presented to provide weather patterns of the years preceding and following the fire, illustrating the wet and mild post-fire weather. The overall results indicate no significant landscape instability across the studied sites and that the ground cover of vegetation is nearing pre-fire baselines, showing that a severe fire has not caused a transgressive dunefield to develop.

AB  - Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is a common disease in Suidae species that causes significant economic losses in the pig industry. This study investigates PRRS in Hungarian wild boar populations and the efforts for eradication of the virus from domestic pig herds. Given the economic significance of PRRS, understanding its prevalence in wild hosts like wild boar is crucial. We examine whether wild boars in Hungary carry the PRRS virus, the seroconversion rate, and the potential relationship between wild boar and domestic pig populations concerning PRRS infection. Our findings indicate a minimal PRRS infection in wild boars, emphasizing the low risk they pose to the PRRS-free status of domestic pig herds. This research contributes to our understanding of PRRS dynamics in wild populations and supports efforts to maintain disease-free domestic pig herds, ensuring the sustainability of pig farming in Hungary. Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) significantly impacts the pig farming industry globally, leading to economic losses due to reduced productivity. This study focuses on assessing the presence and impact of PRRS within Hungarian wild boar populations amidst efforts to eradicate the virus from domestic pig herds. We used a combination of serological and virological tests on samples collected from wild boars across Hungary to evaluate the prevalence of PRRS virus and its potential transmission risks to domestic pigs. Our findings reveal a low seropositivity rate in wild boars, suggesting a minimal role of wild boars in the transmission of PRRS to domestic pig populations. Moreover, no relationship was found between domestic pig and wild boar densities, emphasizing the limited interaction and consequent risk of disease spread between these populations. We confirm the effectiveness of Hungary's PRRS eradication measures among domestic herds and highlight the negligible risk posed by wild boars in re-introducing the PRRS virus.

AB  - Transcriptomics provides a versatile tool for ecological monitoring. Here, through genome-guided profiling of transcripts mapping to 33 042 gene models, expression differences can be discerned among multi-year and seasonal leaf samples collected from American beech trees at two latitudinally separated sites. Despite a bottleneck due to post-Columbian deforestation, the single nucleotide polymorphism-based population genetic background analysis has yielded sufficient variation to account for differences between populations and among individuals. Our expression analyses during spring-summer and summer-autumn transitions for two consecutive years involved 4197 differentially expressed protein coding genes. Using Populus orthologues we reconstructed a protein-protein interactome representing leaf physiological states of trees during the seasonal transitions. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed gene ontology terms that highlight molecular functions and biological processes possibly influenced by abiotic forcings such as recovery from drought and response to excess precipitation. Further, based on 324 co-regulated transcripts, we focused on a subset of GO terms that could be putatively attributed to late spring phenological shifts. Our conservative results indicate that extended transcriptome-based monitoring of forests can capture diverse ranges of responses including air quality, chronic disease, as well as herbivore outbreaks that require activation and/or downregulation of genes collectively tuning reaction norms maintaining the survival of long living trees such as the American beech.

AB  - Invasive alien deer (known in Australia as 'feral deer'; hereafter, 'alien deer') are some of Australia's worst emerging pest species. Recently, the Government of South Australia launched a four-year program to reduce the populations of alien fallow deer (Dama dama). The program will focus on coordinating land-scape-scale aerial culls and seeks to deliver the most efficient and humane approach to aerial culling. We sourced data from a recent program trialling a new approach to aerial culling that incorporated advanced thermal technology and a second shooter with a shotgun to target fallow deer. We reviewed available video and audio records of 104 deer culled in the program to assess efficiency and welfare outcomes. We collect-ed information on the number of shotgun and rifle rounds fired per animal, time between first shot with a shotgun and apparent death, and pursuit time. We completed field dissections of 20 individuals targeted in the program to assess the lethality of wounds inflicted with shotgun pellets. We also compared program costs and efficiency against published and unpublished data from ten other aerial-culling programs for alien deer in South Australia since 2009. A total of 383 shotgun rounds and 10 rifle rounds were used on 104 fallow deer in the focal program. We documented strong improvements to animal welfare for alien deer targeted with shotguns. The mean (+/- standard error) time between first shot and apparent death with a shotgun was 11.1 +/- 0.7 seconds; mean pursuit time between detection and apparent death was 49.5 +/- 3.4 seconds. Pursuit time increased with subsequent deer controlled within a group; the maximum pursuit time for any individual was 159.0 seconds. All autopsied animals had received lethal wounds from shotgun pellets, with 100% receiving lung-penetrating damage and 70% also receiving heart-penetrating damage. While a program that uses a shotgun and rifle combined with a second shooter and thermographer can cost more to mobilise, the outcomes measured in cost deer-1 made it the most cost-effective approach of any program we assessed. Control options that deliver improved animal welfare outcomes and increase efficiency are desirable for managing expanding populations of alien deer in South Australia and elsewhere.

AB  - Although livestock grazing can strongly affect pools and cycles of phosphorus (P) in grassland ecosystems, few studies have examined how grassland management regimes influence the components of the soil P pool. Here, we use a long-term experiment in the Inner Mongolia grassland to examine how grassland management and biotic and abiotic factors affect soil P fractions. The grassland management regimes we studied included a traditional grazing system (continuous grazing, TS), a mixed grazing system (grazing and mowing rotation, MS), and a haymaking system (continuous mowing, HS). Our results showed that traditional grazing accelerated the return of P to ecosystems lost by herbivores and decoupled labile P (i.e., Ca-2-P) from soil organic carbon in the topsoil (0-10 cm). Labile P was significantly reduced in the topsoil in HS (- 10%) and MS (- 24%). Mowing promoted the downward movement of soil P and the transformation of O-P to Ca-2-P in the topsoil by removing large amounts of biomass and litter. Both grazing and mowing increased Fe-P and Ca-10-P concentrations. The amount of labile P in the topsoil was mainly explained by plant properties, whereas the amounts of moderately labile P (Ca-8-P, Al-P and Fe-P) and stable P (O-P and Ca-10-P) were mainly explained by soil properties. Moreover, shifts in plant community composition resulted in substantial impacts on the soil stable P fractions. Our study demonstrates that long-term continuous grazing is detrimental to the accumulation of available nutrients in soils. Understanding how grazing and mowing affect conversion between P pools could improve adaptive grassland management in the face of global change.

AB  - Himalayan regions are among the richest biodiversity reservoirs in the world which contains many eco-regions and protected areas. The present research work was designed to investigate forest resource utilization by local population of Musk Deer National Park (MDNP), Western Himalayas, in the state of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. The data about resource utilizations by local communities were assessed through socio-economic survey in 12 villages. A total of 255 respondents were interviewed. Result revealed that most (44.12%) of the local people relied on forest resources for medicinal uses followed by vegetable collection (17.19%) and fodder extraction (16.10%). In the study area, a total of 109 plant species belonging to 52 families were widely used as medicine, human food (vegetables), fodder (animal food), timber wood and fuel wood by the people of MDNP. The highest number of plant species belonging to family Asteraceae, followed by families Polygonaceae, Poaceae, and Rosaceae. In the present study, 4 different indices were used on the basis of informant consensus for statistical analysis. Each index aimed to determine the cultural significance of a plant species. We emphasized on cultural importance index because it counts the number of uses of a plant species, highly correlated with frequency of citation, and its versatility. Our result showed a significant correlation between numbers of uses (NU), frequency of citation (FC) and semi structural interview that it is still a useful method for compilation study of passive knowledge. The present study revealed that the local knowledge provides new perceptions and opportunities for sustainable and multipurpose use of ecosystem services and offer current approaches for preserving cultural and ecological diversity. From the present study, it is suggested that the protected area should be at the core of national and international effort to conserve nature and their resource that provide benefits us.

AB  - Forage quality surveys can provide a variety of insights into the nutritional well-being of herbivores. Even small differences in how much of the food eaten can be digested and used for life requisites (dry matter digestibility %; DMD) can affect performance of ruminants, and thus methods for determining forage digestibility must be accurate, repeatable, and robust among laboratories and over time. In 2013, we observed levels of DMD as determined from sequential detergent fiber assays with the filter bag method and the ANKOM fiber analyzer(200/200 (R)) that were greater than expected given the plant species, season, and environmental setting. Using stockpiled and previously analyzed forage samples from Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, we evaluated whether fiber results had shifted since 2012, potential causes of the shifts, and whether results since 2012 aligned with data on ungulate performance. Beginning in 2012, our results indicated that sequential detergent fiber analysis began significantly overestimating DMD compared to the same samples analyzed using identical methodology prior to 2012. Magnitude of the difference increased as soluble fiber increased and overestimated DMD by up to 31 percentage points. We detected no changes in laboratory procedures (e.g., fiber bag design or origin of chemical solution) nor differences among laboratories using identical methodologies (e.g., Washington State University versus Dairy One) that might explain the shift, and thus were unable to pinpoint the cause. Results obtained prior to 2012 better explained ungulate performance (e.g., body fat, pregnancy, population trends) and thus we developed predictive equations (0.59 <= r(2) <= 0.88) to align post-2012 lab results with those obtained before 2012. Shifts in assay results and inconsistencies in laboratory methods have marked potential to affect inferences from studies of ruminant nutritional ecology. We provide recommendations for researchers using sequential detergent fiber analysis to measure DMD.

AB  - This study explores the use of underwater visual surveys (UVSs) to assess biodiversity along the Trabocchi Coast of the Adriatic Sea, one of the few remaining areas with natural reefs in Italy's middle Adriatic region GSA17. Fourteen years of observations underscore the effectiveness of UVSs in ecological monitoring and enhancing understanding of the Trabocchi reef's biodiversity, which has thus far been minimally studied. The marine environment supports a complete and balanced trophic structure, from producers and invertebrates to vertebrate species, including herbivorous fish, a variety of predators, and even bottlenose dolphins. The Trabocchi Coast also serves as a nursery for commercially valuable species (56.5%) and hosts several "climate" indicator fish species (33.3%). Species of regulatory concern, such as Lithophaga lithophaga and Cladocora caespitosa, both listed under CITES Appendix II, as well as invasive species like Rapana venosa and the harmful dinoflagellate Ostreopsis ovata, which poses public health risks, are also found here. This work aligns with the 2023 National Biodiversity Strategy, emphasizing UVSs' role in raising awareness and supporting the conservation of marine resources under increasing anthropogenic pressures. Sustainable coastal management and responsible tourism are particularly vital for preserving the fragile ecosystems along the Trabocchi Coast.

AB  - Background and aimsBoth waterfowl grazing and water table fluctuation can alter plant and edaphic conditions and may affect plant nutrient acquisition strategies interactively in wetland ecosystems. However, our understanding of their combined effect on nitrogen (N) acquisition and associated functional traits remains limited.MethodsWe conducted an in situ study by measuring the responses of a set of traits of roots (i.e. specific root length [SRL], root diameter [RD], specific root area [SRA], root tissue density [RTD]) and leaves (i.e. specific leaf area [SLA], leaf dry matter content [LDMC]) of Carex thunbergii from paired waterfowl grazed and ungrazed plots. Plots were arranged along a hydrological gradient in a subtropical riparian wetland, and we measured plant N uptake rates using 15N isotope tracer technology to assess impacts of these treatments.ResultsWaterfowl grazing increased plant N uptake rates by inducing acquisitive strategies (e.g. higher SLA, SRA, and SRL) at deep water table. However, under shallower water tables (wetter soils), C. thunbergii shifted to more conservative N-uptake strategy with low N-absorption capacity under grazing. At sites with deep water tables, grazing separated N acquisition traits into acquisitive and conservative strategies in grazed and ungrazed plots, respectively. The usual coordination of above- and belowground traits was decoupled at shallower water tables, likely due to the combined stress of grazing and waterlogging. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the plant's N uptake pattern was most strongly affected by soil properties (especially the soil NH4+/NO3- ratio) at sites with shallower water tables compared with sites with deep water table by RD.ConclusionsThe functional trait-mediated plant N acquisition strategy that we observed under waterfowl grazing might be mitigated by altered edaphic conditions in wetland systems.

AB  - We tracked the spawning habitat use of two native stream gobies (Rhinogobius fluviatilis and Rhinogobius nagoyae) before and during the invasion of a non-native goby (Rhinogobius sp. OR) and after its disappearance in the Tani River, Japan. Throughout the three phases, the majority of the two native gobies showed high preference and use for the habitat with medium-fast current velocity and coarse substrates as spawning sites. When the non-native Rhinogobius sp. OR invaded, the majority of them also preferred and used the same habitat as spawning sites, and the spawning habitat use of the three Rhinogobius species substantially overlapped. These results suggest that the invasion by the non-native goby did not significantly change the spawning habitat use of the two native gobies. However, the similar habitat requirement among the three Rhinogobius species may cause competition for the spawning habitat when the availability of their favorite habitat is greatly restricted. The non-native Rhinogobius sp. OR could utilize the spawning space on the undersurface of nest stones more efficiently than the two native gobies. Therefore, in the non-native Rhinogobius sp. OR, the size of nest stones is unlikely to be a limiting factor for reproductive success. Such ecological characteristics on nest stone use may enable Rhinogobius sp. OR to easily acquire nest stones with less competition in the spawning habitat where they coexist, which have also helped Rhinogobius sp. OR to extend its distribution area.

AB  - Trade-offs are crucial for species divergence and reproductive isolation. Trade-offs between investment in growth versus defense against herbivores are implicated in tropical forest diversity. Empirically exploring the role of growth-defense trade-offs in closely related species' reproductive isolation can clarify the eco-evolutionary dynamics through which growth-defense trade-offs contribute to diversity. Costus villosissimus and C. allenii are recently diverged, interfertile, and partially sympatric neotropical understory plant species primarily isolated by divergent habitat adaptation. This divergent adaptation involves differences in growth rate, which may constrain investment in defense. Here, we investigate growth-defense trade-offs and how they relate to the divergent habitat adaptation that isolates these species. We characterize leaf toughness and chemistry, evaluate the feeding preferences of primary beetle herbivores in controlled trials and field-based experiments, and investigate natural herbivory patterns. We find clear trade-offs between growth and defense: slower-growing C. allenii has tougher leaves and higher defensive chemical concentrations than faster-growing C. villosissimus. Costus villosissimus has rapid growth-based drought avoidance, enabling growth in drier habitats with few specialist herbivores. Therefore, growth-defense trade-offs mediate synergistic biotic and abiotic selection, causing the divergent habitat adaptation that prevents most interspecific mating between C. villosissimus and C. allenii. Our findings advance understanding of ecological speciation by highlighting the interplay of biotic and abiotic selection that dictates the outcome of trade-offs.

AB  - Simple Summary The stability and balance of the intestinal bacterial community is the foundation of animal health. It is unclear how the therapeutic dose of doxycycline affects pig intestinal bacterial ecology. In our study, the effect of high doxycycline concentration on the bacterial community was not reflected in the diversity of the microbial community structure but in the bacterial interaction. Moreover, the functional prediction also showed that bacterial interaction may be related to changes in metabolic pathways. This study provides a reference for the effect of therapeutic doxycycline on the pig intestinal bacterial community in pig breeding. Doxycycline is a therapeutic veterinary antibiotic commonly used in pig breeding. In this study, 27 fattening pigs of 33.5 +/- 0.72 kg were divided equally into 3 groups. Doxycycline at 0, 3, and 5 mg/kg body weight was added to the feed in groups CK, L and H. The medication and withdrawal periods were set at 5 and 28 days. The results showed that the doxycycline average concentrations in groups L and H during the medication period were 117.63 +/- 13.54 and 202.03 +/- 24.91 mg/kg dry matter, respectively. Doxycycline levels were lower than the detection limit after 20 days. Doxycycline did not affect the diversity of the intestinal microbial community structure. The relative abundances of Streptococcus were significantly higher in treatment groups than that in group CK, and Alishewanella, Vagococcus, Cloacibacterium, and Campylobacter abundances were significantly positively correlated with doxycycline concentration. Interestingly, the microbiota cooccurrence network suggested that high doxycycline concentration weakened the interactions among bacteria until day 33. Functional prediction showed that doxycycline significantly altered metabolic pathways related to the cell membrane. The results revealed that the use of doxycycline during pig breeding can affect bacterial abundance during the withdrawal period, and it may affect interactions among bacteria and change the intestinal metabolic pathways.

AB  - Global warming has facilitated the invasion of several Red Sea species in the Mediterranean Sea; a phenomenon known as Lessepsian migration. In this work, two key Mediterranean herbivore fish, the native salema ( Sarpa salpa) ) and the invasive marbled spinefoot ( Siganus rivulatus) ) were studied via the lens of bioenergetic modeling based on Dynamic Energy Budget theory. Models for the two species were developed and subsequently used to simulate their performance under gradients of temperature and food as well as explore effects of historical changes in temperature between a past, colder (1982-1997), and a recent, warmer (1998-2022), period for the north and south Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Over this time, our results indicate a progressive benefit in growth for the invasive siganid compared to salema, offering, thus, a competitive advantage for the former, which may contribute to the interpretation of its rapid expansion in the region. In addition, the presented models allow for exploration of other effects such as competition for food resources or differences in reproduction traits, which are discussed in light of existing knowledge. This work contributes towards a better understanding of the complex phenomenon of bioinvasions by offering a mechanistic approach to study the metabolism and performance of invasive and native species under the climate-driven, dynamic environment of the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Carnivore recovery is often promoted to restore ecosystem functioning. However, human-disturbed landscapes can alter the behavior and role of returning carnivores. To evaluate how different dimensions of a carnivore niche are affected across a gradient of human disturbance, we studied 83 pumas (Puma concolor) at seven populations in North and South America. We hypothesized that pumas inhabiting sites with high human disturbance would modify their niche by reducing space use, becoming more nocturnal and diversifying their diets. We quantified how landscape features affected puma home ranges, movement paths, diel activity, and step selection. Using stable isotopes, we quantified individual diet and dietary specialization, and population dietary niche width. Pumas decreased their movement rate with increasing human disturbance while some evidence indicates home ranges were reduced. Unexpectedly, diel activity was unaffected by human disturbance, but pumas decreased movement more during the day in areas with high disturbance. Similarly, pumas avoided highly disturbed areas during the day, but that avoidance was low at night. Finally, individual dietary specialization decreased because of pumas reduced consumption of native ungulates with increasing disturbance, although without changes in the population niche width. Responses to human disturbance were generally consistent across sites, with pumas adjusting their temporal, spatial, and foraging axes to decrease encounters with humans. Our results suggest that human-disturbed landscapes across regions alter the primary niche axes of pumas to construct a new realized niche in human landscapes, which may have important consequences for their ecological interactions and the functional role of this large carnivore.

AB  - Function-based studies have opened a new chapter in our understanding of coral reefs. Unfortunately, we are opening this chapter as the world's reefs rapidly transform. In this context, one of the most important roles of function-based studies is to inform coral reef conservation. At this critical juncture, we have a chance to reflect on where we have come from, and where we are going, in coral reef functional ecology, with specific consideration of what this means for our approaches to conserving reefs. As focal examples, we examine the role of corals on reefs, and the practice of culling crown-of-thorns starfish, from a functional perspective. We also consider how the papers in this special issue build on our current understanding. Ultimately, we highlight how robust scientific investigation, based on an understanding of ecosystem functions, will be key in helping us navigate reefs through the current coral reef crisis.

AB  - Plant-insect herbivore interactions are essential in shaping forest ecosystem health. The resource availability hypothesis (RAH) and the leaf economics spectrum (LES) theory predict that species in high-resource environments tend to adopt a 'fast' strategy but are more susceptible to herbivory. However, this contradicts the reports of increased insect herbivory in the context of global drought intensification and hinders accurate prediction about how different plant species respond to herbivorous insect feeding. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted an observational study in two temperate forests dominated by Quercus mongolica and Betula platyphylla in eastern China to compare their leaf herbivory patterns and explore possible mechanisms. We measured three leaf herbivory proxies (consumed leaf area, percent consumed and herbivory frequency), some leaf traits (leaf area [LA], specific leaf area [SLA], leaf water content [LWC], leaf nitrogen, phosphorus and non-structural carbohydrate contents) and soil properties (pH, soil water content [SWC], soil organic carbon content, soil nitrogen and phosphorus contents). We found that Q. mongolica, growing in poorer soil environments with lower water and nutrient contents, experienced higher leaf herbivory than B. platyphylla. Regarding leaf traits, Q. mongolica had a higher LA and non-structural carbohydrate content, but lower SLA, leaf nutrient and water contents, than B. platyphylla. At the leaf level, LA, rather than SLA, of both tree species was positively correlated with leaf herbivory. At the tree level, species-specific patterns emerged, that is, leaf herbivory of B. platyphylla was positively related to LA and negatively related to leaf nitrogen and water contents and soil phosphorus content, whereas that of Q. mongolica was only positively affected by soil phosphorus content. These findings challenge the predictions of RAH and LES theory, as Q. mongolica that grows in resource-poor soil environments with a conservative strategy suffers higher leaf herbivory than B. platyphylla, shedding some light on the proverb that trouble follows the needy. Moreover, water-related factors (i.e. LWC and SWC) and LA showed an important effect on driving interspecific and intraspecific leaf herbivory variations here, implying that climate-induced droughts may exacerbate herbivore pressure in temperate forests.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Northern ungulates contend with Setaria yehi and Rumenfilaria andersoni, filarioid nematodes that are transmitted by ectoparasitic blood-feeding arthropods, which can result in animal and population level impacts. Setaria yehi microfilariae can be detected in fresh blood samples using a modified Knott's test, or by postmortem detection by genetic sampling or through the retrieval of adult specimens in the peritoneal cavity. In this study we validated a novel qPCR for detection of S. yehi DNA in blood samples of moose (Alces alces). Additionally, we compared quantitative values from modified Knott's test to detect both S. yehi and R. andersoni from both fresh and frozen blood samples. Species-specific primers targeting a 121-base pair fragment of the cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (cox1) of S. yehi, and a species-specific probe were designed. The qPCR had a detection threshold of 0.157 pg/mu L of parasite DNA. We collected 166 blood samples from wild moose captured on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska from 2019 to 2022. Matching blood aliquots were tested by modified Knott's test and subjected to DNA extraction for subsequent qPCR. Quantitatively, blood samples had an average S. yehi microfilaremia (mf) of 472.2 mf/mL (0-14,490 mf/mL) and R. andersoni of 72.9 mf/mL (0.0-5071.5 mf/mL). Qualitatively, 32.53% (n = 54) of samples tested positive for S. yehi in each of the tests, and 37.35% (n = 62) when both tests were combined, with very good agreement between the results from Knott's test and qPCR (kappa = 0.90). The validation of the qPCR test for S. yehi allows for faster, less labor-intensive diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of this emerging parasite in moose and other cervid hosts.

AB  - Simple Summary Emotions play an important role in animal survival through better cohesion and coordination, and affect behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses in animals. Improving positive emotions and reducing negative emotions has been advocated for better compliance with animal welfare and to improve the productivity of animals. The preslaughter handling of animals is a very crucial stage of meat production as it affects animal welfare and meat quality. The slaughter environment could lead to emotional stress in animals. There is a need to study the effect of exposure to the slaughter environment in goats. Recent advances in emotions and cognitive science make it imperative to assess the emotional stress in goats at the time of slaughter. The present study was envisaged to study the electroencephalogram and physiological responses as affected by slaughter empathy in goats. A total of 12 goats were divided into two groups viz., E-group (goats exposed to slaughter environment, n = 6) and S-group (goat slaughtered in front of E-group, n = 6). The electroencephalogram and physiological responses in male Boer cross goats (E-group) were recorded in a slaughterhouse in two stages viz., control (C) without exposure to the slaughter of conspecifics and treatment (T) while visualizing the slaughter of conspecifics (S-slaughter group). The exposure of the goat to the slaughter of a conspecific resulted in a heightened emotional state. It caused significant alterations in neurobiological activity as recorded with the significant changes in the EEG spectrum (beta waves (p = 0.000491), theta waves (p = 0.017), and median frequency MF or F50 (p = 0.002)). Emotional stress was also observed to significantly increase blood glucose (p = 0.031) and a non-significant (p = 0.225) increase in heart rate in goats. Thus, slaughter empathy was observed to exert a significant effect on the electric activity of neurons in the cerebrocortical area of the brain and an increase in blood glucose content.

AB  - What drives the composition of invaded communities and the local abundance of introduced species are key questions in ecology. Community-assembly theory provides a useful framework for addressing these questions. Specifically, the environmental filtering model of community assembly predicts that a species' presence and abundance in a community depend on the interaction between its functional traits and the local environmental filters. However, for introduced species, larger-scale dispersal and introduction-related filters may restrict their regional trait pool. Here, we tested this framework using long-term data from 50+ years of old-field vegetation succession. We asked whether native and introduced plant assemblages followed the same trait-based assembly rules. We also asked whether local functional dissimilarities between the two can be explained by regional species pool differences, a possibility that has rarely been addressed. We found strong similarities in the assembly processes of native and introduced plants. Average height and seed mass of both groups increased over time, consistent with previous studies of old-field succession. Moreover, the two showed similar trait-abundance relationships. While there were also some differences, particularly in their trait-incidence relationships, these differences appeared to be minor. Furthermore, we identified species pool constraints on introduced species and found that the exotic species pool was biased towards early successional traits. Lastly, we found that highly invasive exotic species were also likely to deviate from the expected trait-abundance relationship, suggesting a link between the two. These results imply that introduced species generally follow the same assembly rules as native species. They also indicate that species pool differences can result in local functional composition differences, even when the two groups follow the same assembly rules. Moreover, there may be a link between species invasiveness and deviation from assembly rules, which, if further confirmed, provides a potential method of identifying strong invaders. Synthesis: Using data from a long-term succession study, we showed several similarities, and some differences, in the assembly of native and introduced species assemblages. Our results provide a better understanding of the factors constraining and allowing invasion, and help in the identification of 'rule breaking' invaders.
   Using data from a long-term successional study, the authors found that introduced plant species generally followed the same trait-based assembly rules as native species, but were limited by lower species pool variation. However, highly invasive species were likely to deviate from the trait-abundance relationship shown by the rest of the community, suggesting a link between invasiveness and 'breaking' assembly rules.image

AB  - Microbial nitrogen (N) limitation is a common problem in terrestrial ecosystems. Pig manure, a type of solid waste, is increasingly applied to improve soil N availability in agriculture through inputs of organic matter and inorganic N. Pig manure application also introduces a lot of exogenous microorganisms, which have distinctly different N requirements and metabolic properties, into the resident soil microbial community. However, the impacts of these manure-borne microorganisms on soil N cycling have not been well determined. Here, we investigated effects of manure-borne microorganisms on the N limitation of soil microorganisms using an ecoenzymatic stoichiometry analysis. We monitored microbial communities over a 90-day period in a laboratory-controlled experiment with four treatments: (1) non-sterilized soil mixed with non-sterilized manure (S-M), (2) non-sterilized soil mixed with sterilized manure (S-sM), (3) sterilized soil mixed with non-sterilized manure (sS-M), and (4) non-sterilized soil without manure addition (S, the control). The microbial N limitations were significantly mitigated in both S-M and sS-M. By contrast, the S-sM and S showed high levels of microbial N limitation, likely stemming from differences in the microbial functional composition. We found chitin-degrading bacteria were the dominant copiotrophic manure-borne bacteria associated with N mineralization, and they may improve soil N availability. We further identified several copiotrophic manure-borne bacteria in S-M and sS-M, and their abundances had significantly negative correlation with the level of N limitation and significantly positive correlation with the stoichiometric homeostasis. As these copiotrophic taxa can maintain homeostasis through regulating enzymatic activities, our results indicate that copiotrophic taxa in pig manure contribute to the mitigation of soil microbial N limitation. Our study also highlights the invasiveness capacity of manure-borne microorganisms in soil and evaluates the biotic effects of manure application on soil N cycling.

AB  - Background: Grasslands are the primary source of feed for grazing livestock, and as such, knowledge on how to best manage livestock and grasslands, through the use of spatiotemporal modelling, will assist in the long-term management of a valuable ecosystem resource.
   Methods: This study was conducted over 14 months between March and April 2017 in Orange, NSW, Australia. The study evaluated sheep behaviour in relation to the presence of pasture species, environment and paddock structures, using random forest modelling, to predict sheep location under continuous high (HSR, 13DSEha(-1)) and low (LSR, 7DSEha(-1)) stocking rates.
   Results: In the LSR, significant drivers included water, shade and fence lines (p<0.01). In the HSR, only fence lines and available biomass were found to be significant (p<0.01). The presence of green legumes in both stocking rates often increased residency by sheep. Animals spent more time together in the LSR, suggesting that social behaviour played a larger role than pasture quantity and quality in driving grazing behaviours.
   Conclusions: Understanding how pasture type can influence grazing behaviours and also how animal behaviour affects pasture performance and utilisation is important in developing long-term sustainable management strategies on a paddock scale.

AB  - Coexistence of competing species in the same foraging guild has long puzzled ecologists. In particular, how do small subordinate species persist with larger dominant competitors? This question becomes particularly important when conservation interventions, such as reintroduction or translocation, become necessary for the smaller species. Exclusion of dominant competitors might be necessary to establish populations of some endangered species. Ultimately, however, the goal should be to conserve whole communities. Determining how subordinate species escape competitive exclusion in intact communities could inform conservation decisions by clarifying the ecological conditions and processes required for coexistence at local or regional scales. We tested for spatial and temporal partitioning among six species of native, granivorous rodents using null models, and characterized the microhabitat of each species using resource-selection models. We found that the species' nightly activity patterns are aggregated temporally but segregated spatially. As expected, we found clear evidence that the larger-bodied kangaroo rats drive spatial partitioning, but we also found species-specific microhabitat associations, which suggests that habitat heterogeneity is part of what enables these species to coexist. Restoration of natural disturbance regimes that create habitat heterogeneity, and selection of translocation sites without specific competitors, are among the management recommendations to consider in this case. More generally, this study highlights the need for a community-level approach to conservation and the usefulness of basic ecological data for guiding management decisions.

AB  - Sichuan Province spawned abundant of indigenous buffalo varieties, which probably harbor valuable gene resources beneficial to the genetic improvement of buffalo. However, limited genetic information was publicly available. To better understand their selection signatures between different populations, we performed a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) to explore genome-wide SNPs among two indigenous breeds of Sichuan buffaloes. As a result, a total of 2,110,077 high-quality SNPs were finally obtained. Population genetic analysis indicated a obviously genetic differentiation between two breeds. The detection of selective genes showed that 995 and 910 protein-coding genes underwent positive selection in Yibin buffalo (GYBS) and Dechang buffalo (XCS). Further functional analysis revealed distinctly discrepant selection in two breeds. Candidate genes that positively selected from Yibin buffaloes have mainly occurred in functions closely related to meat quality, complex living environment adaption capability, and disease resistance. While they were significantly enriched in cell proliferation and cell components in Dechang buffalo, indicating the selection pressure primarily derived from the requirement of organism growth and development speed during breed formation. Our dataset constitutes a promising reservoir of genome-wide SNP markers of Sichuan buffaloes and provides potentially traits selected in different local populations. Such comprehensive genetic resources offer an unprecedented opportunity for genetic association analysis of economically important traits and precision breeding programs in buffaloes.

AB  - Understanding the genomic basis of adaptation is critical for understanding evolutionary processes and predicting how species will respond to environmental change. Spinner dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) present a unique system for studying adaptation. Within this large geographical region are four spinner dolphin ecotypes with weak neutral genetic divergence and no obvious barriers to gene flow, but strong spatial variation in morphology, behaviour and habitat. These ecotypes have large population sizes, which could reduce the effects of drift and facilitate selection. To identify genomic regions putatively under divergent selective pressures between ecotypes, we used genome scans with 8994 RADseq single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify population differentiation outliers and genotype-environment association outliers. Gene ontology enrichment analyses indicated that outlier SNPs from both types of analyses were associated with multiple genes involved in social behaviour and hippocampus development, including 15 genes associated with the human social disorder autism. Evidence for divergent selection on social behaviour is supported by previous evidence that these spinner dolphin ecotypes differ in mating systems and associated social behaviours. In particular, three of the ETP ecotypes probably have a polygynous mating system characterized by strong premating competition among males, whereas the fourth ecotype probably has a polygynandrous mating system characterized by strong postmating competition such as sperm competition. Our results provide evidence that selection for social behaviour may be an evolutionary force driving diversification of spinner dolphins in the ETP, potentially as a result of divergent sexual selection associated with different mating systems. Future studies should further investigate the potential adaptive role of the candidate genes identified here, and could probably find further signatures of selection using whole genome sequence data.

AB  - In recent decades, rapid industrial growth has accelerated the construction of new roads, which has led to the destruction and isolation of wildlife habitats. Newly constructed roads affect wildlife in many ways. In particular, fatal wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) have a direct impact on wildlife. A substantial number of WVCs occur every year on expressways, where vehicle speeds and vehicle traffic are significant. However, our understanding of the relative importance of the factors associated with areas in which large numbers of WVCs occur on the expressway remains poor. Therefore, herein, we analyze the spatial characteristics of WVCs. The effect of spatial distribution on the occurrence of WVCs was analyzed using the types of land cover in the areas where water deer appear (Cheongju, Boeun, and Sangju) and the areas in which WVCs occur along the Cheongju-Sangju Expressway (CSE). We identified the WVC hotspots by using CSE patrol data recorded between January 2008 and December 2019, and we analyzed the corresponding distribution patterns and land cover characteristics. Along the CSE, a total of 1082 WVCs occurred, out of which collisions involving water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyropus) accounted for 91%. Water deer appear frequently in Forested Areas and Agricultural Land, but the WVC distribution in the Hotspots followed a highly clustered pattern, with a higher proportion of WVCs occurring in Used Areas (areas including buildings such as residential facilities, commercial and industrial facilities, and transportation facilities). Used Areas have a smaller cut slope compared to Forested Areas, and Used Areas are open terrains. Therefore, the occurrence of WVCs will be high given that wildlife can easily access the expressway. Based on these results, we can infer that the landscapes near the expressway influence the occurrence of WVCs. To establish an effective policy for reducing WVCs on a road, the WVC characteristics and spatial distribution of the road should be considered together. Further research on the wildlife ecology and land-use status of WVC hotspots is required to mitigate WVCs on expressways and protect human and animal life. Therefore, if the characteristics of WVC hotspots are analyzed considering the characteristics of various ecosystems, an appropriate WVC reduction plan can be established.

AB  - Since most leaf defense traits are derived from photosynthates, the increase of feeding damage in woody plants can be partially attributed to the recent increase in ground-surface O3 (elevated O3; eO3), which has suppressed the photosynthetic capacity of the plants. In different soil fertility conditions (fertile brown forest soil or infertile volcanic ash soil), we made research on leaf defense traits of the three species; birch (an early successional species), beech (a late successional species), and oak (an intermediate species). The results showed that except for lignin, the defensive capacity of birch leaves was reduced by eO3 as well as by a fertile soil condition. In beech as an O3-sensitive species, C/N was slightly higher in fertile soil; especially total phenolics and lignin concentrations, but increased with eO3. Therefore, carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis was not applicable in beech, which may be due to a different nutrient translocation system from birch and other trees. Oak, an O3-tolerant species, was less affected by eO3 and soil condition; C/N slightly tended to increase with eO3 due to a decrease in N. In addition, total phenolics of oak leaves tended to decrease by eO3 in infertile soil. From these results, O3 tolerance, which differs among tree species, can lead to new and altered plant-insect relationships through impact on defense functions, which can also lead to new relationships in biodiversity.

AB  - Ractopamine is a drug used as an additive in animal production to improve growth, body composition, and production efficiency, although its use in fish is still poorly known. This study aimed to evaluate ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC) effects at increasing levels (0, 10, 20, and 40 mg kg(-1)) in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) diets during 40 days by considering growth performance, body composition, and muscle fiber morphometry. One hundred and twelve fish (mean initial weight 518.63 +/- 5.49 g) were housed in 16 circular tanks (450 L), following a completed randomized design with four treatments and four replicates. Body composition was significantly affected (P < 0.05), and the content of lipids in fish fillets dropped 26.7% (20 mg kg(-1) RAC) and 26.1% (40 mg kg(-1) RAC), as well as the amount of unsaturated fatty acids C14:0 and C18:0 in fish fillets (P < 0.05) by treatment with 10 mg kg(-1) of RAC. Results demonstrate that fish fed 20 mg kg(-1) RAC for 40 days changed Nile tilapia fillet chemical composition, decreasing lipid levels, altering the fatty acid profile, and increasing protein levels. RAC did not affect any productive performance parameters evaluated for muscle fiber morphometry.

AB  - Parental effects can influence offspring fitness, which may further impact interspecific competition. However, few studies have tested the role of clonal parental effects in regulating interspecific interactions and examined the underlying mechanisms. We conducted two consecutive experiments with two clonal plants (Pistia stratiotes and Eichhornia crassipes). In the first experiment, the mother ramet of P. stratiotes and E. crassipes were grown in two nutrient levels and treated with a DNA demethylation reagent (5-azacytidine) or not. In the second experiment, the offspring ramets from each of the four treatments in the first experiment were grown alone (no competition) or with a heterospecific neighbor (with interspecific competition). We found no parental nutrient effect on the competitive ability of E. crassipes, but a significant parental nutrient effect of both E. crassipes and P. stratiotes on the competitive ability of P. stratiotes. Furthermore, the parental nutrient effect of P. stratiotes on the competitive ability of P. stratiotes varied depending on the DNA methylation status of both P. stratiotes and E. crassipes. These clonal parental effects were related to resource provisioning and/or DNA methylation. We conclude that clonal parental nutrient effects can regulate interspecific competition between P. stratiotes and E. crassipes by altering the competitive ability of P. stratiotes. Both resource provisioning and epigenetic mechanisms can be involved in these clonal parental effects. By regulating interspecific competition, clonal parental effects may further influence species coexistence, community structure, and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Lime is commonly used in human burials, but its effects on bodies are not clear at all. Different short-time experimental studies concluded that lime does not inhibit the decomposition of bodies. To provide the long-term effects of lime on bodies, this work presents the results of six burials of pig carcasses completely or partially covered with lime during 5 to 5 years. These experiments were carried out in the experimental facilities of Taphos-m project. After that period of time, all pig carcasses were completely or partially skeletonised, and the Bradford score values were about 90% (active decomposition). Lime casts were observed, surrounding and covering some pig cadaveric remains. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed preservation of lime remains on bones in the cases when no lime casts were observed in the burial. Also, persistence of unexpected anatomical position (bone spatial distribution) by lime could be observed. The cortical surface of the bones was flaked and cracked, related to dryness in a permanent alkaline environment produced by lime inside burials.

AB  - A key driver of the African savannah elephant population decline is the loss of habitat and associated human-elephant conflict. Elephant physiological responses to these pressures, however, are largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we evaluated faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations as an indicator of adrenal activity and faecal thyroid metabolite (fT3) concentrations as an indicator of metabolic activity in relation to land use, livestock density, and human landscape modification, while controlling for the effects of seasonality and primary productivity (measured using the normalized difference vegetation index). Our best-fit model found that fGCM concentrations to be elevated during the dry season, in areas with higher human modification index values, and those with more agropastoral activities and livestock. There was also a negative relationship between primary productivity and fGCM concentrations. We found fT3 concentrations to be higher during the wet season, in agropastoral landscapes, in locations with higher human activity, and in areas with no livestock. This study highlights how elephants balance nutritional rewards and risks in foraging decisions when using human-dominated landscapes, results that can serve to better interpret elephant behaviour at the human-wildlife interface and contribute to more insightful conservation strategies.

AB  - Premise Plants rely on pools of internal nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs: soluble sugars plus starch) to support metabolism, growth, and regrowth of tissues damaged from disturbance such as foliage herbivory. However, impacts of foliage herbivory on the quantity and composition of NSC pools in long-lived woody plants are currently unclear. We implemented a controlled defoliation experiment on mature Tamarix spp.-a dominant riparian woody shrub/tree that has evolved with intense herbivory pressure-to test two interrelated hypotheses: (1) Repeated defoliation disproportionately impacts aboveground versus belowground NSC storage. (2) Defoliation disproportionately impacts starch versus soluble sugar storage. Methods Hypotheses were tested by transplanting six Tamarix seedlings into each of eight cylinder mesocosms (2 m diameter, 1 m in depth). After 2.5 years, plants in four of the eight mesocosms were mechanically defoliated repeatedly over a single growing season, and all plants were harvested in the following spring. Results Defoliation had no impact on either above- or belowground soluble sugar pools. However, starch in defoliated plants dropped to 55% and 26% in stems and roots, respectively, relative to control plants, resulting in an over 2-fold higher soluble sugar to starch ratio in defoliated plants. Conclusions The results suggest that defoliation occurring over a single growing season does not impact immediate plant functions such as osmoregulation, but depleted starch could limit future fitness, particularly where defoliation occurs over multiple years. These results improve our understanding of how woody plants cope with episodic defoliation caused by foliage herbivory and other disturbances.

AB  - Lead-based bullets used to shoot deer typically fragment. These toxic fragments are a threat to wildlife scavengers and human consumers of venison. Awareness of this issue is widespread internationally but limited in Australia. The aim of this research was to characterise deer carcass contamination via bullet fragmentation associated with lead-based and lead-free ammunition in a deer culling program conducted in Australia. We used radiography (X-rays) to study Hog Deer (Axis porcinus) shot in a professional ground-based shooting program in Victoria, south-eastern Australia. Our data captured 33 deer shot with frangible lead-based bullets in 2021, and 21 deer shot with monolithic lead-free (copper-based) bullets from the same rifles in 2021-2022. For lead-based bullets, the mean number of lead fragments per carcass ranged from seven to 629 (mean +/- SD = 256 +/- 169), mean fragment size was 1.2 mm(2) (74% of fragments were <1.0 mm(2)) and the mean fragment coverage area (the smallest ellipse covering all fragments) was 325 cm(2). Of these deer, 36% had metallic fragments in the 'back strap' (loin) muscles and 42% had metallic fragments in the shoulder muscles: meat cuts typically removed for human consumption. In contrast, for lead-free bullets, the mean number of metallic fragments per carcass ranged from zero to four (0.5 +/- 1.0), with only 29% of carcasses having any fragments, and no deer had metallic fragments in the loin or shoulder muscles. On the basis of these results, it is clear that lead-based bullets used for shooting deer in Australia pose risks to wildlife scavengers, and to human consumers when used in hunting. Australian wildlife managers involved in mitigating deer impacts should strongly consider a timely transition to lead-free bullets.

AB  - It is widely recognized that predators can influence prey through both direct consumption and by inducing costly antipredator behaviours, the latter of which can produce nonconsumptive effects that cascade through trophic systems. Yet, determining how particular prey manage risk in natural settings remains challenging as empirical studies disproportionately focus on single predator-prey dyads. Here, we contrast foraging strategies within the context of a primary and secondary prey to explore how antipredator behaviours emerge as a product of predation intensity as well as the setting in which an encounter takes place. We studied the effects of spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) on two species experiencing asymmetrical risk: dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes; primary prey) and deer mice (Peromyscus spp.; alternative prey). Woodrats are most abundant within young forests, but predominantly captured by owls foraging within mature forests; in contrast, deer mice occur in high densities across forest types and seral stages and are consumed at lower per-capita rates overall. We deployed experimental foraging patches within areas of high and low spotted owl activity, created artificial risky and safe refuge treatments, and monitored behaviour throughout the entirety of prey foraging bouts. Woodrats were more vigilant and foraged less within mature forests and at riskier patches, although the effect of refuge treatment was contingent upon forest type. In contrast, deer mice only demonstrated consistent behavioural responses to riskier refuge treatments; forest type had little effect on perceived risk or the relative importance of refuge treatment. Thus, habitat can interact with predator activity to structure antipredator responses differently for primary versus secondary prey. Our findings show that asymmetrical predation can modulate both the magnitude of perceived risk and the strategies used to manage it, thus highlighting an important and understudied contingency in risk effects research. Evaluating the direct and indirect effects of predation through the paradigm of primary and secondary prey may improve our understanding of how nonconsumptive effects can extend to population- and community-level responses.
   These findings demonstrate that among a diverse prey guild within a spatially heterogeneous environment, asymmetrical predation between a primary and secondary prey species can modulate both the magnitude of perceived risk and the strategies used to manage it, highlighting an important and understudied contingency in risk effects research.image

AB  - The present study elucidated sero-prevalence of Mycobacterium avium sub sp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in cattle and buffalo. Diarrhea is a major risk factor for MAP, so 1100 blood samples were collected from diarrheic animals or having history of some diarrheic episodes from four districts of Punjab i.e. Kasur (n=300), Rawalpindi (n=230), Lahore (n=230) and Bahawalpur (n=340). These samples were tested using ELISA and overall seroprevalence found was 39.64%. The major host-associated and non-associated risk factors of MAP were also considered. It was found that positive percentage of MAP was 2.20 times more in buffaloes than in cattle; 21.19 times more in females than in males; 1.04 times more in adult animals having age >6 years; and 1.20 times more in dry animals compared to milking animals. Furthermore, body condition score (BCS), type of housing, and condition of drinking water were also found to have significant (p<0.05) effect on the occurrence of MAP in cattle and buffalo. Moreover, hematological profile of MAP-positive animals showed significantly (p<0.05) lower values of RBCs, Hb, and PCV; whereas, levels of MCHC showed non-significant (p>0.05) rise in MAP-positive animals as compared to control animals. Thus, findings of the current study depict alarming situation of Johne's disease in Punjab, and help in understanding its associated risk factors and its effects on the health of cattle and buffalos.

AB  - Group living in animals offers advantages like access to resources, yet also fosters competition, often leading to dominance hierarchies. These hierarchies influence resource distribution and aggression levels. This study investigates individual behavioural traits, including aggression, and their correlation with social rank. Through standardized individual reactivity tests and observational data, we discerned links between dominance rank, group living, and individual behaviour in male Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Dominance rank (strongly correlated with age) influenced behaviour, with lower-ranking, younger individuals standing up earlier when approached. More dominant individuals displayed greater boldness, resuming foraging sooner after a human approach. Furthermore, aggression levels correlated with social rank between ages 1 to 6 and then gradually declined with age, with higher-ranking males exhibiting fewer agonistic interactions than middle-aged males. Notably, the study indicates that experimental approaches, in addition to traditional ratings, are viable for understanding personality-dominance associations. While some tests of individual behaviour, such as novel object trials and reactivity assessments, did not yield significant relationships, the research underscores the importance of tailoring tests to the species' ecological context. The findings contribute valuable insights into the intricate interplay between individuality, dominance hierarchies, and social dynamics. Understanding these relationships enhances comprehension of species' behaviour and fitness implications.
   This study delves into the intriguing topic of individual reactive behaviour and its link to dominance hierarchies in wild male Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Group living, while advantageous for various reasons, inevitably leads to competition and aggression among members, fostering the emergence of dominance hierarchies. Our research showed that individual traits such as age or aggressiveness significantly correlate with an individual's social rank within the bighorn sheep hierarchy. Notably, more aggressive individuals occupied higher social positions and were quicker to resume foraging when approached by humans. Moreover, the frequency of agonistic interactions was higher among higher-ranking individuals, highlighting a link between aggression and social rank.However, reactivity tests using novel objects failed to unveil such relationships, emphasizing the importance of designing ecologically relevant experiments to test the consistency and repeatability of individual behaviour. Lastly, we found that while some individuals' reactions to a human approach changed with the number of approaches over time, they did not in others, revealing differences in reactivity or habituation. This study contributes valuable insights into the dynamics of social hierarchies in male bighorn sheep, with potential implications for their fitness and conservation.

FX  - This study is part of a long-term research project on individually marked bighorn sheep. The long-term study was initiated by Marco Festa-Bianchet and John T. Hogg in the early to late 1980ies. KER took over the study in 2004. We would like to thank the University of Calgary for the use of the R. B. Miller Research Station and acknowledge that Sheep River Provincial Park is part of the unceded traditional territories of the Blackfoot Confederacy, the Tsuut'ina, and the Stoney Nakota First Nations. We would also like to thank all the bighorn sheep who allowed us to work with them and observe them from birth to death. The government of Alberta culled all adult bighorn sheep rams of the Sheep River study population due to a pneumonia outbreak in the ram group in March 2023, including all rams mentioned in this manuscript. Thus, none of our study subjects are alive today. This article is dedicated to these rams, the many hours they allowed us to follow and observe them, and all the knowledge they shared with us. Thanks also go to Huub van Osch and lab members from the Ruckstuhl lab for their input and support, as well as the anonymous reviewers and the associate editor who provided constructive feedback on this manuscript.

AB  - Insect pollinators frequently forage with conspecifics in nature, thus it is important to understand their behavioral responses to the presence of conspecifics on flowers. Plant-pollinator interactions can be influenced by neighboring flowers, and these neighborhood effects can have important implications for plant fitness. Research about neighborhood effects generally tests how plant traits or different plant communities affect plant-pollinator or plant-herbivore interactions. However, neighborhood effects can also be considered from the point of view of an insect pollinator and how the presence of their own conspecifics on plants alters their perceptions of plant quality. We used the Western honey bee, Apis mellifera, to test whether neighborhood effects affect honey bee foraging behavior. In this context, we refer to neighborhood effects as the relative number of bees on neighboring flowers compared to the number of bees on a focal flower. We found that in a floral neighborhood, the relative number of honey bees present on neighboring flowers has a weak effect, such that more bees on neighboring flowers increase the likelihood of visits to a focal flower. Our results suggest that high numbers of bees on neighboring flowers increase the attractiveness of the entire neighborhood and low numbers of bees on the neighboring flowers decrease the attractiveness of the neighborhood, highlighting that bee activity on neighboring flowers may have significant impacts on pollination services.

AB  - Zhaotong pig (ZTP) is a Chinese indigenous pig breed in Yunnan Province, known for its unique body shape and appearance, good meat quality, strong foraging ability, and adaptability. However, there is still a lack of research on its genome. In order to investigate the genetic diversity, population structure, and selection signatures of the breed, we conducted a comprehensive analysis by resequencing on 30 ZTPs and comparing them with genomic data from 10 Asian wild boars (AWBs). A total of 45,514,452 autosomal SNPs were detected in the 40 pigs, and 23,649,650 SNPs were retained for further analysis after filtering. The HE, HO, PN, MAF, pi, and Fis values were calculated to evaluate the genetic diversity, and the results showed that ZTPs had higher genetic diversity and lower inbreeding coefficient compared with AWBs. Population structure was analyzed using NJ tree, PCA, ADMIXTURE, and LD methods. It was found that ZTPs were population independent of AWBs and had a lower LD decay compared to AWBs. Moreover, the results of the IBS genetic distance and G matrix showed that most of the individuals had large genetic distances and distant genetic relationships in ZTPs. Selection signatures were detected between ZTPs and AWBs by using two methods, FST and pi ratio. Totals of 1104 selected regions and 275 candidate genes were identified. Finally, functional enrichment analysis identified some annotated genes that might affect fat deposition (NPY1R, NPY5R, and NMU), reproduction (COL3A1, COL5A2, GLRB, TAC3, and MAP3K12), growth (STAT6 and SQOR), tooth development (AMBN, ENAM, and ODAM), and immune response (MBL2, IL1A, and DNAJA3). Our results will provide a valuable basis for the future effective protection, breeding, and utilization of ZTPs.

AB  - Plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) play a keystone role in the alpine meadow ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). For decades, QTP grasslands have become degraded to some degree, largely as a result of heavy livestock grazing. Concomitantly, the abundance of plateau pikas has increased dramatically as grassland degradation has altered the vegetation community structure and dominant species, shifting the plant nutrient contents toward higher protein conditions that favor them. Considerable research supports the hypothesis that the quantity and quality of food limit herbivore populations. Here, we examined the relationship between the availability of essential amino acids in the diets of plateau pikas and the degree of meadow degradation associated with livestock grazing intensity through a field survey, as well as the fitness of individuals by laboratory feeding experiments with 2 pelleted chows containing 0.26% and 0.45% methionine. Sulfur-containing methionine and cystine were the most limiting amino acids in the diets of pikas. During the pika breeding season, the concentrations of most essential acids, particularly methionine and cystine, were higher in heavily degraded meadows than in lightly and moderately degraded meadows. Individuals fed 0.45% methionine exhibited enhanced cell-mediated immunity, reduced intensity of coccidian infection, and increased concentrations of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone compared to those fed 0.26% methionine. These results showed that heavily degraded meadows provided relatively high-quality food that improved individual fitness, suggesting that the high-methionine food in the heavily degraded meadows may be a key factor in the generation and maintenance of high-density populations of plateau pikas.

AB  - Despite the reported allelopathic nature of the Eucalyptus genus, eucalypt leachates have unknown effects on the trophic base of stream green food webs. Eucalypt plantations have increased worldwide, including riparian ecosystems. We aimed to test whether short-term eucalypt leachates might alter water chemistry, periphytic algal biomass and diatoms, and herbivorous invertebrates' (i.e., scrapers). We studied two oligotrophic and well-preserved headwaters from NW Spain. The experiment followed a before-after control-impact paired (BACIp) design, with weekly sampling before and after eucalypt leaves addition to streams. In the stream with lower discharge, the eucalypt treatments seemed to affect increases in biomass accrual (Chl-a) and diatom assemblages, disfavouring sensitive species (e.g., Eunotia minor and Achnanthidium pyrenaicum). Therefore, the ecological status was reduced from high to good. In the stream with higher discharge, invertebrate assemblages changed with scrapers having their abundances modified in comparison with the control (e.g., Habrophlebia sp. and Elmidae). Results suggest that eucalypt leaves leachates exert toxic effects on periphyton and on diatom and invertebrate assemblages, and this effect might be mediated by discharge. Alterations at the base of stream food webs may compromise their good ecological status. Further studies are necessary to identify whether this toxicity is due to allelopathic processes.

AB  - Two native European large herbivores: the aurochs Bos primigenius Bojanus, 1827 and the wisent Bison bonasus Linnaeus, 1758 lived simultaneously until the end of the Medieval period. Between the 15th and beginning of the 17th century, however, the aurochs population declined rapidly, while wisents continued to live in the wild until the end of World War I. In western Europe, both aurochs and wisents went extinct much earlier than in the east, so by the 16th century the two species were commonly confused, as illustrated by a drawing from 1571, showing the dif- ferences in appearance, and providing proper nomenclature for both species. The extinction of aurochs took place despite their strict protection and even supplementary feeding imposed by Polish kings. Since in central and eastern Europe there is a number of traditional geographical names associated with both species, we made an attempt to determine their distribution in four areas of eastern Europe (Poland, Lithuania, Romania + Moldova, and Ukraine), and by compar- ing historical changes in land cover, identify possible reasons for such a substantial difference in their survival. Numbers of geographical names were much higher for the aurochs than for the wisent: >5-fold in Poland and >4-fold in Ukraine, indicating much greater recognition of the aurochs by the human population. The suggestion is either that aurochs were more abundant, or were more frequently present in open areas. Between 1000 and 1400 (when in Poland and Lithuania hunts for the aurochs by the kings of the Jagiellonian dynasty were organised only occasionally), there was a drastic decline in forest cover, estimated at almost 50% in Poland, nearly 40% in Lithuania, and almost 30% in Ukraine. This deforestation was associated with the development of agriculture and settlements, which resulted in much greater areas of open land with attractive forage for herbivores. Therefore, the most probable factor for differences in the survival of the two species, we suggest, was preference by aurochs for open landscapes, making them more conspicuous, leading to more frequent encounters with people and conflicts with cattle breeders and farmers. This case indicates the critical importance of socio-economic cir- cumstances for the survival of endangered species, despite strict protection.

AB  - Pastoral practices remain a widespread economic activity across European mountain regions. However, the viability of this activity may be threatened by the recovery of large wild vertebrates associated with passive rewilding, leading to the so-called human-wildlife conflicts. Reconciling the return of large wild vertebrates and pastoral practices is therefore a major challenge for the European Union (EU), as it poses political, socio-economic and conservation challenges. We analyse the social dimension of the recovery of large carnivores, ungulates and strict avian scavengers, through a multi-stakeholder approach in two rural territories in central Spain exposed to different degrees of land abandonment. Based on in-depth interviews, we identify potential conflicts and disagreements between the different stakeholders, search for strategies to promote the coexistence of large wild vertebrates and extensive grazing systems and seek emergent discourses for reconciling and boosting agrarian production and biodiversity conservation. Our findings show a consensus among stakeholders on the general increase and recovery of large wild vertebrate populations. We then collected divergent positions on what this recovery means for social groups, showing opposing views between urban and rural people; while conservationists considered this increase positively, land users generally-but not always-perceived this recovery as a threat to their livelihoods. We identified disagreements within social groups and divergent positions displayed between cattle farmers and sheep and goat farmers. The latter showed forms of management closer to agroecological visions, thus allowing coexistence. The coexistence of pastoral practices and wild vertebrates involves navigating a complex interplay of ecological, social and economic factors. The negative impacts of wildlife on livestock can be minimized, but only through the collective implementation of measures by all parties. Furthermore, the recognition and valuation of pastoral practices and the empowerment of land users may facilitate coexistence. Mutual recognition and participation of local stakeholders seems an unavoidable step in developing more collaborative approaches that respect the needs and aspirations of rural communities while contributing to the EU's restoration and conservation goals.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.
   Las pr & aacute;cticas de pastoreo contin & uacute;an siendo una actividad econ & oacute;mica clave en las regiones monta & ntilde;osas de Europa. Sin embargo, la recuperaci & oacute;n de grandes vertebrados silvestres, vinculada a la llamada "renaturalizaci & oacute;n pasiva" (del ingl & eacute;s passive rewilding), plantea nuevos desaf & iacute;os que pueden amenazar la viabilidad de esta actividad. Estos desaf & iacute;os, conocidos como conflictos entre humanos y fauna silvestre, suponen un reto significativo para la Uni & oacute;n Europea (UE), al generar tensiones pol & iacute;ticas, socioecon & oacute;micas y de conservaci & oacute;n. En este estudio, exploramos la dimensi & oacute;n social de la recuperaci & oacute;n de grandes carn & iacute;voros, ungulados y aves carro & ntilde;eras mediante un enfoque multiactor en dos territorios rurales del centro de Espa & ntilde;a con distintos grados de abandono de las pr & aacute;cticas pastorales. A trav & eacute;s de entrevistas en profundidad, identificamos conflictos y desacuerdos potenciales entre los actores implicados, evaluamos estrategias para fomentar la coexistencia entre grandes vertebrados silvestres y sistemas ganaderos extensivos, y analizamos discursos emergentes que buscan equilibrar la producci & oacute;n agraria sostenible con la conservaci & oacute;n de la biodiversidad. Nuestros resultados reflejan un amplio consenso entre los actores sobre el aumento y recuperaci & oacute;n de las poblaciones de grandes vertebrados silvestres. Sin embargo, se observaron posturas divergentes respecto a lo que esta recuperaci & oacute;n significa para los distintos grupos sociales. Mientras los conservacionistas valoran positivamente este fen & oacute;meno, los usuarios de la tierra-aunque no de manera uniforme-lo perciben mayoritariamente como una amenaza para sus medios de vida. Adem & aacute;s, identificamos desacuerdos y posiciones divergentes dentro de los grupos de actores, especialmente entre los ganaderos de vacuno y los de peque & ntilde;os rumiantes (ovino y caprino). Estos & uacute;ltimos adoptan pr & aacute;cticas de manejo m & aacute;s alineadas con visiones agroecol & oacute;gicas, favoreciendo as & iacute; una mayor coexistencia con la fauna silvestre. La coexistencia entre la ganader & iacute;a extensiva y las poblaciones de grandes vertebrados requiere abordar una compleja interacci & oacute;n de factores ecol & oacute;gicos, sociales y econ & oacute;micos. Los impactos negativos de la fauna silvestre sobre el ganado pueden mitigarse, pero solo mediante la implementaci & oacute;n colectiva de medidas concertadas entre todos los actores implicados. Asimismo, el reconocimiento y la valorizaci & oacute;n-tanto sociocultural como econ & oacute;mica-de las pr & aacute;cticas pastorales, junto con la capacitaci & oacute;n del sector agrario, resultan esenciales para facilitar esta coexistencia. El reconocimiento mutuo y la participaci & oacute;n activa de los actores locales se perfilan como pasos imprescindibles para desarrollar enfoques colaborativos que respeten las necesidades y aspiraciones de las comunidades rurales, al tiempo que contribuyen a los objetivos de restauraci & oacute;n y conservaci & oacute;n de la UE.

AB  - The structure of the community of insect herbivores in a plant can be determined by plant traits and also by interactions with consumers. We studied the herbivores associated with the tropical plant Andira nitida (Fabaceae), aiming to understand the temporal co-occurrence of herbivore insects from different guilds. We monitored and quantified the temporal sequence of appearance and leaf consumption of three herbivore guilds (leaf miners, gall-formers and chewers) at weekly intervals for 23 weeks (between September 2021 and March 2022), testing whether functional leaf traits (leaf area, leaf dry matter content, specific leaf area and leaf age) influence herbivory incidence and intensity. Leaves of A. nitida showed simultaneous damage by miners, chewers and six gall species. We found a temporal sequence in the establishment of leaf herbivores and a preference for young leaves. However, null model analysis indicated independent patterns of association between herbivores, and there was no evidence of co-occurrence or repulsion between herbivores or herbivore guilds. We found that leaf age is a determinant functional trait for the occurrence of all guilds and types of herbivores in A. nitida. However most of the physical characteristics of the leaf did not show a clear effect on the herbivore community. We showed that interactions among herbivores partially explained the organization of herbivorous insects in A. nitida and that patterns of occurrence depend more on the life history of herbivores than on aspects associated with plant functional traits. We suggest that there is differential leaf use by herbivores in time, which leads to the formation of different pairs of co-occurring herbivores.

AB  - (1) Regular wildlife abundance surveys are a key conservation tool. Manned aircraft flying transects often remain the best alternative for counting large ungulates. Drones have cheaper and safer logistics, however their range is generally too short for large-scale application of the traditional method. Our paper investigates an innovative rosette flight plan for wildlife census, and evaluates relevance of this sampling protocol by comparing its statistical performance with transects, based on numerical simulations. (2) The UAS flight plan consisted in two rosettes of 6 triangular '' petals '' spread across the survey area, for a theoretical sampling rate of 2.95%, as opposed to a 20.04% classic sampling protocol with systematic transects. We tested the logistics of our survey design in Garamba National Park. We then modeled theoretical population distributions for both antelopes and buffaloes. We calculated animal densities in the simulated footprints of the theoretical rosette and transect flight plans. We also tested aggregating results for 2, 3 and 4 repetitions of the same rosette flight plan to increase the sampling rate. (3) Simulation results showed that the coefficient of variation associated with density estimates decreases with the number of repetitions of the rosette flight plan, and aggregating four repetitions is enough to give antelope densities with acceptable accuracy and precision while staying at a lower sampling rate. Buffalo densities displayed much higher variability and it shows the significant impact of gregariousness on density estimate accuracy and precision. (4) The method was found to be inappropriate for highly aggregative species but efficient for species that disperse widely and more randomly in their environment. Logistics required to perform a full survey in the field remain time- and resources-intensive. Therefore, we recommend it for remote parks facing difficulties to organize manned aerial counts. Lower costs and developments such as solar UASs offer interesting future perspectives.

AB  - Our understanding of pathological conditions is usually centered on human and domesticated species. Thus, a vast array of pathologies within vertebrates are unknown, especially those that occur in exotics and those that lack external characters, such as conditions that affect the skeleton. Exotics represent a majority of the vertebrates housed in zoos and other wildlife centers, and in the larger picture of conservation, represent the best way to determine potential health threats and cures for endangered and threatened species in the wild. Here we describe a case of acromegaly, a rare condition of excess growth hormone, in a hog badger (Arctonyx collaris) based on Computed Tomography (CT). This is the first documented occurrence of this condition in non-human or non-domesticated mammals, and the first occurrence within Mustelidae. The recognition of this rare condition within a badger suggests that acromegaly may be more widespread within mammals than previously thought, and has implications for diagnosis of other exotics within zoos.

AB  - Fenton oxidation is a widely used method for the fast and efficient treatment of contaminated sediment, but few studies have investigated the management of Fenton-treated sediment for resource utilization. In this study, the evolutionary characteristics of bacterial community composition in Fenton-treated riverine sediment were investigated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing after the incorporation of rice straw biochar and sheep manure compost. The Fenton treatment caused a decline in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes from 39% to 8% on the 7th day, and using biochar and compost rapidly increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes from 13% to 61% and 57%, respectively. Applying 1.25 wt% biochar after the Fenton treatment contributed to high Shannon diversity indices of 4.80, 4.69, and 4.76 on the 7th, 28th, and 56th day, respectively. The reduced differences of Shannon indexes on the 56th day indicated that the bacterial diversity among different treatments tended to be similar over time. The genera Flavisolibacter and Bacillus were representatively detected on the 7th day in the untreated sediment and Fenton/biochar-treated sediment, respectively. The number of feature bacteria decreased significantly from 88 on the 7th day to 29 on the 56th day. The community functions for the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles were sensitive to the Fenton-treatment and the subsequent treatment with biochar and compost. This study may provide a useful reference for follow-up work on the remediation of contaminated sediment using advanced oxidation processes, and promote the development of resource utilization of amended sediment.

AB  - The ancient tea plant germplasm is an important resource for breeding new tea plant varieties and has great economic value. However, due to man-made and natural disturbances, it has become endangered. In order to have a better management of the conserved tea plant germplasm, it is a requirement to understand the genetic and phenotypic diversity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic and phenotypic diversity of 145 ancient tea plant germplasm resources from five populations in Sandu County of Guizhou province in China. To explore the population genetics of tea plant, we successfully identified 15 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, which were highly polymorphic. Additionally, we applied traditional phenotypic methods to evaluate the tea plant diversity. The results suggested that the genetic and phenotypic diversity were relatively high. A total of 96 alleles were identified, and the mean polymorphic information content (PIC) value was found to be 0.66. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that genetic variation within the populations was greater than among the populations. Overall, our results are the valuable baseline data in developing more efficient management and breeding plans for one of the most popular non-alcoholic beverage crops, the tea plant species.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts are becoming increasingly common worldwide and are a challenge to biodiversity management. Compared with compensatory management, which often focuses on solving emergency conflicts, mitigation management allows decision-makers to better understand where the damage is distributed, how the species are distributed and when the species conduct their activity. Here, we integrated data collected from 90 districts/counties' damage surveys and 1271 camera traps to understand the damage status, abundance, density and activity rhythms of wild boar (Sus scrofa) in Zhejiang, Eastern China, from January 2019 to August 2023. We found that (1) wild boar-human conflicts were mainly distributed in the northwest and southwest mountainous regions of Zhejiang Province; (2) the total abundance of wild boar was 115,156 +/- 24,072 individuals, indicating a growing trend over the past decade and a higher density in the western and southern regions; (3) wild boar exhibited different activity patterns across different damage regions, and the periods around 7:00, 11:00 and 16:00 represented activity peaks for wild boar in seriously damaged regions. The damage distribution, density, distribution and activity rhythms provide specific priority regions and activity intensity peaks for conflict mitigation. We believe that these findings based on the damage, distribution and activity could provide a scientific basis for mitigation management at the county level and enrich the framework of human-wildlife conflict mitigation.

The lack of forest continuation may prevent organisms from escaping areas that are no longer habitable due to altered environmental conditions and the reduction in size of habitat regions. Therefore, protecting and promoting forest connectivity has become one of the important objectives of forest management. The forests were regarded as independent elements, and the connectivity of the forest itself was directly evaluated in previous studies. However, this approach ignores the maintenance of forest connectivity, while requiring the participation of other landscape elements. In this study, we indirectly determine the forest priority by evaluating the landscape priority by integrating analysis with the habitat suitability (HS) model, MSPA and and BCkPC and dPC(k) index. We studied the wild boar (Sus scrofa) habitats in and around Hupingshan and Houhe National Nature Reserves to illustrate the indirect evaluation method of forest priority. The results showed that forests with high priority, medium priority, low priority, and non-priority comprised 596, 64, 58 and 105 km(2), respectively, accounting for the 41.2, 2.7, 3.0, and 11.9% of the total forest area. Our research revealed that evaluating the forest priority by analysing the landscape priority was an effective method for forest priority identification, and this strategy can be used to other regions or species for the goal of identifying the forest priority for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The relationships between shore fish assemblages from habitats neighboring coral reefs have received little attention in the Indo-Pacific. The present study is based on the extensive sampling (539,000 fish; 898 taxa) of three fish assemblages: reefs, mangroves, and soft-bottoms in a large bay of New Caledonia. Species area curves indicate that sampling was nearly exhaustive in all three habitats (262 species in mangroves, 342 on soft-bottoms, 594 on reefs). Combinations of life-history traits were used as proxies of ecological functions. The species and functional overlaps were highest between soft-bottoms and mangroves and lowest between mangroves and reefs. These overlaps were lower than most recent studies in the Indo-Pacific, a result probably linked to the extent of the sampling in the present study. The life-history traits of species found exclusively in one habitat as opposed to several habitats were not a random selection within the species pool. Overlapping species were mostly large species that fed on nekton, large invertebrates, or plankton; exclusive species were mostly sedentary, solitary, and of small size, except for plankton-feeding species, which mostly had large home ranges and formed large schools. Herbivores were seldom found in several habitats. Functional redundancy was correlated to species richness, and was highest in reef fish assemblages. Functions common to several habitats had very seldom the same relative redundancy, implying that these functions had not the same importance for each assemblage. Functions exclusive to one habitat generally had low redundancy. These functional attributes and species overlap suggest that these three assemblages have a low level of interaction, despite the fact that they share extensive boundaries. These findings may have important applications in the management of shore fish assemblages.

AB  - The impact of wildlife-vehicle collisions on drivers and wildlife populations has been gaining attention in the United States. Given the established success of wildlife crossings with fencing in reducing wildlife crashes and connecting habitat, information is needed on cost-effective means of implementation for departments of transportation. When wildlife crossings are constructed, they are often built into new road projects as a series of 2 or more underpasses and/or overpass structures connected by exclusionary fencing. Given limited transportation budgets and the prevalence of maintenance activities more so than new construction in many states, enhancing existing underpasses on previously constructed roads has been recognized as a cost-effective mitigation opportunity. More research is needed, however, on the effects of adding fencing to existing underpasses, particularly those that are too far from one another to be connected with contiguous fencing. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of this measure when applied to isolated underpasses. Approximately 1.6 km of 2.4-m-high wildlife fencing was added to each of 2 existing underpasses, a large bridge underpass and a large box culvert, situated approximately 8 km apart from one another on Interstate 64 in Virginia, USA. We conducted a 2-year post-fencing camera monitoring study and compared the findings from a 2-year pre-fencing study with regard to collision frequencies with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and black bears (Ursus americanus); the use of the underpasses by wildlife; and roadside deer activity. We also evaluated deer activity data to compare different fence end designs applied at the study sites. After fencing installation, deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) were reduced by 96.5% and 88% at the box culvert and bridge underpass, respectively, and there were no increases in DVCs within 1.6 km of the fence ends. Deer crossings increased 410% at the box culvert and 71% at the bridge underpass. Use of the culvert and bridge underpasses by other mammals increased 81% and 165%, respectively. Although deer use of the underpasses was much greater than their activity at any of the fence ends, there was relatively high deer activity at the fence ends that did not tie into a feature such as right-of-way fencing. Our study found that the addition of wildlife fencing to certain existing isolated underpasses can be a highly cost-effective means of increasing driver safety and enhancing habitat connectivity for wildlife. The benefits from crash reduction exceeded the fencing costs in 1.8 years, and fencing resulted in an average saving of >$2.3 million per site over the 25-year lifetime of the fencing. The results add to the growing body of knowledge about effective ways we can use existing infrastructure to connect wildlife habitat and increase driver safety.

AB  - Soundscapes contain rich acoustic information associated with animal behaviours, environmental characteristics and human activities, providing opportunities for predicting biodiversity changes and associated drivers. However, assessing the diversity of animal vocalizations remains challenging due to the interference of environmental and anthropogenic noise. A tool for separating sound sources and delineating changes in acoustic signals is crucial for an effective assessment of acoustic diversity. We present soundscape_IR, an open-source Python toolbox dedicated to soundscape information retrieval in which nonnegative matrix factorization is applied. This toolbox provides algorithms for supervised and unsupervised source separation (SS). It also enables the use of a snapshot recording for model training and subsequently applying adaptive and semi-supervised SS when target species produce sounds with varying features and when unseen sound sources are encountered. Our results demonstrated that SS could enhance the vocalizations of target species, characterize the complexity of vocal repertoires and investigate the spatio-temporal divergence of soundscapes. In tropical forest soundscapes, the application of SS effectively detected the rutting vocalizations of sika deer and revealed a graded structure in their acoustic characteristics. In subtropical estuarine soundscapes, SS automated the process of identifying distinct biotic and abiotic sounds, and the result uncovered divergent sound compositions between inshore and offshore waters. Implementation of SS in soundscape analysis offers a promising method for streamlining the assessment of acoustic diversity in diverse environments. Future application of SS will open new directions to acoustically quantify ecological interactions across individual, species and ecosystem levels.

AB  - Descendants of introgressive hybridization between species may have evolutionary advantages over their parental species. Prior studies have documented evidence of introgressive hybridization between coyotes, dogs, grey wolves and eastern wolves. This study attempts to attribute morphology and pelage patterns of Pennsylvania coyotes to sex, ecoregion, and the degree of coyote-wolf introgressive hybridization. A total of 192 coyotes were genotyped at 63 ancestry informative SNPS to determine the percent of coyote genome attributable to wolf origin (percent wolf). Females had higher percent wolf than males, which could be the result of lower survivorship in hybrid males. Percent wolf, sex, and ecoregion each were found to independently influence size using general linear model analysis, and the effect of sex was most pronounced. Coyotes from Northeastern and northcentral ecoregions of Pennsylvania were larger in size and possessed a higher percent wolf. Moreover, coyotes with higher percent wolf were larger, less red in some parts of their pelage, and had a different pelage patchiness composition. This correlates with previous studies that showed ecoregions with increased deer density correlated to coyotes with higher percent wolf. Size and percent wolf may be adaptively advantageous in Northeastern Pennsylvania where there is a relatively high deer population abundance. Furthermore, the degree of redness within coyotes may be used as an indicator for introgression levels for population managers, aiding in understanding the shifting ecological role of coyotes.

AB  - Land-use change is one of the most important driving factors of change in soil microbial diversity. Deforestation for tea plantations has transformed large areas of forestland in hilly areas of Southeast China. However, its impact on the soil fungal community structures and functions is still understudied. We compared the soil fungal communities and their functions in forestland (FD), a 3-year-old tea plantation (ZC3) and a 30-year-old tea plantation (ZC30) at 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil depths. The soil fungal community compositions and potential functions were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing techniques coupled with FUNGuild analysis. The results showed that the initial conversion from forestland to tea plantations significantly decreased soil fungal diversity. With an increase in the tea plantation age, the soil fungal diversity rebounded. The dominant phyla included Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, unclassified_k_fungi and Mortierellomycota, which were identified in all soil samples and accounted for 90% of all fungal communities. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) indicated that the soil fungal community was more responsive to the duration of tea planting than to the soil depth. FUNGuild analysis showed that the relative abundance of pathogenic and pathotrophic-saprotrophic fungi was higher while saprotrophs were lower in ZC30 compared with FD. Among the analyzed soil properties, soil available nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium and bulk density were the prime factors affecting the abundance and diversity of soil fungal community compositions. Network analysis showed that fungal microbial taxa increased positive interactions to enhance the adaptability of fungal microorganisms to long-term tea planting. Collectively, our results provide a clear view on the dynamic yet differential responses of fungal communities to land-use changes, and further emphasizes the need for long-term conventional tea plantations to adopt sustainable agricultural practices to reduce soil pathogenic fungi.

AB  - Conservation is a major topic in primatology. In addition to focusing on individual species, the protection of interaction networks is key to conservation success, but difficulties in identifying these networks hinder research. We hope to inspire research in primate conservation through network analysis. We illustrate an approach for studying species networks using data for Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana) in three national nature reserves in Sichuan Province, China: Wolong, Tangjiahe, and Heizhugou. With data on species presence/absence from 185 cameras each continuously working for >12 months, we used the Phi coefficient r(& oslash;) to identify spatial association networks between species and the Lambda statistic L-B to test the properties of the associations. We identified four networks across the reserves. Tibetan macaques were associated with four terrestrial/semi-arboreal bird and mammal species in Wolong and nine species in Tangjiahe, but only two species in Heizhugou. Macaques formed symmetrical associations, suggesting competition, unidirectional asymmetrical associations, suggesting commensalism, and bidirectional asymmetrical associations, suggesting mutualism. The macaque's community environment may be predation-free. Commensal and mutualistic interactions with Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) and three other species may enhance the ecological fitness of Tibetan macaques in Tangjiahe over that in Wolong and conservation investment for the macaque in Tangjiahe may benefit more species than that in Wolong. Asymmetrical associations may facilitate the ecological restoration of the degraded community in Heizhugou. Our approach may provide a sensitive method for ecological monitoring for conservation management, and facilitate primate community ecological research.

AB  - Bell miner associated dieback (BMAD) is a prevalent type of eucalypt dieback along the eastern seaboard of Australia that is caused by repeated psyllid outbreaks, which are due to over-abundant bell miner birds excluding insectivorous birds. Despite strong evidence for this causal model, we have a limited understanding of how abiotic soil properties influence the interactions within the model. To address this knowledge gap, we compared the abiotic soil properties of Eucalyptus saligna forest stands affected and not affected by BMAD in New South Wales (NSW). We then tested whether the differences in the abiotic soil properties altered soil mycorrhizal fungal communities, bell miner bird nesting habitat availability via understorey thickening by Lantana camara (growth) and factors that may influence eucalypt-psyllid interactions including E. saligna feed quantity (tree size and leaf growth rate), feed quality (leaf nutrient content) and chemical defences (terpene emissions). We found that BMAD-affected stands had higher soil available phosphorus than stands not affected by BMAD, which was most likely due to topography. This higher soil available phosphorus was associated with greater L. camara growth and E. saligna leaf phosphorus content, suggesting it may be important in bell miner bird nesting habitat availability and the quality of feed available to psyllids. In contrast, the feed quantity and chemical defences of E. saligna were not related to soil available phosphorus. Our findings show that soil available phosphorus may play an important role in BMAD in eucalypt forests. Therefore, we can use remote sensing generated fine-scale soil nutrient maps to identify eucalypt stands that are vulnerable to BMAD and focus preventative management actions in these areas.

AB  - Corpses in Brazil are commonly hidden in sugarcane plantations in the attempt to delay their finding and hinder the solution of the crime. On the other hand, these plantations are regularly sprayed with insecticides for pest control. Until now no study has reported the effects of insecticides on ant fauna. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that if a body hidden in a monoculture is accidentally contaminated by an insecticide, both the carcass decomposition pattern and the Formicidae fauna will be affected. To accomplish this, pig carcasses contaminated and non-contaminated were placed in a sugarcane monoculture environment and subsequently examined for data collection every 24 hours. The concentration used to contaminate the carcasses was 20 grams per liter of thiamethoxam. The decomposition patterns of contaminated carcasses were changed, in turn affecting the behavior of Formicidae fauna. A total of 5318 ants were collected, 3397 in contaminated carcasses and 1919 in non-contaminated carcasses, and 30 species of 11 genera were identified. According to the analysis, there are no differences between the composition of species between contaminated and non-contaminated carcasses, however, a significant difference was observed in the composition of species along the stages of decomposition between the two types of carcasses. Therefore, our hypothesis has been confirmed, contaminated carcasses undergo changes in their normal pattern of decomposition and the fauna of ants that act on them. As this group of insects has great importance for forensic sciences, the analysis of the experts should take these results into account.

AB  - The Sierra de Huautla Biosphere Reserve is a biodiversity reservoir in the Mexican dry tropics. The peasant communities historically inhabiting it have been used its natural resources for their subsistence, including wildlife. In order to characterize the hunting practices in the community of Pitzotl??n, Morelos, interviews were applied to ten local farmers, as well as participant observation, guided tours and hunting recording for seven months. 37 species of fauna with use values were registered, most of them for food (57 %), to reduce agricultural damage (49 %) and to use in traditional medicine (27 %). From September 2018 to March 2019, the capture of 70 individuals belonging to 17 species was counted in 41 hunting events. The species with the highest percentage of captured individuals were iguana negra Ctenosaura pectinata (19 %), huilota Zenaida spp. (19 %), tejon Nasua narica (14 %), Odocoileus virginianus (10 %) and tortola Columbina inca (9 %). It was estimated that 278.93 kg of biomass were consumed, 80 % was contributed by the white-tailed deer. The hunting was carried out within a 3.5 km ratio from the community environment, through ???spied on???, ???herded???, ???cornered??? and, ???lampareadas???, with the use of dogs and in opportunistic events. Hunting is a complementary activity in the subsistence strategies of the studied community, whose cultural roots allow obtaining material goods, recreation and socialization.

AB  - South American camelids (Lamini tribe) are represented by two genera and four species. Here we studied the skull anatomy of three of them, Lama glama, Lama guanicoe and Vicugna vicugna. The coexistence of these species in wide sectors of their distribution and the osteological homogeneity of these camelids constitute important factors that limit or even preclude identification at species level. This is particularly true in paleontological and archaeological contexts in which bones are the only elements to analyze, and complete or fragmentary remains are potentially recorded. Although some contributions dealing with interspecific differentiation of camelids are available currently, the clear distinction between these species through osteological remains is still a pending issue. The aim of this study was to find osteological characters that facilitate the determination of the analyzed species. For this, we analyzed a final sample comprised mainly adult specimens of 11 guanacos, 9 llamas and 18 vicun similar to as. We described and compared a diverse set of qualitative and quantitative osteological features of the skull, including foramina, processes, muscular scars, and other features of the cranium and mandible. The set of qualitative features included eight observations on the cranium and four on the mandible. The set of quantitative features included eight linear variables on the cranium and two on the mandible. We performed a Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) based on both qualitative and quantitative variables in order to differentiate camelids species. The best results were obtained when both types of variables were included in the analysis. The most robust characters for interspecific discrimination are those related to the muzzle, the mastoid foramen, the paraoccipital process, the lower incisors and the coronoid and condylar processes of the mandible. The morpho-functional meanings of some of these traits are discussed. This study can be considered as a contribution to future systematic studies and as a basic tool to carry out specific assignment of camelids through complete or partial remains in archaeological and paleontological contexts.

AB  - People's views and values for wild animals are often a result of their experiences and traditional knowledge. Local folklore represents a resource that can enable an understanding of the nature of human-wildlife interactions, especially the underlying cultural values. Using archival searches and semi-structured interviews, we collected narratives about the ibex (Capra sibirica) (n = 69), and its predators, the wolf (Canis lupus) (n = 52) and the snow leopard (Panthera uncia) (n = 43), in Ladakh, India. We compared these stories to those of a mythical carnivore called seng ge or snow lion (n = 19), frequently referenced in local Tibetan Buddhist folklore and believed to share many of the traits commonly associated with snow leopards (except for livestock depredation). We then categorized the values along social-cultural, ecological and psychological dimensions. We found that the ibex was predominantly associated with utilitarianism and positive symbolism. Both snow leopard and wolf narratives referenced negative affective and negative symbolic values, though more frequently in the case of wolves. Snow leopard narratives largely focused on utilitarian and ecologistic values. In contrast, snow lion narratives were mostly associated with positive symbolism. Our results suggest that especially for snow leopards and wolves, any potentially positive symbolic associations appeared to be overwhelmed by negative sentiments because of their tendency to prey on livestock, unlike in the case of the snow lion. Since these values reflect people's real and multifarious interactions with wildlife, we recommend paying greater attention to understanding the overlaps between natural and cultural heritage conservation to facilitate human-wildlife coexistence.

AB  - Management of rangelands requires knowledge of forage species that are preferred or avoided by wildlife and livestock. A recent expansion of woody vegetation into previously open grasslands in African savanna ecosystems negatively impacts many mammalian grazers. Nevertheless, the ecological role of bush encroacher plant species as food may present a benefit for browsing species. We quantified diet selection by Masai giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) through foraging observations and vegetation sampling in the Tarangire Ecosystem of Tanzania, which includes large areas of a native shrub that livestock managers have classified as an encroacher species (Dichrostachys cinerea). We compared woody plant species used by giraffes for foraging with availability at two different spatial scales during the wet and dry seasons. Giraffes selected some woody plants such as Vachellia species while significantly avoiding others, both at the local and landscape scales. Giraffes preferred foraging on D. cinerea at both spatial scales and in both the wet and dry seasons. Management that has focused on benefiting grazing livestock by removal of encroaching species (e.g., D. cinerea) may have unintended consequences for wildlife, especially for browsing species like giraffes that feed extensively on the expanding bush species.

AB  - Managing activities that result in human-wildlife conflict is a challenging goal for modern scientists and managers. In recent years, the self-motivated feeding of wildlife by humans has garnered popularity but with consequent risks for the health and safety of both parties. This has resulted in calls for management in areas of high contact, for example, parklands. Traditional controls are typically utilised (i.e. signage, patrols), yet their success is varied, leading to a rise in research aiming to improve them. This research has primarily focused on language and design, with little attention paid to the role that audience type (i.e. international tourists vs. locals/residents) may play in their success. Proportions in audience type present can vary both between parks and spatially within a single park, however, controls are usually applied homogeneously with no consideration for how response may vary between these groups. Here, we performed a robust before-after study across two summers using a wild fallow deer population in a public park that are commonly fed by visitors as our model. We deployed controls, following best practice as outlined by the literature, and tested their overall effectiveness. We then identified key areas with differences in visitor type proportions and tested for variation in success between them. We found that the numbers of visitors feeding the deer significantly decreased overall after the introduction of controls, although interactions were not eliminated entirely. We discovered that the effectiveness of these controls varied with changes in visitor type, with the most positive effects occurring in areas with more international tourists and no significant effect occurring in areas dominated by resident visitors. Notably, of the food offerings remaining, the proportion of foods that could be perceived as 'nutritionally beneficial' increased in both sites, marking overall changes in the behaviours of even those visitors who refused to stop feeding. These findings highlight the importance of target audience research in human-wildlife conflict management. We recommend that authorities aiming to reduce these interactions perform systematic surveys to identify the audience type present and cater controls accordingly to maximise their success.

AB  - Consumers play an integral role in mediating ecological succession-the change in community composition over time. As consumer populations are facing rapid decline in ecosystems around the world, understanding of their ecological role is becoming increasingly urgent. Increased understanding of how changes in consumer populations may influence community variability across space and turnover through time during succession is particularly important for coral reefs, which are among the most threatened ecosystems globally, and where fishes play vital roles in structuring benthic succession. Here, we examine how consumers influence coral reef succession by deploying 180 paired settlement tiles, caged (to exclude fishes larger than approximately 15 cm) and uncaged, within Palmyra Atoll, a remote marine wildlife refuge with previously documented high fish abundance, and monitored benthic community development one and three years after deployment. We found that excluding large fishes lead to lower alpha diversity and divergent community states across space (i.e.,, high beta diversity among caged tiles), suggesting that benthic fish feeding maintains local diversity but tends to homogenize community composition with dominance by crustose coralline algae. In addition, when fish were experimentally excluded, the developing benthic community exhibited a greater change in species composition over time (i.e., high temporal beta diversity), indicating that fish feeding tends to canalize community successional trajectories. Finally, the caged and uncaged tiles became more similar over time, suggesting that fish feeding plays a more important role during early succession. Our results demonstrate that the loss of large fishes, for example from overfishing, may result in benthic communities that are more variable across space and time. Increased variability could have important implications for ecosystem function and coral reef resilience in the face of escalating global stressors.

AB  - Insect herbivores can inflict substantial costs on plant reproductive success. Seed herbivory impacts directly by reducing the number of seeds and therefore the dispersal and reproductive potential of the plant. Fig trees, Ficus, provide keystone resources for tropical forests. The pollinating fig wasps develop inside figs, so consumption of unripe figs results in trees not only losing seeds but also their pollen dispersers. Selection to defend figs should therefore be strong. Seed herbivory is understudied in tropical forests and most data has been collected from fallen fruits. Here we use canopy sampling to identify fig-consuming larvae in central Panama and quantify both their consequences for the fig trees' reproductive success and the defensive value that ants provide against these larvae. Field surveys of 46 crops from nine fig species revealed that larvae could destroy up to 80% of figs on a tree. From seven Ficus species we barcoded (using COI) 51 individual fig consuming larvae (mainly Lepidoptera) that grouped into seven molecular operational taxonomic units. Lepidopteran larvae formed two feeding strategies, either stationary within a fig or tunneling between figs. Within the context of our study, stationary larvae were specialists whereas tunneling larvae were either specialists or generalists found on different Ficus species. Trees with ants had significantly fewer figs consumed by larvae (9% +/- 17% (mean +/- SD) for trees with azteca ants and 16% +/- 24% for trees with other ants) than did trees without ants (51% +/- 27%). Our results corroborate earlier findings that hosting ants can be an effective defensive mechanism for trees against seed herbivores or other antagonistic insects. Our study contributes to a wider body of research around the networks of insects associated with figs that highlights the importance of a multitrophic approach for understanding mutualism stability and persistence in the face of antagonism.

AB  - Similar to other insular birds around the world, the Galapagos rail (Laterallus spilonota Gould, 1841) exhibits reduced flight capacity following its colonization of the archipelago similar to 1.2 mya. Despite their short evolutionary history, rails have colonized seven different islands spanning the entire width of the archipelago. Galapagos rails were once common on islands with sufficiently high altitudes to support shrubs in humid habitats. After humans introduced goats, this habitat was severely reduced due to overgrazing. Habitat loss devastated some rail populations, with less than 50 individuals surviving, rendering the genetic diversity of Galapagos rail a pressing conservation concern. Additionally, one enigma is the reappearance of rails on the island of Pinta after they were considered extirpated. Our approach was to investigate the evolutionary history and geographic distribution of Galapagos rails as well as examine the genome-wide effects of historical population bottlenecks using 39 whole genomes across different island populations. We recovered an early divergence of rail ancestors leading to the isolated populations on Pinta and a second clade comprising the rest of the islands, historically forming a single landmass. Subsequently, the separation of the landmass similar to 900 kya may have led to the isolation of the Isabela population with more panmictic populations found on Santa Cruz and Santiago islands. We found that rails genomes contain long runs of homozygosity (>2 Mb) that could be related to the introduction of goats. Finally, our findings show that the modern eradication of goats was critical to avoiding episodes of inbreeding in most populations.

AB  - The results of long-term observations are summed up, making it possible to assess patterns and identify the reasons for changes in the numbers, current distribution, and interspecific relationships of ungulates in the Ussuriysky Nature Reserve. A comparison of archival materials and data from the last decade shows that changes in the abundance and distribution of most ungulate species in the reserve are inextricably linked with the increase in the number of sika deer. After the introduction of this species into the territory over 70 years, its number increased from 25 to 1180 individuals, and the population density reached an average of 30 individuals/1000 ha. Over the same period, the number of red deer in the Ussuriysky Nature Reserve decreased from 450 to 130 individuals, that is, more than three times. In the Suvorovsky forestry, there is currently a decrease in the number by about half (from 250-280 to 110 individuals); in the Komarovsky forestry, the number has decreased by about 10 times (from 180-200 to 15-20 individuals). The number and distribution of roe, musk deer, and wild boar in the territory has not changed as obviously. The current number of roe in the reserve is 170 individuals, with a population density of 4 individuals/1000 ha. The number of wild boars is about 200 individuals, with a population density of 4-5 individuals/1000 ha. The accounting methodology that was developed and applied has made it possible to obtain reliable data on the number and distribution of ungulates throughout the Ussuriysky Nature Reserve. There are concerns about a further increase in the number of sika deer in connection with the implementation of biotechnical measures in the reserve.

AB  - Simple Summary The Qinghai-Tibetan plateau is considered as the third Pole of the world and is characterized by low oxygen, high altitude, extreme cold weather and strong ultraviolet radiation. Yak, as the main domestic animals raised on the plateau, play various roles in local herdsmen's lives by supplying necessities such as meat, milk and fuel. Yak are adapted to the harsh environment on the plateau; microbiota in gut equip the hosts with special abilities including adaptability, as illustrated by numerous research projects. Accordingly, the microbes in the gastrointestinal tract of yak must be characteristically profiled as a strategy to adapt to the environment. However, little is known about the microbial community in whole tract of yak; almost all of reported researches focused on rumen. Therefore, in the current study the bacterial community in the gastrointestinal tract of yak was explored using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing technology, and the community profiling characteristic in each section was clearly elucidated. In the current research, samples of yak gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) were used to profile the bacterial compositional characteristics using high through-put sequencing technology of 16S RNA amplicon. A total of 6959 OTUs was obtained from 20,799,614 effective tags, among which 751 OTUs were shared by ten sections. A total of 16 known phyla were obtained in all samples-the most abundant phyla were Firmicutes (34.58%), Bacteroidetes (33.96%) and Verrucomicrobia (11.70%). At the genus level, a total of 66 genera were obtained-Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group (7.24%), Akkermansia (6.32%) and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 (6.14%) were the most abundant. Species of Observed (Sob), Shannon and Chao values of the Stomach were the greatest, followed by the large intestine, while small intestine had the lowest diversity (p < 0.05). Bacteroidete were more abundant in sections from rumen to duodenum; while Firmicutes were the most abundant in sections from jejunum. ABC transporters (7.82%), Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (4.85%) and Purine metabolism (3.77%) were the most abundant level-3 pathways in all samples. The results of associated correlation analysis indicated that rectum samples might be used as an estimator of rumen bacterial communities and fermentation. The results of this research enrich the current knowledge about the unique animals of the QTP and extend our insight into GITs microecology of various animals.

AB  - Due to the traditional rearing conditions in Algerian farms, a broad panel of ectoparasites can infest ruminants and domestic birds. Among them, lice (Phthiraptera) could be a severe source of discomfort, disturbance, and diseases for the infested animals and cause decreased productivity and economic losses. The current study was conducted for two years and aimed to investigate ruminant and domestic bird lice diversity in northeastern Algeria and argue their veterinary importance. The entomological field investigations were conducted on various animal species, including cattle, sheep, goats, backyard chickens, turkeys, and pigeons, in six regions of northeastern Algeria. Lice were collected manually on their hosts and kept in Eppendorf containing 70% ethanol. They were then morphologically identified according to several morphological keys. Among all 4488 collected lice, five species in ruminants and ten in domestic birds were identified. The most common lice species were Bovicola caprae in goats, Haematopinus eurysternus in cattle, Menacanthus stramineus in backyard chickens, Chelopistes meleagridis in turkeys, and Columbicola columbae in pigeons. We also identified other species with various abundance such as Linognathus africanus, Bovicola ovis, Bovicola bovis, Menopon gallinae, Goniocotes gallinae, Goniodes dissimilis, Goniodes gigas, Lipeurus caponis, Cuclotogaster heterographus, and Campanulotes bidentatus s.l.The survey results suggest that lice infestations are widespread in the studied areas. Further investigation is needed to evaluate such pests' impact on overall animal health and production.

AB  - In Mongolia, where nomadic pastoralism is still practiced by around one-third of the population, increasing livestock numbers, socio-economic constraints and climate change raise concerns over rangeland health. Little empirical evidence explains what triggers camp moves of pastoralists in the Dzungarian Gobi in Mongolia, which factors influence grazing mobility around camps, and how altitudinal migration benefits small livestock. We combined GPS tracking data of 19 small livestock herds monitored from September 2018 to April 2020 with remotely sensed climate and environmental data. We used general linear-mixed models to analyse variables influencing camp use duration and daily mobility patterns. To understand the importance of the altitudinal migration, we compared climatic conditions along the elevation gradient and looked at seasonal body weight changes of small livestock. We found that available plant biomass and season best explained camp use duration. Daily walking distance and maximum distance from camp increased with camp use duration. Pasture time increased with increasing biomass and rising temperatures. We conclude that herders in the Dzungarian Gobi have optimized pasture use by reacting to changes in biomass availability at landscape and local scale, and by embracing altitudinal migration. Flexibility in grazing mobility seems to have enabled local herder communities to practise sustainable pasture use. Maintaining this mobility will most likely be the best strategy to deal with environmental change under the current climate change scenarios.

AB  - The Campania region has a genetic heritage, both vegetal and animal, of great scientific interest, but many genetic resources risk extinction or abandonment. Thus, from a sustainability perspective, their conservation is very important and represents an imperative to allow future generations to satisfy their needs just as we are doing today. The aims of the present paper were to describe the current consistency and importance of goat farming in Italy and in the Campania region and to study its trend from 1861 to understand whether the policies for the sector implemented over time have been sufficient to conserve goat biodiversity. To these ends, the latest available data of the national livestock register of the Italian Ministry of Health, those of the different available Italian agricultural censuses, and historical-cultural documents published over time for the livestock sector were acquired and consulted to describe the goat sector and reconstruct its temporal trend. The results showed that in Italy there are just over 1,000,000 goats (the same consistency as 60 years ago), 50% of which are distributed in the southern regions, and 50,616 farms with goats, 43% of which are extensive. In this contest, the Campania region represents approximately 5% of the national goat population. The continuous decrease in the size of the national and regional goat heritage since the 1920s is the result of the agricultural policy instruments implemented for the livestock sector over time, which have effectively excluded the goat sector. Two small increases in the number of caprines were registered: the first in 1980s, when the Italian scientific community realized that the native goat genetic types, its milk and its organoleptic and dietary qualities could constitute a wealth of endogenous resources that needed to be valorized; the second, in the last decade, due to the actions of sustainability and biodiversity conservation implemented at the national and regional level. At the same time, today the goat sector continues to have a marginal role in the national and regional agricultural economy, and the survival of native goat farming is essentially ensured by sustainable rural communities conceived as the custodians of biodiversity.

AB  - How intensely animals use habitat features depends on their functional properties (i.e., how the feature influences fitness) and the spatial and temporal scale considered. For herbivores, habitat use is expected to reflect the competing risks of starvation, predation, and thermal stress, but the relative influence of each functional property is expected to vary in space and time. We examined how a dietary and habitat specialist, the pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis), used these functional properties of its sagebrush habitat-food quality, security, and thermal refuge-at two hierarchical spatial scales (microsite and patch) across two seasons (winter and summer). At the microsite and patch scales, we determined which plant functional traits predicted the number of bites (i.e., foraging) by pygmy rabbits and the number of their fecal pellets (i.e., general habitat use). Pygmy rabbits used microsites and patches more intensely that had higher crude protein and aerial concealment cover and were closer to burrows. Food quality was more influential when rabbits used microsites within patches. Security was more influential in winter than summer, and more at Cedar Gulch than Camas. However, the influence of functional properties depended on phytochemical and structural properties of sagebrush and was not spatiotemporally consistent. These results show function-dependent habitat use that varied according to specific activities by a central-place browsing herbivore. Making spatially explicit predictions of the relative value of habitat features that influence different types of habitat use (i.e., foraging, hiding, and thermoregulating) will improve how we predict patterns of habitat use by herbivores and how we monitor and manage functional traits within habitats for wildlife.

AB  - Density is a key trait of populations and an essential parameter in ecological research, wildlife conservation and management. Several models have been developed to estimate population density based on camera trapping data, including the random encounter model (REM) and camera trap distance sampling (CTDS). Both models need to account for variation in animal behavior that depends, for example, on the species and sex of the animals along with temporally varying environmental factors. We examined whether the density estimates of REM and CTDS can be improved for Europe's most numerous deer species, by adjusting the behavior-related model parameters per species and accounting for differences in movement speeds between sexes, seasons, and years. Our results showed that bias through inadequate consideration of animal behavior was exceeded by the uncertainty of the density estimates, which was mainly influenced by variation in the number of independent observations between camera trap locations. The neglection of seasonal and annual differences in movement speed estimates for REM overestimated densities of red deer in autumn and spring by ca. 14%. This GPS telemetry-derived parameter was found to be most problematic for roe deer females in summer and spring when movement behavior was characterized by small-scale displacements relative to the intervals of the GPS fixes. In CTDS, density estimates of red deer improved foremost through the consideration of behavioral reactions to the camera traps (avoiding bias of max. 19%), while species-specific delays between photos had a larger effect for roe deer. In general, the applicability of both REM and CTDS would profit profoundly from improvements in their precision along with the reduction in bias achieved by exploiting the available information on animal behavior in the camera trap data.

AB  - The present study was conducted with the objective of investigating the effect of aeration on the composting process and bacterial community in a semi-permeable membrane-covered high-temperature composting system. To this end, a 21-day laboratory-scale composting experiment was conducted on chicken manure, municipal sludge, wood chips, and rice straw under aeration rates of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 L<middle dot>kg DM- 1 min- 1. The results showed that aeration of 0.2 L<middle dot>kg DM- 1 min- 1 prolonged the high-temperature time span, increased the degradation rate of organic matter, and effectively improved the maturity of the compost. The results of the microbiological analyses demonstrated that the aeration of 0.2 L<middle dot>kg DM- 1 min- 1 resulted in an augmentation of both diversity and abundance in relation to the bacterial communities. Furthermore, aeration of 0.2 L<middle dot>kg DM- 1 min- 1 increased the relative abundance of Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria in the cooling and maturation phases as well as Bacillus in the high temperature phase, thus promoting organic matter degradation and compost maturation. Different aeration levels affected the bacterial community structure, which in turn altered compost physicochemical properties and maturity.

AB  - Background From megafauna to amoebas, the amount of space heterotrophic organisms use is thought to be tightly linked to the availability of resources within their habitats, such that organisms living in productive habitats generally require less space than those in resource-poor habitats. This hypothesis has widespread empirical support, but existing studies have focused primarily on responses to spatiotemporal changes in mean resources, while responses to unpredictable changes in resources (i.e., variance in resources or resource stochasticity) are still largely unknown. Since organisms adjust to variable environmental conditions, failing to consider the effects of resource unpredictability can result in an insufficient understanding of an organism's range size. Methods We leverage the available literature to provide a unifying framework and hypothesis for the effects of resource abundance and stochasticity on organisms' range sizes. We then use simulated movement data to demonstrate how the combined effects of resource abundance and stochasticity interact to shape predictable patterns in range size. Finally, we test the hypothesis using real-world tracking data on a lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) from the Brazilian Cerrado. Results Organisms' range sizes decrease nonlinearly with resource abundance and increase nonlinearly with resource stochasticity, and the effects of resource stochasticity depend strongly on resource abundance. Additionally, the distribution and predictability of resources can exacerbate the effects of other drivers of movement, such as resource depletion, competition, and predation. Conclusions Accounting for resource abundance and stochasticity is crucial for understanding the movement behavior of free-ranging organisms. Failing to account for resource stochasticity can lead to an incomplete and incorrect understanding of how and why organisms move, particularly during periods of rapid change.

AB  - Simple Summary: Our study elucidated the specific alterations in rumen microbiota associated with subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) triggered by a high-concentrate diet. It demonstrated that SARA can lead to a decrease in microbial richness and diversity in the rumen of goats. SARA could potentially hinder the growth of rumen bacterial communities. Within the context of SARA, the antioxidant capacity of goats diminishes, while inflammatory cytokines increase, potentially raising the risk of health issues in growing goats. Understanding this is crucial for predicting changes in goat microbiota and improving the efficiency and well-being of ruminants through nutritional approaches such as dietary interventions. This study aims to explore the antioxidant, immune, and enzyme metabolism aspects in goats experiencing subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA). Furthermore, we seek to elucidate the relationship between the symbiotic microbiota of goats and their metabolic function. Sixteen goats were equally divided into two groups and fed a normal-concentrate diet (NC, 55% concentrate) or a high-concentrate diet (HC, 90% concentrate) for five weeks. We found that the HC diet reduced the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) (p = 0.022) and increased interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) (p = 0.015), interleukin-4 (IL-4) (p = 0.008) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p = 0.002) concentration of goats. Simultaneously, the HC diet significantly increased the concentrations of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and amylase (AMY) in the blood and rumen fluid of goats (p < 0.05). Microbial analysis in the rumen of goats revealed that the HC diet decreased bacterial richness and diversity, as evidenced by the changed observed species, Chao 1, PD whole tree and Shannon when compared to the NC diet (p < 0.01). The proportion of Proteobacteria increased while that of Spirochaetes and Fibrobacteres significantly decreased with the HC diet (p < 0.05). The Christensenellaceae_R-7_group and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 in rumen was notably decreased when a diet was switched from 55% concentrate diet to 90% concentrate diet (p < 0.05). Additionally, microbial functional potentials deduced that the HC diet significantly increased the abundance of the citrate cycle (TCA cycle) (ko00020) associated with carbohydrate metabolism (p = 0.028). Furthermore, the HC diet significantly increased the glutathione metabolism (ko00480) associated with the metabolism of other amino acids (p = 0.008). Our findings suggested that SARA reduced the total antioxidant capacity and increased levels of inflammatory factors in goats, as well as decreased rumen bacterial species and abundance.

AB  - The fighting fish Betta splendens, long studied for its aggressive territorial competitions, has the potential to be a tractable and relevant model for studying the intersection of cognitive ecology and social neuroscience. Yet, few studies have comprehensively assessed Betta behavior across both social and nonsocial contexts. Furthermore, the present study is the first to quantify the expression of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (PS6), a proxy for neural response, in the Betta telencephalon. Here, we assessed male Betta behavior across a suite of tasks and found that response to a mirror, but not neophilia (a novel object) nor anxiety (scototaxis), predicted behavior in a social competition. To then explore the cognitive aspects of social competition, we exposed Betta to either a familiar or novel opponent and compared their competitive behavior as well as their neural responses in the teleost homologs of the hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, and lateral septum. We did not detect any differences between familiar-exposed and novel-exposed individuals, but by implementing the first use of a habituation-dishabituation competition design in a study of Betta, we were able to observe remarkable consistency in competitive outcomes across repeated exposures. Taken together, the present study lays the groundwork for expanding the use of Betta to explore integrative and multidimensional questions of social cognition.

AB  - Rapid climate change has provided the opportunity for many species to learn to adapt fast enough to modify their range distribution. The positive and negative responses of the species in terms of distribution are related to parameters such as kind of species, degree of specialization, size and movement skills, and such factors. Moving to high elevations and transitions to higher latitudes are among the strategies proposed as a solution to the negative effects of climate change. Therefore, predicting how different species respond to climate change can help predict the conservation program for them. Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to predict the geographical distribution of habitat suitability and species occurrence. Rhinopoma muscatellum is one of the three mouse-tailed bats (Rhinopomatidae) inhabiting the southeastern, southern, and southwestern parts of Iran and its distribution range to the interior and northern parts of Iran has been limited by the Elburz and Zagros Mountain. To study the effect of climate change on this species, range shifts and coverage of protected regions, 74 presence points and environmental variables (climate, topography, anthropogenic, and vegetation) in MaxEnt software were used. Before the implementation of the model, the autocorrelation of the presence points was reduced and the selection of pseudo absent points was limited by using the bias grid. Climate variables were prepared for Mid-Holocene, Current, Climate Current, and Future scenarios in 2070 (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5). In order to evaluate the overlap of ecological niche, the Schoener's D and I statistic metrics were used. Also, to measure the breadth of the niches, B1 (inverse concentration) and B2 (uncertainty) metrics in ENMTOOLS software were employed. TSS statistics were used as a threshold. Species distribution trend changes in climatic scenarios were performed by the Mann Kendall (MK) test. Based on the results, the AUC values for current and future climate models were calculated to be 0.89 and 0.85, respectively. The distance from settlement, soil organic carbon, and altitude variables have the greatest impact on the current distribution of the species; and among the climatic variables, Isothermality (Bio3), Temperature Seasonality (Bio4), and Max Temperature of Warmest Month (Bio5) had the greatest impact on species distribution. The results showed that in climate change scenarios by 2070, the distribution range and breadth of climatic niche of Rhinopoma muscatellum will be significantly increased (P-value <0.05), habitat fragmentation will be reduced, and in RCP8.5 scenario it will reach the maximum distribution (39.38% of total Iran). This increase will cover the Elburz and Zagros mountain ranges, and a large part of the country will be suitable for the species. In response to current climate change, migration to higher latitudes was identified in this study. Among the main different classes of protected regions in Iran (National parks, Wildlife refuges, and Protected areas), protected areas in all scenarios had the most coverage of the suitable species habitat.

AB  - Many species exhibit selective foraging behaviour, where consumers use a nonrandom subset of available food types. Yet little is known about how selective foraging behaviour varies with environmental conditions and the community level consequences of such selection dynamics. We examined selective foraging by wolves preying primarily on elk in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) over a 12-year period and on moose in Isle Royale National Park (IRNP) over a 47-year period. Specifically, we assessed how selection for calves and senescent adults varied with their frequency in the environment, wolf abundance and winter severity. Selection for senescent adults decreased as the relative abundance of senescent prey increased (i.e. negative frequency-dependent selection) in both study sites. In IRNP, selection for calves was also negatively frequency dependent and declined with increasing wolf abundance. These results are inconsistent with the pattern of positive frequency-dependent selection expected under the prey switching hypothesis. These results suggest that selection is primarily driven by intraspecific differences in prey vulnerability and wolves' interest in minimizing their risk of injury, as opposed to maximizing intake rates. Lastly, we ran simulations to evaluate how predator-prey dynamics were influenced by dynamic patterns of selection, like those observed in YNP and IRNP. The simulations indicated that predators are more efficient (i.e. steeper slope of the numerical response) when selection for calves is negatively frequency dependent, which results in a lower mean abundance of prey. More importantly, predation is a stronger destabilizing force when selection for calves is negatively frequency dependent. That stronger destabilizing force is indicated by greater variability in the abundance of prey and predators, prey populations being less resilient and a steeper negative slope of the relationship between predation rate and prey population growth rate. As such, our simulation analyses suggest that some of the observed patterns of negative-frequency dependent selection may have important consequences for predator-prey dynamics.

AB  - Herbivores use vigilance to reduce predation risk and interact socially, yet it imposes a foraging efficiency cost. As individuals spend more time with their head up being vigilant, time available to search for and ingest food decreases. We explored whether ungulates can strategically modify behaviours to compensate for vigilance costs via increased cropping rate when food searching time was near-zero and bite sizes were small. We compared the proportion of time individuals had their head up to their cropping rate (bites/observation length) in 271 observations of Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti). Using a linear mixed-effect model, we estimated the head up-cropping rate relationship and found that elk cropping rate was constant across varying lengths of time spent with their head up, indicating no vigilance compensation occurred via increased cropping rate. We discuss settings when cropping rate compensation is expected and other behaviours that might mitigate vigilance costs.

AB  - In temporary ponds, submerged plants have adapted to recurrent periods of drought. These ponds often lack the impact of large herbivores but can harbor large numbers of herbivorous tadpoles. Tadpoles of the Iberian spadefoot toad (Pelobates cultripes) may reach large body size and consume large quantities of macrophytes during their long larval period, which is shortened with risk of pond drying. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to analyze the interplay between hydroperiod and impact of herbivorous tadpoles on the abundance and life history of 3 species of submerged plants common to temporary ponds. We observed differences in growth among plant species resulting in lags in timing of maximum cover, probably related to interspecific competitive interactions. Some plants responded to pond drying with a remarkable increase in the production of flowers. Tadpoles greatly reduced the plant cover, although their impact varied across plant species. Differential plant consumption by these large tadpoles can substantially modify the internal structure and complexity of temporary ponds, and tadpoles can also interfere with plant responses to shortened hydroperiod.

AB  - To improve lifetime reproductive success, maternal ungulates should pursue behavioral strategies that reduce risk of offspring mortality. Predation is a leading cause of neonatal mortality; thus, maternal ungulates should select habitat that reduces risk of predation on vulnerable neonates. We examined selection of habitat across subpopulations of federally endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis sierrae) within Sierra Nevada, California, USA, 2008-2018. Our objectives were to understand how maternal Sierra Nevada bighorn minimize risk of predation through selection of habitat and to quantify current and future potential neonatal habitat across the Sierra Nevada. Mountain lions (Puma concolor) are the predominant predators of adult Sierra Nevada bighorn; thus, we hypothesized females would select habitat that minimized risk of predation from mountain lions. We developed a used-available resource selection function to quantify patterns of habitat selection and produced predictive maps identifying highly selected lambing habitat across the Sierra Nevada. Our top model demonstrated females selected habitat where the relative probability of encountering mountain lions was low and near escape terrain. Selection for vegetation type was dependent on risk of encounter with mountain lions; when risk of encounter was low, females selected shrub cover. This suggests that when risk of encountering mountain lions was low, females may have selected areas with dense shrubs to reduce risk of being detected by other predators such as coyotes (Canis latrans) and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). As risk of encountering mountain lions increased, females avoided all vegetation types other than barren, suggesting that despite increased risk of encounter, females may have been able to mitigate overall mortality risk by selecting habitat where approaching mountain lions could be detected and avoided. Our predictive models and resulting maps demonstrate differences in prevalence and connectivity of highly selected lambing habitat across subpopulations, which may explain differences in lamb recruitment and adequacy of lambing habitat observed among subpopulations. Recolonization into historical ranges and increasing connectivity between Sierra Nevada bighorn subpopulations is an important conservation need for species recovery and long-term viability of fragmented subpopulations.

AB  - The long-term health of many South African estuaries is impacted by pollutants entering these systems through industrial and agricultural runoff, sewage outfalls, contaminated storm water drainage, flows from informal settlements, and plastic materials in marine debris. Uncontrolled inputs combined with poor environmental management often result in elevated levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in affected estuaries. Data on POPs research from 1960 to 2020 were analysed in terms of their sources, environmental investigations, and health implications. The outcome showed polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl sulphonates (PFASs) to exceed the US EPA health advisory levels for drinking water. Concentration of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in water were below the WHO limits, while those in fish tissues from most estuaries were found to be below the US FDA limits. Although environmental compartments in some estuaries (e.g. Rooiels and uMngeni estuaries) seem to be less contaminated relative to other marine systems around the world, many others were polluted and critically modified (e.g. Durban Bay, Swartkops, Sundays, and Buffalo systems). Due to inconsistent monitoring methods coupled with limited data availability, temporal trends were unclear. Of the 290 estuaries in South Africa, 65 were prioritised and recommended for POPs evaluation based on their pollution sources, and a monitoring strategy was defined in terms of sampling. Government policies to curb marine pollution need to be enforced to prevent chronic contamination that leads to water quality deterioration and loss of ecosystem services.

AB  - Studies of interspecific differences in the physiological performance of animals and their relationship with metabolism may provide insight into how selection influences diversity in phenotypic traits. To investigate the effects of food habits on growth, digestion, specific dynamic action (SDA), and the intestinal microbiota and verify their relationships in freshwater fishes, we measured the specific growth rate (SGR), meal remaining in the gastrointestinal tract, postprandial metabolic response, and intestinal microbial diversity of nine freshwater fish species with different food habits (three carnivorous, four omnivorous, and two herbivorous) fed at 25 degrees C. The SGR, energy ingested (EI), energy efficiency (EE), gastrointestinal evacuation rate (GER), peak metabolic rate (PMR), peak metabolic scope (PMS), and SDA duration values were the highest in carnivores and the lowest in herbivores. The routine metabolic rate (RMR) and SDA coefficient values of carnivores were also significantly greater than those of omnivores and herbivores. The SGR was also significantly and positively correlated with the EI, GER, PMS, and SDA coefficients. These results indicated that growth performance, feeding and digestion abilities, and feeding metabolic responses were the strongest in carnivores and the weakest in herbivores. There was no significant difference in the richness of the intestinal microbiota with different food habits, whereas omnivores presented the highest diversity, followed by herbivores, and carnivores presented the lowest diversity. Moreover, while the phylum composition of the intestinal microbiota in fish with different food habits was similar, significant differences were observed in the composition proportions among carnivores. This might be related to the host's ability to digest and utilize proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. We suggest that the interspecific differences in growth associated with different food habits are related to their feeding and digestive abilities, metabolic response, and gut microbiota.

AB  - Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) have among the longest annual migrations of any terrestrial mammal as they move from winter ranges to spring calving grounds. Biomonitoring records indicate broad consistencies in calving geography across the last several decades, but how long have herds used particular calving grounds? Furthermore, how representative are modern patterns of calving geography to periods that pre-date recent climatic perturbations and increased anthropogenic stresses? While modern ecological datasets are not long enough to address these questions, bones from past generations of caribou lying on the tundra provide unique opportunities to study historical calving geography. This is possible because female caribou shed their antlers within days of giving birth, releasing a skeletal indicator of calving. Today, the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (Alaska) is a key calving ground for the Porcupine Caribou Herd (PCH). To test the duration across which caribou have used this area as a calving ground, we radiocarbon dated three highly weathered female antlers collected from tundra surfaces on the Coastal Plain. Calibrated radiocarbon dates indicate that these antlers were shed between similar to 1,600 and more than 3,000 calendar years ago. The antiquity of these shed antlers provides the first physical evidence of calving activity on the PCH calving grounds from previous millennia, substantiating the long ecological legacy of the Coastal Plain as a caribou calving ground. Comparisons to published lake core records also reveal that dates of two of the antlers correspond to periods with average summer temperatures that were warmer than has been typical during the last several decades of biomonitoring. This finding expands the range of climatic settings in which caribou are known to use the current PCH calving grounds and suggests that the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge may remain an important caribou calving ground during at least portions of predicted future warming. Discarded skeletal materials provide opportunities to assess the historical states of living populations, including aspects of reproductive biology and migration. Particularly in high-latitude settings, these insights can extend across millennia and offer rare glimpses into the past that can inform current and future management policies.

AB  - Microhistology analyses are well-supported techniques useful for studying herbivore diet composition, but they involve the correct identification and validated relative quantification of the plant species consumed, as well as the knowledge of possible biases inherent to methods. We analyzed two methods for quantifying the relative frequency of plant cuticles using an experimental procedure from laboratory- prepared samples. The factors affecting the precision of quantification were analyzed, the minimum sampling effort to detect all plants in the experimental mixture was estimated and the practical application on a complex real sample discussed, in order to describe a simple, standardized, and reliable procedure for studies of herbivore diet composition in Mediterranean ecosystems. Ten random mixtures were prepared with combinations of 40 known plant species, in different number and dry weight percentages. A total of 100 microscopic fields, distributed across 5 slides per sample, were analyzed using both quantification methods. Statistical analysis concluded that the two methods differed significantly. Higher precision was achieved with the method based on annotating the presence/absence of each species in each microscopic field, instead of the total number of times each plant was detected in each field. The important predictors of accuracy were the complexity of the sample and the proportion of plant material in the mixtures. The number of slides and microscopic fields did not significantly impact the quantification results, and no additional species were identified beyond 25 fields in the most complex samples. Due to its greater reliability, shorter analysis time, and reduced visual effort, the first method proved to be more efficient. This method is validated and useful in diet studies of overabundant populations of deer and extensive and transhumant livestock to evaluate the impacts of herbivores on ecosystems and generate sustainable management criteria in the use of pastures toward environmental and economic sustainability.

AB  - Climate change is expected to significantly reshape the geographic distribution of many species worldwide. The bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), a species of ecological, economic, and cultural importance in Mexico, is particularly vulnerable to these environmental shifts. This study applies ecological niche modeling to estimate the probability of species occurrence based on bioclimatic variables under future climate scenarios. Using four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) and six General Circulation Models, projections are made for the period 2041-2060. This analysis is based on 280 georeferenced records of bighorn sheep occurrences and evaluates changes in temperature and precipitation, which are assumed to influence their potential distribution. Projections suggest a significant reduction in geographic distribution, with drier periods and extreme temperatures exerting the most detrimental effects. These findings pose considerable challenges for long-term conservation and management of bighorn sheep populations, as current strategies may be insufficient. The ecological niche model suggests focusing conservation efforts on Northern Baja California (Californian ecoregion) to identify potential distribution. This research emphasizes the critical need to integrate climate projections into conservation strategies to better manage the uncertainties of climate change.

AB  - Composting is a reliable way for manure treatment and nutrient recycle, but the accumulation of pig manures is not effectively treated with the limited available lands. In this study, a continuous composting system was designed to increasing the treatment capacity by adding pig manure three times at the beginning of each composting cycle. The aim of the present study was to assess the composting parameters and bacterial community structure in this system. Physicochemical factors, bacterial community, and functional prediction of each composting cycles were evaluated. The result indicated that content of total nitrogen and NH4+-N increased, while the amount of carbon, cellulose, and hemicellulose decreased during the composting process. At the same time, the amount of lignin increased firstly, and then decrease to 17.3% after the last composting cycle. Furthermore, bacterial community structures were different among the three composting cycles. The correlation heatmap between environment factors and microbial community indicated that C/N ratio and pH were the main factors affecting the community structure. Additionally, bacteria participated in nitrogen cycles were found in the composting materials. Paracoccus denitrificans, Jonesia denitrificans, and Geobacillus thermodenitrificans were the main denitrifiers, and became the most abundance after the second composting cycle. The numbers of KEGG Orthology (KO) associated with ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification increased after the composting. The present study illustrated that more composting cycles might reduce the ability of nitrogen assimilation, but increases the degradation of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose in continuous composting system.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetries (FA) are small stress-induced random deviations from perfect symmetry that arise during the development of bilaterally symmetrical traits. One of the factors that can reduce developmental stability of the individuals and cause FA at a population level is the loss of genetic variation. Populations of founding colonists frequently have lower genetic variation than their ancestral populations that could be reflected in a higher level of FA. The European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) is native to Eurasia and was introduced successfully in the USA in 1890 and Argentina in 1983. In this study, we documented the genetic diversity and FA of starlings from England (ancestral population), USA (primary introduction) and Argentina (secondary introduction). We predicted the Argentinean starlings would have the highest level of FA and lowest genetic diversity of the three populations. We captured wild adult European starlings in England, USA, and Argentina, measured their mtDNA diversity and allowed them to molt under standardized conditions to evaluate their FA of primary feathers. For genetic analyses, we extracted DNA from blood samples of individuals from Argentina and USA and from feather samples from individuals from England and sequenced the mitochondrial control region. Starlings in Argentina showed the highest composite FA and exhibited the lowest haplotype and nucleotide diversity. The USA population showed a level of FA and genetic diversity similar to the native population. Therefore, the level of asymmetry and genetic diversity found among these populations was consistent with our predictions based on their invasion history.

AB  - A ridge-to-reef framework was developed for 26 watersheds around Guam. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) data were collected for one year at the base of streams while coral and fish surveys were conducted on adjacent reefs. Two independent analyses revealed a similar 0.10 mg/l DIN threshold beyond which negative impacts to water quality and coral reefs existed. The influence of DIN was next partitioned with respect to a second primary stressor, fishing pressure. While coral diversity was negatively influenced by DIN, the cover of some stress -tolerant corals increased, such as Porites rus, making coral cover alone a poor indicator of watershed pollu-tion. Less intuitive, DIN predicted increased food-fish biomass that was accounted for by generalist herbivores/ detritivores, representing homogenized assemblages, while fishing pressure reduced biomass. Our DIN thresholds resonated with a similar study in American Samoa suggesting broader guidance for water quality legislation may be emerging.

AB  - This study evaluated the trend and spatial distribution of wild boar population harvested in the Alpine hunting district C.A. CN1 (Piedmont, Italy) from 1996 to 2018, and its relation with hunting effort. Protected areas were found to shape the distribution of the harvested wild boars, which decreased in number as the distance from those zones increased. The hunting bag data presented large yearly fluctuation, with a trend in line with the hunting effort until 2007 when the maximum capacity of the population to cope with the hunting pressure was reached. The variation of reproductive parameters (percentage of piglets in the hunted population and piglets to sexually matured female ratio) showed a decreasing trend in both time series. Conversely, hunting effort increased over the years, with significant trend changes in 2000 and 2015, probably associated with the increased preference for hunting activity on wild boars, and the parallel reduction of the extension of hunting areas. Predation, hunting activity, and environment could have modulated the wild boar population dynamics in the study area. Decrease in chestnut Castanea sativa production, due to the gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu, were reported during the period of study. This might be the main factor determining the downtrend of piglets in 2003. In addition, predation by wolves Canis lupus, whose population has sharply increased in the southwestern Alps in the last decades, might have contributed to the decline since 2010. This work outlines the importance of a proper management of protected areas, which influence the density and distribution of wild boars. In this context, hunting bags analysis is of pivotal importance to monitor population dynamics and develop proper wildlife policies.

AB  - PurposeIn the present study, gastrointestinal parasites (GIP) prevalence in sheep and goats from India was estimated by scientometrics.MethodsThe GIP prevalence studies (86) reported during 1998-2021 was obtained from online databases, and offline literatures, meta-analysis was undertaken by using "meta" package in R-Software.ResultsThe pooled GIP prevalence in India was 65% (95% level CI 56-74%, PI 12-96%) in sheep, 74% (95% level CI 66-80%, PI 14-98%) in goats and 68% (95% level CI 62-73%, PI 15-96%) in sheep and goats. Period-wise analysis revealed a higher GIP prevalence during 1998-2010 than the recent periods. Among the zones, GIP prevalence was higher in the Central zone (79%) in sheep, North zone (82%) in goats, and Central zone (78%) in sheep and goats. Based on the state-wise analysis, a higher GIP prevalence was observed in Haryana for sheep, Himachal Pradesh for goats, and Uttarakhand for sheep and goats. In India, a higher prevalence was reported by nematodes than other parasite classes. Based on climatic regions, a higher GIP prevalence was observed in semi-arid Steppe type region (84%).ConclusionThe high prevalence zones, states, species, sample types, parasite classes, parasite species and climate regions of GIP will be useful in decision-making and resource use efficiency by policymakers and stake holders. There is an urgent need to prevent the occurrence of GIP infections in sheep and goats by adopting scientific management practices, effective therapeutic measures, and hygienic practices on farms to augment the economic benefits to sheep and goat farmers in India.

AB  - When a transmission hotspot for an environmentally persistent pathogen establishes in otherwise high-quality habitat, the disease may exert a strong impact on a host population. However, fluctuating environmental conditions lead to heterogeneity in habitat quality and animal habitat preference, which may interrupt the overlap between selected and risky habitats. We evaluated spatio-temporal patterns in anthrax mortalities in a plains zebra (Equus quagga) population in Etosha National Park, Namibia, incorporating remote-sensing and host telemetry data. A higher proportion of anthrax mortalities of herbivores was detected in open habitats than in other habitat types. Resource selection functions showed that the zebra population shifted habitat selection in response to changes in rainfall and vegetation productivity. Average to high rainfall years supported larger anthrax outbreaks, with animals congregating in preferred open habitats, while a severe drought forced animals into otherwise less preferred habitats, leading to few anthrax mortalities. Thus, the timing of anthrax outbreaks was congruent with preference for open plains habitats and a corresponding increase in pathogen exposure. Given shifts in habitat preference, the overlap in high-quality habitat and high-risk habitat is intermittent, reducing the adverse consequences for the population.

AB  - Earth's climate is rapidly changing, bringing forth questions of how domestic and wild animals will alter their behaviour in response to increasing temperatures and dryland expansion. Dwindling water availability will likely impact animal behaviour and water foraging, potentially increasing animal aggregations and interspecific contacts. These interspecific contacts are especially important for competition, predation and disease transmission among wildlife and domestic animals. In this study, we analysed interspecific wildlife and cattle contacts using two years of camera trap data at an experimental water manipulation site at a conservancy in central Kenya. We found that on average, the hourly probability of any interspecific contact was approximately 3.4 times higher at water sources versus drained water sources and 18 times higher than surrounding matrix areas, and that this relationship was amplified by dry and hot conditions. Species-specific analyses revealed variation in the magnitude of responses across wildlife and domestic cattle, although all animals had approximately 2-3 times higher interspecific contact probability with other species at water in hot conditions versus other conditions. Notably, we observed the largest behavioural changes for relatively water-independent species, such as giraffe, which had 3.6 times higher interspecific contact probability at water sources in hot versus other conditions. Synthesis and applications. These findings show how elevated temperatures that will become increasingly common with future climate changes can increase interspecific contacts around critical water resources. In mixed wildlife-livestock systems, maintaining wildlife-only water sources may be a practical management tool to mitigate human-wildlife conflict and disease transmission at this interface, especially during dry and hot conditions.

AB  - Patterns of co-occurrence among species can help reveal the structure and assembly of ecological communities. However, studies have been limited by measuring co-occurrence in either space or time but not both simultaneously. This is especially problematic in systems such as masting forests where resources are highly variable, meaning that spatial use and co-occurrence patterns can change on fine spatiotemporal scales. We develop an analytical framework for assessing species co-occurrence at fine spatial and temporal scales simultaneously and apply these models to a camera trapping dataset from Borneo. We sought to determine how substantial variation in food availability across space and time affects co-occurrence among terrestrial vertebrates. We detect many significant, mostly positive, co-occurrence patterns among species, but almost entirely in unlogged forest and during dipterocarp mast years. The most strongly co-occurring pair of species, bearded pig (Sus barbatus) and sambar (Rusa unicolor), only positively co-occur in areas and years when fruit is locally abundant. Species occurrences in logged forest and non-mast years are mostly random with respect to other species. This suggests that frugivore-granivore species positively co-occur when resources are plentiful (i.e., large trees are present and fruiting), likely because they use the same resources; these patterns disappear when food availability is lower. Our approach demonstrates the utility of measuring co-occurrence in space and time together and highlights the importance of resource abundance for driving the co-occurrence structure of communities. Furthermore, our method could be broadly applied to other systems to assess fine-scale spatiotemporal patterns across a range of taxa.

AB  - The expansion of global maritime activities threatens marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Collisions between ships and marine megafauna profoundly impact vulnerable species such as whales, who serve as keystone predators. However, the specific regions most heavily affected by shipping traffic and the multi-species facing collision risk remain poorly understood. Here, we analyzed global shipping data to assess the distribution of areas with high shipping pressure and identify global hotspots for whale-ship collisions. The results reveal that high-pressure habitats are primarily distributed within exclusive economic zones (EEZs), which are generally consistent with the distribution of collision hotspots. High-pressure habitats exhibit significant spatial mismatch: 32.9% of Marine Protected Areas endure high shipping stress and yet occupy merely 1.25% of protected ocean area. Additionally, 25.1% of collision hotspots (top 1% risk) affect four or more whale species, forming critical aggregation in regions like the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Northeast Asian marginal seas. Most of these high-risk areas lack protective measures. These findings offer actionable spatial priorities for implementing targeted conservation strategies, such as the introduction of mandatory speed restrictions and dynamic vessel routing in high-risk, multi-species hotspots. By focusing on critical aggregation areas, these strategies will help mitigate whale mortality and enhance marine biodiversity protection, supporting the sustainable coexistence of maritime activities with vulnerable marine megafauna.

AB  - Present work evaluated the zinc (Zn) concentration in soil, forage, blood plasma, hair, and feces samples of cows, buffaloes, and sheep taken from Mianwali, Punjab, Pakistan. The concentration of Zn was found in the ranged of 21.82-35.09mg/kg, 32.59-42.17mg/kg, 0.927-2.48mg/l, 1.03-2.84mg/kg, and 0.923-1.98mg/kg in soil, forage, blood plasma, hair, and feces samples, respectively. The Zn concentration in soil, forage, blood, hair, and feces was safer compared to standard limits. Statistical analysis described that values for BCF, PLI, EF, DIM, and HRI ranged 1.03-1.57mg/kg, 0.486-0.782mg/kg, 0.457-0.696mg/kg, 0.048-0.08mg/kg, and 0.160-0.272mg/kg, respectively. It can be concluded from the present work that Zn concentration was safe in soil, forages, and animal samples. BCF was noticed as greater than 1 while PLI, EF, DIM, and HRI were found less than 1, so regular heavy metal analysis was required to appraise the contamination level in environment.

AB  - After a long period of human persecution that led it to extinction in most of its distribution range, the wolf is undergoing a fast recovery. Despite being described as an elusive species only living in remote areas, wolves are recently occupying also human-dominated landscapes, increasing the frequency of direct contacts with humans. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether this situation is only caused by a numerical increase or partially facilitated by a higher tolerance of wolves with respect to human proximity. We focused on a European region offering an abundant, widespread and long-term monitored wolf population to analyse wolf pack distribution and its relationship with human presence across areas recolonized across four different time periods (1972, 1996, 2005 and 2016). Throughout areas recolonized during different periods, wolves were initially located in mountains and hills, occupying plains only in the recent past. Although they consistently tended to be located as far as possible from urban settlements, especially from those with over 5000 inhabitants, in 2016, 70% of packs included at least one urban settlement within the expected home range. Moreover, the distance kept by wolves from the nearest urban settlement was more constrained in areas of recent recolonization (2005 and 2016) and in the mountainous altitudinal range, likely due to a reduced availability of territories. We showed that wolves tend to keep as far away as possible from humans, but they can also permanently occupy human-dominated landscapes to cope with the lower availability of space induced by their remarkably successful recolonization. Our results shed light on an upcoming scenario for the conservation of large carnivores.

AB  - Studies assessing the effects of the spatial distribution of ant nests on ant-plant mutualisms are rare, even though they could be decisive to the outcomes of such interactions. Here, we investigated how ant nest abundance and richness affected a Neotropical plant with extrafloral nectaries (EFN), Smilax polyantha (Smilacaceae). We used baits to sample all nests of mutualistic ants within a 12 m radius of each plant. All neighbouring plants with EFN within 10 m of each tagged plant were also sampled. We measured foliar herbivory and fruit production of each S. polyantha. We hypothesized that (i) high numbers of ant nests near S. polyantha individuals would reduce foliar herbivory and increase fruit production, and that (ii) high ant nest richness would increase foliar herbivory and reduce fruit production. Results showed that plants surrounded by more ant nests had lower foliar herbivory and higher fruit production. However, ant nest richness was associated with higher foliar herbivory. Furthermore, plants producing more leaves and those surrounded by more neighbouring plants with EFN had reduced herbivory. Despite this, S. polyantha had low numbers of ant nests and reduced fruit production when surrounded by high numbers of neighbours with EFN. We suggest that the spatial distribution of ant nests and resources (plants with EFN) play an important role in ant-mediated mutualisms, where both ants and plants are likely competing for each other's services. Thus, incorporating these two variables in ecological models should provide insights into how protective mutualisms are structured.

AB  - Alpine grasslands are essential for carbon sequestration and food supply for domestic and wild herbivores inhabiting mountainous areas worldwide. These biomes, however, are alternatively threatened by the abandonment of agricultural and livestock practices leading to a fast-growing shrubification process while other mountain grasslands are suffering from the impacts of overgrazing. The functioning of alpine meadow ecosystems is primarily driven by climatic conditions, land-use legacies and grazing. However, although it is critically important, the role of large herbivores on the aboveground biomass and protein content of palatable plants is poorly understood for most alpine meadows. In this work, we explore the effects of grazing on grassland vegetation at two different spatial and temporal scales in the Eastern Pyrenees, Spain. Remote sensing was used to assess the effect of high and moderate grazing (HG and MG respectively) on grass biomass using the leaf area index (LAI) at the meso-scale (patches between 2.3 and 38.7 ha). We also explored the impact of null (NG), overgrazing (MO, mimicked overgrazing) and high (HG) grazing intensities at local scale setting eighteen 1 m2 exclusion boxes in six meadows (three boxes each) commonly used by domestic and wild ungulates. Historical satellite data showed that LAI values are greater in high than in low grazed areas (HG, mean = 0.66, LG, mean = 0.55). Along the same lines, high and moderate grazing pressures improved biomass production at the local-scale (HG, mean = 590.3 g/m(2), MO, mean = 389.3 g/m(2) and NG, mean = 110.8 g/m(2)). Crude protein content reached higher values under MO pressure than under HG pressure. Our results confirm that grazing intensity exerts significant changes on the above-ground biomass production and the protein content of plants consumed by domestic (cattle and horses) and wild ungulates (Southern Chamois, Rupicapra pyrenaica). We can conclude that ungulates sustain biomass and nutritive values of grass exerting a negligible effect on biomass and protein content of woody vegetation. Our results will inform management guidelines to support profitable grazing activities and promote conservation of the open landscapes in the alpine ecosystems under the current global change scenario.

AB  - Simple Summary Aerated burial systems involve slow air circulation within a mound, caused naturally or artificially. The weak airflow allows bacteria to work in an aerobic environment, accelerating the natural skeletonisation process. The main objective of this study was to document the decomposition level of an animal carcass in an aerated and watertight niche in a special epigean loculus. Pig carcasses (weighing approximately 70 kg each) were used as an experimental model for testing differences between the two systems. Each carcass was removed from the niches at predefined intervals, and the degree of decomposition and the presence of macrofauna were verified. The study examined if insects could colonise carcasses in the two burial systems to determine which fauna were present during the sampling dates. The possible existence of bacterial colonies was also assessed after five years. Our experiments showed that aerated burials facilitate skeletonisation similarly to watertight burial methods. Therefore, aerated burials are a viable alternative to watertight burials in terms of reducing both decomposition time and the costs of urban cemetery planning. It is also an alternative to interment in cemeteries where the soil cannot properly skeletonise. Aerated entombment applies to both hypogeum and epigean solutions. In recent years, burial systems have covered increasingly higher costs due to the pollution caused by decomposition products. These products are understood as chemicals and microorganisms in the surrounding soil and groundwater and represent a topical issue. The purpose of this research was to ascertain the extent of decomposition when pig carcasses are buried in two different burial systems ("aerated" vs. "watertight") and catalogue the arthropods associated with burials at different time-points of removal from niches (after 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months). Thirteen taxa were collected in aerated niches, whereas five were collected in watertight niches. The initial access or exclusion of insect colonisers affected overall functional activity. Two Diptera species, Hydrotaea capensis and Megaselia scalaris, were the most abundant, supporting the hypothesis that insects can colonise carcasses in aerated burial systems. Furthermore, some species of bacteria have been documented as facilitators of the initial decomposition process of the carcass. Most bacterial colonies develop only in aerated niches. The trial showed that the first enzymatic-bacterial and insect actions helped promote the process of cadaveric decomposition and later skeletonisation, mainly when associated with aeration modes of the tomb/mound. The results obtained provide essential information on the process of human decomposition and taphonomy in cemeteries. Moreover, these data could benefit forensic science by adding information on insect colonisation and body modification in medico-legal investigations concerning the post-mortem interval in exhumed bodies and illegal burials.

AB  - Wildlife management entails the manipulation of bottom-up and top-down forces that affect populations. For bear management in North America, both food availability (bottom-up) and hunting pressure (top-down) can limit population growth. Whereas seasonal and year-to-year variation in production of fruits and nuts (i.e., primary bear foods) has been widely recognized, long-term trends in natural food production have rarely been reported. Here we compared the current (2015-2019) availability of 18 fruits and nuts representing the main foods of American black bears (Ursus americanus) in north-central Minnesota to what was available three decades earlier (1980s) on the same study area. Timber harvesting was routine in the 1980s but less intensive in recent decades, prompting us to hypothesize that forests matured and consequently produced less fruit for bears due to increased shade. Within each of 12 forest types, we measured the abundance, productivity and biomass (kg/ha) of each fruit-bearing plant species using the same methodology as in the 1980s. Bootstrapped independent twosample t-tests identified species-specific changes in food availability between the two sampling periods. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to quantify changes for groups of fruit-producing species (i.e., summer/fall foods and short/tall shrubs). For all these groups, availability of the fruiting species changed little, but the probability of forest stands producing any fruit at all in the recent time period (-40%) was nearly half what it was in the 1980s (-80%). At the landscape scale, we estimated a -70% decline in fruit biomass. Our hypothesis that this decline was due to reduced timber harvesting and thus denser canopy was only partially correct, as we observed the same decline in fruit production within forests of the same type and canopy closure, and also along edges of stands with high light penetration. Decline in fruit availability was due more to a complete lack of production in some stands of the same type and age rather than to general forest maturation. We explored three alternate hypotheses to explain this decline: (1) change in weather (which could affect fruiting directly, or cause issues with pollination), (2) increase in invasive earthworms, and (3) increased deer browsing. None of these were completely consistent with our findings, although it appeared from the extreme spatial variability in fruit production that on-the-ground factors were more of a driving force than weather. The magnitude and complexity of this change in bottom-up forces is a serious issue for bear management.

AB  - The glacial cycles of the Quaternary heavily impacted species through successions of population contractions and expansions. Similarly, populations have been intensely shaped by human pressures such as unregulated hunting and land use changes. White-tailed and mule deer survived in different refugia through the Last Glacial Maximum, and their populations were severely reduced after the European colonization. Here, we analyzed 73 resequenced deer genomes from across their North American range to understand the consequences of climatic and anthropogenic pressures on deer demographic and adaptive history. We found strong signals of climate-induced vicariance and demographic decline; notably, multiple sequentially Markovian coalescent recovers a severe decline in mainland white-tailed deer effective population size (Ne) at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. We found robust evidence for colonial overharvest in the form of a recent and dramatic drop in Ne in all analyzed populations. Historical census size and restocking data show a clear parallel to historical Ne estimates, and temporal Ne/Nc ratio shows patterns of conservation concern for mule deer. Signatures of selection highlight genes related to temperature, including a cold receptor previously highlighted in woolly mammoth. We also detected immune genes that we surmise reflect the changing land use patterns in North America. Our study provides a detailed picture of anthropogenic and climatic-induced decline in deer diversity and clues to understanding the conservation concerns of mule deer and the successful demographic recovery of white-tailed deer.

AB  - Climate change has been shown to advance spring phenology, increase the number of insect generations per year (multivoltinism) and increase pathogen infection levels. However, we lack insights into the effects of plant spring phenology and the biotic environment on the preference and performance of multivoltine herbivores and whether such effects extend into the later part of the growing season. To this aim, we used a multifactorial growth chamber experiment to examine the influence of spring phenology on plant pathogen infection, and how the independent and interactive effects of spring phenology and plant pathogen infection affect the preference and performance of multigenerational attackers (the leaf miner Tischeria ekebladella and the aphid Tuberculatus annulatus) on the pedunculate oak in the early, mid and late parts of the plant growing season. Pathogen infection was highest on late phenology plants, irrespective of whether inoculations were conducted in the early, mid or late season. The leaf miner consistently preferred to oviposit on middle and late phenology plants, as well as healthy plants, during all parts of the growing season, whereas we detected an interactive effect between spring phenology and pathogen infection on the performance of the leaf miner. Aphids preferred healthy, late phenology plants during the early season, healthy plants during the mid season, and middle phenology plants during the late season, whereas aphid performance was consistently higher on healthy plants during all parts of the growing season. Our findings highlight that the impact of spring phenology on pathogen infection and the preference and performance of insect herbivores is not restricted to the early season, but that its imprint is still present - and sometimes equally strong - during the peak and end of the growing season. Plant pathogens generally negatively affected herbivore preference and performance, and modulated the effects of spring phenology. We conclude that spring phenology and pathogen infection are two important factors shaping the preference and performance of multigenerational plant attackers, which is particularly relevant given the current advance in spring phenology, pathogen outbreaks and increase in voltinism with climate change.

AB  - The ability to track animals with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars opened an enormous potential for studying animal movements and behaviour in their natural environment. One such endeavour is to identify clusters of GPS locations as a way to estimate predator kill rate. Clapp et al. (2021) developed an R package (GPSeqClus) to assess a location dataset based on user-defined parameters to identify clusters and their characteristics. These characteristics can then help to distinguish resting-site clusters from kill sites of their large (> 50 kg) prey.We identified location clusters of an adult male wolf Canis lupus on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada in July 2009 and tracked him until he died in April 2010. Identifying location clusters was challenging because the collar only obtained two GPS locations per day (12 h apart). In July 2010, we searched 30 of 52 location-clusters we identified as kill/scavenge sites and found 17 of them as such, given they had muskox Ovibos moschatus or caribou Rangifer tarandus pearyi remains nearby. We also documented five wolf rendezvous sites, two den sites, and the wolf's death site to total 60 location-clusters in all.We used a two-step process in testing the R Package GPSeqClus (hereafter GPSeqClus): (1) compare the number of clusters our method discerned with the number identified by the new algorithm, and (2) compare the number of biologically significant clusters (e.g. den sites, kill/feeding sites) we found with the number the new algorithm located. We made these tests with GPSeqClus by varying the search radius, number of days at a site, and minimum number of locations required for a cluster.GPSeqClus compared well to our technique, with the best sub-algorithm among the 25 we tested only missing three of our identified clusters and yielding six additional clusters. GPSeqClus identified 16 of the 17 confirmed sites of remains, all wolf home sites, and the wolf's carcass site. Identifying clusters using a 500-m search radius, a 1.5-day window, and a minimum of two GPS locations per cluster was suitable for a coarse GPS acquisition rate of two locations per day when prey are large, such as muskox or caribou.Given that GPSeqClus performed well with our coarse location dataset, we expect it will also perform even better with a collar acquiring more than two locations per day. Having a field-tested utility such as GPSeqClus will enhance carnivore predation studies elsewhere.

AB  - The adaptability of herbivorous insects to toxic plant defense compounds is partly related to the structure of the gut microbiome. To overcome plant resistance, the insect gut microbiome should respond to a wide range of allelochemicals derived from dietary niches. Nevertheless, for sibling herbivorous insect species, whether the gut microbiome contributes to success in food niche competition is unclear. Based on 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing, the gut microbiomes of two Apriona species that share the same food niche were investigated in this study to determine whether the gut microbiome contributes to insect success in food-niche competition. Our observations indicated that the gut microbiome tended to play a part in host niche competition between the two Apriona species. The gut microbiome of Apriona swainsoni had many enriched pathways that can help degrade plant toxic secondary compounds, including xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism, terpenoid and polyketide metabolism, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Meanwhile, A. swainsoni hosted a much greater variety of microorganisms and had more viable bacteria than A. germari. We conclude that gut microbes may influence the coevolution of herbivores and host plants. Gut bacteria may not only serve to boost nutritional relationships, but may also play an important role in insect food niche competition.

AB  - Projecting the consequences of warming and sea-ice loss for Arctic marine food web and fisheries is challenging due to the intricate relationships between biology and ice. We used StrathE2EPolar, an end-to-end (microbes-to-megafauna) food web model incorporating ice-dependencies to simulate climate-fisheries interactions in the Barents Sea. The model was driven by output from the NEMO-MEDUSA earth system model, assuming RCP 8.5 atmospheric forcing. The Barents Sea was projected to be > 95% ice-free all year-round by the 2040s compared to > 50% in the 2010s, and approximately 2 degrees C warmer. Fisheries management reference points (F-MSY and B-MSY) for demersal fish (cod, haddock) were projected to increase by around 6%, indicating higher productivity. However, planktivorous fish (capelin, herring) reference points were projected to decrease by 15%, and upper trophic levels (birds, mammals) were strongly sensitive to planktivorous fish harvesting. The results indicate difficult trade-offs ahead, between harvesting and conservation of ecosystem structure and function.

AB  - A link between diet and avian intestinal anatomy is generally assumed. We collated the length of intestinal sections and body mass of 390 bird species and tested relationships with diet, climate and locomotion. There was a strong phylogenetic signal in all datasets. The total and small intestine scaled more-than-geometrically (95%CI of the scaling exponent > 0.33). The traditional dietary classification (faunivore, omnivore and herbivore) had no significant effect on total intestine (TI) length. Significant dietary proxies included %folivory, %frugi-nectarivory and categories (frugi-nectarivory, granivory, folivory, omnivory, insectivory and vertivory). Individual intestinal sections were affected by different dietary proxies. The best model indicates that higher consumption of fruit and nectar, drier habitats, and a high degree of flightedness are linked to shorter TI length. Notably, the length of the avian intestine depends on other biological factors as much as on diet. Given the weak dietary signal in our datasets, the diet intestinal length relationships lend themselves to narratives of flexibility (morphology is not destiny) rather than of distinct adaptations that facilitate using one character (intestine length) as proxy for another (diet). Birds have TIs of about 85% that of similar-sized mammals, corroborating systematic differences in intestinal macroanatomy between vertebrate clades.

AB  - Hunting impacts tropical vertebrate populations, causing declines of species that function as seed dispersers and predators, or that browse seedlings and saplings. Whether and how the resulting reductions in seed dispersal, seed predation, and browsing translate to changes in the tree composition is poorly understood. Here, we assess the effect of defaunation on the functional composition of communities of tree recruits in tropical rainforests in French Guiana. We selected eight sites along a gradient of defaunation, caused by differences in hunting pressure, in otherwise intact old-growth forests in French Guiana. We measured shifts in functional composition by comparing leaf and fruit traits and wood density between tree recruits (up to 5 cm diameter at breast height) and adults, and tested whether and how these compositional shifts related to defaunation. We found a positive relationship with defaunation for shifts in specific leaf area, a negative relationship for shifts of leaf toughness and wood density, and a weak relationship for shifts in fruit traits. Our results suggest that the loss of vertebrates affects ecological processes such as seed dispersal and browsing, of which browsing remains understudied. Even though these changes sometimes seem minor, together they result in major shifts in forest composition. These changes have long-term ramifications that may alter forest dynamics for generations.

AB  - Species with fission-fusion social organization, where groups break apart and merge over time, show variable subgroup stability. Plains bison (Bison bison bison (Linnaeus, 1758)), a keystone species in North American grasslands, exhibit fission- fusion dynamics. However, it is unclear whether subgroups are stable over time nor whether they are composed of related individuals. We used fine-scale behavioral observations and movement data from GPS ear tags to construct social networks for two plains bison herds over multiple years at American Prairie in north-central Montana. These herds are semi-free roaming and graze year-round in 32.4 and 111.6 km2 fenced pastures. While the bison in our study did exhibit fission-fusion behavior, we did not observe stable subgroups in time-aggregated social networks constructed over single growing seasons (eigenvector modularity ranged from -0.008 to 0.027). We used Mantel tests to assess the relationships between association strength and relatedness, age, and place of origin. We found that only first-order relatives were more likely to associate, and shared age and place of origin had no significant impact. The observed lack of stable subgroups challenges prevailing assumptions and highlights the need for future research into the mechanisms of fission-fusion dynamics in plains bison and other managed social species.

AB  - Background and Aims The defensive role of spines has previously been related to leaves, young shoots and reproductive organs. However, some woody species harbour spines on their trunks where none of those organs are present. Several explanations are plausible: they could be (1) climbing aids, (2) remnants from defence of leaves or reproductive organs during an earlier development phase, or (3) an as-yet undescribed defence. Here we investigate whether they could play a role against either bark feeding or preventing climbing animals accessing food resources in the tree canopy. Methods We described 31 woody species with spines on their trunk, growing in a botanical garden, to test whether morphological strategies could be identified and suggest what could be their most likely function. As testing their function is difficult experimentally for large pools of species, we performed virtual experiments to evaluate the potential roles of trunk spines against bark removal and climbing animals of different sizes. We then compared for each species and their confamilial non-spiny species the nutritional profiles of leaf, bark and reproductive organs to test whether trunk spines were associated with a nutritious organ (more likely targeted by herbivores). Key Results We identified four morphological syndromes of trunk spines. Two corresponded to already known functions (anchorage for lianas and crown defence against large ground mammals), and two strategies are newly described trait syndromes with traits suggesting a defence against bark feeding and climbing mammals. By simulation, we show how each strategy could translate into defence against debarking and prevent herbivores from climbing. Conclusions We identified trunk spine strategies and the criteria to classify them, their most likely function and the likely feeding mode and size of animal against which different trunk spine strategies may be effective. We discuss further perspectives for testing their function and their ecological significance.

AB  - Understanding how megaherbivores incorporate habitat features into their foraging behavior is key toward understanding how herbivores shape the surrounding landscape. While the role of habitat structure has been studied within the context of predator-prey dynamics and grazing behavior in terrestrial systems, there is a limited understanding of how structure influences megaherbivore grazing in marine ecosystems. To investigate the response of megaherbivores (green turtles) to habitat features, we experimentally introduced structure at two spatial scales in a shallow seagrass meadow in The Bahamas. Turtle density increased 50-fold (to 311 turtles ha(-1)) in response to the structures, and turtles were mainly grazing and resting (low vigilance behavior). This resulted in a grazing patch exceeding the size of the experimental setup (242 m(2)), with reduced seagrass shoot density and aboveground biomass. After structure removal, turtle density decreased and vigilance increased (more browsing and shorter surfacing times), while seagrass within the patch partly recovered. Even at a small scale (9 m(2)), artificial structures altered turtle grazing behavior, resulting in grazing patches in 60% of the plots. Our results demonstrate that marine megaherbivores select habitat features as foraging sites, likely to be a predator refuge, resulting in heterogeneity in seagrass bed structure at the landscape scale.

AB  - Introduction Water depth (WD) and snail abundance (SA) are two key factors affecting the growth of submersed aquatic plants in freshwater lake ecosystems. Changes in WD and SA drive changes in nutrients and other primary producers that may have direct or indirect effects on submersed plant growth, but which factor dominates the impact of both on aquatic plants has not been fully studied.Methods To investigate the dominant factors that influence aquatic plant growth in plateau lakes, a one-year field study was conducted to study the growth of three dominant submersed macrophyte (i.e., Vallisneria natans, Potamogeton maackianus, and Potamogeton lucens) in Erhai Lake.Results The results show that, the biomass of the three dominant plants, P.maackianus, is the highest, followed by P.lucens, and V.natans is the lowest. Meanwhile, periphyton and snails attached to P.maackianus are also the highest. Furthermore, WD had a positive effect on the biomass of two submersed macrophyte species of canopy-type P.maackianus and P.lucens, while it had a negative effect on rosette-type V.natans. Snail directly inhibited periphyton attached on V.natans and thereby increasing the biomass of aquatic plants, but the effect of snails on the biomass of the other two aquatic plants is not through inhibition of periphyton attached to their plants.Discussion The dominant factors affecting the biomass of submersed macrophyte in Erhai Lake were determined, as well as the direct and indirect mechanisms of WD and snails on the biomass of dominant submersed macrophyte. Understanding the mechanisms that dominate aquatic plant change will have implications for lake management and restoration.

AB  - Accelerating levels of human-elephant conflicts (HEC) have become a topic of major concern in conservation efforts of endangered Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) throughout their range. Wayanad plateau (WP) is a key summer habitat of Asian elephants in the Brahmagri-Nilgiri Eastern Ghats elephant landscape (Nilgiris), harbouring the largest breeding population in Asia. With the increase in human population density and consequent forest loss, HEC amplified in frequency and intensity in Wayanad. We assessed the drivers of HEC in a temporal and spatial context by integrating questionnaire surveys, compensation claims for crop loss, and individual identification of crop-raiding elephants. The ordinal regression analysis showed that season and proximity to the forest boundary were the major drivers of conflict. The pattern of conflict is spatially heterogeneous, and there is peak crop depredation during the jackfruit and mango season (MayS-September), followed by paddy season (September-December). The conflict has resulted in the removal of jackfruit and mango trees from farmlands and stopped cultivation of several crops that attract elephants. This has impacted rural food supply, economic well-being, local biodiversity, and human-elephant coexistence. We discuss effective and locally appropriate conflict mitigation and management strategies which can apply in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - The global transition to renewable energy has large land requirements that can impact local wildlife populations. A clear understanding of whether, or to what degree, wildlife avoid utility-scale solar energy (USSE) development is critical for effective mitigation and planning. This is particularly important for ungulates and other large mammals that cannot move through USSE perimeter fences and instead, rely on design-based mitigation measures (e.g. movement corridors) to minimize impacts and retain connectivity. Using a suite of complementary metrics and fine-scale global positioning system (GPS) data collected 6 months before and 5 years after development, we found multiple lines of evidence that non-migratory pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) avoid USSE. Absent avoidance behaviours, we expected pronghorn use to be similar during pre- and post-construction periods. Yet, we found weekly encounter rates along the USSE perimeter were more than 3x lower after construction. The pattern of less pronghorn use near the USSE extended >1 km. For example, 10% of all pre-construction GPS locations occurred within 0.75 km of the USSE, but the distance needed to contain a similar proportion of locations after construction ranged from 1.65 to 1.75 km. Relatedly, the amount of high-use pronghorn habitat surrounding the USSE declined after development, with the steepest declines (40%-60%) occurring within 1 km of the solar site. When key environmental covariates were accounted for in a resource selection framework, pronghorn preferred to use habitats near the location of the USSE prior to construction, but following construction probability of use was highest at 1.50 km away from the USSE. Practical implication. The direct loss of habitat and reduced connectivity associated with USSE pose serious challenges for ungulate populations. Our results suggest avoidance behaviours could exacerbate the impacts to ungulates through indirect habitat loss and potentially complicate the effectiveness of design-based mitigation measures that assume animals will readily utilize habitats adjacent to USSE.

AB  - Glycolysis in follicular granulosa cells (GCs) is the primary source of energy metabolism substrate of oocytes and is closely related to follicular development in mammals. Many physiological functions of GCs are regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In contrast, whether FSH regulates the glycolysis of GCs and its mechanism remains unclear. This study explored the correlation between FSH concentration and glycolysis level of GCs from different diameters of water buffalo follicles, and further explored the mechanism of FSH regulation in glycolysis in vitro cultured GCs. Results showed the variation trend of lactic acid concentration in follicular fluid and the expression level of glycolysis-related genes in GCs were consistent with the variation trend of FSH concentration in follicular fluid from follicles with different diameters. When GCs were treated with FSH in vitro, the expression level of glycolysis-related genes, lactate production and glucose uptake increased correspondingly (p < .05). Furthermore, we found that expression trend of AMPK/Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) pathway-related genes in GCs was consistent with the expression trend of glycolysis-related genes and was positively correlated with FSH concentrations in vivo or cultured in vitro. Activation of SIRT1 increased the expression level of glycolytic key proteins and lactic acid production in GCs, while inhibition of SIRT1 showed the opposite effect. In general, glycolysis in water buffalo GCs in vivo or cultured in vitro was positively correlated with FSH concentration. AMPK/SIRT1 pathway plays an important role in the regulation of FSH on glycolysis in GCs. Our findings will enrich the understanding of FSH regulating the development of water buffalo follicles.

AB  - Understanding the diurnal and nocturnal activity of organisms is a key topic in behavioral ecology, with implications for population structure and management strategies. In reef systems, parrotfishes play crucial roles as nominal herbivores, but overfishing has led to population collapses with detrimental effects on reef functions. Parrotfish are good models to study diel rhythms, as they are often easily observed while sleeping at night. We assessed the distribution, sleeping substrate selectivity and sleeping areas of parrotfishes during the night in a subtropical rocky reef of the Southwestern Atlantic. We performed replicated visual censuses (50 x 2 m) at different depths to estimate parrotfish abundance, while quantifying the structural complexity of sleeping sites. Among the seven recorded parrotfish species, we focused on the four most abundant to determine their sleeping habitat selectivity. Active telemetry was used for the two most abundant species to define their sleeping site areas and sleeping hotspots. All four species exhibited a preference for sediment as a sleeping substrate, while avoiding zoanthids. Species distribution was influenced by depth, with Scarus zelindae predominantly sleeping in high-complexity substrate at intermediate depths and Sparisoma tuiupiranga sleeping in the rock-sand interface at deeper depths. Tagged Sparisoma axillare and Sparisoma frondosum exhibited similar sleeping areas in terms of size and geographical locations; showing high site fidelity, they returned to the same sleeping sites over consecutive nights. These results represent the first assessment of parrotfish distribution and habitat use at night in the Atlantic. This information is crucial for guiding management actions, particularly in the planning of no-take zones for fishing control and population recovery.

AB  - Infectious disease dynamics operate across biological scales: pathogens replicate within hosts but transmit among populations. Functional changes in the pathogen-host interaction thus generate cascading effects across organizational scales. We investigated within-host dynamics and among-host transmission of three strains (SAT-1, -2, -3) of foot- and-mouth disease viruses (FMDVs) in their wildlife host, African buffalo. We combined data on viral dynamics and host immune responses with mathematical models to ask the following questions: How do viral and immune dynamics vary among strains? Which viral and immune parameters determine viral fitness within hosts? And how do within-host dynamics relate to virus transmission? Our data reveal contrasting withinhost dynamics among viral strains, with SAT-2 eliciting more rapid and effective immune responses than SAT-1 and SAT-3. Within-host viral fitness was overwhelmingly determined by variation among hosts in immune response activation rates but not by variation among individual hosts in viral growth rate. Our analyses investigating across-scale linkages indicate that viral replication rate in the host correlates with transmission rates among buffalo and that adaptive immune activation rate determines the infectious period. These parameters define the virus's relative basic reproductive number (R0), suggesting that viral invasion potential may be predictable from within-host dynamics.

AB  - Strandings of marine mammals, seabirds, and marine turtles in coastal areas can provide valuable information on their ecology. However, gathering information by field teams often incur high costs and effort. This study evaluated the effectiveness of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to detect stranded animals during beach monitoring programs. The study was carried out between 2016 and 2017 evaluating factors related to the UAV (height and camera angle) and the beach (morphology). Data obtained from the UAV was compared with the traditional method of in situ teams. A total of 120 aerial surveys were conducted on four beaches on the coast of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Eighteen carcasses were recorded by both methods, traditional methodology and UAV. However, six other events were only recorded by in situ monitoring (traditional method) and one event recorded only by the UAV. The time interval between the beach monitoring by the two strategies is probably responsible for the differences. Despite obtaining high-quality aerial images and easily identifying strandings, the UAV cannot completely replace the traditional method due mainly to the impossibility to fly in adverse weather conditions such as high winds and rain. On the other hand, UAVs can complement the data collection information, with less consumption of fossil fuels and damage to the coastal environment.

AB  - How does climate control river chemistry? Existing literature has examined extensively the response of river chemistry to short-term weather conditions from event to seasonal scales. Patterns and drivers of long-term, baseline river chemistry have remained poorly understood. Here we compile and analyze chemistry data from 506 minimally impacted rivers (412,801 data points) in the contiguous United States (CAMELS-Chem) to identify patterns and drivers of river chemistry. Despite distinct sources and diverse reaction characteristics, a universal pattern emerges for 16 major solutes at the continental scale. Their long-term mean concentrations (C-m) decrease with mean discharge (Q(m)), with elevated concentrations in arid climates and lower concentrations in humid climates, indicating overwhelming regulation by climate compared to local Critical Zone characteristics such as lithology and topography. To understand the C(m)Q(m) pattern, a parsimonious watershed reactor model was solved by bringing together hydrology (storage-discharge relationship) and biogeochemical reaction theories from traditionally separate disciplines. The derivation of long-term, steady state solutions lead to a power law form of C(m)Q(m) relationships. The model illuminates two competing processes that determine mean solute concentrations: solute production by subsurface biogeochemical and chemical weathering reactions, and solute export (or removal) by mean discharge, the water flushing capacity dictated by climate and vegetation. In other words, watersheds function primarily as reactors that produce and accumulate solutes in arid climates, and as transporters that export solutes in humid climates. With space-for-time substitution, these results indicate that in places where river discharge dwindles in a warming climate, solute concentrations will elevate even without human perturbation, threatening water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Water quality deterioration therefore should be considered in the global calculation of future climate risks.

AB  - Effects of environmental change on plants can differ due to sequential changes in their life-history strategies (i.e., ontogenetic variations). The fitness of herbivorous insects by physiological changes of the host plant could be affected depending on their diet breadth. However, little is known regarding the combinational effects of plant ontogeny and climate change on plant-herbivore interactions. This study examined the plant ontogeny-dependent effects of climate change on the interaction between a host plant (Aristolochia contorta), its specialist herbivore (Sericinus montela), and a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera exigua). Plants were grown under a factorial design of two distinct CO2 concentrations (ambient, 400 ppm; elevated, 560 ppm) and two watering frequencies (control, once a week; increased, twice a week). Plant ontogeny ameliorated the effects of climate change by altering its defensive traits, where nutrient-related factors were cumulatively affected by climate change. Herbivore performance was assessed at three different plant ontogenetic stages (1st-year juvenile, 1st-year senescence, and 2nd-year juvenile). Elevated CO2 levels reduced the growth and survival of the specialist herbivore, whereas increased watering frequency partially alleviated this reduced performance. Generalist herbivore performance slightly increased under elevated CO2 levels with progressing ontogenetic stages. The effects of climate change, both elevated CO2 and increased watering frequency were weaker in 2nd-year juveniles than in 1st-year juveniles. Elevated CO2 levels detrimentally affected the nutritional quality of A. contorta leaves. The effects of climate change on both specialist and generalist herbivore performance differed as plant ontogenetic stage proceeded. Increased growth rates and survival of the generalist herbivore at the latter ontogenetic stage might negatively affect the population dynamics of a specialist herbivore. This study suggests that biases are possible when the plant herbivore interaction under a changing environment is predicted from a singular plant ontogenetic stage.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a growing phenomenon threatening the world's natural ecosystems. ALAN has received a lot of attention in relation to many different taxa. However, comparatively little is known about how ALAN affects plant growth, fitness and physiology, and how this alters interactions in the phytobiome food web. There is a lot of evidence for involvement of light cycles and light quality in plant growth and physiological processes, including seasonal timing and defense regulation. Surprisingly, however, only very few studies have investigated how ALAN, typically light of low density and occurring at night, affects plant-mediated interactions. A handful of studies describe bottom-up and top-down effects in plant-aphid-parasitoid systems, pollinator responses and effects on ground-dwelling nocturnal organisms. How herbivores of other feeding guilds are impacted is not clear. Importantly, very little is known about how ALAN may impact mutualistic and antagonistic associations with the plant microbiome, above-and belowground. In this Invited View, I synthesize what is known about effects of ALAN on plants and plant-mediated interactions. I identify several key knowledge gaps that exist in the literature and discuss areas that need future attention. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Zoysia japonica, a low growing grass, is tolerant to grazing and trampling. Kinkazan Island in northern Japan is inhabited by sika deer (Cervus nippon). The deer population increased in the 1970s at a shrine garden in the western part of the island, leading to expansion of Zoysia swards around the shrine garden and their colonization of remote open patches. The expansion around the garden is due to elongation of the rhizome, but expansion to remote places may be due to endozoochory by deer. This appears to be a good example of the "foliage is the fruit" hypothesis (the FF hypothesis) proposed by Janzen (1984; American Naturalist 123:338-353). To demonstrate this, we confirmed the expansion of the Zoysia swards and tested the traits of Zoysia by field surveys and indoor experiments. The Zoysia peduncles stood among the leaves, and sika deer fed on both the seeds and leaves. One deer fecal pellet contained about 20 seeds at its peak in June. In the feeding experiment, the survival rate through digestion was 38%. In the greenhouse experiment, the germination rate was 72%. An outdoor experiment showed that germination rates of the ingested seeds were 5% in a dark habitat and 58% in a bright habitat. Zoysia exhibited many of the traits presented by the FF hypothesis, and sika deer functioned as seed dispersal agents. Therefore, the Zoysia-sika deer relationship seems to support the FF hypothesis.

AB  - Assessing local anthropogenic impacts on tropical forest wildlife is central to conservation science in low-governance regions, particularly in the context of community-based resource management. Two methods frequently used to sample wildlife are based on local ecological knowledge (LEK), which is low cost and draws on substantial human experience, and camera trap sampling (CT), which is widely used due to its spatial replicability and the increasing diversity of analytical frameworks. We compared the effectiveness of both methods in assessing the impact of hunting on wildlife at 70 local community catchments across the Brazilian Amazon. We did this by assessing local occurrences of 17 focal species as recounted by 187 subsistence hunters in interviews and by assessing data from 631 CT deployments. We evaluated correlations among the distances from the nearest community at which species and species groups occurred, derived from either LEK or CT data. We also assessed how species' morphological and socioecological traits influenced estimates derived from LEK and CT. Estimates derived from LEK were more strongly correlated with species abundance than with occupancy estimates. Large-bodied, harvest-sensitive species, such as tapir (Tapirus terrestris), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), and curassow (Crax or Pauxi spp.), were spatially depleted more than 15 km away from human communities. These species showed particularly strong positive correlations across all estimates. The precision of LEK estimates increased with independent data on local game species abundance. These results underline the utility of data derived from LEK in assessing patterns of local wildlife abundance, especially for large-bodied species sensitive to hunting pressure. Local ecological knowledge-based methods are valuable in their own right, especially in areas where alternative sampling methods are lacking and human impact is not matched by conservation efforts.

AB  - Landscape-scale footprints of behavioural interactions between predators and prey can offer a window into the ecological dynamics of entire ecosystems. In coral reefs, a promising example of this phenomenon includes reef halos, which are bare patches of sand surrounding patch reefs. Reef halos form where the presence of predators restricts herbivory and other foraging activities to close proximity of shelter. Additionally, reef halos persist from year-to-year, are more prevalent in reefs with ostensibly intact predator populations, and are easily measured using satellite imagery. However, the stability of reef halos over short-term (i.e. monthly) scales and how they respond to environmental factors, has yet to be rigorously explored in coral reefs. Here, we used a remote sensing approach to investigate the magnitude of reef halo size fluctuations over time in the Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, relative to a suite of environmental factors. Although reef halos appear to be a permanent feature of the seascape, the size of individual reef halos fluctuated widely over monthly scales, declining as sea surface temperature and regional upwelling (a proxy for nutrient delivery) increased. We did not find a relationship between halo prevalence and management zone, fish biomass, or patch reef area, which is inconsistent with studies of reef halo formation in other locations. Unravelling this discrepancy with the broader literature will require an in situ experimental approach. Overall, our results demonstrate that single snapshots in time of reef halo size may not be sufficient to yield accurate signals regarding interactions between predators, herbivores, and vegetation.

AB  - Simple Summary Due to the lack of water resources in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the abundance of fish resources could be higher, and background research on fishes is rare. The current status of downstream fishery resources can be clarified by investigating fish resources in the lower Yellow River in the past four years. A total of 54 fish species were found in the downstream waters during the survey, with the recovery of populations and abundance of major economic fish, common small-sized fish, and endangered fish. By comparing and analyzing the current status of fish resources in various downstream survey sections, it was found that the confluence of Dongping Lake into the Yellow River has the highest number of fish species, which means that this water area is the most essential habitat for fish in the lower Yellow River. To protect downstream fishery resources, key protection measures should be taken for this habitat in the future.Abstract In order to study the community of fishery resources, five sampling sections were set up in the lower Yellow River from 2019 to 2022 to investigate the diversity of fishery resources. A total of 54 fish species were identified in the survey, belonging to 9 orders, 19 families, and 48 genera. The number of species reached its highest level since the Integrated Water Regulation of the Lower Yellow River in 1999. The original rare and endangered fish species in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, such as Coilia nasus, Rhinogobio nasutus, and Pseudobagrus ussuriensis, have reappeared in the lower reaches. The population and abundance of main economic fish and common small-sized fish in the lower reaches of the Yellow River have increased. These signs all indicate that, and the fishery resources are recovering slowly in the lower Yellow River. By comparing the fish resources of various investigation sections, it was found that there are differences in fish diversity: the closer to the estuarine waters, the higher the variety of fish in the Yellow River at the upper level of the taxonomic category. However, that section of the lower Yellow River where species evenness, species diversity, and community structure of fishery resources were most stable was the confluence of Dongping Lake into the Yellow River, which has the most significant number of fish species, the smallest Lambda+ value, and the most extensive G-F index. The above results indicate that Dongping Lake, as the only lake connected to the lower reaches of the Yellow River, plays an essential role in replenishing fish resources in the lower reaches of the Yellow River.

AB  - Aim Latitudinal clines in dietary specialization and range size are used to explain biodiversity distributions at large spatial scales, such as the latitudinal diversity gradient. The aim of this study was to test whether dietary breadth (as a dimension of niche breadth) and range size decrease towards lower latitudes in a species-rich clade of herbivorous insects as predicted by the latitude-niche breadth hypothesis and Rapoport's rule, respectively. We also aimed to study whether these species characteristics are positively linked with each other as stated by the niche breadth-range size hypothesis. Location Europe (35-71 degrees N). Time period Present-day. Major taxa Geometrid moths (Lepidoptera: Geometridae). Methods For every species, we compiled information on latitudinal distribution and host-plant use based on available literature and online sources. We estimated the level of fundamental dietary specialization of each species while accounting for phylogenetic relationships among the host plants used. We also reconstructed a phylogeny including all studied moth taxa, in order to control for phylogenetic dependence in species characteristics. Phylogenetic least squares (PGLS) analyses were used to test each of our hypotheses. Results We analysed 631 species of geometrids (85.2% of taxa within the biogeographical region) and found strong support for the latitude-niche breadth hypothesis and for Rapoport's rule. Fundamental dietary breadth was also found to be positively related to latitudinal range size, which supports the niche breadth-range size hypothesis. These results were retained when the subfamilies Ennominae and Larentiinae were analysed separately. Main conclusions Our findings indicate that latitudinal clines in range size and fundamental dietary breadth covary in European geometrid moths and are likely to be drivers of increased species richness towards lower latitudes. This supports the idea that both characteristics should be studied simultaneously in order to unveil mechanisms structuring biodiversity patterns at the macroecological scale.

AB  - Coral reefs have undergone drastic declines due to anthropogenic and natural disturbances. In response, restoration efforts were developed to recover lost ecosystem services. Restoration in the Caribbean has focused almost exclusively on branching Acropora but declines of corals with massive morphologies highlight the need to develop a multi-species approach. Recent studies have reported high mortality rates (> 50%) of outplanted fragments of massive coral taxa because of predation by fish, creating a restoration bottleneck. We conducted targeted experiments aimed at mitigating predation and understanding factors driving fish predation impacts on fragments of Orbicella faveolata. Fragment mortality due to predation was extremely high (> 80% average across all experiments). By limiting physical access to newly outplanted corals, Acropora cervicornis proved to be an effective predator deterrent, providing a predation refuge for susceptible species like O. faveolata. Protecting outplanted corals using metal spikes and cages was effective at reducing predation impacts while protection remained in place, but benefits declined immediately after barrier removal, with predation causing an average of 84% mortality one week after removal. We identified a size threshold where larger colonies (25 cm(2)) are less susceptible to predation than smaller corals (5 cm(2)). Coral genotype influenced predation impacts, with the most susceptible coral genotype experiencing 86% mortality compared to the least susceptible genotype experiencing 29% mortality after 4 weeks. The genotype most impacted by predation had significantly higher lipid and protein content, suggesting prey selectivity by fish may be driven by coral tissue characteristics. Fish impacts were driven by consumption activities and not the removal or targeting of "novel" objects within parrotfish territories as dead coral controls were not impacted while adjacent live corals experienced 100% mortality. These results suggest that outplanting genotypically diverse assemblages of large, massive morphology fragments in combination with fast growing, branching species, and utilizing physical barriers will limit predation impacts and improve the efficiency of reef restoration activities.

AB  - Weather conditions, such as temperature and precipitation, likely influence white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) activity and hunter participation, both of which are major factors contributing to deer harvest. Because harvest is often used to manage white-tailed deer population trends and guide management decisions, understanding how certain abiotic factors may bias such data is important. We examined the effects of weather on deer harvest during the Iowa, USA, firearms seasons from 2006-2021 using a generalized mixed-effects linear model. Weather conditions during the hunting season were related to overall deer harvest. Specifically, deer harvest was positively correlated with snowfall on opening day and negatively correlated with average minimum temperature, average snow depth, rainfall on opening day, and number of rainfall and snowfall days. Abiotic factors have the ability to substantially influence deer harvest. Because many white-tailed deer population models use harvest data, incorporating the effects of weather variability into such models may substantially improve population estimates. Our study provides a compelling case for considering hunting season weather conditions when interpreting harvest data as a population index for white-tailed deer. The results of this study also demonstrate potential for retrospective modeling of past harvest rates and incorporating the effects of abiotic factors on harvest into future age-based population models.

AB  - This study evaluate the effects of four organic soil amendments on soil. Physical, chemical and biochemical properties were compared to untreated and natural (not cultivated) soils in a semiarid region (Andalusia, Spain). A large set of physical, chemical biochemical properties and, the composition of bacterial communities; and overall soil quality index (SQI) were evaluated on soils treated with organic soil amendments of animal origin (compost from sheep and cow manure [CS] or chicken manure, [CK], vegetal origin (greenhouse crop residues [CC]), and vermicompost (CV). Immediately after application, the animal origin compost significantly increased pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and total nitrogen (TN) as well as the enzymatic activities associated with the carbon (C) cycle but decreased the richness and evenness of bacterial communities. After 3 months of treatment, all measured properties recovered except for EC, TN and dehydrogenase activity (whose increase was stable over time), as did bacterial richness, which remained lower. The vegetal-originating compost increased EC and pH whereas the other effects were not significant throughout the monitoring period. CV application did not affect soil properties. The SQI was the highest for soils treated with CK compost, both immediately after application and over time. The soil treatments with the other organic amendments did not result in a significantly different SQI over time compared to both untreated and natural sites.

AB  - Teat number is an important economic trait in pigs, affecting piglet health and survival. While numerous GWAS have identified candidate genes for teat number in Duroc, Landrace, and Large White pigs, the causal genes remain unclear, largely due to a lack of transcriptional and epigenetic studies on mammary placodes in 26-day-old pig embryos, a critical stage for teat formation. Erhualian and Bamaxiang pigs, derived from Chinese wild boars, serve as ideal models for studying genetic variation in teat number, with Erhualian averaging nearly 20 teats and Bamaxiang around 10. This study collected mammary placodes from these breeds at embryonic day 26 and performed ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to explore chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Results indicate widespread chromatin accessibility across mammary placodes. Of the 30,806 open chromatin regions (OCRs) identified, only 30 showed breed-specific differences, suggesting conserved accessibility patterns across breeds. OCRs are enriched in intergenic and promoter regions, and significantly overlap with QTL intervals for teat number. RNA-seq revealed 4432 differentially expressed genes between the two breeds, including WTN10B and WNT6, indicating breed-specific gene expression patterns. Combining ATAC-seq and RNA-seq results identified three protein-coding genes (ENSSSCG00000031037, ENSSSCG00000032042, and ENSSSCG00000039180) near 48.80 Mb on SSC14 that are associated with teat number according to pheWAS and GWAS data. FISH analysis confirmed that ENSSSCG00000031037 is specifically expressed in epithelial cells of mammary placodes, and this region is under stronger selection in Erhualian pigs, suggesting its role in the breed's higher teat number. In conclusion, this study integrates ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to construct a chromatin accessibility and gene expression map of pig mammary placodes. It identifies ENSSSCG00000031037, ENSSSCG00000032042, and ENSSSCG00000039180 as key candidate genes driving teat number differences, providing insights for understanding QTL intervals and identifying causal genes linked to teat number in pigs.

AB  - In the past 10 years, the level of heavy metals has sharply increased in the Jiangxigou farm in the Qinghai Lake basin, which has seriously affected the health of Przewalski's gazelle. Nano-potassium molybdate (nano-K2MoO4), as a new nano-fertilizer, has been applied in agriculture. To study the effect of applying different levels of nano-K2MoO4 fertilization (8 kg/hm(2), group I; 9 kg/hm(2), group II; 10 kg/hm(2), group III) on preventing heavy metal toxicity in Przewalski's gazelle. The samples of soil, forage, and animal tissues were collected for testing heavy metals and mineral contents, oxidative stress, and blood indexes. The empirical findings showed that the contents of selenium (Se) and copper (Cu) in the tested forage were significantly higher than those in the control group (p<0.01). The levels of Cu and lead (Pb) in the blood and liver of the tested Przewalski's gazelles were remarkably higher than those in the control animals (p < 0.01), but the levels of molybdenum (Mo) and Pb were remarkably lower than those in the control animals (p < 0.01). The levels of hemoglobin (Hb), platelets (PLT), and red blood cells (RBC) in the tested Przewalski's gazelles were remarkably higher than those in the control animals (p<0.01). The enzymatic activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the serum of the tested Przewalski's gazelles exhibited a significant increase in comparison to the control animals (p<0.01), but the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) was lower than that in the control animals (p<0.01). In summary, the application of nano-K2MoO4 not only significantly improved the antioxidant capacity and alleviated effectively the anemia symptoms of Przewalski's gazelle, but also reduced the heavy-metal toxicity of Przewalski's gazelle in the fertilization areas.

AB  - Changes in topography, such as terrain elevation and slope, are an important source of landscape complexity influencing the ecology of animals, particularly in mountainous landscapes. In such landscapes animals navigate changes in elevation and slope in their daily movement. Despite the importance of topographic variation, studies of animal ecology in mountainous landscapes tend not to explicitly consider those effects on species detection. We deployed a broad-extent, coarse resolution camera-trapping system across a landscape with considerable complexity and quantified the influence of topographic variables on detection probability conditional on occurrence for multiple mammal species. Specifically, we examined the fine-scale effects of terrain steepness and topographic position (i.e. ridges, mid-slopes or valleys) on detection probability for 14 mammal species at camera-traps. We found that detection probability increased on gently sloping terrain for six species and decreased on the steepest slopes sampled for three of these species and three additional species. Among four other mammal species, detection probability changed according to local topographic position though the directionality of these responses varied among these species. Several species, primarily meso-carnivores as well as larger-bodied species, like mule deer and black bears, were more detectable on gentle slopes than flat terrain. This pattern suggests that many species may use moderately steep terrain for the resources or heterogeneity they provide. Topographic position had comparatively less effect on species detection probabilities, suggesting that this variable does not have a strong effect on fine-scale space use of animal species in mountainous regions. These relationships suggest that researchers should consider local terrain when siting camera traps in mountainous landscapes and analyzing survey data from such landscapes. Studies that compare the detection of mammal species at cameras deployed in close proximity will improve our understanding of fine-scale topographic effects on mammal movement and detection.

AB  - Herbivorous insect communities are structured by multiple processes operating locally (e.g. bottom-up effects of plants) and regionally (e.g. dispersal limitation). Although the relative strength of these processes has been well documented, how it varies in time is less understood, especially in relation with the temporal dynamics of plant communities. If temporal turnover of local plant species composition is too rapid for insect community assembly to keep up with, bottom-up effects are expected to be weak. Here, in plant and herbivorous insect communities in Japanese grasslands, we studied how the relative importance of local (bottom-up effects of plants, structures of plant communities and top-down effects of predators) and regional (dispersal limitation) processes varies over the growing season. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that larger temporal turnover of plant species composition is related to the weaker bottom-up effects, that is, the lower explanation power of plant communities for insect communities. We found that, throughout the growing season, the insect species composition was mainly explained by local variables (plant species composition, vegetation height and predator abundance), and their explanation power was higher during later phases of the season (late summer). Furthermore, the variation not explained by plant species composition was correlated with the degree of temporal turnover of plants, suggesting that insect communities failed to track the temporal turnover of plant species. These results were pronounced when we focused on leaf sucker insects, whose host plant range is presumably more limited. We conclude that herbivorous insect communities are mainly regulated by local processes, especially bottom-up effects from plants, while stochasticity may have played a role in early phases of the season. Furthermore, we underscore the importance of considering relative time scale of community assembly and environmental shifts, especially in systems characterized by dynamic changes.

AB  - Plastic pollution and the resulting entanglement of marine wildlife is a global and growing issue. However, there is a significant lack of knowledge about the impacts of marine litter on marine biodiversity in Morocco. Based on a digital media search, we evaluated the negative impacts of marine litter on Moroccan marine biodiversity. The study demonstrated that sixty-eight individuals from 18 species were affected by marine litter. Cetaceans are most affected by entanglements, followed by sea turtles, fish, seabirds and elasmobranchs. Most of the reported entanglements were from discarded or lost fishing gear, indicating the importance of strengthening existing legislation for the protection of endangered marine animals and implementing mitigation measures related to discarded fishing litter. This study is the first inventory of marine wildlife affected by marine litter in Morocco, but the real status stays underestimated and still somewhat unclear.

AB  - Trade-offs between host resistance to parasites and host growth or reproduction can occur due to allocation of limited available resources between competing demands. To predict potential trade-offs arising from genetic selection for host resistance, a better understanding of the associated nutritional costs is required. Here, we studied resistance costs by using sheep from lines divergently selected on their resistance to a common blood-feeding gastro-intestinal parasite (Haemonchus contortus). First, we assessed the effects of selection for high or low host resistance on condition traits (body weight, back fat, and muscle thickness) and infection traits (parasite fecal egg excretion and loss in blood haematocrit) at various life stages, in particular during the periparturient period when resource allocation to immunity may limit host resistance. Second, we analysed the condition-infection relationship to detect a possible trade-off, in particular during the periparturient period. We experimentally infected young females in four stages over their first 2 years of life, including twice around parturition (at 1 year and at 2 years of age). Linear mixed-model analyses revealed a large and consistent between-line difference in infection traits during growth and outside of the periparturient period, whereas this difference was strongly attenuated during the periparturient period. Despite their different responses to infection, lines had similar body condition traits. Using covariance decomposition, we then found that the phenotypic relationship between infection and condition was dominated by direct infection costs arising from parasite development within the host. Accounting for these within-individual effects, a cost of resistance on body weight was detected among ewes during their first reproduction. Although this cost and the reproductive constraint on resistance are unlikely to represent a major concern for animal breeding in nutrient-rich environments, this study provides important new insights regarding the nutritional costs of parasite resistance at different lifestages and how these may affect response to selection.

AB  - Moose (Alces alces) in boreal habitats feed and rest where they are exposed to Dipteran flies and the parasites they carry. We collected 31,905 flies during the summer from 12 habituated moose on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. Moose flies, Haematobosca alcis (Snow), Diptera: Muscidae-a species that completes its entire life cycle on or around moose-accounted for 91% of flies collected; the reminder of the flies collected included mosquitoes (Culicidae), black flies (Simuliidae), and deer flies (Tabanidae). Flies impose physiological costs for moose, e.g., vectors for parasites such as Legworm (Onchocerca spp.) which causes sores on the hind legs of moose. We found that the number of sores present on the hind legs of moose is positively correlated with body fat, which suggests a correlation between gains of energy and damage from flies. We also found that the number of sores is negatively correlated with serum albumin, which is indicative of an inflammatory response and body protein being used to repair injuries from flies and parasites. The number or type of flies present on a Moose were not correlated with the concentration of corticosteroids in saliva or feces. Flies do not elicit a stress response in moose even though the costs of repairing wounds and resisting infections of those wounds likely reduce gains of protein from summer foraging. Moose can tolerate the injuries from biting flies with regular gains from summer foraging but exposure to insect-borne parasites poses a risk to reproduction and survival.
   Moose (Alces alces) in boreal habitats of Alaska are exposed to thousands of Dipteran flies throughout the summer months, with moose flies (Haematobosca alcis) making up the majority of fly residence on moose. Flies impose physiological costs such as tissue damage and loss of body protein, without eliciting a corticosteroid stress response in moose.

AB  - Accurate abundance estimates can contribute to effective management of large carnivore populations. Lion Panthera leo and spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta populations are frequently estimated at night by eliciting their approach using broadcasted vocalizations. Spotlights are typically used to observe these species on approach but can disturb animals and adversely affect counts. We compared the efficacy of spotlight with red filters and forward looking infrared (FLIR) thermal monocular to enumerate lions and spotted hyenas in Serengeti National Park (SNP; non-hunted area) and Maswa Game Reserve (MGR; hunted area), Tanzania, during 2015-2017. We established 119 call-in sites in SNP and 20 in MGR and conducted repeated call-ins at 1-2 week intervals. During call-ins we conducted systematic paired counts using both devices. We assessed the influence of device order, species, hunting regime and land cover on species counts. We found that FLIR was more efficacious for counting hyenas in MGR and spotlight for counting lions in SNP. We found evidence for temporary artificial light disturbance in MGR, as counts were higher when FLIR was used as the second device. Habitat type within 200 m of call-in sites did not influence device performances. Greater spotlight efficacy in SNP is a likely consequence of lower perceived risk and less anthropogenic disturbance compared to MGR. To improve accuracy of counts and subsequent population estimates for lions and spotted hyenas, we recommend consideration of variation in device efficacy, based on species surveyed and management regime.

AB  - Coral reefs support an incredible abundance and diversity of fish species, with reef-associated fisheries providing important sources of income, food, and dietary micronutrients to millions of people across the tropics. However, the rapid degradation of the world's coral reefs and the decline in their biodiversity may limit their capacity to supply nutritious and affordable seafood while meeting conservation goals for sustainability. Here, we conduct a global-scale analysis of how the nutritional quality of reef fish assemblages (nutritional contribution to the recommended daily intake of calcium, iron, and zinc contained in an average 100 g fish on the reef) relates to key environmental, socioeconomic, and ecological conditions, including two key metrics of fish biodiversity. Our global analysis of more than 1,600 tropical reefs reveals that fish trophic composition is a more important driver of micronutrient concentrations than socioeconomic and environmental conditions. Specifically, micronutrient density increases as the relative biomass of herbivores and detritivores increases at lower overall biomass or under high human pressure. This suggests that the provision of essential micronutrients can be maintained or even increase where fish biomass decreases, reinforcing the need for policies that ensure sustainable fishing, and that these micronutrients are retained locally for nutrition. Furthermore, we found a negative association between micronutrient density and two metrics of fish biodiversity, revealing an important nutrition-biodiversity trade-off. Protecting reefs with high levels of biodiversity maintains key ecosystem functions, whereas sustainable fisheries management in locations with high micro- nutrient density could sustain the essential supply of micronutrients to coastal human communities.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from livestock manure contribute significantly to the growth of atmospheric N2O, a powerful greenhouse gas and dominant ozone-depleting substance. Here, we estimate global N2O emissions from livestock manure during 1890-2020 using the tier 2 approach of the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Global N2O emissions from livestock manure increased by similar to 350% from 451 [368-556] Gg N year(-1) in 1890 to 2042 [1677-2514] Gg N year(-1) in 2020. These emissions contributed similar to 30% to the global anthropogenic N2O emissions in the decade 2010-2019. Cattle contributed the most (60%) to the increase, followed by poultry (19%), pigs (15%), and sheep and goats (6%). Regionally, South Asia, Africa, and Latin America dominated the growth in global emissions since the 1990s. Nationally, the largest emissions were found in India (329 Gg N year(-1)), followed by China (267 Gg N year(-1)), the United States (163 Gg N year(-1)), Brazil (129 Gg N year(-1)) and Pakistan (102 Gg N year(-1)) in the 2010s. We found a substantial impact of livestock productivity, specifically animal body weight and milk yield, on the emission trends. Furthermore, a large spread existed among different methodologies in estimates of global N2O emission from livestock manure, with our results 20%-25% lower than those based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. This study highlights the need for robust time-variant model parameterization and continuous improvement of emissions factors to enhance the precision of emission inventories. Additionally, urgent mitigation is required, as all available inventories indicate a rapid increase in global N2O emissions from livestock manure in recent decades.

AB  - Wildlife management is an integral part of forest management, and game animals should be considered an essential part of the forest ecosystem and agroecosystems in which the flow of energy changed fundamentally during the 20 th century due to the use of fertilisers, pesticides, and modern technologies. An approximately four-fold increase in the production of crops brought with it an increase in the number of ungulates in the world. The tasks of foresters and hunters in wildlife management include creating the best suitable living conditions for animals and mitigating conflicts between forest animals and human activities. This necessitates the creation and implementation of modern land units called Game Management Regions (GMRs) in Poland. This concept was defined in the Polish Hunting Law primarily for managing big game populations. The aim of the GMRs is to ensure year-long management of game populations within their respective ranges. Longterm Hunting Management Plans were developed for each GMR, serving as the basis for adopting management directions, and achieving the desired state of the game population as recorded in the multi-year plan (typically spanning ten years). However, experiences and the current situation reveal several weaknesses in the functioning of these divisions, including rapid changes in the environment, particularly the emergence of barriers like highways and new buildings. This research aimed to develop a method for determining or verifying the boundaries of the GMRs based on objective criteria as a case study hosted by the Regional Directorate of State Forests in Lublin. During the conducted analysis we examined data provided by the Regional Directorate of State Forests (RDSF) in Lublin, including information on the current density of red deer ( Cervus elaphus ), forest cover, forest patch fragmentation, categories of hunting districts, ecological corridors, as well as existing, under-construction and planned highways and expressways. The boundaries of the GMRs were determined by aggregating hunting districts with similar characteristics using GIS software while considering ecological barriers. The analysis results indicated the need to establish 12 divisions instead of 8, with significant deviations from the previous delimitation. The obtained results underscore the necessity of verifying the boundaries of the GMRs nationwide.

AB  - Fungal symbionts can buffer plants from environmental extremes and may affect host capacities to acclimate, adapt, or redistribute under environmental change; however, the distributions of fungal symbionts along abiotic gradients are poorly described. Fungal mutualists should be the most beneficial in abiotically stressful environments, and the structure of networks of plant-fungal interactions likely shift along gradients, even when fungal community composition does not track environmental stress. We sampled 634 unique combinations of fungal endophytes and mycorrhizal fungi, grass species identities, and sampling locations from 66 sites across six replicate altitudinal gradients in the western Colorado Rocky Mountains. The diversity and composition of leaf endophytic, root endophytic, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal guilds and the overall abundance of fungal functional groups (pathogens, saprotrophs, mutualists) tracked grass host identity more closely than elevation. Network structures of root endophytes become more nested and less specialized at higher elevations, but network structures of other fungal guilds did not vary with elevation. Overall, grass species identity had overriding influence on the diversity and composition of above- and belowground fungal endophytes and AM fungi, despite large environmental variation. Therefore, in our system climate change may rarely directly affect fungal symbionts. Instead, fungal symbiont distributions will most likely track the range dynamics of host grasses.

AB  - The application of livestock manure and aquaculture wastewater into agricultural soil introduces animal manurederived colloids into the environment. These manure-derived colloids generally contain different organic matter components and may facilitate nanoparticle transport to the subsurface. This study investigated the interaction between manure-derived colloids (cow and pig manures) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles at neutral pH. The effect of this interaction on the stability, aggregation, and transport of TiO2 in a saturated porous media was studied. Our study found that cow manure-derived colloids have many humic-like substances, and pig manure-derived colloids contain many protein components and some humic-like substances. The interactions of different manure-derived colloids with TiO2 can affect the zeta-potential and aggregation status of TiO2 in the aqueous system. The results showed that cow manure-derived colloids slightly increased the TiO2 transport due to electrostatic repulsion, while pig manure-derived colloids substantially increased the TiO2 mobility in porous media because of both electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance. Since both animal manure and TiO2 are ubiquitously present in the natural environment, manure-derived colloids can change the surface properties of TiO2 and facilitate TiO2 transport in the subsurface.

AB  - Structural variants (SVs) represent an important genetic resource for both natural and artificial selection. Here we present a chromosome-scale reference genome for domestic yak (Bos grunniens) that has longer contigs and scaffolds (N50 44.72 and 114.39 Mb, respectively) than reported for any other ruminant genome. We further obtained long-read resequencing data for 6 wild and 23 domestic yaks and constructed a genetic SV map of 372,220 SVs that covers the geographic range of the yaks. The majority of the SVs contains repetitive sequences and several are in or near genes. By comparing SVs in domestic and wild yaks, we identified genes that are predominantly related to the nervous system, behavior, immunity, and reproduction and may have been targeted by artificial selection during yak domestication. These findings provide new insights in the domestication of animals living at high altitude and highlight the importance of SVs in animal domestication.

AB  - Spatial patterns in topography and forage distribution significantly influence the movements and choices of large herbivores. However, understanding the foraging strategies of free-grazing herbivores at different temporal and spatial scales remains limited, as different behavioral decisions can apply at different hierarchical levels. This study investigates the fine-scale foraging strategies of the Plains Zebra (Equus quagga) in a South African savanna, with a specific focus on their selection of green vegetation at the plant and feeding patch levels. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as a proxy for vegetation productivity and quality. Our findings reveal that zebras adapted their foraging strategies according to scale and season. During the late-dry season and early-wet season, selection for greenness was at both the grass tuft and feeding site levels. In contrast, during the mid-dry season, selection was predominantly at the tuft level, focusing solely on greenness. These insights emphasize the importance of conducting multilevel studies when investigating factors influencing foraging decisions. Findings at 1 hierarchical level may not necessarily apply across other levels of investigation, highlighting the need for a nuanced and comprehensive approach to understanding the complex foraging behaviors of animals.
   This study investigates the fine-scale foraging strategies of zebras in a South African savanna, focusing on their selection of green vegetation at plant and feeding patch levels. Results reveal adaptive foraging behavior varying with scale and season: during late-dry and early-wet seasons, zebras select greenness at both levels, while in mid-dry season, preference shifts to grass tuft level. These findings underscore the need for multilevel studies to comprehend factors influencing herbivore foraging decisions, emphasizing the complexity of their behaviors.

AB  - Both natural and anthropogenic stressors are increasing on coral reefs, resulting in large-scale loss of coral and potential shifts from coral- to macroalgae-dominated community states. Two factors implicated in shifts to macroalgae are nutrient enrichment and fishing of reef herbivores. Although either of these factors alone could facilitate establishment of macroalgae, reefs may be particularly vulnerable to coral-to-algae phase shifts in which strong bottom-up forcing from nutrient enrichment is accompanied by a weakening of herbivore control of macroalgae via intense fishing. We explored spatial heterogeneity and covariance in these drivers on reefs in the lagoons of Moorea, French Polynesia, where the local fishery heavily targets herbivorous fishes and there are spatially variable inputs of nutrients from agricultural fertilizers and wastewater systems. Spatial patterns of fishing and nutrient enrichment were not correlated at the two landscape scales we examined: among the 11 interconnected lagoons around the island or among major habitats (fringing reef, mid-lagoon, back reef) within a lagoon. This decoupling at the landscape scale resulted from patterns of covariation between enrichment and fishing that differed qualitatively between cross-shore and long-shore directions. At the cross-shore scale, nutrient enrichment declined but fishing increased from shore to the crest of the barrier reef. By contrast, nutrient enrichment and fishing were positively correlated in the long-shore direction, with both increasing with proximity to a pass in the barrier reef. Contrary to widespread assumptions in the scientific literature that human coastal population density correlates with impact on marine ecosystems and that fishing effort declines linearly with distance from the shore, these local stressors produced a complex spatial mosaic of reef vulnerabilities. Our findings support spatially explicit management involving the control of anthropogenic nutrients and strategic reductions in fishing pressure on herbivores by highlighting specific areas to target for management actions.

AB  - In marine fishes of commercial interest, defining habitat use and migration strategies through ontogeny can help better understand the structure and dynamics of harvested populations and guide their management. The present study relied on otolith chemistry to identify three contingents within the Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) stock in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL). We differentiated two chemical signatures from otolith edges, one for shallow (<100 m) and another one for deep (>100 m) waters. By identifying transitions between the deep and shallow habitats, we found that most halibut display migrations from the deep waters to shallow waters during the first 3 years of life. After reaching maturity, most halibut distributing in northern regions of the GSL became full-time residents in deep areas of the GSL. In contrast, halibut found in summer on the shallow plateau of the southern GSL displayed migrating behaviour between shallow (summer) and deep (winter) waters throughout their lives, either on an annual or irregular basis. Overall, our results demonstrate that otolith chemical signatures serve as natural markers of geographically distinct marine environments, facilitating the identification and reconstruction of environmental histories of long-lived marine fishes.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) could improve crop yield by nutrient uptake from soil. However, how AMF of topsoil and subsoil respond to long-term differential application of mineral and organic fertilizers and how they are influenced in presence of different crops and growth stages have never been assessed together. Next generation sequencing was applied to profile soil AMF communities in both topsoil and subsoil from a typical arable soil (Eutric Regosol) in the Sichuan Base, southwest China. Soils were collected at anthesis and harvest of winter wheat and maize after 15-years of differential fertilization of an annual maize-wheat rotation (same inputs of nitrogen, N; but different in carbon, C; phosphorus, P; and potassium, K): (i) no-fertilization control (CT), (ii) 100% mineral NPK fertilizer (NPK), (iii) 60% mineral N and 100% mineral PK plus 40% N as crop residues (NPKCR); and (iv) 60% mineral N and 100% mineral PK plus 40% N as pig (organic) manure (NPKOM). Compared to CT, AMF diversity significantly decreased in topsoil, but increased in subsoil for both wheat and maize under NPK, NPKCR and NPKOM. The AMF community composition differed between NPK and CT in both topsoil and subsoil of maize and wheat. Both distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) suggested that AMF communities in topsoil and subsoil of maize and wheat responded in differences in soil available P, soil organic carbon, fertilization and climate (temperature and/or rainfall). Fertilization and available N, not AMF community, had significantly positive effects on wheat and maize aboveground dry matter and grain yield. Results from the present study shed light on how AMF communities in topsoil and subsoil respond to different soil fertility management over the long-term. Insights of this study are valuable in managing an important part of biological soil fertility.

AB  - Giant kelp forests off the west coast of North America are maintained primarily by sea otter (Enhydra lutris) and sunflower sea star (Pycnopodia helianthoides) predation of sea urchins. Human hunting of sea otters in historical times, together with a marine heat wave and sea star wasting disease epidemic in the past decade, devastated these predators, leading to widespread occurrences of urchin barrens. Since the late Neogene, species of the megaherbivorous sirenian Hydrodamalis ranged throughout North Pacific giant kelp forests. The last species, H. gigas, was driven to extinction by human hunting in the mid-eighteen century. H. gigas was an obligate kelp canopy browser, and its body size implies that it would have had a significant impact on the system. Here, we hypothesize that sea cow browsing may have enhanced forest resilience. We tested this hypothesis with a mathematical model, comparing historical and modern community responses to marine heat waves and sea star wasting disease. Results indicate that forest communities were highly resistant to marine heat waves, yet susceptible to sea star wasting disease, and to disease in combination with warming. Resistance was greatest among systems with both sea cows and sea otters present. The model additionally predicts that historical communities may have exhibited delayed transitions after perturbation and faster recovery times. Sea cow browsing may therefore have enhanced resilience against modern perturbations. We propose that operationalizing these findings by mimicking sea cow herbivory could enhance kelp forest resilience.

AB  - When hydrothermal activity ceases at black-smoker chimneys on mid-ocean ridges, populations of associated invertebrates hosting chemoautotrophic endosymbionts decline and then disappear, but the chimneys can persist on the seabed as relicts. Suspension-feeding brisingid seastars colonize hydrothermally inactive (relict) chimneys on the East Pacific Rise (EPR), though their distribution relative to available hard substrata and proximity to hydrothermal activity is poorly documented. In this study, brisingid abundance on sulfide and basalt substrata was assessed along an similar to 3,700 m ROV Jason II transect at the summit of Pito Seamount (SE Pacific; similar to 2,275 m). Brisingids were non-randomly distributed, with highest densities (up to similar to 300 m(-2)) on relict sulfides chimneys near active black smokers. Brisingids were relatively uncommon on basalt substrata, and absent on black smokers. We infer that both relict sulfide structures and proximity to black smokers play key roles in the maintenance of dense brisingid populations on Pito Seamount and in similar environments on the EPR. Our observations suggest that experimental introduction of "artificial" relict chimneys providing microtopographic relief could test whether such an approach might mitigate potential impacts of mineral extraction on populations of suspension-feeding invertebrates.

AB  - Plants constantly cope with insect herbivory, which is thought to be the evolutionary driver for the immense diversity of plant chemical defenses. Herbivorous insects are in turn restricted in host choice by the presence of plant chemical defense barriers. In this study, we analyzed whether butterfly host-plant patterns are determined by the presence of shared plant chemical defenses rather than by shared plant evolutionary history. Using correlation and phylogenetic statistics, we assessed the impact of host-plant chemical defense traits on shaping northwestern European butterfly assemblages at a macroevolutionary scale. Shared chemical defenses between plant families showed stronger correlation with overlap in butterfly assemblages than phylogenetic relatedness, providing evidence that chemical defenses may determine the assemblage of butterflies per plant family rather than shared evolutionary history. Although global congruence between butterflies and host-plant families was detected across the studied herbivory interactions, cophylogenetic statistics showed varying levels of congruence between butterflies and host chemical defense traits. We attribute this to the existence of multiple antiherbivore traits across plant families and the diversity of insect herbivory associations per plant family. Our results highlight the importance of plant chemical defenses in community ecology through their influence on insect assemblages.

AB  - Ecotones are responsive to environmental change and pave a path for succession as they move across the landscape. We investigated the biotic and abiotic filters to species establishment on opposite ends of a tidal marsh-forest ecotone that is moving inland in response to sea level rise. We transplanted four plant species common to the ecotone to the leading or trailing edge of the migrating ecotone, with and without caging to protect them from ungulate herbivores. We found that species exhibited an individualistic response to abiotic and biotic pressures in this ecotone; three species performed better at the leading edge of the ecotone in the coastal forest, whereas one performed better at the trailing edge in the marsh. Specifically, grass species Phragmites australis and Panicum virgatum grew more in the low light and low salinity conditions of the leading edge of the ecotone (forest), whereas the shrub Iva frutescens grew better in the high light, high salinity conditions of the trailing edge of the ecotone (marsh). Furthermore, of the four species, only P. australis was affected by the biotic pressure of herbivory by an introduced ungulate, Cervus nippon, which greatly reduced its biomass and survival at the leading edge (forest). P. australis is an aggressive invasive species and has been observed to dominate in the wake of migrating marsh-forest ecotones. Our findings detail the role of lower salinity stress to promote and herbivory pressure to inhibit the establishment of P. australis during shifts of this ecotone, and also highlight an interaction between two nonnative species, P. australis and C. nippon. Understanding migration of the marsh-forest ecotone and the factors controlling P. australis establishment are critical for marsh conservation in the face of sea level rise. More generally, our findings support the conclusion that the abiotic and biotic filters of a migrating ecotone shape the resulting community.

AB  - Aquatic macrophytes are generally recognized to influence fish-prey interactions. We assessed how fish consume particular foods, and how their foraging efficiency, trophic niche breadth, and niche overlap respond to gradients of macrophyte density and diversity. We sampled fish and macrophytes in 30 stands distributed over a 13.7 km stretch of the littoral zone of a river in Brazil. By generating generalized linear models, we showed that increasing macrophyte density (from 366 to 7066 g DW m(-3)) favored herbivory and fish foraging efficiency. Beta regressions showed that fish reduced their trophic niche breadth along the gradient of macrophyte density, while niche overlap increased until a certain extent of plant density when species started to segregate the niche more strongly. However, niche breadth responses varied according to the trophic guild considered, with omnivorous and herbivorous fish generally showing opposite responses. Macrophyte diversity was important for the preferred food items of the fish, with stomach contents shifting from higher plants, algae, and detritus to insects with increasing macrophyte diversity. Therefore, in addition to the presumable effects of macrophyte density on resource availability and prey encounter rates, our findings highlight the importance of maintaining diverse macrophyte stands for the conservation of fish diversity.

AB  - Impatiens glandulifera or Himalayan balsam is one of the most invasive weeds across Europe and can seriously reduce native plant diversity. It often forms continuous monocultures along river banks, but the mechanisms of this arrested succession are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on balsam competitive ability with two native plant species, Plantago lanceolata and Holcus lanatus. We also studied how competition with Impatiens affects colonisation by foliar endophytes and mycorrhizas of two other co-occurring native species, Urtica dioica and Cirsium arvense. Mycorrhizal colonisation reduced balsam growth when the plants were grown singly, but appeared to have little effect when balsam experienced intra- or interspecific competition. Competition with balsam together with the addition of mycorrhizas had no effect on P. lanceolata biomass, suggesting that the fungi were beneficial to the latter, enabling it to compete effectively with balsam. However, this was not so with H. lanatus. Meanwhile, competition with Impatiens reduced endophyte numbers and mycorrhizal colonisation in U. dioica and C. arvense, leading to enhanced susceptibility of these plants to insect attack. Himalayan balsam is known to degrade soil fungal populations and can also reduce foliar beneficial fungi in neighbouring plants. This allows the plant to compete effectively with itself and other native species, thereby leading to the continuous monocultures.

AB  - Simple Summary:In the early sixties, free ranging red deer (Cervus elaphus, L.) were absent in Piedmont. Human-driven translocations and spontaneous migration of red deer from Switzerland and France resulted in the successful redistribution of this wild ungulate. In parallel, host-specific parasites harbored by red deer populations disappeared in the same area until the restoration of red deer in north-western Italy. The parasitic community has been enriched with at least two species-specific taxa, Onchocerca jakutensis and Pharyngomyia picta, suggesting that the recovery of parasitic biodiversity could be included amongst future conservation goals of this intensively managed game.
   Red deer (Cervus elaphus) populations in north-western Italy have been remodeled in recent decades. Multiple translocations and the spontaneous migration from Switzerland and France resulted in the successful redistribution of the red deer after human-driven extirpation during the 18th century. The scarcely diverse parasitic community harbored by these cervids has been enriched with two species-specific taxa, Onchocerca jakutensis and Phayigomyia picta, suggesting that the recovery of parasitic biodiversity could be included amongst future conservation goals of this intensively managed game. Nodular onchocercosis was reported in three red deer populations since 2011, while nasal bots were reported since 2018. Hypoderma spp. larvae were identified for the first time in 1989, then a second record was made in 2014 in the province of Biella, where a yearling male in poor condition infested with Hypoderma diana was observed. In the perspective that the restoration of species-specific parasite communities of native mammals in Europe is increasingly perceived as a conservation target, with similar dignity as the conservation of their hosts, baseline data presented in this communication may give new insights for future parasite conservation efforts.

AB  - Agricultural wastes, comprising cotton straw and livestock manure, can be effectively managed through aerobic co-composting. Nevertheless, the quality and microbial characteristics of co-composting products from different sources remain unclear. Therefore, this study utilized livestock manure from various sources in Xinjiang, China, including herbivorous sheep manure (G), omnivorous pigeon manure (Y), and pigeon-sheep mixture (GY) alongside cotton stalks, for a 40-day co-composting process. We monitored physicochemical changes, assessed compost characteristics, and investigated fungal community. The results indicate that all three composts met established composting criteria, with compost G exhibiting the fastest microbial growth and achieving the highest quality. Ascomycota emerged as the predominant taxon in three compost products. Remarkably, at the genus level, the biomarker species for G, Y, and GY are Petromyces and Cordyceps, Neurospora, and Neosartorya, respectively. Microorganisms play a pivotal role in organic matter degradation, impacting nutrient composition, demonstrating significant potential for the decomposition and transformation of compost components. Redundancy analysis indicates that potassium, total organic carbon, and C:N are key factors influencing fungal communities. This study elucidates organic matter degradation in co-composting straw and livestock manure diverse sources, optimizing treatment for efficient agricultural waste utilization and sustainable practices.

AB  - The pedogenic carbonates found in Pleistocene units of the coastal Brazilian Pampa, informally designated as 'Caliche Corda similar to o', include rhizocretions, soft masses and isolated or coalescent nodules, either isolated within the sediment or forming discrete horizons, the most developed horizons (Ca-01 and Ca-02) stretching for hundreds of meters along the banks of Chuy Creek. Petrographic analyses show micritic (Alpha-type) matrix in most samples, with few signs of recrystallization as circumgranular spar rims or cracked sand grains. Stable carbon (delta 13C) and oxygen (delta 18O) isotope values in samples from the lower horizon Ca-01 exhibit small variation and indicate C3dominated plant assemblages and carbonate precipitation from relatively 18O-enriched water, whereas the delta 13C and delta 18O in samples from the upper horizon (Ca-02) exhibit wider variation, higher proportion of C4 plants and precipitation from 18O-depleted water in some samples. The delta 18O variations can be explained by variable degrees of evaporative enrichment, or to relative contributions of 18O-depleted (tropical) or 18O-enriched (subtropical) rainfall, based on the similarity with estimates from fossils of mastodons. Nodules from other sites are similar, but larger isotopic variations indicate carbonate precipitation at distinct times and environmental conditions, and a few exhibit partial recrystallization as larger spar calcite crystals. Luminescence ages of -74.7 and -71.3 ka of quartz grains in two nodules from Ca-01 indicate precipitation during MIS 4, whereas ages of -52 ka from Ca-02, and >= 30 ka in nodules from the shores of Mirim Lagoon indicate carbonate formation between MIS 3 and MIS 2. The probable source of carbonate was calcium released from eolian-sourced silty dust produced by Andean glaciers and transported from loess deposits in Argentina during cold and dry intervals of the last glacial, when arid/semiarid environments expanded from Patagonia across the Pampas up to southern Brazil. The variations of delta 13C in calcretes formed between MIS 4 and 2 point to changes in plant assemblages that could have contributed for the local extinction of the mammalian megafauna.

AB  - Mammals have evolved to occupy spatial and temporal niches in order to optimize resource utilization and minimize predation risk or competition. Subsequently, niche partitioning may be influenced by phylogenetic associations, which could have substantial consequences for ecosystem structure and function. We use the output from occupancy models based on camera trapping data to construct a tri-partite network describing the environmental and temporal partitioning of activity among twelve sympatric mammals in the Apennine Mountains of central Italy. We further evaluate if there were any effects of phylogenetic associations on the contributions of species to the properties of this spatio-temporal network. The Apennines form a pristine region in central Italy with a relatively intact Mediterranean mammal fauna. The mammal community in our study consisted of species ranging in size from 300 gs to over 200 kg, and included herbivores, omnivores and predators. There was limited structuring of the network describing environmental and temporal niche use. Furthermore, we did not find any phylogenetic signal in species contributions to network structures, and phylogenetic relatedness among species was not associated with their similarities in environmental or spatial niche use. However, animals appeared to have partitioned environmental niches more than temporal ones, suggesting that spatial variation in resource availability may have been more important than temporal avoidance of predation risk or competition in shaping activity within this mammal community. Our study highlights the need to evaluate under which conditions evolutionary history is influencing contemporary ecological processes.

AB  - Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. are the most reported zoonotic agents in Europe. They can be transmitted from wildlife to humans, and wild boars (Sus scrofa) can harbour them. In the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (MAB, NE Spain) wild boars are found in urbanized areas. To assess the potential public health risk of this increasing wild boar population, we collected stool samples from 130 wild boars from the MAB (June 2015 - February 2016), to determine the Campylobacter and Salmonella occurrence and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates. We also investigated the genetic diversity and virulence potential of Campylobacter. Campylobacter prevalence in wild boars was 61%. Forty six percent of wild boars carried Campylobacter lanienae, 16% carried Campylobacter coli, and 1% carried Campylobacter hyointestinalis; 4% carried both C. lanienae and C. coli, and 1% carried both C. lanienae and C. hyointestinalis. This is the first report of C. hyointestinalis in wildlife in Spain. Using pulse -field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing, we observed a high genetic diversity of Campylobacter and identified new sequence types. Thirty-three percent of C. coli and 14% of C. lanienae isolates showed a high virulence potential. All of the Campylobacter isolates analysed were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent. Multidrug resistance was only detected in C. coli (67%). Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica was detected in four wild boars (3%) and included a S. Enteritidis serovar (1/4 wild boars) and a multidrug-resistant (ASSuT) monophasic S. Typhimurium serovar (1/4 wild boars) which is associated with human infections and pig meat in Europe. The characteristics of some of the Campylobacter and Salmonella isolates recovered suggest an anthropogenic origin. Wild boars are a reservoir of Campylobacter and have the potential to spread antimicrobial resistant Campylobacter and Salmonella in urbanized areas in the MAB.

AB  - In the late 10th century, the Norse established settlements in Greenland that lasted until the mid-15th century, driven by more than just climatic factors. These settlers introduced agropastoral practices and engaged in longdistance trade, especially in the highly prized walrus ivory. The Eastern Settlement (Eystribyggd), at 60 degrees N, proved to be the largest and best studied settlement, in contrast to the smaller Western Settlement (Vestribyggd) at 64 degrees N, particularly in the Kapisillit area. The Western Settlement was likely abandoned earlier than the Eastern Settlement, although the exact timing remains debated. The harsher climatic conditions may have pushed the western settlers towards a subsistence strategy focused, in addition to farming activities, on hunting and fishing. High-resolution multi-proxy analyses of lake sediments from Lake Itinera and Lake Pingu at Kapisillit, only 2 km away from the nearest Norse ruins, reveal subtle environmental changes and fire activity between 1000 and 1200 CE. These changes are characterised by a slight clearing of scrubland, including willows and alders, and an increased spread of herbaceous vegetation. Although the presence of coprophilous fungal spores suggests some herbivore activity, the data do not indicate significant grazing pressure. Instead, the declining values of these spores may reflect a decline in domesticated animals or increased hunting of wild herbivores, such as caribou, towards the end of the settlement period. After the mid-13th century, our results suggest a decrease in human influence, coinciding with the onset of the Little Ice Age. However, the reasons for the eventual abandonment of the Western Settlement remain unclear. This study provides evidence from pollen data and records of fire activity and contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between societies and the environment, highlighting grazing and hunting pressure as key factors in vegetation change at the Western Settlement. The results highlight the complexity of interpreting environmental data, particularly in distinguishing between anthropogenic impacts and natural variability during the Norse period.

AB  - The interplay between natural, non-cropped, and cropped habitats affects insect movement in the landscape. Polyphagous, highly mobile pests are more likely to cross habitat-edges and colonize crops. However, local differences within habitats can affect pest populations and modulate their broad response to the landscape. We investigated how different habitat types influence the spatiotemporal dynamics and spillover of a polyphagous pest on tropical organic vegetable farms. We simultaneously sampled the abundance of the worldwide pest Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) on crops, fallow areas, agroforests, and forests fragments on five farms for two years. This whitefly species achieved higher population growth rates in open-field habitats (mostly crops), where resources are more easily found and concentrated. The lack of density dependence on population growth suggests that migration drives habitat occupancy. Crops were the main source of individuals to other habitat types, while agroforests and forest fragments (both sink and stepping-stones habitats) are most likely temporary habitats for whiteflies where they face a populational bottleneck. Regardless of habitat features, higher precipitation and low temperatures independently regulated population densities throughout seasons. Fragmented agricultural landscapes reduced bottom-up effects of forests and facilitated whitefly infestation on crops due to edge effects. In summary, the source-sink dynamics of whiteflies was largely determined by sink habitats that differ in local characteristics and management but was also influenced by landscape type. These findings indicate that the farmland habitat scale was adequate to integrate the scale-dependent processes operating on different spatial (local and landscape) and temporal (seasonality) scales on pest populations.

AB  - Introduction Given the different life histories and movement behaviors of diverse species, reconciling conservation measures to benefit all species is a critical concern for landscape conservation planning. Understanding land cover composition and finding multispecies movement routes across heterogeneous landscapes are crucial to maintaining many target species. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the optimal environment in Florida that promotes multispecies connectivity in landscapes increasingly threatened by rapid suburban development and to enhance methods for delineating the state's ecological networks.Methods Potential functional connectivity of the focal species with statewide distributions and are considered priorities because of the historical and current threats to their population viability, such as the Florida black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus), Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi), eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi), and southern fox squirrel (Sciurus niger niger), were modeled using Linkage Mapper, Omniscape, and resistant kernels. We combined quantiles from each method for a single species combination approach to leverage the results from the three models for planning purposes. Subsequently, we integrated the results into a novel multiple species, multi-model connectivity mapping approach. Following the corridor analysis, a comparison was made between multispecies connectivity maps, current managed conservation lands, and the main priority areas for the Florida Wildlife Corridor, a previously developed planning network of natural hubs and corridors. Finally, we used the spatial prioritization software Zonation to identify areas of conservation priority, while also illustrating the impacts of infrastructure (built infrastructure, roadways, mining, and future development 2040 and 2070 projections) and threats from human activity (landscape fragmentation, recreation, pollution, contamination, and clean-up sites).Results The study identified priority areas for all four species, with a particular focus on areas not currently protected. The connectivity models showed significant overlap with current managed conservation lands and the main priority areas for the Florida Wildlife Corridor. Pinchpoint areas or bottlenecks were identified as needing fine-scale incorporation into spatial planning. Using the spatial prioritization software Zonation, we identified areas of conservation priority and illustrated the impacts of infrastructure and threats.Discussion The results indicate that species-relevant connectivity models incorporating a group of focal species with both complementary and opposing habitat requirements can better inform biodiversity conservation and landscape design decisions. This multi-model approach provides a robust framework for identifying and prioritizing areas for conservation, particularly in landscapes facing rapid suburban development. Integrating multispecies connectivity models into conservation planning can enhance the effectiveness of ecological networks and contribute to the long-term viability of diverse species in Florida.

AB  - Ocean warming is affecting marine ectothermic herbivores as well as the macroalgal species they consume and this has the potential to alter their trophic interaction. However, it is currently still unknown how these two important components of benthic food webs will react to a warming environment. Consumption rates of grazers change with increasing temperatures, but it is unclear whether this is also true for feeding preferences. In this study, multiple-choice feeding assays with the tropical abalone Haliotis squamata from Western Indonesia were conducted in August 2018. After brief acclimation of either the grazer or the macroalgae to moderately elevated water temperatures (maximum 2 degrees C above the long-term average) in the laboratory, three species of living macroalgae were simultaneously offered to the abalone in feeding assays. Consumption rates of H. squamata were lower under elevated water temperatures, while its feeding preference switched: At 27 degrees C (2 degrees C below long-term average), abalone preferred non-acclimated Gracilaria salicornia, but switched to non-acclimated Amphiroa spp. at 31 degrees C. Interestingly, no such switch in preference occurred when the macroalgae, but not the grazers were acclimated. This indicates that the grazer will presumably be the driver of this potential change in interactions between H. squamata and its macroalgal food. Ocean warming may result in changes in the structure of benthic communities, mediated by changes in the feeding behaviour of herbivorous invertebrates.

AB  - Bite force is often associated with specific morphological features, such as sagittal crests. The presence of a pronounced sagittal crest in some tapirs (Perissodactyla: Tapiridae) was recently shown to be negatively correlated with hard-object feeding, in contrast with similar cranial structures in carnivorans. The aim of this study was to investigate bite forces and sagittal crest heights across a wide range of modern and extinct tapirs and apply a comparative investigation to establish whether these features are correlated across a broad phylogenetic scope. We examined a sample of 71 specimens representing 15 tapir species (5 extant, 10 extinct) using the dry-skull method, linear measurements of cranial features, phylogenetic reconstruction, and comparative analyses. Tapirs were found to exhibit variation in bite force and sagittal crest height across their phylogeny and between different biogeographical realms, with high-crested morphologies occurring mostly in Neotropical species. The highest bite forces within tapirs appear to be driven by estimates for the masseter-pterygoid muscle complex, rather than predicted forces for the temporalis muscle. Our results demonstrate that relative sagittal crest height is poorly correlated with relative cranial bite force, suggesting high force application is not a driver for pronounced sagittal crests in this sample. The divergent biomechanical capabilities of different contemporaneous tapirids may have allowed multiple species to occupy overlapping territories and partition resources to avoid excess competition. Bite forces in tapirs peak in Pleistocene species, independent of body size, suggesting possible dietary shifts as a potential result of climatic changes during this epoch.

AB  - Dwarfed insular mammals are of significant interest to evolutionary biology because of their morphological and physiological adaptations triggered by variables inherent to geographical isolation. One life history trait that is expected to be modified in relation to body size reduction is extended longevity facilitated by ecological parameters such as predator and competitor release and fluctuating resource availability. However, systematic examination of longevity in extreme cases of dwarfism is difficult as such cases are largely represented by fossils of extinct species. We studied seven rib fragments of the extraordinary endemic Pleistocene dwarf deer Candiacervus (size 2) to test whether its bone matrix shows evidence for extensive bone remodelling typically seen in large and long-living mammals. We found that all ribs had well-remodelled Haversian bone, implying several generations of resorption and re-deposition processes. Osteon density was high relative to small bone cross-section size, with examples of porosity similar to that seen in elderly animals. We report the first combined micro-morphological and micro-morphometric record of Candiacervus rib histology, agreeing with previous literature discussing the evolutionary biology of dwarf ruminants. Further experimental validation of osteon density in extant deer will confirm whether dwarfed Candiacervus indeed lived longer than expected for its body mass.

AB  - Competition for hosts is a common ecological interaction in insect parasitoids. In the recent years, it has become increasingly evident that microorganisms can act as 'hidden players' in parasitoid ecology. In this review, we propose that parasitoid competition should take into consideration the microbial influence. In particular, we take a tritrophic perspective and discuss how parasitoid competition can be modulated by microorganisms associated with the parasitoids, their herbivore hosts, or the plants attacked by the herbivores. Although research is still in its infancy, recent studies have shown that microbial symbionts can modulate the contest outcome. The emerging pattern is that microorganisms not only affect the competitive traits of parasitoids but also the fighting arena (i.e. the herbivore host and its food plant), in which competition takes place. We have also identified important gaps in the literature that should be addressed in future studies to advance our understanding about parasitoid competition.

AB  - The degree of knowledge of Thysanoptera in the various ranges of the Carpathian Mountains is uneven. The aim of this research was to identify the Thysanoptera fauna in the G & oacute;ra (Mount) Bucze natural-landscape complex. Three meadow-pasture complexes were selected for the study. Various indicators were used to assess the evenness of the thrips assemblages. A total of 30 thrips species from Aeolothripidae, Thripidae, and Phaeolothripidae were collected, including 26 herbivorous taxa and 4 zoophages. Among herbivores, 11 species were associated with monocotyledonous plants, 12 chose flowers of dicotyledonous herbaceous plants, and 3 preferred leaves, including 2 species which were dendrophilous. The most abundant grass-living species among them were Chirothrips manicatus, Aptinothrips rufus, Chirothrips hamatus, and Anaphothrips obscurus. Flower-living species collected from all sites included Frankliniella intonsa, Neohydatothrips gracillicornis, and species of the genus Thrips: T. fuscipennis, T. major, and T. physapus. All reported species, except Limothrips cerealium, were found in various mountain ranges of the Polish Carpathians. Neohydatothrips abnormis, considered rare and found only at the Babia G & oacute;ra massif, was caught in site 2. The values of the biodiversity indices are indicated for the three study sites.

AB  - The performance of invertebrate herbivores in grasslands can be influenced by climate warming, but there is a lack of experimental evidence, particularly in high elevation areas. We conducted two complementary experiments to investigate the effect of experimental warming on the performance of the grassland caterpillar Gynaephora alpherakii, a notorious pest species in the alpine Tibetan meadow. The first field experiment examined the effect of warming (nonwarmed vs. warmed) on the feeding behavior, growth, and development rate of the caterpillars. The second chamber experiment explored the relationship between temperature and caterpillar appetite, excrement mass, respiration rate, or change of caterpillar weight. Results show that warming significantly decreased fresh body mass of caterpillars by 27.5%, cocoon volume by 61.1%, and egg production per female moth by 26.9% at the end of the field experiment. Warming did not affect cocooning time but significantly increased feeding time of caterpillars during the field experimental period. The independent chamber experiment revealed a significant and positive correlation between caterpillar appetite, excrement mass, respiration rate, and temperature. However, except the first examination, there was a significant negative correlation between changes in caterpillar weight and temperature. Stepwise regression analysis indicated that excrement mass had the greatest influence on caterpillar weight. The weight loss of caterpillars to warming might thus be attributed to elevated metabolic rates at higher temperatures, and the behavioral adaptations failed to compensate for the physiological-induced weight loss. These findings suggest that climate warming can modify the performance and thus the fitness of invertebrate herbivores in high elevation areas.

AB  - One of the most serious consequences of eutrophication in shallow lakes is deterioration of water quality, proliferation of phytoplankton and disappearance of submerged macrophytes. After removing herbivorous and plankti-benthivorous fish, submerged macrophyte restoration was utilized at the entire lake (82.7 km(2)) to combat eutrophication and improve water quality in the shallow subtropical aquaculture of Lake Datong. We conducted two years of monitoring, from March 2018 to February 2020. During the first year of restoration, 80% of the area of Lake Datong (approximately 60 km(2)) was successfully recovered by submerged vegetation, and the water quality was improved. For example, the phosphorous (P) content (including total P (TP), dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total dissolved P (TDP)) and turbidity decreased, and the Secchi depth (SD) increased. However, the submerged vegetation disappeared from autumn 2019 in the intermittent recovery area (MN), while the continuous recovery area (DX) continued to recover with an abundance of submerged vegetation. During the second year, the water quality continued to improve significantly in the DX area, with high biomass and coverage of submerged vegetation. In the MN area, although turbidity and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) increased significantly and SD decreased significantly, the P content (TP, TDP, and DRP) still continued to decrease. The restoration of submerged macrophytes could significantly decrease the density of phytoplankton. Over time, there was a regime shift in Lake Datong. The structural equation model (SEM) results illustrated that the water level and submerged plant coverage were the primary drivers that triggered changes in the state of the lake ecosystem. Our results highlight the potential of restoring submerged vegetation to control water eutrophication at the whole-lake scale. However, the water level in spring was the primary driver that triggered changes in the state of the lake ecosystem. Water level management should be emphasized during the early stages of recovery of submerged plants.

AB  - Understanding rumen degradation and microbial colonization of tanniniferous forages is key to optimizing their utilization in ruminant feeding and mitigating methane emissions. This study investigated rumen degradation and microbial attachment of Sesbania sesban, Leucaena leucocephala, and Anabasis articulata in camels and sheep. The results revealed that the chemical composition of plants and animal species affected the rumen degradation and microbial colonization. Sesbania has higher degradability of dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, and crude protein (p < 0.05). Higher rumen microbial alpha diversity indices were observed in anabasis incubated in camels, while lower diversity was observed in leucaena incubated in sheep. On average, the bacterial community was dominated by the phyla Bacteroidota and Firmicutes. A higher Bacteroidota abundance was observed in sesbania incubated in sheep, while a higher Firmicutes abundance was observed in anabasis incubated in camels. The dominant bacterial genera were Prevotella, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Ruminococcus, Christensenellaceae R-7 group, and Butyrivibrio. Archaeal community was dominated by genus Methanobrevibacter, which was higher in sesbania incubated in camels and was lower in leucaena incubated in sheep. Microbial function prediction showed that sesbania incubated in sheep was enriched in the pathways of carbohydrate digestion and protein metabolism. Thus, fodder plants such as sesbania that have lower saponins and crude fiber with a proper amount of protein revealed a higher rumen degradability; therefore, these plants can be included in the feeding of the desert ruminants.

AB  - Arthropods can strongly impact ecosystems through pollination, herbivory, predation, and parasitism. As such, characterizing arthropod biodiversity is vital to understanding ecosystem health, functions, and services. Emerging environmental DNA (eDNA) methods targeting trace arthropod eDNA left behind on flowers have the potential to track arthropod biodiversity and interactions. The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which eDNA metabarcoding can identify plant-arthropod and arthropod-arthropod interactions and assess eDNA metabarcoding compared to conventional sampling. We deployed camera traps to document arthropod activity on specific flowers, sampled eDNA from those same flowers, then performed a metabarcoding analysis that targets a partial fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) to determine all arthropod eDNA present. We found that our eDNA metabarcoding analysis detected small arthropod pollinators, plant pests, and parasites, and shed light on potential predator-prey interactions while detecting 55 species compared to just 21 species from conventional camera trapping. The camera trapping survey, however, detected larger, more conspicuous nectarivores more successfully. We also explored the ecology of residual arthropod eDNA, finding that rainfall had a significant negative effect on the ability to detect residual arthropod eDNA. Preliminary evidence also indicates flower species may impact the amount of arthropod eDNA that can be detected. We found that eDNA metabarcoding can provide clues to potential predator-prey interactions on flowers and highlights the potential insights that can be gained from future eDNA metabarcoding studies. We show that eDNA metabarcoding is a valuable tool for not only detecting pollinator communities but for revealing potential interactions among plants, pollinators, pests, parasites, and predators. Future research should focus on how to improve the detection of large pollinators/nectivores and studying the ecology of residual arthropod eDNA to further explore this method's utility.

AB  - Butternut is a relatively uncommon hardwood tree native to eastern North America. The species' abundance has declined over the past 50 years, primarily because of an invasive pathogen (Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum [Oc-j]) and loss of suitable habitat for regeneration. Although genetic diversity of butternut is highest along the southern range edge, genetic diversity rangewide is fairly high, except in small and isolated populations. Although there is little evidence for even moderate resistance in native butternut, hybrids with Japanese walnut, a closely related species, display enough tolerance to infection to persist on the landscape and bear abundant nut crops year after year. Cryostorage of native embryogenic axes has yielded promising initial results as a strategy for gene conservation, but additional action is needed to conserve the remaining native gene pool. We describe a strategy for canker-resistance breeding in butternut using naturally occurring hybrids, hybrids in research orchards, and sources of native trees from as many regions as possible. Forest managers are encouraged to find surviving trees and collect seed for planting in suitable habitat to develop actionable knowledge that will enable the restoration of butternut with enough resistance to be self-sustaining on the landscape.
   Study Implications: We are soliciting help from the forestry community to take these steps to help save butternut: (1) Collect butternuts to propagate and feature in botanic gardens and arboreta. (2) Upload images and locations to TreeSnap, a free mobile phone application developed by scientists at the University of Kentucky and University of Tennessee, so the trees may be used for future breeding efforts. (3) Include butternut in upland plantings in high light environments, especially on sites that can be protected from white-tailed deer. (4) Collaborate with researchers, nonprofit organizations, and breeders to develop actionable knowledge-for example, to improve the canker-resistance screening process and to understand the pathogen's biology.

AB  - The Japanese greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus nippon) is distributed widely in East Asia. Within the species, R. nippon in Northeast Asia is regarded as the lineage that diverged most recently. However, the monophyly of the Japanese populations is unclear due to insufficient data about phylogenetic relationship of the western Japanese populations. To test the monophyly of the Japanese populations of R. nippon, we sampled R. nippon from western Japan and performed a phylogeographic analysis based on mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b and the D-loop. The Northeast Asian lineage consisted of three main clades in eastern Japan (clade I), western Japan (clade II), and the continent as well as the Kumamoto population in westernmost Japan (clade III). The results of this study do not support the monophyly of the Japanese population. The findings suggest the "reverse colonization" of R. nippon from the Japanese Archipelago to the Eurasian continent, and provide important insight into the role of the island system in creation and supply of diversity to the continent.

AB  - Nearshore coastal waters off Northumberland, UK, are important habitats for marine megafauna including marine mammals and seabirds. The area also features extensive anthropogenic activities including shipping, marine renewables development, fisheries, and tourism. Meanwhile there is lack of baseline data on odontocete occurrence to allow assessment of the potential impact from human disturbance. A recent increase in the number of sightings of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the area has provided impetus for new data to inform conservation managers and policy makers. To provide this information, acoustic data were collected using broadband passive acoustic recorders at three sites (Druridge Bay, Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, and St Mary's Island) off the Northumberland coast and analyzed to identify species-specific click trains of common bottlenose dolphin, white-beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Detection data were modelled for each species as detection-positive hours (DPH) using Generalized Additive Models with Generalized Estimating Equations (GAM-GEE) to investigate the effects of environmental covariates, including day of year, diel phase, lunar phase, salinity, year, month and sea surface temperature, and their interaction with location. A total of 20,845 h were recorded during the study resulting in a total of 1660, 71, and 1111 DPH identified for bottlenose dolphin, white-beaked dolphin and porpoise, respectively. The final model for bottlenose dolphins retained all covariates except tidal index and an interaction between location and day of year after model selection and all covariates in the final model were significant. The final model for white-beaked dolphin retained month, year, location, diel index, temperature, lunar index and interactions between location and diel index and all covariates except lunar index were significant. The final model for porpoise retained all covariates and interactions between location and diel phase, day of year, lunar index, and salinity, however, salinity and the interaction between location and lunar index were not significant. Bottlenose dolphin clicks were detected in the area year-round but with two peak periods in occurrence coinciding with May and late September; white-beaked dolphin clicks were detected predominantly in July and August; and porpoise clicks were present year-round but with much greater probability of detection at the Druridge Bay site, where there were peaks in winter and in September. The results of this study provide important information for conservation and management actions that may be needed to reduce anthropogenic pressures on odontocetes in UK waters.

AB  - Wildfire and grazing by invasive herbivores can influence habitat suitability for ground-dwelling fauna, such as reptiles. Australia has a large and diverse reptile fauna, with the Australian Alps bioregion in the southeast of the continent supporting a disproportionately high number of threatened species. In this bioregion, many species are threatened by fire, habitat loss or modification, and invasive species. The range of one such threatened endemic lizard, Cyclodomorphus praealtus (family Scincidae), was impacted by the 2019-20 megafires and is also subject to widespread grazing by invasive species. We investigated the relationship between C. praealtus site occupancy and fire and grazing. We completed 2045 surveys across 120 sites over 4 years, detecting the species at 43% of sites and increasing the species' known geographic range. Using single season detection occupancy models, we found C. praealtus occupancy was not associated with elevation, vegetation height or whether the site was burnt, but was positively associated with grazing activity. Our results indicate that C. praealtus has the capacity to persist following a single fire in some cases, and that habitats with high occupancy probabilities are subject to high grazing pressure. However, our results do not rule out more nuanced impacts associated with these disturbances, which affect a large proportion of C. praealtus' habitat. Our cumulative detection probability calculations revealed that considerable survey effort is often required to determine C. praealtus site occupancy. We therefore recommend that impact assessments assume species presence within areas of suitable habitat within the species' range. Our study improves our understanding of disturbance impacts on C. praealtus' occupancy, while demonstrating the need for sufficiently resourced impact assessments for cryptic and threatened species.

AB  - PurposeSoil bacteria play a vital role in crop growth and production. However, the impact of long-term application of chemical fertilizers or combined with organic manure on the soil bacterial communities (diversity, structure, and co-occurrence patterns) and their relationships with rice (Oryza sativa L.) productivity remains unclear.MethodsA 30-year fertilization trial was conducted in a Chinese paddy field with three treatments of no fertilizer (CK), chemical fertilizer (NPK), chemical fertilizers, and pig manure co-application (NPKM). The co-occurrence network and key species for yield enhancement were investigated in combination with bacterial community structure by high-throughput sequencing.ResultsNPKM treatment significantly increased the contents of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and pH value in the soil. Compared to CK and NPK treatments, NPKM significantly enhanced rice yield by an average of 43.51 and 18.69% in the last 2 years (2019 and 2020). NPKM rather than NPK resulted in a significant increase in bacterial alpha diversity. PCoA showed that both NPKM and NPK substantially shaped bacterial structure. Moreover, three ecological clusters (modules 1, 7, and 9) were observed under the ecological network involving all samples, and modules 1 (negative) and 7 (positive) had strong associations with rice yield. Concretely, Chloroflexi contributed most to the rice yield in module 7. Soil pH, SOM, and TN were the main soil factors affecting bacterial communities and co-occurrence patterns.ConclusionsThese results suggested that long-term organic manure and chemical fertilizer co-application outperforms chemical fertilization in increasing rice productivity through enhancing soil bacterial diversity and harboring more beneficial members in its ecological cluster.

AB  - The yak is a symbol of the Tibetan Plateau and an indispensable livestock resource at high altitudes, with important ecological, economic, and cultural values. When yaks are sick, their excrement can cause serious damage to the highland ecosystem, so real-time monitoring of their health status is essential for ecological conservation. The daily behaviors of yaks, such as eating, lying, standing, and walking, contains a wealth of health information. By recognizing the behavior of yaks using computer vision technology, real-time monitoring of yak health status can be achieved, thus, effectively protecting the ecological environment while maintaining the economic benefits of yak breeding. This study proposes a non-contact yak behavior recognition method based on the SlowFast model. The method uses two paths with different sampling rates (i.e., Slow and Fast) to extract spatial and action features from the input video. The 3D Resnet50 network is selected as the backbone network of the SlowFast dual path after comparative analysis. The size of the 3D convolutional kernel is increased to improve the perceptual field of feature extraction, which in turn effectively improves the recognition accuracy of the algorithm. A total of 318 videos of yaks in different scenes and poses were captured for testing. Six different networks were selected to verify the performance of the proposed method: SlowFast-3DResnet50, SlowFast3DResnet101, SlowFast-3DResnet152, 3DResnet50, C3D, and I3D. The experimental results show that the method achieves 96.6% recognition accuracy, 91.3% recall, and 90.5% precision in classifying the basic behaviors of yaks in natural scenes, and 97.3%, 99.1%, 95.9% and 94.1% for the four basic behaviors, respectively. These results are comprehensively better than the other six methods. In addition, compared with other 3D convolutional neural networks used for video classification, the method proposed in this paper can classify the target behavior from each video frame, which has a broader implications and application. The algorithm meets the needs for basic behavior recognition of yaks and lays the foundation for real-time monitoring of yak health status.

We surveyed over 400 visitors in multiple locations in Namibia, using a discrete choice experiment to elicit preferences for attributes reflecting tracking safaris of the critically endangered, desert-adapted black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis bicornis) in the northwest of the country. Attributes included those related to local community involvement and the benefits they receive from tourism, as well as the reinvestment of tourism profits back into rhino conservation, and the wildlife likely to be seen on safari. Using a latent class model that assigned tourists to market segments based on the observed pattern of responses in the choice experiment, we find that respondents can be divided into four classes that reflect differences in tourism preferences and their own demographics and experiences. While responses to attributes varied across classes, respondents were consistent in demonstrating a strong preference for the largest share of profits being returned to the local community, and were willing to pay an additional $43-670 to ensure this happens. Respondents in the four classes differed in their views toward the financing of rhino conservation and the participation of community trackers in rhino safaris, although those respondents in the class most interested in rhino tracking safaris were willing to pay an additional $34 per trip for tracker involvement. Our results demonstrate the value of assessing heterogeneity in tourists' preferences for wildlife experiences, and suggest that appropriate pricing and marketing may result in "triple bottom line" gains for nature-based tourism.

AB  - Agriculture can alter the nutritional landscape for herbivores in ways that can augment nutritional condition, reproduction, and survival. Ecological benefits associated with human modified landscapes, however, potentially alter environmental cues in ways that appear beneficial but ultimately have negative effects on fitness or population growth. We tested the hypothesis that the expected nutritional benefit of agriculture would come with a tradeoff associated with increased transmission of chronic wasting disease using a partially migratory population of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in northern Wyoming, USA. Agriculture provided a substantial nutritional buffer to resident deer by augmenting nutritional condition in autumn and enhancing recruitment of offspring-a resident that spent 35% of its summer in agriculture had 1.2 percentage points more body fat in December and was 18 percentage points more likely to recruit offspring to December than a resident that spent 15% of its summer in agriculture. During winter, migrants and residents selected for home ranges closer to agriculture, but only residents selected for home ranges overlapping directly with agriculture. Proximity to agriculture in winter, however, decreased adult survival for migrants and residents (29 percentage points decreased probability of survival for every 1-km closer to agriculture) and increased the probability of having CWD at time of death. The nutritional benefits of agriculture likely increase the viability of a resident tactic, but the benefits may be offset if the nutrition gained from using agriculture does not outweigh the risks associated with disease.

AB  - Simple Summary Enteric viruses cause gastroenteritis in humans and animals, but have also been associated with several extraintestinal diseases. These viruses affect a wide range of vertebrate species, including birds and mammals. Frequent and close contact between humans and animals can potentially lead to the emergence of zoonoses. Approximately 60% of zoonotic diseases in humans are spillovers from wildlife. Preventing future outbreaks of emerging zoonotic diseases calls for better description of the viruses that circulate in domestic animals, because they are located at the human/wildlife interface. We therefore screened for the presence of astroviruses, enteroviruses, and caliciviruses-three of the main viral families causing enteric diseases both in humans and animals-in goats, sheep and dogs living in villages in northeastern Gabon. We identified the presence of astroviruses in goats, a calicivirus in a dog, and enteroviruses in all three species. All detected viruses were animal-related, but not those from wildlife. However, we showed that some human-pathogenic enteroviruses infect goats and dogs. Therefore, further studies are required to better understand the role of domestic animals as amplifiers of reverse zoonotic viruses. Astroviruses (AstVs), enteroviruses (EVs), and caliciviruses (CaVs) infect several vertebrate taxa. Transmitted through the fecal-oral route, these enteric viruses are highly resistant and can survive in the environment, thereby increasing their zoonotic potential. Here, we screened for AstVs, EVs, and CaVs to investigate the role of domestic animals in the emergence of zoonoses, because they are situated at the human/wildlife interface, particularly in rural forested areas in Central Africa. Rectal swabs were obtained from 123 goats, 41 sheep, and 76 dogs in 10 villages located in northeastern Gabon. Extracted RNA reverse-transcribed into cDNA was used to detect AstVs, EVs, and CaVs by amplification of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), or capsid protein (VP1) gene using PCR. A total of 23 samples tested positive, including 17 goats for AstVs, 2 goats, 2 sheep, 1 dog for EVs, and 1 dog for CaVs. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that AstV RdRp sequences clustered with sheep-, goat-, or bovine-related AstVs. In addition, one goat and two sheep VP1 sequences clustered with caprine/ovine-related Evs within the Enterovirus G species, and the CaV was a canine vesivirus. However, human-pathogenic Evs, EV-B80 and EV-C99, were detected in goats and dogs, raising questions on the maintenance of viruses able to infect humans.

AB  - Overfishing has the potential to severely disrupt coral reef ecosystems worldwide, while harvesting at more sustainable levels instead can boost fish yield without damaging reefs. The dispersal abilities of reef species mean that coral reefs form highly connected environments, and the viability of reef fish populations depends on spatially explicit processes such as the spillover effect and unauthorized harvesting inside marine protected areas. However, much of the literature on coral conservation and management has only examined overfishing on a local scale, without considering how different spatial patterns of fishing levels can affect reef health both locally and regionally. Here, we simulate a coupled human-environment model to determine how coral and herbivorous reef fish respond to overfishing across multiple spatial scales. We find that coral and reef fish react in opposite ways to habitat fragmentation driven by overfishing, and that a potential spillover effect from marine protected areas into overfished patches helps coral populations far less than it does reef fish. We also show that ongoing economic transitions from fishing to tourism have the potential to revive fish and coral populations over a relatively short timescale, and that large-scale reef recovery is possible even if these transitions only occur locally. Our results show the importance of considering spatial dynamics in marine conservation efforts and demonstrate the ability of economic factors to cause regime shifts in human-environment systems.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms governing biological invasions has implications for population dynamics, biodiversity, and community assembly. The enemy escape hypothesis posits that escape from enemies such as herbivores and predators that were limiting in the native range helps explain rapid spread in the introduced range. While the enemy escape hypothesis has been widely tested aboveground, data limitations have prevented comparisons of belowground mechanisms for invasive and noninvasive introduced species, which limits our understanding of why only some introduced species become invasive. We assessed the role of soil biota in driving plant invasions in a phylogenetic meta-analysis, incorporating phylogeny in the error structure of the models, and comparing live and sterilized conditioned soils. We found 29 studies and 396 effect size estimates across 103 species that compared live and sterilized soils. We found general positive effects of soil biota for plants (0.099, 95% CI = 0.0266, 0.1714), consistent with a role of soil mutualists. The effect size of soil biota among invaders was 3.2x higher than for natives, the strength of effects was weaker for older conditioning species with a longer introduced history, and enemy escape was stronger for distant relatives. In addition, invasive species had a weaker allocation tradeoff than natives. By demonstrating that the net effect of soil biota is more positive for invasive than native and noninvasive introduced species, weakens over time since introduction, and strengthens as phylogenetic distance increasing, we provide mechanistic insights into the considerable role of soil biota in biological invasions, consistent with the predictions of the enemy escape hypothesis.

AB  - Expanding knowledge on natural history of carnivores allows to understand mechanisms species developed for survival and improve decision-making aiming conservation. Studies on eco-morphological aspects of skunks, such Conepatus amazonicus, are scarce and usually based on small sampling size. We assessed roadkill individuals, camera trap records, and biometric data to describe the feeding ecology, activity period, and morphology of striped hog-nosed skunk in agroecosystems and protected areas in Central Brazil. Invertebrates represented critical items in the diet in agroecosystems, and due to an intermediate niche breadth (0.545), skunks could not be classified as specialists or generalists. Males and females have total niche overlap (0.94), and the diversity of items was not affected by proximity to urban centres. Animals develop their activities during the night, with 93% (n = 71) of records from sunset to sunrise. There were significant sex differences in the body masses ( t = - 3.7151; d.f. = 29; P < 0.0001). Males (mean = 2.56 kg) were 30% heavier than females (mean = 1.96 kg), allowing us to infer the existence of sexual dimorphism in C. amazonicus. Foot size and dentition were also larger in males, corroborating the sexual selection hypothesis. Behavioural and morphological adaptations favour predation on insects, prey of low physical resistance, which are also available in agroecosystems. This is the first study to report sexual dimorphism in C. amazonicus. Our results fill a gap in the knowledge of a species that plays a unique role for ecosystem functioning, suggesting that skunks represent the primary medium-sized omnivorous-insectivorous organism occupying the Brazilian Savanna.

AB  - AimTo understand how natural geomorphological features and oil and gas platforms (OG platforms) influence the habitat use and seascape connectivity of the whale shark (Rhincodon typus).LocationEast-Indian Ocean and North-West Australia.MethodsWe compiled a satellite tracking dataset of 78 whale sharks tagged across a 14-year period at Ningaloo Reef and Shark Bay World Heritage Areas in Western Australia to develop spatial networks for the regions of the East-Indian Ocean and North-West Australia. We then applied a Bayesian modelling framework to assess the effects of natural features and OG platforms on spatial patterns and habitat connectivity.ResultsGeomorphological features such as pinnacles, canyons, and seamounts promoted habitat connectivity and strongly influenced the habitat use of whale sharks across both regional (1000's km; East-Indian Ocean) and local (100's km; North-West Australia) spatial scales. In the North-West of Australia, OG platforms had similar effects on habitat use as natural feature types and also enhanced habitat connectivity. The OG platforms most visited by whale sharks were situated close to the edge of the continental shelf and near natural geomorphological features that likely enhance productivity.Main ConclusionOur work identified natural geomorphological features that promoted habitat use and connectivity for whale sharks across oceanic and coastal seascapes. Sharks routinely visited OG platforms, which acted as migratory stepping stones that further enhanced habitat connectivity. Protection of natural feature types that promote habitat use and connectivity could assist conservation management of whale sharks. We suggest that the influence of OG platforms on their movement and habitat use beyond individual structures, should be considered in environmental impact assessments during operation and decommissioning phases.

AB  - Large herbivorous fishes, such as parrotfishes, play a critical role in coral reef ecosystems by limiting the coverage of macroalgae. Yet, in the Colombian Caribbean, parrotfishes are being increasingly targeted for human consumption as the demand for fish increases with tourist numbers. The Colombian Caribbean is dominated by Afro-descendant communities, and music is a deeply rooted form of expression and communication. 'Champeta', the local music folklore, is heard at all times of day and danced continuously in the islands off the coast of Cartagena. We conducted a survey of local tourist and fisheries stakeholders to characterise the parrotfish fishery, and designed a contextualised awareness-raising campaign of the ecological role of parrotfish and the need for management in the Islands of the Corales del Rosario and San Bernardo National Park. In doing so, we test if Champeta could be used as a mechanism for social-ecological change in Caribbean coastal communities in the context of coral reef conservation. Locals were engaged in every aspect of the campaign, especially with the song, as the campaign was a process rooted in their culture, interests and idiosyncrasies. Surveys of restaurants illustrated the size of the fishery and the extent of misinformation surrounding the consumption of parrotfish by tourists. We found that both locals and tourists held misconceptions about the ecological role of parrotfish and were supportive of efforts to protect them.

AB  - Evaluating reintroduction success is fundamental to wildlife management and conservation. Movement affects animal fitness and survival and is the first response of reintroduced animals, making it an excellent indicator of reintroduction success. However, there is limited information on the early post-release movement of reintroduced animals. Here, we addressed this important issue by studying the post-release behaviour of the critically endangered black rhinoceros, Diceros bicornis minor, reintroduced to the Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe, in 2021. We used daytime sighting data collected from 21 rhinoceros for 1.5 years to investigate survival and reproduction, movement patterns and habitat selection after release. We examine how sex, age and different release sites affect the short-term movement behaviour and habitat selection of black rhinos. Rhinos showed progressive and consistent changes in movement patterns and habitat selection, shifting from large-scale movements during the early stages of release to smaller-scale movements after home ranges were established. We found that rhinos released in the large area had larger activity areas with less overlap between individuals and moved further away from the release site (less fidelity to the release site) than the individuals released in the smaller area. These findings confirm the great capacity of black rhinos to adapt to the environment, occupying large ranges when given the opportunity, but populations with smaller ranges can also be viable. Based on our study and a literature review, we stress the importance of longterm monitoring and believe that reserve size, rhino density, fencing, food and water availability, familiarity between conspecifics and human disturbance are key factors in the successful establishment of a rhino population that should be considered in future reintroductions. Finally, the high survival and birth rates in the first 1.5 years after reintroduction, together with most rhinos having established their home range, suggest a successful reintroduction in the short term.

AB  - Accurate high-resolution gridded livestock distribution data are of great significance for the rational utilization of grassland resources, environmental impact assessment, and the sustainable development of animal husbandry. Traditional livestock distribution data are collected at the administrative unit level, which does not provide a sufficiently detailed geographical description of livestock distribution. In this study, we proposed a scheme by integrating high-resolution gridded geographic data and livestock statistics through machine learning regression models to spatially disaggregate the livestock statistics data into 1 km x 1 km spatial resolution. Three machine learning models, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and deep neural network (DNN), were constructed to represent the complex nonlinear relationship between various environmental factors (e.g., land use practice, topography, climate, and socioeconomic factors) and livestock density. By applying the proposed method, we generated a set of 1 km x 1 km spatial distribution maps of cattle and sheep for western China from 2000 to 2015 at five-year intervals. Our projected cattle and sheep distribution maps reveal the spatial heterogeneity structures and change trend of livestock distribution at the grid level from 2000 to 2015. Compared with the traditional census livestock density, the gridded livestock distribution based on DNN has the highest accuracy, with the determinant coefficient (R-2) of 0.75, root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.82 heads/km(2) for cattle, and the R-2 of 0.73, RMSE of 31.38 heads/km(2) for sheep. The accuracy of the RF is slightly lower than the DNN but higher than the SVM. The projection accuracy of the three machine learning models is superior to those of the published Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) datasets. Consequently, deep learning has the potential to be an effective tool for high-resolution gridded livestock projection by combining geographic and census data.

AB  - The role of facilitation in shaping natural communities has primarily been studied in the context of plant assemblages, while its relevance for mobile animals remains less understood. Our study investigates whether reciprocal interspecific facilitation may exist between fire ants (Solenopsis richteri) and cavies (Cavia aperea), two mobile animals, in the SW Atlantic coast brackish marshes. Field samples showed a spatial association between ant mounds and cavies, and that ants prefer to use cavy runways for movement within the marsh. Through experiments involving transplanting the dominant plant, cordgrass (Spartina densiflora), and manipulating cavy presence in areas with and without ant mounds, we observed that cavies forage extensively (and defecate more) near ant mounds. The ants actively remove cavy droppings in their mound vicinity. These ant activities and interactions with cavy droppings led to reduced moisture and organic content while increasing nitrate and phosphate levels in marsh sediment. Consequently, this enhanced plant growth, indirectly facilitating the cavies, which preferred consuming vegetation near ant mounds. These cascading indirect effects persisted over time; even four months after cavies left the marshes, transplanted plants near ant mounds remained larger and exhibited more leaf senescence when exposed to cavy herbivory. Therefore, the networks of positive interactions appear to generate simultaneous selection among species (populations), promoting coexistence within the community. Although complex, these reciprocal facilitative effects among mobile animals may be more common than currently believed and should be further studied to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving species coexistence in natural communities.

AB  - Sufficient genetic variation is vital for the long-term survival of a population. The adaptive potential and reproductive fitness of a population is generally enhanced by greater levels of genetic diversity, while loss of genetic variation in small populations may increase extinction risk due to disease susceptibility and decreased reproductive fitness. Determining levels of genetic diversity in threatened species can, therefore, help inform conservation strategies. The Chinese water deer (Hydropotes inermis) is classified as Vulnerable in its native range on the IUCN Red List, and populations in Korea and mainland China have declined drastically in recent years. However, the species was introduced to Europe about a century ago and populations there now make up over 40% of global numbers. To infer the population genetic structure and genetic diversity of Chinese water deer both in their native China and in populations introduced to the UK and France, variation in mitochondrial DNA was investigated for over 100 individuals (92 cytochrome b and 106 control region sequences). Our results reveal lower levels of genetic diversity in the British populations, differentiation between native and introduced populations, and that the source population of British deer is likely to be extinct. Recommendations are made for the conservation of populations.

AB  - Mountaintop removal coal mining is a source of downstream pollution. Here, we show that mountaintop removal coal mining also pollutes ecosystems downwind. We sampled regional snowpack near the end of winter along a transect of sites located 3-60 km downwind of coal mining in the Elk River valley of British Columbia, Canada. Vast quantities of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), a toxic class of organic contaminants, are emitted and transported atmospherically far from emission sources. Summed PAC (Sigma PAC) snowpack concentrations ranged from 29-94,866 ng/L. Snowpack Sigma PAC loads, which account for variable snowpack depth, ranged from <10 mu g/m(2) at sites >50 km southeast of the mines to >1000 mu g/m(2) at sites in the Elk River valley near mining operations, with one site >15,000 mu g/m(2). Outside of the Elk River valley, snowpack Sigma PAC loads exhibited a clear spatial pattern decreasing away from the mines. The compositional fingerprint of this PAC pollution matches closely with Elk River valley coal. Beyond our study region, modeling results suggest a depositional footprint extending across western Canada and the northwestern United States. These findings carry important implications for receiving ecosystems and for communities located close to mountaintop removal coal mines exposed to air pollution elevated in PACs.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are generally considered a home-ranging species, although northern populations may migrate between summer and winter ranges to balance resource requirements with environmental stressors. We evaluated annual home range characteristics of adult bucks (n = 30) fitted with GPS collars from 2017 to 2021 in central Mississippi with time series segmentation and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to determine if individuals employed varying movement strategies. We found 67% of bucks displayed a "sedentary" strategy characterized by a single KDE home range polygon with a mean size of 361 ha. The remaining 33% of bucks employed a "mobile" strategy characterized by multiple home range segments with a mean size of 6530 ha. Sedentary bucks went on an average of 5.9 excursions annually while mobile bucks went on 0.8. Excursion timing for both strategies peaked in breeding season and early spring. Mobile buck home ranges were separated by a mean distance of 7.1 km and mean duration in one home range segment before traveling to another was 78 days. Our study provides the first evidence that partial migration may apply to a larger proportion of lower-latitude deer populations than originally thought, though the environmental justification for this partial migration is not clear.
   Some white-tailed deer populations are migratory in locations with severe and chronic seasonal resource limitations, but biological justification for such behaviors is lacking at lower latitudes. We document migratory behavior termed the "mobile" movement strategy in 33% of adult male deer in a low-latitude system void of such environmental pressures. Mobile deer had multiple home range segments separated by an average of 7 km and migrated at all times of year.image

AB  - Dispersal and gene flow within an animal population are influenced by the composition and configuration of the landscape. In this study, we characterized the population genetic structures of three coexistent forest duiker species (Cephalophinae) in an approximately 250 km(2) area of Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon. We obtained genotypes of 11 autosomal microsatellite loci and sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial DNA control region (similar to 600 bp). Individual identification analyses using microsatellites showed that we obtained 82 blue, 6 bay, and 15 yellow-backed duiker individuals. In each species, mitochondrial and microsatellite results showed that there were two genetically different subpopulations. A mountainous area was suggested to cause the observed genetic differentiation in the blue duiker, while a river might act as a genetic barrier for yellow-backed duiker. The difference in genetic barriers between the two species might also be explained by the difference in body size. In the blue duiker population, two genetically different subpopulations were suggested to have recently come into contact. This suggests that the population history of blue duiker in Moukalaba may be complex, although duikers were continuously distributed. In this study, using both mitochondrial and microsatellite data, we described the genetic structure of coexistent duikers, suggesting that different landscape features limited gene flow in different species.

AB  - Wetlands occupy 4%-8% of the Earth's terrestrial surface and perform critical ecosystem functions, including water quality and quantity regulation, wildlife habitat provision and carbon storage. 'Vegas', wetlands in Chilean Patagonia, are unique ecosystems that play a vital role in water supply and forage productivity, which are essential for sheep farming, the region's main economic activity. This study aimed to analyse the spatial variability of soil functions, evaluate water dynamics and correlate hydrological behaviour with environmental characteristics in Patagonian Vega. Seven excavation sites were selected along a topographical transect, with soil samples collected at depths of 5, 30, and 80 cm. Sensors were installed to measure soil water content and matric potential. Analyses included WRC, Ka and Ks. Results showed hydric deficits for 84.3% of the evaluation period and a progressive decline in the water table. Air capacity and plant available water varied significantly across topographical positions and depths. Soils on summits and footslopes exhibited higher hydraulic conductivity but lower water retention compared to soils in the centre of the Vega, which remained saturated in deeper horizons. A strong correlation was observed between soil water content and evapotranspiration (ETo), whereas precipitation had minimal influence. Vegas acts as natural sponges, storing and releasing water according to seasonal demands. The central zone of the Vega plays a pivotal role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting forage productivity, while peripheral areas contribute to hydrological flows via surface and subsurface runoff. These results underscore the importance of treating Vegas as protected wetlands and adopting sustainable management strategies to conserve their ecosystem services in the face of climate change and increasing anthropogenic pressures. Patagonian Vegas exhibits significant spatial variability in soil functions, which are critical for water regulation and biodiversity support.

AB  - A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study was carried out to assess the environmental profile of the main Sardinian dairy sheep farming systems, with the scope to provide a detailed and robust baseline for the identification of effective mitigation solutions at farm level and to develop environmental strategies at regional scale. Both product- and area-based functional units (FUs) were adopted, considering sixteen impact categories and soil carbon sequestration estimates as well. Water Use, Climate Change, Land Use, Ecotoxicity Freshwater, Marine Eutrophication and Fossils Resource Use resulted the main impact categories, cumulatively contributing over 80% of the total environmental impact (single score). Environmental performances significantly varied according to the geo-pedological traits of the different sheep milk production areas and were driven by the farming systems' structure and production level. The group of farms located in less fertile areas showed significantly worse environmental performance per kg of normalized milk for the impact categories Climate Change and Land Use, whereas no significant differences were observed for the remaining main impact categories. Considering the area-based FU, this farm group resulted less impacting for all main categories compared to the group of farms located in more plain and productive soils, with a significantly lower impact observed for Marine Eutrophication and Fossils Resource Use. Regardless of the FU used, feed supply management represented a key area of improvement, and soil carbon sequestration impact compensated the high GHG emission intensity of grasslandbased farms despite the limited nutritional value of natural pasture. Regional strategies should be based on ecosystem services optimization and eco-innovative solutions tailored according to both the specific geopedological conditions and the production level of each farming system.

AB  - Simple Summary The European roe deer is the most abundant ungulate in Europe. Information on the number of animals and the factors that influence this are essential for the effective management of this species. We developed a model to estimate the pellet group density using transect surveys of dung pellets in the federal state of Bavaria, south-eastern Germany. We used the pellet group density as a proxy for roe deer relative abundance. Our results show that climate, habitat type and wildlife management approach determine the relative number of roe deer. Influential factors differed between seasons and were expected due to changes in food and shelter availability. Although recognized as a woodland species, the majority of roe deer are expected in agriculture-dominated landscapes, which shows their ability to adapt to a wide range of landscape types, especially those with high food availability. Higher numbers were also predicted in regions with intermediate temperatures. Estimates of relative number do not give the actual absolute number of animals but are useful in determining which conditions will have more or fewer animals and can provide information for broad-scale management recommendations. Our results also provide insights into possible future changes in the distribution of relative numbers of roe deer due to climate and land-use change. European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.) are important given their economic, recreational and ecological value. However, uncontrolled roe deer numbers can result in negative impacts on forest regeneration and agricultural crops, disease transmission and occurrences of deer-vehicle collisions. Information on the abundance and distribution is needed for effective management. We combined distance sampling (DS) of roe deer dung pellet groups with multiple variables to develop a density surface model (DSM) in the federal state of Bavaria in south-eastern Germany. We used the estimates of pellet group density as a proxy for roe deer relative abundance. We extrapolated our best DSM, conducted a quantitative evaluation and contrasted relative abundance along climate and land-use gradients. Relative abundance of roe deer was influenced by a combination of habitat type, climate and wildlife management variables, which differed between seasons and which reflected changes in food and shelter availability. At the landscape scale, the highest abundance was observed in agriculture-dominated areas and the lowest in urban areas. Higher abundance was also observed in areas with intermediate temperatures compared to the warmest areas. Our results provide information on possible future changes in the distribution of relative abundance due to changes in climate and land-use.

AB  - Predation risk largely constrains prey behavior. However, whether predators may be scary also after death remains unexplored. Here, we describe the "fight-and-flight" responses of a prey, the wild boar (Sus scrofa), to carcasses of (a) its main predator, the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and (b) a carnivore that very rarely kills wild boars, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), in the western Alps (Italy). We recorded the behavior of wild boars at 10 wolf and 9 fox carcass sites. We found eight "fight-and-flight" responses toward wolf carcasses, and none toward fox carcasses. Our results suggest that carnivore carcasses may indeed be scary; fear responses toward them are dependent on the species to which the carcass belongs; and animals approaching the carcasses are feared mainly when the latter are relatively fresh. This emphasizes the multiple and complex roles that carrion plays in the landscape of fear and opens exciting ecological, epidemiological, and evolutionary research avenues.

AB  - Seasonal diet shifts and migration are key components of large herbivore population dynamics, but we lack a systematic understanding of how these behaviours are distributed on a macroecological scale. The prevalence of seasonal strategies is likely related to herbivore body size and feeding guild, and may also be influenced by properties of the environment, such as soil nutrient availability and climate seasonality. We evaluated the distribution of seasonal dietary shifts and migration across large-bodied mammalian herbivores and determined how these behaviours related to diet, body size and environment. We found that herbivore strategies were consistently correlated with their traits: seasonal diet shifts were most prevalent among mixed feeding herbivores and migration among grazers and larger herbivores. Seasonality also played a role, particularly for migration, which was more common at higher latitudes. Both dietary shifts and migration were more widespread among extratropical herbivores, which also exhibited more intermediate diets and body sizes. Our findings suggest that strong seasonality in extratropical systems imposes pressure on herbivores, necessitating widespread behavioural responses to navigate seasonal resource bottlenecks. It follows that tropical and extratropical herbivores may have divergent responses to global change, with intensifying herbivore pressure in extratropical systems contrasting with diminishing herbivore pressure in tropical systems.

AB  - A cross sectional survey study aimed to: 1) Identify the management factors associated with the occurrence of salmonellosis in some diarrheic sheep and goats belonging to mixed reared flocks in Giza governorate, Egypt, 2) Investigate the presence of enterotoxin (stn) gene in the recovered Salmonella spp. strains, and 3) Build a phylogenetic tree for the partial codon sequence of stn gene of some recovered strains in order to provide a scientific basis for the implementation of practical preventive measures. A total number of 518 diarrheic sheep and goats belonging to 7 mixed flocks of sheep and goats were enrolled and from which rectal swabs were collected and subjected to culture for Salmonella spp. Enterotoxin (stn) gene was detected using polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR), and the PCR amplicons of nine randomly selected strains were purified, sequenced and deposited in the GenBank. The obtained data about disease occurrence were statistically analyzed using Chi-square test in order to identify disease-associated factors. The overall prevalence of salmonellosis among diarrheic sheep and goats was 3.86%, and the disease prevalence per each flock ranged from 0% to 7.55%. The factors that were found to be associated with disease occurrence included, absence of isolation of newly-purchased animals and isolation pen for sick animals, over the counter use of antimicrobials, lack of disinfection of feeding utensils and water troughs, and presence of rodents in feed storage area. Enterotoxin (stn) gene was detected in all recovered salmonellae, and the phylogenic analysis of stn gene of the selected strains and the retrieved sequences from GenBank showed the relatedness of the isolated strains to the other strains isolated from different sources. Accordingly, the analysis of disease associated factors and the robust phylogeny findings provide valuable data that will be useful for implementation of preventive measures for salmonellosis in small ruminants.

AB  - Desert kites are communal game traps that were used to harvest herds of ungulates, and there are more than 6000 in the arid zones of southwestern Asia. The oldest were dated to the 9th millennium cal B.C. and some were reused until the beginning of the 20th century. A wide range of types and dimensions is found throughout the region, but only the small V-shaped type is found in the cultural landscape of the Timnian, a Mid-Holocene culture in the southern Levantine deserts. The Timnian economy was based on nomadic pastoralism, rearing small herds of goats/sheep. In the southern Levantine deserts, pastoralism had to be augmented by other carbohydrate sources. It is apparent that the Timnians invested much effort and resources in kite construction to hunt ungulates; however, faunal assemblages from habitation camps, burial fields and ceremonial complexes show very few bones of hunted game. Here we test two competing hypotheses: the use of kites to augment food supply, versus the use of kites for social or ceremonial purposes. We review the Timnian culture, the local kites, and cost-benefits considerations, as well as issues regarding desert pastoralism. We conclude that the kites were mostly used in social and ceremonial contexts.

AB  - Reef fish assemblages under fishing pressure generally exhibit a lower fish biomass, abundance, and size structure, which can be counteracted with the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs). The effectiveness of MPAs relies on enforcement and compliance, which is particularly challenging in developing countries with financial and socioeconomic limitations. By combining underwater visual surveys (UVS) and baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS), we determined the abundance, size distribution, and biomass of economic (e.g., target and ornamental species) and ecological (e.g., small/large predators and herbivorous) indicator fish groups inside and outside a no-take MPA from the north Pacific coast of Costa Rica. The biomass of economic fish groups was not affected by protection, yet overall abundance and size distribution of fishes differed between no-take and open-fishing zones. These results suggest that although illegal fishing may be occurring inside the MPA, there are at least partial benefits of protection on particular groups within the fish assemblage. Herbivores and ornamental fishes, two groups that are targeted by the artisanal compressor fishery and by the aquarium trade, respectively, had higher biomass and were more abundant inside the no-take MPA. Additionally, large shark species (e.g., Galeocerdo cuvier, Carcharhinus leucas, C. limbatus) were only present inside the MPA. Habitat quality was particularly important for ornamental fishes which showed higher biomass in areas with high coral cover. Our study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that, even with limited enforcement, MPAs still provide ecological benefits for reef fish assemblages.

AB  - BackgroundUnderstanding the macroscale patterns of rodent herbivory damage and their driving factors are essential for effective rodent management. This study examines how climatic factors and human activities influence the large-scale spatial distribution of rodent herbivory damage in forests of China.ResultsI utilized a unique long-term province-level dataset of rodent damage in China to map its extent across the country. A generalized linear mixed model was employed to analyze the relationship between rodent damage, and climatic variables, and human population density (HPD). The results reveal a clear spatial pattern of rodent herbivory damage in China's forests, primarily driven by HPD and precipitation of the warmest quarter, with a secondary influence of diurnal temperature range. These three variables explained approximately 58% of the variation in the geographic pattern of rodent herbivory damage in China's forests. Specifically, rodent damage was negatively correlated with both precipitation of the warmest quarter and HPD. Higher precipitation during the warmest quarter (often as rainstorms) probably exacerbates rodent mortality through flooding their burrows and imposing thermal stress, while higher HPD probably increases predation pressure, further lowering rodent populations. Additionally, rodent damage was positively related to diurnal temperature range, likely because greater diurnal temperature fluctuations impose greater thermal stress on their predator, thereby enhancing rodent survival. Consequently, regions in northwestern China that are arid, experience high diurnal temperature fluctuations and have low human populations, are particularly vulnerable to severe rodent damage. In contrast, southern and southeastern China, with higher precipitation, milder temperature fluctuations, and denser human populations, experience significantly lower rodent damage.ConclusionThe findings suggest that the combination of precipitation during the warmest quarter, diurnal temperature range, and HPD can serve as effective indicators of rodent pest severity in forests. This underscores the need for proactive surveillance and management in arid regions with high diurnal temperature fluctuations and low population densities worldwide.

AB  - Animals adjust their habitat use patterns in response to changes in their physiological needs and environmental conditions. Understanding the mechanisms underlying resource selection and space use across time and space reveals effects of the environment on animals' decisions. We explored the effects of habitat availability and heterogeneity on the seasonal and annual space use and resource selection of two free-roaming feral burro (Equus asinus) populations in the United States within distinct climate and habitat conditions: the Sonoran Desert and the Colorado Plateau. As an introduced yet protected species in the United States, understanding burros' interactions with habitat elements is important for their conservation and management, as well as the conservation of sympatric wildlife. We used GPS locations of female burros (72 animals across both study areas) to delineate annual and seasonal ranges and resource selection patterns. We evaluated effects of mean and CV of habitat covariates, including forage, distance to water, and topography, representing availability and heterogeneity of resources, on seasonal and annual range size of burros. Moreover, we explored how burro seasonal and annual resource selection patterns were affected by availability and heterogeneity of resources. In the Sonoran Desert study area, burros had smaller seasonal and annual ranges and constant resource selection patterns across a year, likely due to a freshwater lake in the area, making water a nonlimiting resource. Human presence was the greatest factor affecting range size and resource selection in the Sonoran Desert, where burros selected for areas near roads and human recreation. In the Colorado Plateau study area, where resources were more seasonal, we found larger range sizes and fluctuating resource selection patterns compared to the Sonoran Desert population. Spatial variation in forage, water, and topography significantly affected range size of burros inhabiting the Colorado Plateau study area. Productive habitats with available water support smaller ranges and a more consistent pattern of resource selection. Our results highlight the positive effect of habitat heterogeneity and the negative effect of habitat productivity on range size of animals. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of habitat requirements for free-roaming burros that currently live under various climate and habitat conditions globally.

AB  - The red deer Cervus elephus has been a common species in Italy until the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, when its distribution range started to considerably decrease, due to gradual deforestation and hunting pressure. Afterwards, the red deer has been reintroduced to many regions of the world, including Italy. In the Italian Apennines, the Acquerino-Cantagallo Natural Reserve (ACQUERINO) hosts one of the largest peninsular red deer populations, originated from a series of successful reintroductions. In this study, we meant to detect the level of genetic variability of Acquerino-Cantagallo Natural Reserve deer population and to investigate the genetic relationships with the other Italian and European populations. We identified five mitochondrial DNA control region (D-loop) haplotypes, four falling in lineage A and one falling in lineage C, derived from at least two maternal lineages, confirming that ACQUERINO population should be the result of multiple reintroductions. Haplotype diversity (H = 0.50) and nucleotide (pi = 0.004) diversity were low, but included into the deer range values. ACQUERINO population showed low levels of genetic diversity when compared to other European and Mediterranean populations, confirming that this expanding population may have been generated from a low number of founders.

AB  - The ecological model of female social relationships predicts variation in female social behaviour based on variation in environmental factors. When resources are abundant, females should exhibit poorly defined affiliative and dominance relationships. If resources are clumped, female-bonded societies should emerge with despotic age-size-based or nepotistic dominance relationships. African elephants (Loxodonta sp.) contradict socioecological theory. Despite feeding primarily on abundant herbaceous vegetation, female savannah elephants, Loxodonta africana, exhibit age-size-based despotic dominance relationships, while female forest elephants, Loxodonta cyclotis, rely heavily on clumped resources and form weak social bonds as females disperse from their natal groups to forage in small groups. Here we provide first insights into dominance relationships among female forest elephants based on displacement interactions over access to small monopolizable mineral pits at the Dzanga Bai forest clearing in Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African Republic. We found that body size, but not relatedness, determined the outcome of displacement interactions and resulting dominance rank relationships. Tall females were more likely to initiate displacements and had higher ranks compared to short females. Relatedness had no influence on a female's ability to displace another, and related females were not more similar in rank compared to nonrelated females. Our results suggest that female forest elephants exhibit size-based despotic dominance relationships, similar to savannah elephants, despite the two species relying on vastly different resources. The discrepancy with the socioecological model suggests it may not be entirely applicable to elephants. As proposed for various well-armoured herbivore species, including savannah elephants, despotic dominance relationships may emerge in forest elephants to reduce the risk of injury during low-gain competitive interactions. Further studies are needed to disentangle the effects of resource distribution and the risk of injury on dominance relationships in the genus Loxodonta.

AB  - Livestock grazing supports a considerable amount of economic activity across the United States. Federal grazing permits support numerous ranching operations by providing relatively low-cost grazing on federal lands. While grazing supports employment, labor income, and economic activity within a given state, the extent to which federal grazing permits play a role remains uncertain. In this paper we develop a method for estimating state-level economic contributions of livestock grazing for cattle grazing, as well as sheep and goat grazing, that is applicable to both the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. We report state-level direct response coefficients, defined as the economic effects per 1 000 animal unit months of grazing use. We apply our coefficients to grazing lands for both US Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to estimate state-level economic contributions of federal grazing, finding that the economic effects of federal grazing are highest in western states where there are large amounts of public land. The measures of economic impact produced in this study were developed for consistent nationwide analyses. These measures may be used by researchers and land managers for conducting policy impacts and analysis of livestock grazing (e.g., increases or decreases of permitted grazing on public land) but are not intended to replace project- or site-specific economic analyses.

AB  - Forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii Flerov), a critically endangered ruminant species, faces extinction risks, with captive populations further threatened by prevalent digestive and immune disorders. This study utilized comparative metagenomic sequencing to assess intestinal microbiota structure and functional profiles between wild populations in Chongqing and Hunan and captive individuals. Wild populations exhibited a Pseudomonadota-dominated gut microbiota (significantly more abundant than in captive counterparts), enriched with lignin-degrading genera Novosphingobium and Acinetobacter. In contrast, the captive group demonstrated increased abundances of Bacillota/Bacteroidota, alongside abnormal proliferation of Escherichia and Clostridium. Both alpha and beta diversity analyses confirmed significant compositional divergences among the three groups, with wild populations maintaining higher diversity than captive populations. Notably, while substantial disparities in microbial abundance existed between wild populations (attributed to habitat vegetation differences), core microbial diversity and carbohydrate metabolic functions exhibited convergence. Functional analyses marked divergences in metabolic pathways: Captive microbiota showed enrichment in translation and glycan metabolism pathways, whereas wild populations displayed pronounced enrichment in immune regulation and environmental sensing pathways. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for optimizing wild population conservation strategies and developing science-based captive management protocols.

AB  - The elephant population in the Kruger National Park (KNP) has been increasing since the cessation of culling in the mid-1990s. This contrasts with recent trends in elephant populations in many parts of Africa where poaching continues to decrease numbers. Logistic growth theory predicts that increased competition for vital resources when densities increase should serve to constrain population growth, implying a negative density-growth correlation. We tested this prediction using 28 years of elephant census data to investigate how the growth of the KNP's elephant population responds to increasing elephant density from the period 1985 to 2012. We expected a spatially variable population growth pattern in response to the distribution of elephant densities in the park and thus classified the park into zones with low, medium or high long-term (28 years) average, dry-season elephant density. Zones were named 'peripheral', 'semi-peripheral' and 'core' zones, respectively, and represent proxies of resource availability to elephant herds. Using a Stochastic Ricker growth model, we tested for the presence of negative density-dependence in population growth in the core versus peripheral zones. In response, we only detected density-dependent growth in the core zone. Overall the population grew at 4.1% per year, coupled with local recruitment rates that increased over time, particularly in the peripheral zones. These density-dependent trends support previous observations of homogenisation of elephant distribution and density across the KNP landscapes.
   Conservation implications: Density-dependent changes to elephant growth rates are scale-dependent (local vs. park level). Only core areas with long-term high density show signs of density-dependent growth. Overall, the distributions of elephants are homogenising in the KNP. Conservation authorities should monitor the impact of such homogenisation to landscape heterogeneity. The spatial variation of the negative density-growth correlation, especially between the core and peripheral zones, can be considered when developing effective strategies to manage the KNP elephant population.

AB  - The genus Sarcocystis contains around 200 species and 25 of these infect snakes. Two Sarcocystis spp. shed by snakes have called special attention of the scientific community. S. nesbitti, which is shed by scrub pythons (Simalia amethistina), causes myopathy in humans that consume water or food contaminated with the parasite. Sporocysts of S. singaporensis, excreted by reticulated pythons (Malayopython reticulatus), is letal for rats and was successfully tested in the biological control of these rodents. A high biodiversity of snakes is found in Brazil, however, scarce information is available about Sarcocystis spp. in Brazilian snakes. Herein, we investigated Sarcocystis sp. in feces of the common boa (Boa constrictor) from Salvador, as it is widely distributed in Brazil and it is also bred in other countries. Feces of 65 boas were examined, and Sarcocystis sp. was found in 1/65 (1.53%) snakes. All snakes were alive, and for this reason, intestinal scrapping, which is the most sensitive method to detect the parasite, was not performed. Morphometric evaluation of sporocysts showed significant differences in their sizes. PCR and multilocus sequencing of four genetic markers (cox1, 18S, ITS1, and 28S) revealed that sporocysts corresponded to a new Sarcocystis species. Sequences of cox1 and 18S had identities of 100% and higher than 98%, respectively, with sequences obtained from the rodent Lagostomus maximus in Argentina. ITS1 and 28S sequences did not match with any known Sarcocystis sp. No ITS1 and 28S sequences were available for the Sarcocystis sp. found in the Argentinian L. maximus. Bioassay using the boa sporocysts was conducted in three mouse lineages and in Rattus norvegicus, but no parasitic stages were detected in these rodents. We concluded that the common boa is probably the definitive host of a new species of Sarcocystis sp. that has L. maximus or related rodents as intermediate hosts.

AB  - The whitespotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari) is a highly mobile, predatory batoid distributed throughout shallow, warm-temperate to tropical Atlantic Basin waters from North Carolina to Brazil. The species' strong, plate-like dentition facilitates the consumption of hard-shelled prey, and due to effective winnowing behavior, it is a significant challenge to identify prey based on soft tissues alone. Here, we report on the first analysis of whitespotted eagle ray diet in Florida waters using visual-based gut content analysis complemented with DNA barcoding. Gut contents were obtained via gastric lavage from 50 individuals collected in the Indian River Lagoon and off Sarasota, Florida. Of the 211 unique prey samples collected, 167 were deemed suitable for sequencing. Approximately 56.3% of samples yielded positive species matches in genetic databases. Results from the sequenced data indicate that the whitespotted eagle ray diet in Florida is mainly comprised of bivalves and gastropods, with variable inclusion of crustaceans. Despite positive identification of venerid clams, there was no evidence for the consumption of hard clams (Mercenaria spp.), a major shellfish aquaculture and restoration species in Florida. Such wide-ranging prey species from various trophic guilds and locations highlight the whitespotted eagle ray's diverse role in the top-down regulation of coastal benthic communities.

AB  - The health of wildlife plays a crucial role in population demography by connecting habitat and physiology. Southern mountain caribou, a population of woodland caribou ( Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1978)) found in the mountains of southwest Canada, are facing significant threats. We evaluated the health of the Klinse-Za subpopulation within the central group of southern mountain caribou, which is part of an Indigenous-led conservation initiative aimed at enhancing caribou population growth through seasonal maternal penning. We collected health metrics from 46 female Klinse-Za caribou between 2014 and 2021. The health metrics included trace minerals, cortisol, biomarkers for inflammation, and pathogen prevalence. We compared these health metrics between penned and non-penned animals, reproductive and non-reproductive females, and nearby subpopulations. We provide correlative evidence linking reproductive success to trace nutrients but find no evidence for relationships with stress, exposure to pathogens, or biomarkers of inflammation. Based on the health metrics considered, Klinse-Za caribou were generally healthy relative to neighboring subpopulations and repeat capture for penning did not appear to create accumulated health issues. Penned caribou had lower fecal cortisol levels and inflammation markers compared to free-ranging animals. This work provides a baseline assessment of southern mountain caribou health and provides guidance on maternal penning activities in support of caribou recovery.

FX  - We thank editor Mark Brigham, reviewer Thomas Jung, and an anonymous reviewer for their helpful suggestions to im-prove the accuracy and clarity of this manuscript. This project is closely integrated with the Klinse-Za maternity pen project and therefore owes much to the people and organizations that support this large and complex endeavor. Since many of the samples used come from the capture session, we would like to acknowledge the support provided by the similar to 25 individuals (helicopter pilots, veterinarians, government biologists, First Nations Lands Office staff, and contract biologists) during the capture and transport of adult females that oc-curs each March, from 2014 to present. This team performs the delicate job of handling each caribou in the most pro-fessional and humane manner possible. Especially, we thank the Nikanese Wah tzee Stewardship Society and its directors for their continued, unwavering support for the recovery of caribou in the traditional territories of Treaty 8 First Nations. For help with project conception, development, and technical guidance, we are deeply grateful to Dr. Helen Schwantje. In carrying out the finicky work of organizing samples and data, we would like to thank the staff members of Wildlife Infometrics Inc. and the BC Wildlife Health branch, especially Shari Willmott and Amelie Mathieu for making the long trek to get samples from Mackenzie, and to Shari and Meave for expert and patient management of databases and physical samples. We thank Kristin Bondo, Susan Kutz, and the BC Health Program for sharing the BC boreal caribou data with us. We are very grateful for the financial support of the Nikanese Wah tzee Stewardship Society, Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation, Canadian Mountain Network, Liber Ero Fellowship, Mitacs Canada, Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program, Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative, and Environment and Climate Change Canada. Your contri-butions have allowed us to finally launch something that has been years of questions and pen-side conversations in the making.

AB  - Climate change impacts on species and ecosystem functioning may depend on climatic context and study systems. Climate warming and intensified herbivory are two stressors to plants that often appear in combination and are predicted to increase in cold environments. Effects of multiple drivers on plant performance are difficult to predict and warrant studies that use experimental manipulations along climatic gradients to produce more realistic knowledge. Our three study sites by the Sognefjord in Norway, that differed mainly in climatic conditions (ca. 5 degrees C growing season difference), ranged from hemi-boreal lowland (100 masl, Low), via boreal mid-montane (500 masl) to alpine timberline (900 masl, High) bioclimates. At each site, in a randomized block design, we simulated growing-season warming using open-top chambers (OTCs) and experimentally induced herbivory resistance using the plant hormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA). We recorded growth, mortality, flower and fruit numbers, and insect herbivory on tagged ramets in permanent plots across three years (2016-2018) in three open woodland populations of two functionally important plant species with contrasting traits, Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry) and V. vitis-idaea (lingonberry). Growth of both dwarf shrubs decreased with warming in the warm lowland populations (Low) but increased in the alpine populations (High). Shoot mortality increased most with warming at Low but was reduced at High. Reproduction, both flowering and fruiting, decreased with induced resistance treatment, but the effect was larger when warmed for bilberry and increased with elevation for both species. Leaf herbivory in bilberry increased with warming at Low but decreased at High. The combined warming and resistance treatment had only synergistic negative interaction effects on fruit numbers in bilberry. The clear context- and species-dependent effects of climate warming and increased resistance in this study may predict a potential decline in performance, as well as abundance and distribution, of these functionally important Vaccinium species at our lowest site. Bilberry reproduction appeared to be particularly susceptible to both climate warming and induced resistance in the manipulated populations. Such combined negative effects on plant performance are likely to have considerable knock-on effects via altered species' interactions and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - In Finland, the wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) lives on the northernmost edge of the species' distribution range, and the population mainly originates from individuals immigrating from Russia. Most of the current population lives in the southeastern part of the country, and the wild boar is steadily expanding further. To develop effective risk and population management in novel northern wild boar regions, detailed information about the species' local ecology is required. To estimate wild boar movement patterns, 17 adult wild boars were monitored using GPS collars from May 2020 to September 2022 in the core region of the current distribution. The average total home ranges of wild boars (87.1 & PLUSMN; 17 km2 MCP, 33 & PLUSMN; 5.5 SE km2 95% KDE) were larger compared with studies from southern latitudes. The length of nocturnal activity times varied seasonally. All studied individuals at the border zone (N = 15) showed continuous transboundary movements, with home range core areas located mainly on the Russian side. Wild boar locations were predominantly in the Russia border zone, especially resting sites during the daytime. Most locations in Finland were from night-time feeding excursions. Our study shows that, although home ranges are large, adult wild boars are relatively sedentary also in northern latitudes. However, the movement capacity of the species enables the transboundary spread of diseases such as African swine fever. Our results provide information for risk management and emphasize the importance of transboundary collaboration in the monitoring and management of common wild boar populations.

AB  - The abundance of hard ticks can be determined by abiotic factors and the presence of suitable hosts. Since deer represent important hosts for many tick species, it is imperative to investigate whether deer introduction will increase the number of ticks, which can transmit a wide variety of pathogens. The sika deer (Cervus nippon) was introduced to Green Island, Taiwan, to supply velvet antlers, a traditional Chinese medicine. However, they were later released into the wild after a steep decline in antler prices. We conducted surveys for questing ticks, ticks on rodents and shrews, and the fecal pellet groups of ungulates (deer and goats) in 31 transects within 3 habitat types (forest, grassland, and roadside) on Green Island every 2 months in 2019. A total of 5,321 questing ticks were collected. All collected ticks were Haemaphysalis mageshimaensis Saito and Hoogstraal, a species first identified on an island with an abundance of sika deer. Additionally, 48 ticks collected from 126 trapped rodents and shrews were almost invariably Ixodes granulatus (except for 1 larval Haemaphysalis sp.). We did not find a positive correlation between the number of questing ticks and the number of fecal pellet groups, suggesting that factors other than ungulate abundance affect tick abundance. Nevertheless, large populations of questing ticks along some roadsides suggest a high risk of tick-borne diseases to tourists on this tropical island.

AB  - Partial migration is a common strategy in marine fishes, enhancing resilience through diversified movement patterns that buffer the effects of environmental changes. A key ecological outcome of migration behaviour is growth variability, which provides insights into the adaptive value of different migratory strategies. Using otolith back-calculation, we investigated how growth patterns of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) in the Gulf St. Lawrence (Canada) varied among resident and migratory individuals whose migration histories were determined previously via otolith chemistry. Von Bertalanffy growth models fitted with nonlinear mixed-effects models revealed that migrants exhibited faster growth rates and greater theoretical maximum lengths compared to residents of both sexes, with significant differences in length-at-age emerging from the age of six. However, both contingents showed good condition, with no differences in relative condition. Overall, growth differences likely reflect the benefits of warmer temperatures and increased prey abundance or quality in shallow summer habitats for migrants, contrasted with potential increased competition in denser halibut populations in deeper channels. Overall, this observed difference in growth suggests that increased habitat quality in shallow areas can overcompensate for energy costs associated with an annual migration, which can exceed 1000 km. The complex growth dynamics between migratory and resident contingents highlight the challenges of managing species with partial migration, where specific components may disproportionately contribute to stock biomass, particularly in the context of changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Remoras are a highly specialised group of fishes known to associate with a range of marine megafauna, including elasmobranchs, cetaceans and marine reptiles. Remoras appear to benefit from these interspecific interactions through consumption of host dermal parasites or reduced cost of transport. Shark-remora associations are widely documented, yet our understanding of the costs and benefits involved in these interactions is poor. Studies frequently make claims about mutualistic, commensalistic or parasitic relationships without providing the necessary quantitative information necessary to make these claims. Here I explain why this approach is problematic, and proceed to examine shark-remora interactions in a rigorous eco-evolutionary framework. These interactions cannot be properly classified without considering net evolutionary fitness and context dependence. In reality, shark-remora interactions are best defined by a multidimensional spectrum of fitness consequences, with net fitness outcomes shifting between mutualism and parasitism (and vice versa) through space and time.

AB  - Connectivity among conservation areas helps to alleviate the negative impacts of habitat fragmentation. Mouflon (Ovis gmelini) as a near threatened species has an unclear habitat connectivity status among conservation areas in the west of Iran. This study was carried out on mouflon with the aim of modeling the habitat suitability and connectivity among core habitats in the west of Iran. An ensemble of three machine-learning models and a factorial least-cost path were used for identifying core habitats and corridors between them, respectively. Our results revealed that grassland density, elevation, slope and distance to roads were the most influential variables for predicting the occurrence of mouflon in the study area. Five core habitats were identified for mouflon in the study area, about 90% of which was covered by conservation areas. The core habitat in the north of the study area is the highest priority for conservation. Conservation areas in the northern and western parts of the study area had the best connectivity for mouflon. To prevent mouflon poaching, the protection of corridors among conservation areas should be considered. In addition, predicted corridors of connectivity modeling in areas crossed by roads, could be investigated for the conservation of mouflon by wildlife managers.

AB  - The consequences of non-native species invasion may depend on the characteristics of the invaded ecosystem, such as abiotic environmental conditions and biological community structure. Invasive herbivores can have a substantial adverse impact on the abundance of submerged macrophytes and trigger declines in water quality. Although previous research has posited that shallow lakes with higher nutrient conditions might exhibit greater susceptibility to non-native herbivores, empirical support for this claim remains limited. In this study, we employed 24 mesocosms to simulate shallow water ecosystems, with the primary objective of assessing the influence of invasive herbivorous apple snails (Pomacea canaliculata) on submerged macrophyte and phytoplankton abundance under two distinct nutrient conditions. Our findings indicate that moderate nutrient enrichment alone promoted submerged macrophyte growth, leading to a 156% increase in total biomass in the nutrient-enriched treatment compared to the control (low-nutrient conditions without apple snails). However, the introduction of apple snails caused a significant reduction in submerged macrophyte biomass in both nutrient conditions, approximately 100% loss in low-nutrient conditions and a roughly 50% loss in moderately nutrient-enriched conditions. Additionally, the presence of apple snails slightly increased phytoplankton abundance (similar to 57 chl-a mu g/l for phytoplankton and similar to 2 mu g/l chl-a for cyanobacteria) under low-nutrient conditions, while triggering a shift to a turbid state dominated by planktonic algae (similar to 270 chl-a mu g/l for phytoplankton and similar to 36 mu g/l chl-a for cyanobacteria) under moderately nutrient-enriched conditions. These results emphasize the need for effective management strategies to control invasive herbivores and decrease nutrient inputs.

AB  - The last statewide survey of hard ticks in Alabama was in 1972. To address this deficit, we examined the distribution of the medically important species across the state, Ixodes scapularis (Say), Dermacentor variabilis (Say), Amblyomma americanum (L.), and A. maculatum (Koch), between April, 2018 and February, 2021. Collections primarily involved dragging (April to July) and examination of harvested deer (November to February). A total of 2,927 ticks was collected from 110 sites; three species, I. scapularis, A. americanum, and D. variabilis, represented 91.70% of all ticks collected. Amblyomma americanum and D. variabilis were the most common species encountered in drags; I. scapularis dominated deer collections. Dermacentor variabilis was never found on deer, whereas D. albipictus was only found on deer. Stepwise regression (AIC) of drag data was linked to several site variables. Results suggest a linear response along a south (low abundance) to north (high abundance) gradient, in addition to increased abundance at sites with lower temperatures and greater precipitation and canopy cover.

AB  - It has long been hypothesised that introduced species can evolve to become better competitors, which in turn will enable some of them to become invasive. The evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis (EICA) gives a possible answer for why some introduced plants become invasive by stating that they can escape natural coevolved enemies (pests, pathogens and herbivores) in their new environment, thus allowing them to shift resource allocation from producing expensive chemical defences, towards a higher growth rate and competitive ability. In order to test if there is evidence for increased competitive ability in introduced populations, we examined the performance of three Rumex species (R. obtusifolius, R. crispus and R. conglomeratus, Polygonaceae) from their native (United Kingdom) and introduced ranges (New Zealand), when grown alone and in competition with a conspecific from the same or a different provenance. Based on the predictions of EICA, we hypothesised that plants from the introduced provenance would: (i) have a faster growth rate and a larger biomass at harvest; and (ii) would perform better in competition with a conspecific from the native provenance than one from the introduced provenance. Intraspecific competition reduced biomass by as much as 50%. However, contrary to expectations, we found no difference between the performance of plants from native and introduced provenances when grown in direct competition with each other. Plant performance when grown with a conspecific from the same provenance was similar to performance when paired with one from a different provenance, showing that there was no provenance effect. These results were consistent for all three Rumex species. Our findings contradict the predictions of the EICA hypothesis suggesting that other factors are needed to explain the success of Rumex species in New Zealand.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms that govern microbial community assembly across a soil-plant continuum is crucial for predicting the responses of ecosystems to environmental changes. However, the impact of the health status of plants on microbial assemblies across these continuums remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the stochastic and deterministic processes associated with different aggregate particles and Camellia oleifera growth stages (sapling, maturity, and degeneration periods). The composition of bacterial communities in C. oleifera soil was significantly affected by cultivation length and aggregate size, and cultivation length plays a more important role in the regulation of bacterial composition. The assembly processes of the bacterial community were dominated by deterministic processes in soil aggregates at different growth stages. Soil structurality determined soil alpha-diversity and beta-diversity to a greater extent than soil nutrient content. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms of soil bacterial community in different soil aggregates and C. oleifera plantation lengths and highlights the significance of soil physical properties to mediate soil microbial community composition and abundance.

AB  - The forests of the Congo Basin are an important home to some of the world's most critically endangered species, including the central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and the forest elephant (Loxodanta cyclotis). To contribute to the long-term sustainability of these species and their habitats within the Dzanga Sangha Protected Areas (DSPA) in the Central African Republic, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) developed an ecological monitoring program to assess the spatial drivers of species' habitat changes. Here, we assess and quantify chimpanzee, gorilla and elephant habitat suitability within the DSPA using data from two survey years (2015 and 2020), to identify priority habitat areas and recommend conservation measures to mitigate ongoing habitat changes. We found that priority chimpanzee habitats covered about 1383 km2 (30 %) of the entire DSPA in the year 2015, while priority gorilla and elephant habitats covered approximately 2569 km2 (56 %) and 3075 km2 (67 %) respectively. Priority habitat area for the three species declined by 4, 4.5 % and 9.8 % points respectively between 2015 and 2020, mostly due to increased human pressures. We further provide evidence that the Dzanga National Park represents a region of higher priority habitat for all three species owing to the reduced human pressure that has resulted from higher eco-guard patrol efforts. Based on our analysis, we recommend maintaining a nonviolent patrol presence to mitigate human pressures within remaining priority habitat areas, recognizing also the importance of collaboration with local communities to support long-term conservation goals.

AB  - In contrast to old-growth forests, early-successional stands remain understudied despite potentially harbouring species of conservation interest. With this work, focused on hazel grouse Tetrastes bonasia, a cryptic and indicator species known to select for close-to-natural forests, we evaluated winter densities, home range, microhabitat selection and diet, combining DNA-based mark-recapture and metabarcoding from faecal samples. In total, 216 droppings, collected over 2 years along forest transects in the Italian Alps, were successfully genotyped and 43 individuals were identified. Density estimates were similar to values reported by other studies in the Alps with an average of 4.5 and 2.4 individuals/km(2) in the first and second study year, respectively, and mean home ranges estimated at 0.95 km(2). According to habitat selection models and eDNA-based diet analysis, hazel grouse selected early-succession secondary-growth forests formed after the abandonment of traditional agropastoral activities. These forests, mostly composed of hazel Corylus avellana, Norway spruce Picea abies and Sorbus spp., provided winter food resources and shelter. The diet analysis also highlighted forest arthropods as a non-negligible source of food. Birds avoided areas subject to intensive browsing by ungulates; small forest roads seasonally closed to traffic had positive influence on hazel grouse (i.e. higher abundance of droppings), while roads open to traffic had no effect. Importantly, despite the high coverage of mature forest habitats of Community Interest (53% of our study area), droppings were more abundant in non-listed early-succession secondary forests with similar plant composition. Our results suggest that forest succession after agropastoral abandonment may be beneficial for some forest birds of conservation interest, while acknowledging its negative effects on the previous grassland biodiversity.

AB  - The lower abundance, biomass, and homogenization of sizes of herbivorous fish caused by overfishing may lead to a disproportionate loss of functions. The present work explores to which extent fishing affects species niche and functions by comparing the isotopic niche breadth and redundancy and resource use in a herbivorous fish community. While the video analysis was not able to discriminate large differences in feeding preferences, all ate preferentially the epilithic algal matrix (EAM), the SIA suggests that within the marine protected area (MPA) fish may be feeding on more diverse sources (greater amplitude of isotopic niche) and have more overlapping niches (greater redundancy). Corroborating with works that claim that the delimitation of MPAs can contribute to the redundancy of functions and resilience of coral reefs. For clarifying if fish are using (preying on or digesting) different resource species or same, the species in different environments with different basal SI values would definitively need to have a better isotopic characterization of resources within the MPA. Our work contributes to new discoveries that have implications for the conservation of coral reefs, as fishing appears not only to affect the biomass and body size of herbivorous fish but also reduces the trophic niche of fish species, compromising many of their ecological functions.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate possible systematic effects in the basic underlying variability of individual metabolomic data. In this context, the extent of gender- and genotype-dependent differences reflected in the metabolic composition of three tissues in fattening pigs was determined. The 40 pigs belonged to the genotypes PIx(LWxGL) and PIxGL with gilts and boars, respectively. Blood and tissue samples from M. longissimus dorsi and liver were directly taken at the slaughtering plant and directed to GC x GC qMS metabolite analysis. Differences were observed for various metabolite classes like amino acids, fatty acids, sugars, or organic acids. Gender-specific differences were much more pronounced than genotype-related differences, which could be due to the close genetic relation of the fattening pigs. However, the metabolic dimorphism between gilts and boars was found to be genotype-dependent, and vice versa metabolic differences between genotypes were found to be gender-dependent. Most interestingly, integration into metabolic pathways revealed different patterns for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) usage in boars and gilts. We suppose a stronger N-recycling and increased energy metabolism in boars, whereas, in gilts, more N is presumably excreted and remaining carbon skeletons channeled into lipogenesis. Associations of metabolites to meat quality factors confirmed the applicability of metabolomics approaches for a better understanding about the impact of drivers (e.g., gender, age, breed) on physiological processes influencing meat quality. Due to the huge complexity of the drivers-traits-network, the derivation of independent biomarkers for meat quality prediction will hardly be possible.

AB  - Scavenging is a pervasive foraging strategy among vertebrates, yet researchers have only recently begun to reveal the complex implications of scavenging dynamics. Scavenging studies have predominantly used lower trophic level (i.e., herbivore) species as carrion bait, and the few studies that have used higher trophic level (i.e., carnivore) carrion have found these carcass types are generally avoided by vertebrates or scavenged by fewer species than similarly sized herbivore carcasses. No studies have assessed the fate of carcasses of obligate scavengers. To investigate potential differences in scavenging dynamics among avian carrion representing different guilds and trophic levels, we conducted scavenging trials using 20 replicates of two obligate scavenger species (i.e. black vulture, Coragyps atratus; turkey vulture, Cathartes aura) and two lower trophic level species, chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Carcass trials were conducted at the Savannah River Site, SC, USA, and monitored with remote cameras. We hypothesized carcasses of vultures would persist longer and have a distinct scavenging community compared to lower trophic level carcasses (mallard and chicken). As expected, turkey and black vulture carcasses persisted in the environment longer, were less likely to be entirely consumed by vertebrate scavengers, and had a different scavenging community than mallard and chicken carcasses. These results contribute to the growing body of evidence suggesting higher trophic level carrion is exploited differently by vertebrate scavengers. Our findings suggest nutrients derived from vulture carcasses are likely largely reincorporated into lower trophic levels.

AB  - Phyllospadix spp. play a crucial role in the supply of ecosystem services in rocky shores, but they have been rapidly reduced because of natural and anthropogenic causes. Since Phyllospadix spp. are attached to rocks in the surf zone with a strong hydrodynamic condition, their transplanted shoots easily disappear due to the high current velocity, resulting in the failure of transplantation. We described a leaf trimming method for transplanting shoots of surfgrass Phyllospadix iwatensis and evaluated the method's establishment success for potential use in large-scale restoration projects. A 30-day laboratory experiment was conducted to determine the effect of leaf trimming on shoot survival, growth, and physiology. Successful establishment of new patches from shoots transplanted with the leaf trimming method was assessed through a shoot-transplanting field experiment over 15 months. The survival of P. iwatensis shoots was not significantly affected by the leaf trimming proportion of 10%-60%. The leaf elongation rate and total leaf area of the shoots exposed to 10%-50% leaf trimming reached or exceeded those of the control at the end of the laboratory experiment; however, the growth of the shoots under 60% leaf trimming was significantly lower than those under the control (p < 0.05). The soluble sugar and starch contents of the shoots also displayed a similar trend to the growth, with the lowest values attained at 60% of leaf trimming. The survival rate of shoots exposed to 50% leaf trimming treatment was 70% after 15 months following transplantation, which was 1.23 times higher than that of shoots in the control (p < 0.05). The shoot height in the 50% leaf trimming treatment was 1.02 times higher than that of shoots in the control at the end of the field experiment. There were no significant differences in photosynthetic pigment contents of P. iwatensis shoots between the leaf trimming treatment and the control (p > 0.05). Our study suggested that the leaf trimming method is an efficient restoration technique for the transplantation of P. iwatensis shoots, and is potentially useful in facilitating large-scale restoration projects.

AB  - There is an increasing likelihood that invasive plants are again exposed to their co-evolved specialist herbivores in the non-native range. However, whether there is a latitudinal pattern associated with the resistance of an invasive plant to its co-evolved herbivores and how soil microbes affect resistance has been little explored. We hypothesized that the resistance of invasive Solidago canadensis to its co-evolved insect herbivore Corythucha marmorata could increase with latitude, and that local rhizosphere microbes could facilitate invasive plants to become resistant to their co-evolved herbivores. We conducted a field survey and a greenhouse experiment to examine whether there was a latitudinal pattern in the abundance of C. marmorata and in the damage it caused to S. canadensis in China. We tested whether local rhizosphere microbes of invasive plants can promote the resistance of S. canadensis to C. marmorata herbivory. In the field survey, both density of C. marmorata and damage level of S. canadensis were positively correlated with latitude, and with S. canadensis plant growth, indicating a latitudinal pattern in the resistance of S. canadensis to C. marmorata. However, in the greenhouse experiment, S. canadensis from different latitudes did not suffer significantly from different levels of damage from C. marmorata. Additionally, the damage level of S. canadensis was lower when rhizosphere soil and rhizomes originated from field S. canadensis with same damage level than with different damage levels. This result indicates that local rhizosphere soil microbes promote the adaptation of S. canadensis to resistance of C. marmorata.

AB  - In Australia, fire has become part of the natural ecosystem. Severe fires have devastated Australia's unique forest ecosystems due to the global climate change. In this study, we integrated a multi-resolution segmentation method and a hierarchical classification framework based on expert-based knowledge to classify the burned areas and land-uses in Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Using an object-based image classification framework that combines colour and shape features from input layers, we demonstrated that the objects segmented from the multi-source data lead to a higher accuracy in classification with an overall accuracy of 90.2% and a kappa coefficient of 85.2%. On the other hand, the single source data from post-fire Landsat-8 imagery showed an overall accuracy of 87.4% which is also statistically acceptable. According to our experiment results, more than 30.44% of the study area was burned during the 2019-2020 'Black-Summer' fire season in Australia. Among the burned areas, high severity accounted for 12.14%, moderate severity for 11.48%, while low severity was 6.82%. For unburned areas, farmland accounted for 45.52% of the study area, of which about one-third was affected by the disturbances other than fire. The remaining area consists of 19.42% unaffected forest, 3.48% building and bare land, and 1.14% water. The comparison analysis shows that our object-based image classification framework takes full advantage of the multi-source data and generates the edges of burned areas more clearly, which contributes to the improved fire management and control.

AB  - Context. West African crocodylian populations are declining and in need of conservation action. Surveys and other monitoring methods are critical components of crocodile conservation programs; however, surveys are often hindered by logistical, financial and detectability constraints. Increasingly used in wildlife monitoring programs, drones can enhance monitoring and conservation efficacy.
   Aims. This study aimed to determine a standard drone crocodylian survey protocol and evaluate the drones as a tool to survey the diverse crocodylian assemblage of West Africa.
   Methods. We surveyed crocodile populations in Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, and Niger in 2017 and 2018, by using the DJI Phantom 4 Pro drone and via traditional diurnal and nocturnal spotlight surveys. We used a series of test flights to first evaluate the impact of drones on crocodylian behaviour and determine standard flight parameters that optimise detectability. We then, consecutively, implemented the three survey methods at 23 sites to compare the efficacy of drones against traditional crocodylian survey methods.
   Key results. Crocodylus suchus can be closely approached (>10 m altitude) and consumer-grade drones do not elicit flight responses in West African large mammals and birds at altitudes of >40-60 m. Altitude and other flight parameters did not affect detectability, because high-resolution photos allowed accurate counting. Observer experience, field conditions (e.g. wind, sun reflection), and site characteristics (e.g. vegetation, homogeneity) all significantly affected detectability. Drone-based crocodylian surveys should be implemented from 40 m altitude in the first third of the day. Comparing survey methods, drones performed better than did traditional diurnal surveys but worse than standard nocturnal spotlight counts. The latter not only detected more individuals, but also a greater size-class diversity. However, drone surveys provide advantages over traditional methods, including precise size estimation, less disturbance, and the ability to cover greater and more remote areas. Drone survey photos allow for repeatable and quantifiable habitat assessments, detection of encroachment and other illegal activities, and leave a permanent record.
   Conclusions. Overall, drones offer a valuable and cost-effective alternative for surveying crocodylian populations with compelling secondary benefits, although they may not be suitable in all cases and for all species.
   Implications. We propose a standardised and optimised protocol for drone-based crocodylian surveys that could be used for sustainable conservation programs of crocodylians in West Africa and globally.

AB  - Livestock depredation is an important source of conflict for many terrestrial large carnivore species. Understanding the foraging behavior of large carnivores on domestic prey is therefore important for both mitigating conflict and conserving threatened carnivore populations. Handling time is an important, albeit often overlooked, component of predatory behavior, as it directly influences access to food biomass, which can affect predator foraging efficiency and subsequent kill rates. We used long-term data on snow leopards (Panthera uncia) in Mongolia (Asia) and Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in Norway (Europe) to examine how large carnivore foraging patterns varied between domestic and wild prey, and how the different landscape characteristics affected those patterns. Our results suggest handling time was generally shorter for domestic compared to wild prey. For snow leopards, rugged terrain was linked to increased handling time for larger prey. For lynx, handling time increased with terrain ruggedness for domestic, but not wild, prey, and was greater in closed compared to open habitats. There were also other differences in snow leopard and lynx foraging behavior, e.g., snow leopards also stayed longer at, and remained closer to, their kill sites than lynx. Shorter handling time suggests that felids may have utilized domestic prey less effectively than wild prey, i.e., they spent less time consuming their prey. This could a) result in an energetic or fitness cost related to decreased felid foraging efficiency caused by the risk of anthropogenic disturbance, or b) exacerbate conflict if reduced handling time associated with easy prey results in increased livestock depredation.

AB  - The European rabbit plays a major role in seed dispersal in its native environment. We evaluated its ecological interactions with plants through the dispersal of seeds by endozoochory in two invaded arid ecotones of Argentina. We found 855 whole seeds in 1283 fecal pellets, belonging to one non-native (Sesuvium portulacastrum) and five native plants (Arjona sp., Fabiana denudata, Frankenia juniperoides, Lycium chilensis, Poa sp.). Our results indicate that the European rabbit is a legitimate disperser of F. juniperoides, L. chilensis, and S. portulacastrum by the consumption and dissemination of viable seeds. Contrastingly, the rabbit is an illegitimate disperser of Arjona sp., F. denudata, and Poa sp. Our study identifies new interactions between an invasive herbivore and sympatric plants in the arid ecosystems of Argentina. We put forth that the mutualistic interaction between the European rabbit and both native and non-native plants highlights the complexity of trophic networks in invaded environments.

AB  - Over the last decade, a large effort has been made to understand how extreme climate events disrupt species interactions. Yet, it is unclear how these events affect plants and herbivores directly, via metabolic changes, and indirectly, via their subsequent altered interaction. We exposed common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) and monarch caterpillars (Danaus plexippus) to control (26:14 degrees C, day:night) or heat wave (HW) conditions (36:24 degrees C, day:night) for 4 days and then moved each organism to a new control or HW partner to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of heat exposure on each organism. We found that the HW directly benefited plants in terms of growth and defence expression (increased latex exudation and total cardenolides) and insect her'bivores through faster larval development. Conversely, indirect HW effects caused both plant latex and total cardenolides to decrease after subsequent herbivory. Nonetheless, increasing trends of more toxic cardenolides and lower leaf nutritional quality after herbivory by HW caterpillars likely led to reduced plant damage compared to controls. Our findings reveal that indirect impacts of HWs may play a greater role in shaping plant-herbivore interactions via changes in key physiological traits, providing valuable understanding of how ecological interactions may proceed in a changing world.

AB  - Simple Summary Ruminants, as widely distributed herbivorous animals, have developed various adaptive nutrition strategies in response to environmental changes. As a typical mountain ruminant, blue sheep have a strong adaptability to the environment. In order to understand the changing patterns in the digestive tracts of blue sheep, the morphological characteristics and physiological indexes of the digestive tract structure were determined. Our conclusion is that blue sheep have adopted the nutritional strategy of roughage feeders. In order to adapt to environmental changes, blue sheep adopt fast feeding and fast excretion modes to allow feeding on large amounts of plants, mainly those with high cellulose content, low nutrient quality, and those that are easy to access. Our results can serve as a basis for studying the digestive system adaptation of other ruminants. Constant adaptation to environmental changes is required by ruminants to allow them to adapt to different ecological niches and feeding habits. In addition, the morphology and function of ruminant digestive systems reveal some adaptive evolutionary characteristics. Blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) display a variety of morpho-physiological adaptations that are typical of grazers. In this study, we collected 64 adult blue sheep samples (whole animal carcasses) from the Helan Mountains, China, during different seasons. The external morphological parameters, digestive system morphological indexes, and rumen surface enlargement factors were determined. Our results reveal that the rumen and reticulum weights were positively correlated with the body weight (p = 0.004), while the food channel aperture, intestinal length, and weight of the blue sheep digestive tract presented no significant differences between different seasons (p > 0.05) and sexes (p > 0.05). There were significant differences (p < 0.001) in the density, length, and width of mastoids, and the rumen surface enlargement factor was 2.85 +/- 1.37, which is typical of roughage feeders. The nutritional and ecological characteristics of blue sheep represent obvious morphological and physiological adaptations to an herbivorous diet. Adopting a quick foraging strategy allows blue sheep to rapidly consume and excrete large amounts of feed, thus obtaining the required energy for their activities and facilitating better adaption to environmental changes.

AB  - Species that depend on anthropogenic waste for food can remove pathogens that pose health risks to humans and livestock, thereby saving lives and money. Quantifying these benefits is rare, yet can lead to innovative conservation solutions. To assess these benefits, we examined the feeding ecology and population size of peri-urban spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta in Mekelle, Ethiopia. We integrated these field data into a disease transmission model to predict: (a) the number of anthrax and bovine tuberculosis (bTB) infections arising in humans and livestock from infected carcass waste and (b) the costs associated with treating these infections and losing livestock. We compared these public health and economic outcomes under two scenarios: (a) hyenas are present and (b) the counterfactual, hyenas are absent. We estimated that hyenas annually remove 4.2% (207 tonnes) of the total carcass waste disposed of by residents and businesses in Mekelle. Furthermore, the scavenging behaviour of hyenas annually prevents five infections of anthrax and bTB in humans, and 140 infections in cattle, sheep and goats. This disease control service potentially saves USD 52,165 due to the treatment costs and livestock loss avoided. Synthesis and applications. This human-hyena interaction in Ethiopia is evidence that large carnivores can contribute to human health and economy. To retain these benefits and maintain tolerance of hyenas, we recommend introducing education programmes to promote safe outdoor behaviour around hyenas, training watchdogs to alert residents of hyena presence, constructing bomas to protect livestock from hyena attacks, and preserving the hyenas' access to carcass waste to reduce their dependency on livestock predation. With humans and carnivores coming more frequently into contact, understanding and communicating how these species can benefit humanity will be critical to motivating human-carnivore coexistence worldwide.

AB  - Background The wild boar (Sus scrofa) was extinct in Sweden when a few animals established in the 1970s. Over the past 35 years, the species has made a substantial comeback. In this paper, we analyse wild boar population growth using three indices of population size. We also map the legislative decisions and research prompted by the expanding population. We discuss to what extent, in the eyes of the state, the view of wild boar and the management focus has shifted over time, from a perceived pest (eradication) to scarce (conservation), overabundant (reduction/control) or somewhere in between (sustainable management). Results Wild boar harvest started in the early 1990s with a few hundred animals annually and peaked at 161,000 in 2020/2021. The distribution now comprises most of southern Sweden. Analyses of harvest and traffic accidents involving wild boar showed that the population grew exponentially until 2010/2011, after which the increase levelled off. Thus, logistic growth models showed the best fit for the full study period. We recorded 38 legislative decisions or commissions to government agencies regarding wild boar. The first decision in 1981 was to eradicate the free-ranging population. In 1987 however, the parliament decided that wild boar is native to Sweden and should be allowed in restricted extent. Later decisions mainly concerned hunting regulations and hunting methods as direct means to increase harvest and regulate the population. Another topic, increasing in importance over time, was to facilitate the use of wild boar meat to indirectly stimulate harvest. A local outbreak of African swine fever in 2023 necessitated a stamping out strategy in the affected area. We found 44 scientific papers regarding the present free-ranging population. Topics include movements and feeding patterns, hunting, reproduction, and population development. Conclusions The state historically regarded wild boar as a pest to be eradicated. This changed with the decision that wild boar should be allowed in restricted extent, suggesting a conservation approach. In response to population growth, the focus shifted to means facilitating sustainable management and, lately, reducing growth. The story of wild boar in Sweden illustrates attempts to mitigate conflicts and balance interests in wildlife management.

AB  - Species co-existence depends on how organisms utilize their environment and resources. Little is known about the winter diet composition and sympatric co-existence of South China sika deer and its companion species in Taohongling. In this study, high-throughput sequencing and metabarcoding trnL were used to study the diet composition and interspecific relationship including sika deer, Reeve's muntjac, and Chi-nese hare. Our results show that 203 genera in 90 families are contained in the diet of sika deer, 203 genera in 95 families for Reeve's muntjac, and 163 genera in 75 families for Chinese hare. Sika deer fed on Rubus chingii, Loropetalum chinense, and Eurya japonica in winter, accounting for 75.30%; Reeve's muntjac con-sumed mainly R. chingii, E. japonica, and Euonymus grandiflorus, accounting for 68.80%, and Chinese hare mainly fed on R. chingii, Smilax china, and Rhus chinensis, accounting for 41.98%. The Shannon index showed no significant difference between groups (p > 0.05). The NMDS analysis found consider-able overlap among three species. Sika deer and Reeve's muntjac consumed similar forage plants but varied greatly in Chinese hare, which occupied the widest choice in winter, resulting in higher diet breadth and increased dietary divergence, thereby reducing competition and facilitating coexistence. The diet niche overlap index among them, as represented by Pianka's index, ranging from 0.62 between sika deer and Chinese hare to 0.83 between sika deer and Reeve's muntjac, which indicated a more similar niche and potential competition in closely related species. Our findings provide a new diet perspective of three her-bivores, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of resource partitioning and species coexistence.

AB  - Arctic marine mammals live in a rapidly changing environment due to the amplified effects of global warming. Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) have responded to declines in Arctic sea-ice extent by increasingly hauling out on land farther from their benthic foraging habitat. Energy models can be useful for better understanding the potential implications of changes in behavior on body condition and reproduction but require behavior-specific metabolic rates. Here we measured the resting metabolic rates (RMR) of three captive, adult female Pacific walruses through breath-by-breath respirometry when fed and fasted resting out of water (sitting and lying down) and while fed resting in water. RMR in and out of water were positively related with pretrial energy intake when not fasted and 25% higher than RMR when walruses were fasted and out of water. Overall, RMR was higher than previously estimated for this species. Fasting RMR out of water was only 25% lower than subsurface swimming metabolic rates suggestive of relatively efficient swimming in adult females. Our results identify the importance of considering feeding status and species-specific differences in affecting metabolic costs. Further research is needed to better understand potential energetic costs of thermoregulation at temperatures experienced by wild walruses.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects domestic pigs and wild boars worldwide. For efficient and accurate ASF management, identification of potential wild boar habitats and current ASF-managed areas is crucial. In this study, we used ensemble species distribution models to estimate the potential habitats of wild boar and ASF-managed areas. We aimed to identify areas of disparity between wild boar habitats and managed areas to identify potential risk areas for ASF transmission. Additionally, we expect that this study will ensure effective management.Abstract African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease affecting both domestic and wild boars. Since its first outbreak in South Korea in 2019, substantial efforts have been made to prevent ASF transmission by reducing the wild boar population and eliminating infected carcasses; however, the persistence of ASF transmission has posed challenges to these efforts. To improve ASF management strategies, the limitations of current management strategies must be identified by considering disparities between wild boar habitats and ASF-managed areas with environmental and anthropogenic characteristics of wild boars and their management strategies. Here, ensemble species distribution models were used to estimate wild boar habitats and potential ASF-managed areas, with elevation, distance to urban areas, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as important variables. Binary maps of wild boar habitats and potential ASF-managed areas were generated using the maxSSS as the threshold criterion. Disparity areas of ASF management were identified by overlying regions evaluated as wild boar habitats with those not classified as ASF-managed areas. Dense forests near urban regions like Chungcheongbuk-do, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do were evaluated as disparity areas having high risk of ASF transmission. These findings hold significant potential for refining ASF management strategies and establishing proactive control measures.

AB  - Roadside mineral licks form when road salt used to de-ice highways in winter runs off road surfaces and accumulates in roadside ditches. Some ungulates are attracted to these roadside licks as they seek to satisfy their mineral requirements. Within the distribution of moose (Ales alces (Lintmeus,1758)) in North America, motorists often encounter moose visiting roadside licks in mid-summer, with many jurisdictions reporting summer peaks in moose-vehicle collisions (MVCs) at these locations. We used camera traps to monitor the moose visitation of 22 roadside locations (including roadside licks, roadside ponds, and dry roadsides) in central British Columbia, Canada, from December 2009 to July 2020. We tested the efficacy of treatment (decommissioning) methods used to reduce moose visitation to roadside licks and roughly estimated decommissioning costs. Moose visitation to roadside licks was greatest from May to July. As we hypothesized, untreated licks were visited more often by moose than decommissioned licks, roadside ponds (absence of road salt), and dry roadsides. Decommissioning roadside licks by replacing or mixing lick waters and soils with materials, such as riprap, cedar mulch, pine logs, or dog (Canis lupus familiaris Linnaeus, 1758) fur and human (Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758) hair, is an effective and inexpensive means of reducing moose visitations to roadside areas and should increase motorist safety where roadside licks are visited by moose.

AB  - There is competition for land between Maasai pastoralists and the park agency in the Serengeti ecosystem. The park agency wants to use the land for wildlife conservation while the pastoralist community wants to use it for livestock grazing. Predatory wildlife kills livestock while herbivorous wildlife competes with livestock for water and grazing. In retaliation, the Maasai hunt predators and grazers to protect their livestock and also to supply the black market for wildlife products. With both the Maasai and animal populations growing, increased conflicts are inevitable. This paper develops a bioeconomic model with three animal species to analyse the optimal combination of pastoral activities and wildlife conservation in the Serengeti ecosystem. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle, the market problem for each agent is optimized and compared to the social planner's outcome. Results show that the market solutions are suboptimal because of negative externalities affecting both agents and inadequate regard to biodiversity conservation values. Mathematical simulations of the bioeconomic model are used to generate a solution in which the Maasai pastoralists and park agency can optimally share the land for their mutual benefit. The policy implication is that the government should establish an independent regulatory institution with a primary mandate of balancing the contested socioeconomic and ecological needs of stakeholders in prime ecosystems such as the Serengeti.
   Both pastoralists and park agencies must limit the amount of effort engaged in extensive livestock production and wildlife conservation, as this translates into increased demand for land by either party.In terms of welfare, a combination of antipoaching effort by the parks agency and poaching effort by the pastoralists that exceed optimum levels results in a decrease in social welfare.Increasing extensive livestock production entails greater demand for grazing space, which must be offset by a reduction in protected acreage; this, too, poses a risk of species extinction.Given that the current size of the Serengeti's wildlife stock may be near optimal, the goal of wildlife policy should be to simultaneously reduce the incentives for resource managers to exert excessive antipoaching effort to maintain a healthy wildlife population while also reducing incentives for the pastoralist community to overstock livestock.

AB  - Premise of research. Brahea edulis is an endangered palm endemic to the oceanic island of Guadalupe, Mexico, with a small population of just about 4000 individuals; it was chronically grazed by goats for about two centuries. The evolutionary specificities of insular biotas provide unique scenarios for studying the roles of geography, demography, and climate in driving population divergence. A comprehensive comparison between insular and mainland sister species contributes to a much better understanding of the species-specific responses to the ecological drivers of diversity, divergence, and speciation. Methodology. Here we used a comparative approach coupled with genomic (genotyping by sequencing; single-nucleotide polymorphisms) data to analyze samples from island and mainland Brahea palm species and elucidate their diversity, population divergence, and demographic history. Pivotal results. Genetic diversity analyses revealed higher diversity in insular palms compared with their mainland sister species. Genetic relationships among palm individuals on Guadalupe Island resulted in two strongly diverged clusters that reflected their geographic distributions. Divergence among B. edulis populations was mostly driven by the joint effect of low migration and the climatic heterogeneity of the island's conditions. Using approximate Bayesian analysis, we further evaluated the demographic history of B. edulis. We found the genetic signatures of demographic fluctuations, inferring an effective population size (N-e) reduction that occurred in the late Quaternary and relatively low current N-e. Conclusions. These findings contribute to the ever-growing body of evidence that low genetic diversity in island populations cannot always be generalized. Besides, genetic diversity and differentiation on islands are more likely to be species specific and are strongly influenced by population size and historical factors such as the time since the population was established, ecological characteristics of the island, and anthropogenic impact. Our results also represent groundwork for future conservation and restoration programs for this endangered insular palm species.

AB  - The ocelot, Leopardus pardalis, is one of the opportunistic predators of the tropical forests that includes birds, small and medium mammals, amphibians and reptiles in its diet. Aiming to observe its behaviour within its natural habitat, 10 cameras were installed in 10 mineral licks within the Yasuni National Park (Ecuador). Both images and videos of ocelot predation events were collected. Hence, the frequency of activity of this specie was determined with the register of captures obtained. Three events are described: the first one, an image of an ocelot stalking a Mazama deer was taken, while in the second scene, a video of stalking an anuran was obtained and in the third event, a video of the ocelot capturing a flying bat was recorded. The use of camera traps allowed us to collect valuable behavioural information about this feline and provide evidence of the importance of the mineral licks for this and other wild species.

AB  - Promoting arthropod biodiversity to increase ecosystem services through ecological intensification is a challenge for agriculture. And recent evidence suggests that standard pesticide applications not only harm natural enemies but may also fail to deliver long-term pest control solutions. To fuel ecological intensification and build predictive frameworks for pest management incorporating estimates of pest abundance, natural enemy abundance and their associated interactions is essential. Within this framework, there is a need to shift the focus from a single pest and predator to consider the community of predatory arthropods that interact with communities of prey. We took a network-based approach to investigate community interactions of predatory arthropods that feed on key pests and alternative prey in cotton over a three-year period. We merged prey activity, generalist predator communities collected from cotton canopies, and reconstructed trophic interactions with DNA detection frequencies estimated from molecular gut content analysis. Overall, many predator diets overlap, resulting in similar foraging patterns on groups of cotton pests. Moreover, predation on key cotton pests, such as stink bugs and white flies, was low. Therefore, ecological intensification that increases specialized arthropod predators within the community should improve biological control service delivery.

AB  - Conflicts between wildlife and humans are a major ecological issue. During migration, wildlife, especially wildebeest, often encounter significant environmental pressures from human activities. However, relatively few studies have been conducted to provide a concise, quantitative description of wildebeest migration in the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR). In this study, we identified changes in the location of the wildebeest population over time in the Maasai Mara National Reserve. We then used a K-means algorithm (R2 = 0.926) to fit coordinates representing the changes in the location of the wildebeests to enable a quantitative representation of their migration routes. Subsequently, we developed an environmental stress model to assess the changes in environmental stresses faced by wildebeests along their migration routes. We proposed a model of "migratory ecological corridors and customized buffer zones" and determined the response coefficient T_res. We used the response coefficients T_res = 0.06, 0.09, and 0.12 as the critical values to categorize the areas along the routes into weak, medium, and strong response regions. Then, we set the width of the buffer zones on both sides of the routes as 5 km, 7 km, and 9 km, respectively, and evaluated the buffer effect. This type of model achieved a good effect of reducing the environmental pressure by 54.06%. The "Migratory Ecological Corridor and Customized Buffer Zone" model demonstrated a high degree of economic feasibility while showing good practicality in mitigating the environmental conflicts between humans and migratory wildlife. The variability in the environmental pressures across the region indicates that the Nairobi and Nakuru districts may be undergoing a particular stage of urbanization that unleashes potential threats to the migration of wildebeests. Further research is essential to assess the feasibility of larger buffer zones.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Decomposition is a complex process that involves several factors, such as temperature, pH, humidity, and microbes. Microbes play a significant role in the carcass decomposition process. Microcosm burial set-ups were prepared and poultry carcasses were decomposed for 60 days in unsterilized and sterilized soil, incubated under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The moisture content, pH, alpha and beta diversity were affected by the soil microbial community and oxygen availability during the decomposition of poultry carcasses. The bacterial taxa composition was also altered during the poultry carcass decomposition. These changes suggested that the soil with an intact microbial community and oxygen availability influenced the bacterial community structure during the decomposition of poultry carcasses. The results of this study provided information on the different bacterial species which might be associated with the decomposition of poultry carcasses.& nbsp;The impact of soil with an intact microbial community and oxygen availability on moisture content, soil pH, and bacterial communities during decomposition of poultry carcasses was investigated. Poultry carcasses were decomposed in soil with or without a microbial community, under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The samples collected in each microcosm burial set-up were analyzed by targeted 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and Amplicon sequence variants (ASV) method. Our results showed that moisture was high in the burial set-ups under anaerobic conditions and pH was high in the burial set-ups under aerobic conditions. Meanwhile, the Chao1 and Shannon index significantly differed between the different burial set-ups and across different time points. In addition, bacterial taxa composition during the early period of decomposition differed from that of the late period. A total of 23 phyla, 901 genera, and 1992 species were identified. Firmicutes was the most dominant phyla in all burial set-ups throughout the decomposition. At day 60, Pseudogracilibacillus was dominant in the burial set-ups under aerobic conditions, while Lentibacillus dominated in the burial set-ups under anaerobic conditions. This study demonstrated that the soil microbial community and availability of oxygen significantly affected the changes in moisture content, pH, and bacterial composition during the decomposition process.

AB  - Expansion of feral burro (Equus asinus) populations across the southwestern United States is causing human-wildlife conflicts including rangeland degradation, competition with livestock and native species, and burro-vehicle collisions. On the Fort Irwin National Training Center (NTC) in California, feral burros interfere with military training and are involved in vehicle collisions and other conflicts (e.g., burros blocking access to buildings). Limited data on burro movements and resource use poses a challenge for the development of management plans and mitigation strategies. We estimated home range size, second- and third-order seasonal resource selection, and water dependency of 10 adult female feral burros fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars on the NTC from November 2015 to April 2017. Mean 95% autocorrelated kernel home range size of female burros (253.9 +/- 30.7 km(2) [SE]) did not differ among seasons or between burros that resided close to or far from urban areas. Burros selected areas closer to water in all seasons and at both spatial scales, but selection was stronger in the dry season and at the landscape scale. When available, burros strongly selected for areas closer to urban areas. Burros consistently selected for areas with green forage and at lower elevations, but selection for other topographical features was variable. Water use patterns were consistent with the resource selection results. Burros visited water sources twice as often (every 22.2 +/- 6.3 hr) during the hot-dry season (Apr-Oct) compared to the cool-wet seasons (Nov-Mar; 2015: 45.9 +/- 21.0; 2016: 39.7 +/- 9.3 hr). Our results suggest that urban areas, and resources therein, and water sources have the biggest influence on burro resource selection, and management plans could focus mitigation programs on these areas.

AB  - Marine heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNANs) are important grazers of picoplankton, yet knowledge on how prey type and temperature may affect HNAN feeding ecology remains limited. The relationship of temperature with growth rate, ingestion rate and gross growth efficiency was investigated for a HNAN feeding on either heterotrophic bacteria or the picoeukaryote Ostreococcus lucimarinus at 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C, seasonal average temperatures typical in temperate North Carolina waters from which the organism originated. We found that the HNAN yielded similar growth (d-1) across the varying temperature regimes independent of diet, while gross growth efficiency was linked to differences in prey type. The HNAN ingestion rate (pg C HNAN-1 d-1) were strongly impacted by temperature, prey type and prey C concentrations with an interactive effect between temperature and prey type. Our study provides insight into individual picoplankton-HNAN trophic interactions in relation to varied temperature and prey environments and is meant to contribute to a better understanding of species-specific microbial dynamics which remain insufficiently detailed.

AB  - The present study examined the cooling effects of an air heat pump (AHP) system. An AHP system was installed in a pig house to compare the effects with a traditional cooling system on the growth performance, noxious gas emission, housing environment and consumption of electricity. During the 19-week experimental trial, the internal temperature in the AHP cooling system-connected pig house was significantly decreased (p < 0.05) than the conventional house. Similarly, the temperature-humidity index (THI) was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in the growing and late finishing period. The carbon dioxide (CO2) and electricity consumption were also reduced significantly in the AHP cooling system relative to the control. The concentration of ammonia (NH3) during the weaning and finishing phase and the concentration of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) during all periods were lower in the AHP-installed pig house (p < 0.05). From 0-19 weeks, there was no significant difference was observed (p > 0.05) in terms of the growth performance of pigs in both houses. These results show that the AHP cooling system can be implemented as an environmentally friendly renewable energy source in swine farms for sustainable pig production and better air quality without adversely affecting productivity parameters.

AB  - The okapi (Okapia johnstoni), or forest giraffe, is the only species in its genus and the only extant sister group of the giraffe within the family Giraffidae. The species is one of the remaining large vertebrates surrounded by mystery because of its elusive behavior as well as the armed conflicts in the region where it occurs, making it difficult to study. Deforestation puts the okapi under constant anthropogenic pressure, and it is currently listed as "Endangered" on the IUCN Red List. Here, we present the first annotated de novo okapi genome assembly based on PacBio continuous long reads, polished with short reads, and anchored into chromosome-scale scaffolds using Hi-C proximity ligation sequencing. The final assembly (TBG_Okapi_asm_v1) has a length of 2.39 Gbp, of which 98% are represented by 28 scaffolds > 3.9 Mbp. The contig N50 of 61 Mbp and scaffold N50 of 102 Mbp, together with a BUSCO score of 94.7%, and 23 412 annotated genes, underline the high quality of the assembly. This chromosome-scale genome assembly is a valuable resource for future conservation of the species and comparative genomic studies among the giraffids and other ruminants.

AB  - A large number of herbivorous mammals and reptiles in many terrestrial ecosystems across the globe are presently in the receiving end of extinction. Over-exploitation by its immediate predator and anthropogenic actions is one of the main reasons. Reintroduction of apex predator or top predator at some instances has proven to be a successful strategy in restoring ecological balance. In this paper, we conceptualize the role of top predator in enriching the density of vulnerable species of lower trophic level, with the help of mathematical modeling. First, the dynamical behavior of two species system (prey and mesopredator) is studied, where growth of prey is subject to strong Allee effect. Also, the cost of predation induced fear is incorporated in the growth term. Parametric regions, for which the species perceive extinction risk are analyzed and depicted numerically. We consider that whenever density of the vulnerable species reach a certain threshold, minimum viable population, top predator is introduced in the habitat. Our obtained results show that a species population can be restored from the verge of extinction to a stable state with much higher population density with the introduction of top predator and even it stabilizes an oscillatory system.

AB  - For non-hibernating species within temperate climates, survival during severe winter weather often depends on individuals' behavioral response and available refugia. Identifying refugia habitat that sustains populations during adverse winter conditions can be difficult and complex. This study provides an example of how modeled, biologically relevant snow and weather information can help identify important relationships between habitat selection and dynamic winter landscapes using greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus, hereafter "sage-grouse") as a model species. We evaluated whether sage-grouse responded to weather conditions in two ways: through (1) positive selection for refugia habitat to minimize adverse weather exposure, or (2) lowered activity level to minimize thermoregulation and locomotion expense. Our results suggested that sage-grouse respond to winter weather conditions by seeking refugia rather than changing daily activity levels. During periods of lower wind chill temperatures and greater wind speeds, sage-grouse selected areas with sheltered aspects and greater sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) cover. Broadly, sage-grouse selected winter home ranges in sagebrush shrublands characterized by higher wind chill temperatures, greater wind speeds, and greater blizzarding conditions. However, within these home ranges, sage-grouse specifically selected habitats with greater above-snow sagebrush cover, lower wind speeds, and lower blizzarding conditions. Our study underscores the importance of examining habitat selection at narrower temporal scales than entire seasons and demonstrates the value of incorporating targeted weather variables that wholistically synthesize winter conditions. This research allows identification of refugia habitat that sustain populations during winter disproportionate to their spatial extent or frequency of use, facilitating more targeted management and conservation efforts.

AB  - Genomic assessment of local sheep breeds is relevant to the reconstruction of post-domestication migrations and to filling in gaps in the developmental history and contemporary phylogeographic-differentiation patterns in Eurasia. In this study, we aimed to reveal possible genetic relationships between local sheep breeds in Russia and the Persian Highlands (Iran) based on high-density SNP genotypes. All samples (n = 395) from 11 Iranian and 10 Russian sheep breeds were genotyped by using the Ovine Infinium HD BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Principal Component Analysis, maximum-likelihood assessment, and Neighbor-Net graph analysis demonstrated a clear differentiation between Russian sheep breeds of European ancestry from the Iranian local cluster and Russian breeds of Asian origin. Admixture analysis revealed a shared ancestral background, which was detected in several Iranian-local and Russian-local fat-tailed coarse-wool sheep breeds. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the pattern of historic admixture, which is present in the genomes of many Eurasian sheep breeds.

AB  - The number of hunters in the United States has been declining in recent decades, raising concerns about the loss of hunting-generated funds for conservation and management. We used demographic models to examine the relative effects of time period, age, birth cohort, and gender on Wisconsin, USA residents' likelihood to purchase a deer hunting license, and we used these models to create estimated projections of the number of deer hunters out to 2040. In each projection scenario we examined, the number of male deer hunters declined at a rate of -2.2% to -1.5% per year, and the decline was attributable to declining participation rates across the entire hunter population. For female deer hunters, projections were inconsistent about whether the population would grow or remain stable near current levels. The rapidity and sustained duration of deer hunter declines will see deer populations outstrip the diminishing management capacity of recreational hunting and reduce funding for conservation and management programs.

AB  - We hypothesized that diet choice of mixed-breed goats on xerophytic shrubland of northern Mexico depends on their milk yield potential. During winter and spring (dry season), milk yield was recorded and forage samples were collected weekly. Goats were separated into a medium (MP; n = 20) or low-milk yielding groups (LP; n = 20). Total milk yield for 105 d lactation was 45.2 +/- 12.5 and 20.7 +/- 5.2 L for MP and LP goats, respectively. Dam bodyweight was positively related to milk yield (P < 0.001). Microhistological analyses showed that goat diets were composed mainly of shrubs (33%) and perennial grasses (36%) during the dry season with no influence of milk-yield or season on diet selection. Plants with abundant secondary compounds such as Larrea tridentate and Prosopis laevigata constituted around 7% of the goat diets in winter. Goats showed strong selectivity for Bouteloua gracilis and Croton lechleri in both seasons. The energy content of forage selected by MP goats was higher (P < 0.01) than that of LP goats. CP content of forages selected by goats was higher (12.7%; P < 0.01) in spring than in winter (8.1%). We concluded that mixed-breed goats with higher milk yield capacity selected similar diets as goats with less milk production capacity during both seasons. These mixed-breed goats reared on xerophytic shrubland of northern Mexico have the potential for producing moderate levels of milk during winter and spring (dry season); however, concentrate supplementation is necessary to sustain milk production under condition of forage scarcity.

AB  - Native trees provide a range of benefits, from supporting native wildlife to climate regulation, and many urban natural resource managers prioritize native tree planting and restoration. Ulmus americana (American elm) was once widely planted in American cities but has been decimated by Dutch elm disease (DED; Ophiostoma ulmi). Our study evaluated U. americana establishment and growth across urban landscapes. We planted ramets from three DED-tolerant U. americana genotypes (RV16, RV474, and Sunfield) along an urbanization gradient in Newark, DE and Philadelphia, PA, and assessed physiological and morphological responses. We analyzed how U. americana clone growth, chlorophyll fluorescence, and foliar chemistry relate to impervious surface area, ozone (O-3) concentrations, and soil characteristics. The one-year post planting mortality rate was low (4%) demonstrating these elms can withstand urban environmental conditions when provided ample water supply and protection from deer. As expected, the elms differed in growth rate, chlorophyll fluorescence, and foliar chemistry between the cities. Elms planted in Philadelphia had greater photosynthetic capacity in July (F-v/F-m = 0.76) and September (F-v/F-m = 0.75), while Newark elms had greater photosynthetic capacity in August (F-v/F-m = 0.78). Depleted foliar delta C-13 signatures in Philadelphia suggest elms are experiencing greater fossil-fuel derived atmospheric CO2 than in Newark, possibly contributing to the greater growth rates observed in Philadelphia compared to Newark. Enriched foliar delta N-15 and greater foliar %N in Philadelphia clones suggest they are experiencing greater N deposition from NOx-derived sources compared to Newark clones. Clones growing in Phila-delphia had greater foliar nutrient concentrations despite growing in soils with greater heavy metal concentrations. These foliar-soil chemistry patterns suggest that clones growing in Philadelphia respond positively to urban environmental conditions in a large city, whereas clones growing in Newark may be experiencing N limitation in the first year of growth after planting.

AB  - Spatial patterns of human hunting and predation risk are mediated by the physical landscape, with hunting risk often associated with different habitat features than those linked to large carnivores. Risk from hunters and carnivores also varies over time, and prey may adjust anti-predator strategies accordingly. We used GPS data from 17 female moose (Alces alces) tracked over two fall-winter seasons (2018-2020) in south-central Scandinavia to study moose habitat selection in response to diel and seasonal variation in risk from wolves (Canis lupus) and human hunters. Predation risk was quantified using spatial models based on known wolf and hunter kill-sites. We applied resource selection functions and Generalized Additive Mixed Models to model moose habitat selection in response to wolf and hunting risk. Moose avoided high-risk hunting areas during the day throughout the hunting season but relaxed this avoidance at night and after the season ended. In contrast, we found no evidence that moose adjusted habitat use in response to diel or seasonal variation in wolf predation risk. These results suggest that human hunting was the primary driver of moose habitat selection during the hunting season, becoming less relevant when hunting ceased. Our findings highlight the dominant role of human risk in shaping prey behaviour and the importance of accounting for hunting when evaluating predator-prey dynamics in human-dominated systems. An increased understanding of the risk effects arising from humans and large carnivores on prey can deepen our understanding of the ecological roles of predators and humans.

AB  - The invasive brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), has disrupted integrated pest management programs in agroecosystems including tree fruit in North America and several other regions worldwide. While the toolbox for managing the pest continues to grow, it has not yet been determined if feeding or oviposition by H. halys onto orchard or forest trees induces changes in volatiles emitted from trees that could be exploited by foraging egg parasitoids or other insects. The goal of this study was to investigate differences in volatile compound emissions from branches of potted peach and tree of heaven exposed directly and systemically to H. halys feeding and oviposition. Analyses indicate that H. halys feeding and oviposition induced changes in both the blend and specific amounts of volatile compounds emitted from both tree species. Tree of heaven branches directly exposed to H. halys oviposition and feeding emitted nerolidol at a higher rate than those exposed to feeding alone and control trees. Tree of heaven compound leaves systemically exposed to H. halys feeding alone emitted higher rates of (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) than trees exposed to oviposition and feeding or control trees. Conversely, for peach, both branches exposed directly or systemically resulted in a decrease in cis-3-hexenyl acetate when exposed to H. halys oviposition. Such changes in plant volatile compounds, or blends of compounds, have the potential to be used by foraging natural enemies of H. halys.

AB  - Intraspecific interactions between mesocarnivores are not commonly observed and consequentially not well understood, particularly for species inhabiting wilderness regions. Using a remote camera, we captured interactions between a Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) and wolverine (Gulo gulo) scavenging on the remains of a bison (Bison bison). Over a 23-min period representing nine photographic sequences (1-3 photographs per sequence), we observed (1) a wolverine approach the remains that were being fed on by a lynx, (2) the two animals feeding on the remains at the same time for about 19 min, (3) the wolverine chasing the lynx off of the carcass and, thereafter, (4) the wolverine excluding the lynx from the carcass. Our observation is of potential scientific value because it sheds light on behavioral interactions between these two species, particularly at a rich food source. Intraguild interactions between these species appear to include tolerance toward one another, as well as interference competition, with the wolverine being the dominant species. Our observation highlights the new information on interactions between mesocarnivores that are becoming illuminated with the use of remote cameras, revealing that these interactions may be more complex than once thought.

AB  - Municipal governments are emerging as important stakeholders in managing the populations and geographic distributions of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in urban and suburban areas of the Northeastern United States. To understand the variation in municipal-level concerns about deer and municipal policies related to deer management, we distributed a questionnaire to all 351 municipalities across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 2017 (response rate = 74%) and collected data on local bylaws that influence hunting access. We found that concerns about deer vary across the state and some municipalities are taking action to manage increasing deer populations. In particular, our analysis established the importance of deer and deer management in the suburban regions of Massachusetts, while uncovering many local differences within similar suburban areas. The varying relationships between deer populations, public concerns, and municipal actions illustrated the complex role of municipal decision-makers in shaping wildlife management programs.

AB  - .-habitat loss is a primary threat to seahorses, pipefishes, and their relatives (family Syngnathidae) globally. Conservation intervention is difficult or ineffective when species lack critical habitat information. To better understand the habitat associations of syngnathids we conducted underwater visual surveys of 79 sites in three habitat categories (Reef, Continuous, and Discontinuous Submerged Rooted Vegetation) in Biscayne National Park (BNP), a coastal recorded nine syngnathid species in our surveys; presence/ absence data was analyzed alongside a suite of abiotic and biotic variables. Nonparametric statistical tests indicated that syngnathids were significantly more abundant inside Biscayne Bay and we did not detect any syngnathids at reef species being previously reported in BNP. Additional analyses indicated that sites where syngnathids were present were characterized by fine sediment, reduced horizontal visibility, high seagrass coverage, and low coverage of sessile benthic invertebrates and reef-associated turf algae. The most important predictor of syngnathid presence was a predominance of fine sediment-an indicator of low-velocity hydrodynamic conditions-and seagrass coverage at occupied sites was nearly double that of unoccupied sites. Variation in habitat use among the three most abundant sympatric syngnathids (Hippocampus zosterae, Syngnathus scovelli, and Syngnathus floridae) indicates niche partitioning based on salinity, local hydrodynamic regime, and seagrass coverage. Our study points to the value of protecting sheltered seagrass beds; heightened vulnerability to habitat change-driven by watershed development, impacts from fisheries, recreation and tourism, and climate change-necessitates coordinated management of land use outside of the protected area.

AB  - Wrack supply represents the main organic input in sandy beaches ecosystems and is a common feature of beaches around the world. The chemical composition of the wrack is important in determining the extent and rate of the decay; in particular, phenolic compounds may affect consumption rates by wrack-associated macrofauna and, consequently, modify the nutrient processing and recycling in sandy beaches. The aim of this research was to investigate the possible links between phenolic content of wrack supplies and the macrofaunal community inhabiting them. To achieve this, patches of wrack in three beaches of the NW coast of Spain were analysed and the phenolic contents and macrofaunal distribution, both at spatial and temporal scales, were assessed. Wrack and macrofaunal samples were collected along two shore-parallel transects, coinciding with the wrack lines of previous tidal deposition. The results showed a general spatial distribution in the phenolic content of the beach-cast according to their tidal position on the beach. Thus, two distinct zones were identified: the "spring-tide deposited" zone located in the upper beach close to the base of the dunes and composed by wrack material with the lowest phenolic concentrations; and a "freshly deposited" zone with wrack deposits containing the highest concentrations of deterrent compounds. Nevertheless, only supratidal grazers, mostly linked to fresh deposits, have shown a slightly negative association between their abundance and the increasing phenolic contents of the stranded macroalgae. The lack of a consistent pattern in macrofaunal occupation of fresh and decayed drift lines detected suggests the species could be selecting habitats for reasons other than phenolic content.

AB  - Southern Texas, USA, is home to native collared peccaries (Dicotyles tajacu) and introduced populations of invasive wild pigs (generally Sus scrofa x domesticus hybrids) and non-native African warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus). Although these ecologically similar mammals co-occur in this region, the potential impacts of invasive suids on collared peccaries are poorly understood. We examined co-occupancy and activity pattern overlap of collared peccaries, wild pigs, and warthogs across 3 seasons (fall, winter, and spring) using remote camera data collected from Chaparral Wildlife Management Area, Cotulla, Texas (November 2020 to June 2021). Using activity pattern analyses and single and 2-species occupancy models incorporating habitat and climate characteristics, we found evidence of extensive spatial overlap between all species pairs and varying degrees of temporal overlap depending on species pairs and season. Collared peccaries and wild pigs displayed moderate temporal overlap across all seasons. Collared peccaries appeared to alter fall activity in the presence of wild pigs to be active earlier in the morning and less active during the day. Collared peccaries and warthogs had low-to-moderate temporal overlap (low in fall, winter; moderate in spring). Wild pigs and warthogs had low temporal overlap (fall, spring) and wild pigs appeared to alter activity in the presence of warthogs (fall), becoming less active during the day during peak warthog activity. Overall, our results suggest that peccary, wild pig, and warthog interactions and activity are dynamic and vary seasonally according to the ecology and preferred environmental conditions of each species. Given the potential for interspecific competition and disease transmission with Collared Peccary and other native wildlife, resource partitioning between wild pigs and warthogs needs to be further examined to aid in effective management strategies.
   Native Collared Peccary and non-native wild pigs and warthogs show extensive spatial overlap in portions of southern Texas and varying degrees of temporal overlap depending on species pairs, indicating potential for species interactions. These patterns are dynamic and vary throughout the year according to ecology and preferred environmental conditions for each species.
   El sur de Texas, EE. UU., es el hogar del jabal & iacute; nativo o pecar & iacute; (Dicotyles tajacu) y de poblaciones introducidas de cerdos salvajes invasores (generalmente h & iacute;bridos de Sus scrofa x domesticus) y fac & oacute;queros africanos no nativos (Phacochoerus africanus). Aunque estos mam & iacute;feros ecol & oacute;gicamente similares coexisten en esta regi & oacute;n, los posibles impactos de los suidos invasores sobre el pecar & iacute; nativo son poco conocidos. Examinamos la co-ocupaci & oacute;n y la superposici & oacute;n de patrones de actividad del pecar & iacute;, los cerdos salvajes y los fac & oacute;queros a lo largo de tres estaciones (oto & ntilde;o, invierno, primavera) utilizando datos de c & aacute;maras remotas recopilados en el & Aacute;rea de Manejo de Vida Silvestre de Chaparral, Cotulla, Texas (noviembre de 2020 a junio de 2021). Utilizando an & aacute;lisis de patrones de actividad y modelos de ocupaci & oacute;n de una y dos especies que incorporan caracter & iacute;sticas del h & aacute;bitat y el clima, encontramos evidencia de una amplia superposici & oacute;n espacial entre todos los pares de especies y diversos grados de superposici & oacute;n temporal seg & uacute;n los pares de especies y la estaci & oacute;n. El pecar & iacute; y los cerdos salvajes mostraron una superposici & oacute;n temporal moderada en todas las estaciones. Los pecar & iacute;es parecen alterar su actividad oto & ntilde;al en presencia de cerdos salvajes, para estar activos m & aacute;s temprano en la ma & ntilde;ana y menos activos durante el d & iacute;a. Los pecar & iacute;es y los fac & oacute;queros muestran una superposici & oacute;n temporal baja a moderada (baja: oto & ntilde;o, invierno; moderada: primavera). Los cerdos salvajes y los fac & oacute;queros tienen una superposici & oacute;n temporal baja (oto & ntilde;o, primavera) y los primeros parecen alterar su actividad en presencia de fac & oacute;queros (oto & ntilde;o), volvi & eacute;ndose menos activos durante el d & iacute;a durante la actividad m & aacute;xima de los fac & oacute;queros. En general, nuestros resultados sugieren que las interacciones y la actividad de los pecar & iacute;es, los cerdos salvajes y los fac & oacute;queros son din & aacute;micas y var & iacute;an estacionalmente seg & uacute;n la ecolog & iacute;a y las condiciones ambientales de las especies. Dado el potencial de competencia interespec & iacute;fica y transmisi & oacute;n de enfermedades con los pecar & iacute;es y otros animales salvajes nativos, la repartici & oacute;n de recursos entre los cerdos salvajes y los fac & oacute;queros necesita ser examinada m & aacute;s a fondo para ayudar a desarrollar estrategias de gesti & oacute;n efectivas para reducir los impactos en las comunidades de animales salvajes nativos.

AB  - Accurate estimation and monitoring of wildlife population trends is foundational to evidence-based conservation. Here, we use hierarchical modelling to estimate population trends for six species of management interest (coyotes; red foxes, white-tailed deer, gray foxes; eastern wild turkey, and bobcats) while accounting for observation error from a long-term camera trap survey conducted across the State of New York. We were able to detect population level trends in occurrence and abundance and produce spatially explicit predictions for all six species using a combination of single-species occupancy models and Royle-Nichols models. Coyote (mean lambda = 1.22, 95 % CI = 0.85-1.82) and red fox (mean lambda = 1.17, 95 % CI = 0.95-1.46) populations were widely distributed with stable populations across the sampling period from 2014 to 2021. White-tailed deer populations were highly abundant and displayed an increasing population trend (mean lambda = 1.85, 95 % CI = 1.54-2.10). Eastern wild turkey occupancy remained low across the state despite displaying a slight increase in occupancy over the sampling period (mean psi = 0.16, 95 % CI = 0.07-0.25). Gray fox occupancy was also low (mean psi = 0.22, 95 % CI = 0.12-0.29), consistent with growing concerns over the species across North America. Despite recent recoveries elsewhere, bobcat populations in New York State displayed very low occupancy (mean psi = 0.07, 95 % CI = 0.02-0.12), highlighting the necessity of monitoring to inform conservation action. We provide empirically supported management implications for each species and demonstrate the efficacy of long-term camera trapping to provide robust evidence on population trends while accounting for imperfect detections, over scales meaningful to species management and conservation.

AB  - In forested headwater streams, inconspicuous food resources such as epilithic microalgae can play a major role owing to their content of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that are essential for macroinvertebrate development. Yet, the use of these resources and their consequences for consumers and life-history traits remain scarcely studied, especially for non-herbivorous taxa. Using instream mesocosms, we aimed to understand how two macroinvertebrate species, a shredder detritivore (Gammarus pulex) and a scraper (Rhithrogena semicolorata), use available organic resources under light versus shaded conditions (high and low amounts of phototrophic biofilm, respectively). We specifically focused on the origin of carbon (C) and essential lipids (PUFAs, sterols) assimilated by the two species and the effects of these compounds on their survival and growth. When autotrophic biofilms were available (mesocosms exposed to light), both species experienced significantly higher growth than in mesocosms placed in the dark. In Rhithrogena nymphs, the survival and imago emergence rates were positively affected by access to autotrophic biofilms. Using stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15), we demonstrated that under dark conditions both macroinvertebrates assimilated C of detrital origin. Under light conditions, most of the C assimilated by R. semicolorata was derived from autotrophic biofilms and around 11% from fine detrital particles (FPOM). Gammarus pulex derived part of its C from detrital sources (mainly FPOM) and from autotrophic biofilms. The results of isotopic analyses (delta C-13) on fatty acids (FAs) and sterols showed that the scraper Rhithrogena was entirely dependent on autotrophic biofilms to meet its dietary FAs and sterol requirements. In contrast, detrital sources were quantitatively important for G. pulex both in terms of C and sterol supply, irrespective of the conditions tested. For these consumers, microalgae seemed to be a complementary food source, but yet essential to cover a large part of their requirements in long-chain PUFAs. This study clearly confirmed the ecological importance of autotrophic biofilms for two functional feeding groups of macroinvertebrates in headwater streams providing new insights on the trophic origin of sterols and long-chain PUFAs in their diet.

AB  - We monitored grazing behavior and habitat selection of Argentine Criollo (AC), South American heritage cattle breed, and Angus (AA) cows during summer and winter of 2016 (wetter year) and 2017 (drier year) at a site in La Rioja, Argentina. In each year and season, five AC and five AA cows were fitted with GPS collars configured to log animal position at 10-min intervals for 40 days. Movement, activity, and vegetation use patterns of each breed were derived from the GPS data. In summer, AC cows traveled similar daily distances, explored smaller (wetter year) or slightly larger (drier year) areas of the pasture, tended to move along more sinuous path trajectories, and showed stronger selection of the vegetation unit with higher forage quality and lowest woody cover compared to AA counterparts. AC cows allocated similar (wetter year) or more time to graze (drier year), allocated roughly the same amount of time to travel, and spent similar (wetter year) or less time resting (drier year) than AA cows. In winter, foraging behavior differences between breeds were only observed in the drier year. AC cows traveled farther and spent less time resting than AA counterparts that year. When comparing summer vs. winter move-ment patterns of each breed, AC cows showed an apparent greater ability to adapt to changing forage conditions (foraging plasticity) compared to AA counterparts which appeared to exhibit more rigid foraging patterns. Criollo cattle could be a tool to increase the resilience of Arid Chaco beef systems in the face of climate change. The rangeland conservation implications of raising Criollo vs. British beef cattle require further investigation.

AB  - The paleontological site of "Campo della Spina", in central Italy, offers valuable insights into Middle Pleistocene paleoenvironments. Excavations revealed well-preserved skeletal remains of an adult Palaeoloxodon antiquus, embedded in a sedimentary lens displaying alternating lacustrine and volcanoclastic flow characteristics. The well-preserved state of the remains suggests the elephant died at the site where it was found and was subsequent buried under conditions that facilitated preservation, while evidence of bone breakage and disarticulation indicates potential post-depositional disturbance, likely attributable to tractive water movements or debris flow events. These findings provide interdisciplinary research opportunities, shedding light on past climate dynamics and depositional processes. The site's significance lies in its contribution to understanding rapid aggradation, volcanic activity impacts, and climatic transitions during Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 11- 9 intervals. The study highlights the importance of paleoclimate studies for informing contemporary climate change mitigation strategies. Overall, Campo della Spina offers a unique window into the interplay between climate dynamics, geological processes, and paleoenvironments, with implications for understanding past environmental changes and informing future conservation efforts.

AB  - The comparison of ecological, phenological, morphological and developmental traits between exotic invasive species and coexisting native species contributes to understand the driving mechanisms of successful invasions. This study aimed to examine which of these traits are related to the invasion of woody plants in the understory of deciduous North Patagonian forests of Argentina.We compared the phenology, shoot growth rate, number of leaves, biomass allocation, leaf herbivory, and recruitment type of two exotic deciduous trees, Crataegus monogyna and Sorbus aucuparia, with those of four coexisting native woody species (one deciduous, one semi-deciduous, and two evergreen species).Spring shoot growth took place several weeks earlier in both exotic species and in the deciduous native species than in the other native species; growth rates were higher in the exotics. Compared to coexisting native species, both exotic species developed shoots that were as long as or longer, had lower biomass allocation to leaves and higher allocation to roots, suffered lower leaf damage by herbivores and exhibited higher seed than vegetative recruitment. This study supports the idea that a combination of phenological, growth rate and mass allocation traits allow exotic species to preempt resources, thus favouring invasion processes.

AB  - Apart from frugivory, we have limited knowledge of the ecological consequences of primate herbivory. We aimed to ascertain the effects of spring folivory and winter bark/bud herbivory by Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) on tree species and succession patterns of cool-temperate forests with heavy snow. To evaluate the impact of herbivory on individual trees, we assessed the growth and mortality of trees consumed by simulating herbivory on nine tree species over 4 years. Additionally, we assessed the cumulative impacts of bark/bud herbivory observed at the tree community level by monitoring the patterns of natural herbivory for almost a decade and evaluating the structure of tree assemblages in places with different cumulative impacts of herbivory. The results of simulated herbivory showed that the mortality caused by both spring and winter herbivory was limited (<20%) for almost all tree species monitored; however, the simulated folivory led to delayed tree growth and/or weakening of tree architecture. In contrast, the simulated bark/bud herbivory sometimes resulted in overcompensation of the tree consumed. The multiyear monitoring of natural herbivory demonstrated that, while bark/bud herbivory did not reduced the diversity and biomass of tree assemblages, the cumulative impacts of natural herbivory could have affected the tree succession pattern, resulting in increasing the availability of bark/buds preferably fed by macaques. The key cause for this feedback effect of herbivory on available foods of macaques might be heavy snow conditions, which could physically and physiologically restrain the excessive bark/buds herbivory by macaques.

AB  - Livestock guarding dogs reduce livestock predation by excluding carnivores and altering herbivore behavior through their presence. In Patagonia, invasive European hares compete with livestock for forage but change their behavior when exposed to native predator odors. In this experiment, we aimed to test if livestock guarding dog odor triggers fear in this herbivore and reduces hare presence in different habitats of sheep grazing lands of Chilean Patagonia, where these lagomorphs are an invasive species. The results showed that European hares reduce their visits to scented places with and without horizontal vegetation. We also discovered that this invasive species reduced foraging time when the odor was present in places with dense horizontal vegetation. These results suggested that livestock guarding dogs could also serve as a European hare deterrent and decrease competition with livestock, allowing greater production and supporting sustainable livestock farming.

AB  - The Greek Black Pig (or Greek Pig) is the only recognized autochthonous pig breed raised in Greece, usually in extensive or semi-extensive production systems. According to its name, the characteristic breed coat color is solid black. In this study, with the aim to start a systematic genetic characterization of the Greek Black Pig breed, we investigated polymorphisms in major genes well known to affect exterior and production traits (MC1R, KIT, NR6A1, VRTN and IGF2) and compared these data with population genetic information available in other Mediterranean and Western Balkan pig breeds and wild boars. None of the investigated gene markers were fixed for one allele, suggesting that, in the past, this breed experienced introgression from wild boars and admixture from cosmopolitan pig breeds, enriching the breed genetic pool that should be further investigated to design appropriate conservation genetic strategies. We identified a new MC1R allele, containing two missense mutations already reported in two other independent alleles, but here present in the same haplotype. This allele might be useful to disclose biological information that can lead to better understanding the cascade transmission of signals to produce melanin pigments. This study demonstrated that autochthonous genetic resources can be an interesting reservoir of unexpected genetic variants.

AB  - Simple Summary Jianchang Black goats are one of the indigenous black goat breeds in China. They are known for their crude feed tolerance but have a low growth rate and small body size. However, little is known about the genetic composition of Jianchang Black goats. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the genetic composition of this breed by conducting multiple population genetic analyses. Our results revealed that Jintang Black and Yunshang Black goats showed a close genetic relationship with a non-negligible amount of gene flows but were genetically distant from Jianchang Black goats. Jianchang Black goats generally showed moderate inbreeding levels. Importantly, we identified several putatively selected genes that may be potentially related to immunity, behavior, and reproduction in this breed. The current study provides valuable references and genomic resources for the future breeding of Jianchang Black goats. Understanding the genetic composition of indigenous goats is essential to promote the scientific conservation and sustainable utilization of these breeds. The Jianchang Black (JC) goat, a Chinese native breed, is solid black and exhibits crude feed tolerance, but is characterized by a low growth rate and small body size. Based on the whole-genome sequencing data for 30 JC, 41 Jintang Black (JT), and 40 Yunshang Black (YS) goats, and 21 Bezoar ibexes, here, we investigated the genetic composition of JC goats by conducting analyses of the population structure, runs of homozygosity (ROH), genomic inbreeding, and selection signature. Our results revealed that JT and YS showed a close genetic relationship with a non-negligible amount of gene flows but were genetically distant from JC, apart from Bezoars. An average of 2039 ROHs were present in the autosomal genome per individual. The ROH-based inbreeding estimates in JC goats generally showed moderate values ranging from 0.134 to 0.264, mainly due to rapid declines in the effective population size during recent generations. The annotated genes (e.g., IL2, IL7, and KIT) overlapping with ROH islands were significantly enriched in immune-related biological processes. Further, we found 61 genes (e.g., STIM1, MYO9A, and KHDRBS2) under positive selection in JC goats via three complementary approaches, which may underly genetic adaptations to local environmental conditions. Our findings provided references for the conservation and sustainable utilization of JC goats.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts are a challenge in parks and protected areas around the world. Facilitating quality wildlife viewing experiences that minimize negative impacts to people and animals is often complicated by distance-related human behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine how people?s distance-related norms varied as a function of proximity from wildlife, wildlife species, and physical landscape features. By using virtual reality technology and simulations, this study assessed how physical landscape features (i.e., an open field, deadfall, and a paved road) impact wildlife viewing norms and also compared norms among three different wildlife species (i.e., bison, bear, and elk). Data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA to explore how these factors influenced acceptability ratings of distances between people and wildlife. Results revealed a significant interaction between distance to wildlife and landscape features. Recommendations for improving the management of humanwildlife conflicts and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - The evolution of endothermy was instrumental to the diversification of birds and mammals, but the energetic demands of maintaining high body temperature could offset the advantages of endothermy in some environments. We hypothesized that reductions in body temperature help high-altitude natives overcome the metabolic challenges of cold and hypoxia in their native environment. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) from high-altitude and low-altitude populations were bred in captivity to the second generation and were acclimated as adults to warm normoxia or cold hypoxia. Subcutaneous temperature (T-sub, used as a proxy for body temperature) and cardiovascular function were then measured throughout the diel cycle using biotelemetry. Cold hypoxia increased metabolic demands, as reflected by increased food consumption and heart rate (associated with reduced vagal tone). These increased metabolic demands were offset by plastic reductions in T-sub (approx. 2 degrees C) in response to cold hypoxia, and highlanders had lower T-sub (approx. 1 degrees C) than lowlanders in both environmental treatments. Empirical and theoretical evidence suggested that these reductions could together reduce metabolic demands by approximately 10-30%. Therefore, plastic and evolved reductions in body temperature can help mammals overcome the metabolic challenges at high altitude and may be a valuable energy-saving strategy in some non-hibernating endotherms in extreme environments.

AB  - Mortality resulting from interactions with fishing gears represent an important threat to sensitive species globally. In this study, we address this issue by defining five species groups of marine megafauna (marine mammals, seabirds, demersal and pelagic elasmobranchs, and sea turtles), and conducting a productivity-susceptibility analysis (PSA) within the context of data-limited fisheries in the Mediterranean and Black Sea. Although there are significant differences among species within each group, this approach has been considered much more direct and functional for management purposes. The productivity (P) of each species group was determined by evaluating a set of attributes averaged across representative species within each group. Species groups' susceptibility (S) to bycatch was assessed through a comprehensive review of existing literature and expert judgment, considering a series of semi-quantitative attributes. Our analysis identified areas and fishing gears posing potential risks to the species groups assessed, highlighting that sea turtles and elasmobranchs face the potential risk of incidental captures from various fishing gears operating in both neritic (bottom trawls, set nets and bottom longlines) and pelagic (drifting longlines) environments. Marine mammals exhibit moderate risk across most fishing gears, with particular concern for the harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena relicta in the Black Sea, primarily due to the interaction with set nets, which can severely impact entire population even capturing few specimens due the species low productivity. Seabirds face reduced impact with fishing activities, irrespective of the type of gear examined or the specific area under investigation. Overall, our study highlights the specific basins and fishing gears requiring focused management measures, mitigation strategies, and enhanced monitoring activities to mitigate the impacts of bycatch on vulnerable marine megafauna.

AB  - Large rivers throughout the world have been transformed by anthropogenic stressors that are known to influence the structure and composition of fish assemblages. Management of large rivers requires balancing socio-economic and political considerations with biodiversity conservation efforts. By exchanging best management practices between rivers, management efforts can be improved. However, data limitations have largely prevented comparative analyses among fish assemblages in large rivers, potentially limiting the effectiveness of shared management strategies. To improve understanding of the similarities and differences between the Upper Mississippi and Yangtze Rivers, we (1) compared environmental variables and functional traits of fish assemblages between the two systems, (2) identified traits responsible for distinguishing functional groups from one another, and (3) investigated relationships between similar functional groups of fishes and environmental variables to establish expectations for how fish assemblages in large rivers might respond to anthropogenic stressors. Regional species pools in the Upper Mississippi and Upper Yangtze Rivers were characterized by a similar composition of functional traits; the majority of species were omnivorous, had affinities for gravel or sand substrates, and produced sinking eggs. Few species were pelagic, planktivorous, or herbivorous. Functional groups in both rivers were primarily distinguished according to species' trophic habits and substrate preferences, with secondary contributions from species' water column positions and life history characteristics. Pelagic planktivores and smallbodied guarders with an affinity for structural habitat complexity tended to increase downriver in both systems, in direct association with total phosphorus concentrations, agricultural land use, and temperature. In contrast, proportions of lithophilic species with affinities for gravel or cobble substrates were highest in segments located furthest upriver. By highlighting the sensitivity of different groups of fishes to anthropogenic stressors, we provide insights into the functional ecology of fishes inhabiting the Mississippi and Yangtze Rivers.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEN) is a mycotoxin known for its estrogen-like effects, which can disrupt the normal physiological function of endometrial cells and potentially lead to abortion in female animals. However, the precise mechanism by which ZEN regulates endometrial function remains unclear. In this study, we found that the binding receptor estrogen receptors for ZEN is extensively expressed across various segments of the uterus and within endometrial cells, and a certain concentration of ZEN treatment reduced the proliferation capacity of goat endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) and endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). Meanwhile, cell cycle analysis revealed that ZEN treatment leaded to cell cycle arrest in goat EECs and ESCs. To explore the underlying mechanism, we investigated the mitochondrial quality control systems and observed that ZEN triggered excessive mitochondrial fission and disturbed the balance of mitochondrial fusion-fission dynamics, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, increased mitochondrial unfolded protein response and mitophagy in goat EECs and ESCs. Additionally, ZEN treatment reduced the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, heightened the production of hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species, and caused cellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. These results suggest that ZEN has adverse effects on goat endometrium cells by disrupting the mitochondrial quality control system and affecting cell cycle and proliferation. Understanding the underlying molecular pathways involved in ZEN-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and its consequences on cell function will provide critical insights into the reproductive toxicity of ZEN and contribute to safeguarding the health and wellbeing of animals and humans exposed to this mycotoxin.
   Zearalenone (ZEN), a mycotoxin, exerts detrimental effects on goat endometrial cells by disrupting the mitochondrial quality control system. This disruption includes alterations in fusion-fission dynamics, mitochondrial biogenesis, the UPRmt and mitophagy processes, consequently impacting cell cycle regulation and proliferation.image

AB  - Simple Summary This study evaluates the effectiveness of an ecological bridge, constructed in 2020 in the Zeytinler neighborhood, as a solution to mitigate wild-boar-vehicle collisions (WVCs) on the Izmir-cesme motorway. The Zeytinler Ecological Bridge was monitored and analyzed for wildlife crossings, particularly by wild boars. Between August 2020 and December 2022, 686 instances of movement were observed among six wild mammal species, with wild boars representing 87.5% and foxes 10% of the recorded crossings. The study indicates that the highest frequency of wildlife crossings occurred in autumn between 22:00 and 02:00, coinciding with specific moon phases. Moreover, wild boar crossings increased during the autumn season with a full pond, and no wild boar fatalities were recorded after the bridge's completion. The findings suggest that the ecological bridge effectively facilitates safe wildlife passage, especially for wild boars, reducing the risk of collisions with vehicles on the motorway.Abstract In this study, the use of an ecological bridge installed as a wildlife overpass and constructed in the Zeytinler neighborhood in 2020 was analyzed as a mitigating factor in wild-boar-vehicle collisions (WVCs) on the Izmir-cesme motorway. In this context, this study aimed to assess the use of the Zeytinler Ecological Bridge by wild boars (Sus scrofa Linnaeus, 1758). To this end, wildlife crossings were monitored, analyzed, and modeled with Bayesian networks. Between August 2020 and December 2022, a total of 686 instances of movement were observed among six medium to large wild mammal species. Wild boars accounted for approximately 87.5% of the recorded wildlife crossings, with foxes comprising 10%. The findings showed that the highest frequency of wildlife crossings occurred during the autumn season, particularly between 22:00 (10 p.m.) and 02:00 (2 a.m.), coinciding with the Waxing Gibbous and Waxing Crescent phases of the moon. The model outcomes highlighted that during the autumn season with a full pond, wild boar crossings increased by one and a half times in comparison to regular herd crossings. Throughout the observation period, there were no instances of wild boar fatalities subsequent to the completion of the bridge.

AB  - Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) enables the reprogramming of terminally differentiated somatic cells into a totipotent state, yet whether this process is governed by conserved mechanisms across mammalian species remains poorly understood. Here, we employed low-input transcriptomics to profile global transcriptional dynamics during zygotic genome activation in SCNT embryos from five species: mouse, pig, cattle, goat, and sheep. Our analysis revealed distinct genome-wide expression patterns among these species, with 70.17% of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) being species specific, while only 9.17% were shared DEGs. Functional annotation of the shared DEGs highlighted their enrichment in processes such as mRNA transcription, translation, and carbohydrate metabolism. Notably, we observed widespread pathway overactivation in SCNT embryos from cattle, mouse, and pig, whereas goat and sheep SCNT embryos exhibited broad suppression. Furthermore, weighted gene co-expression network analysis demonstrated that species-specific effects exerted a far greater influence on reprogramming outcomes than the method of embryo generation (fertilization or SCNT). Through systematic identification of key transcription factors, signaling pathways, epigenetic markers, and alternative splicing events, we uncovered species-specific regulatory patterns underlying reprogramming. Additionally, genome browser analysis revealed regional chromosomal expression anomalies in GDF9 and BMP15 during reprogramming across species. Collectively, our findings provide critical insights into the divergent mechanisms of reprogramming in mammalian species and establish a robust theoretical foundation for future studies in this field.

AB  - Associational resistance (AR) is a positive interaction in which a plant suffers less herbivore damage due to its association with a protective plant. Here, we evaluated whether plants with extra-floral nectaries (EFNs) can share indirect defenses with neighboring plants. We sampled 45 individuals of an EFN-bearing liana (Smilax polyantha) and recorded whether their support species had EFNs. In S. polyantha, we measured foliar herbivory and flower and fruit production. We examined the ant species composition and visitation of S. polyantha and whether they changed according to the supporting plant type (with or without EFNs). We experimentally determined whether S. polyantha supplemented with artificial nectaries could share indirect defenses with defenseless neighboring plants. Support plants with EFNs indirectly benefited S. polyantha by sharing mutualistic ant species. Smilax polyantha supported by plants with EFNs had a more specific ant species composition, a higher number of visiting ants and ant species richness, and exhibited nearly 3 times less foliar herbivory. However, we did not observe differences in fruit production between the two groups of S. polyantha. Finally, we observed that S. polyantha with artificial nectaries increased ant visitation on neighboring plants 2.5 times. We provide evidence that interspecific neighbors with EFNs can experience reciprocal benefits by sharing indirect defenses. Such local effects might escalate and affect the structure of plant communities.

AB  - Humans have utilized the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) for millennia but the effects of prehistorical and historical fishing on this ecosystem remain understudied. To assess the long-term coupling of reef ecosystem and human dynamics in this region, we tracked trends in the structure and functioning of lagoonal reefs within the Belizean portion of the MAR using fish teeth fossils and sediment accumulation rates within reef sediment cores. We then paired this with a timeline of demographic and cultural changes in this region's human populations. The similar to 1,300-year timeline encompassed in the core record shows that declines in the relative abundance and accumulation rate of teeth from parrotfish, a key reef herbivore, occurred at all three reef sites and began between similar to 1500 and 1800 AD depending on site and metric of abundance. A causality analysis showed that parrotfish relative abundance had a positive causal effect on reef accretion rates, a proxy of coral growth, reconfirming the important role of these fish in reef ecosystem functioning. The timing of initial declines in parrotfish teeth occurred during a time of relatively low human population density in Belize. However, declines were synchronous with cultural and demographic upheaval resulting from European colonization of the New World. The more recent declines at these sites (similar to 1800 AD) occurred in tandem with increased subsistence fishing on reefs by multiple immigrant groups, a pattern that was likely necessitated by the establishment of an import economy controlled by a small group of land-owning European elites. These long-term trends from the paleoecological record reveal that current parrotfish abundances in central Belize are well below their pre-European contact peaks and that increased fishing pressure on parrotfish post-contact has likely caused a decline in reef accretion rates. The origins of reef degradation in the Belizean portion of the MAR began hundreds of years before the onset of modern declines resulting from the combined effects of local human disturbances and climate change.

AB  - Purpose Multi-cutting and livestock excrement application are two key agricultural practices affecting nutrient cycling in the plant-soil system of sown grasslands. However, little is known about the combination of multi-cutting and livestock excrement application on nitrogen mineralization and utilization and their mechanisms regulating plant growth. Methods The experiment was carried out in a salinized grassland at Linze Grassland Agricultural Station, Gansu Province, China. We tested the effects of plant multi-cutting (MC), sheep excrement (SE), multi-cutting and sheep excrement (MC + SE), and plant only (CK) on the soil nitrogen mineralization and plant growth of two forage plants, the spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Yongliang 15) and common vetch (Vicia sativa L., cv. Lanjian 3). We measured the plant height, branch number, tiller number and crude protein content, and soil nitrification rate, ammonium rate, microbial nitrogen and microbial carbon, and abundance of soil ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing archaea. Results MC and MC + SE significantly increased plant height, dry matter, and branch and tiller number of both forage crops. Although crude protein content and tiller number of spring wheat in SE decreased, these in MC + SE increased. SE and MC + SE significantly promoted nitrification rate in the soil by increasing the soil microbial nitrogen and soil ammonia-oxidizing bacteria abundance of the two forage crops. Conclusions Combined application of both multi-cutting and sheep excrement could accelerate soil nitrogen mineralization and plant nitrogen uptake, which could be considered in pasture management to improve the sustainable productivity of grass-soil systems of sown grassland.

AB  - Simple Summary Globally, small ruminants are important animals since they provide food, income, and livelihoods for millions of people, contributing to biodiversity conservation and offering a range of products with cultural, economic, and environmental significance. Central nervous system (CNS) diseases in sheep and goats encompass a range of conditions that affect the brain and spinal cord. The diseases afflicting these animals can have significant economic and health implications. The diagnosis and management of CNS diseases affecting small ruminants often require the involvement of veterinary care. The timely identification and treatment of these conditions are essential to minimizing the impact on the affected animals and preventing the spread of contagious diseases to herds or flocks. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid can be an important tool in the diagnosis of CNS diseases in small ruminants, and knowledge about the results of CSF analysis in relation to CNS diseases is of importance and can contribute to improving the health statuses of these animals and humans. The present study investigated the cytological pattern of cerebrospinal fluid in sheep and goats with CNS diseases. Infectious diseases of bacterial origin were determined to be the most common underlying causes for CSF alterations in sheep and goats, followed by parasitic disorders. Alterations in the cellular components of cerebrospinal fluid in small ruminants with CNS disease were mainly due to an increase in monocytic and lymphocytic cells with variable quantitative expression, whereas neutrophilic pleocytosis and cytoalbuminologic dissociation were rare findings.Abstract Background: Small ruminants often suffer from central nervous system (CNS) disorders, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can be used as a diagnostic tool in this regard. In small animals and cattle, specific CSF patterns have been defined for specific disease categories. No data exist regarding CSF results obtained from small ruminants and their association with certain CNS diseases. Objectives: The objective of this study was to retrospectively investigate CSF findings obtained from sheep and goats and to identify possible CSF patterns associated with disease categories. Methods: CSF samples and medical records from 44 sheep and 27 goats were included in this study. All animals were presented to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital Zurich of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital Zurich of the Vetsuisse Faculty of the University of Zurich between 2003 and 2016 and had either a confirmed CNS diagnosis or showed CSF changes without a specific CNS diagnosis. Results: Mixed mononuclear pleocytosis was the most common CSF pattern in sheep (25%), followed by monocytic pleocytosis (21%). Lymphocytic pleocytosis was most frequently found in goats (37%). In 75% of sheep and 56% of goats, infectious CNS diseases were diagnosed, with listeriosis being the most common infectious disease in both species, followed by parasitic disorders (nematodiasis and coenurosis). Conclusions: The cytologic CSF patterns in small ruminants are mainly based on the increased presence of monocytic and lymphocytic cells with variable quantitative expression, whereas neutrophilic pleocytosis and cytoalbuminologic dissociation were rare findings. Infectious diseases of bacterial origin were the most common underlying causes for CSF alterations in sheep and goats, followed by parasitic disorders. The pleocytosis type is not helpful for differentiating disease types.

AB  - Carbon materials are commonly used for soil carbon sequestration and fertilization, which can also affect crop growth by manipulating the rhizosphere bacterial community. However, the comparison of the differences between active carbon (e.g., organic fertilizers) and stable carbon (e.g., biochar) on rhizosphere microdomains is still unclear. Hence, a trial was implemented to explore the influence of control (CK, no fertilizer; NPK, chemical fertilizer), organic fertilizer (CF-O, organic fertilizer; CF-BO, biochar-based organic fertilizer) and biochar material (CF-B, perishable garbage biochar; CF-PMB, pig manure biochar) on the diversity, composition, and interaction of rice rhizosphere bacterial community through 16 S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. Our results demonstrate that organic fertilizer increases bacterial alpha-diversity compared to no-carbon supply treatment to the extend, whereas biochar has the opposite effect. The rhizosphere bacterial community composition showed pronounced variations among the various fertilization treatments. The relative abundance in Firmicutes decreased with organic fertilizer application, whereas that in Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria decreased with biochar application. Bacterial network analysis demonstrate that organic fertilizer enhances the complexity and key taxa of bacterial interactions, while biochar exhibits an opposing trend. The findings of our study indicate that organic fertilizer may contribute to a positive and advantageous impact on bacterial diversity and interaction in rice rhizosphere, whereas the influence of biochar is not as favorable and constructive. This study lays the foundation for elucidating the fate of the rhizosphere bacterial community following different carbon material inputs in the context of sustainable agricultural development.

AB  - Increasing livestock densities and more severe drought events challenge sustainable management in South Africa's semi-arid savannas. Effective mitigation strategies require accurate assessments of livestock foraging behaviour. By utilising high-throughput sequencing technology, this study evaluated the use of a dual-locus metabarcoding approach (trnL and rbcL) together with study-area-specific reference libraries, to analyse cattle diets in two bioregions of the eastern semi-arid South African savanna. Both markers demonstrated the ability to identify various plant families, but trnL exhibited a higher diversity in terms of family and genus identification at both sampling sites. Forbs, although comprising a diverse component of savanna plant communities, have relatively small above-ground biomass, but can still serve as crucial forage items, especially during dry periods. Our study underscores the significant role of forbs in cattle diets, demonstrating a shift in cattle foraging preferences from grass-based diets to higher inclusions of forbs and woody taxa during the drier season. Although grasses, such as Setaria, were still prevalent, forbs, belonging to the genera Malvastrum, Asparagus, Pollichia and Ipomoea were also important food items for cattle as well as woody taxa belonging to Fabaceae, Combretaceae, Ebenaceae, and Malvaceae with a selection of food items from trees and shrubs from genera Albizia, Combretum, Euclea and Vachellia. Furthermore, our study highlights the value of a dual-locus metabarcoding approach for understanding herbivorous diets. Using trnL and rbcL markers, with study-area-specific reference libraries, improves taxonomic resolution for accurately reconstructing cattle diets in semi-arid savannas. This study may improve biodiversity estimates and inform sustainable rangeland management strategies in semi-arid African savanna ecosystems.

AB  - Hispanopithecus laietanus from the Late Miocene (9.8 Ma) of Can Llobateres 1 (CLL1; Valles-Penedes Basin, NE Iberian Peninsula) represents one of the latest occurrences of fossil apes in Western mainland Europe, where they are last recorded at similar to 9.5 Ma. The paleoenvironment of CLL1 is thus relevant for understanding the extinction of European hominoids. To refine paleoenvironmental inferences for CLL1, we apply ecometric models based on functional crown type (FCT) variables-a scoring scheme devised to capture macroscopic functional traits of occlusal shape and wear surfaces of herbivorous large mammal molars. Paleotemperature and paleoprecipitation estimates for CLL1 are provided based on published regional regression models linking average FCT of large herbivorous mammal communities to climatic conditions. A mapping to Whittaker's present-day biome classification is also attempted based on these estimates, as well as a case-based reasoning via canonical variate analysis of FCT variables from five relevant biomes. Estimates of mean annual temperature (25 degrees C) and mean annual precipitation (881 mm) classify CLL1 as a tropical seasonal forest/savanna, only in partial agreement with the canonical variate analysis results, which classify CLL1 as a tropical rainforest with a higher probability. The former biome agrees better with previous inferences derived from fossil plants and mammals, as well as preliminary isotopic data. The misclassification of CLL1 as a tropical forest is attributed to the mixture of forest-adapted taxa with others adapted to more open environments, given that faunal and plant composition indicates the presence of a dense wetland/riparian forest with more open woodlands nearby. The tested FCT ecometric approaches do not provide unambiguous biome classification for CLL1. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with those from other approaches, thus suggesting that FCT variables are potentially useful to investigate paleoenvironmental changes through time and space-including those that led to the extinction of European Miocene apes.

AB  - Plants produce multiple specialised metabolites to defend themselves against insect herbivores. Phytochemical diversity plays important roles in plant-insect interactions, but specific roles of its various dimensions are poorly known. Interspecific chemical beta-diversity represents variation in presence of species-specific metabolites or quantitative variation in concentrations of metabolites common to several plant species. We hypothesised that qualitative and quantitative variation in plant chemistry can have differential effects on herbivores from various insect orders. We linked phytochemical variation in willow salicylates (Salicaceae-specific metabolites) and flavonoids (widespread metabolites) to a standardised distance-based specialisation index (DSI*) in three orders of leaf-chewing insects: sawfly larvae, beetles, and caterpillars. In beetles, average DSI* accounting for host chemical beta-diversity did not differ from DSI* disregarding host chemistry. Levels of chemical specialisation did not differ among beetle species feeding only on Salicaceae and those using other plant families, suggesting that both can overcome willow chemistry by alternative physiological or behavioural adaptations. Contrastingly, sawflies and caterpillars responded to willow chemistry, with their DSI* corresponding mainly to quantitative differences in willow metabolites. The DSI* accounting for salicylates did not differ from the one accounting for flavonoids in either of the two orders. Our results suggest that beta-diversity in plant chemistry has differential effects on insect herbivores depending on their order and chemical beta-diversity measurement used. Our results emphasise the importance of quantitative variation in plant chemical composition, suggesting that it does not always have to be rare or species-specific metabolites that drive host-choice of leaf-chewing insects.

AB  - This article presents a medium-scale map of the forage areas of the Kaskakulan cluster area of the Barsakelmes Nature Reserve, where wild ungulates, kulans, saigas, and goitered gazelles, live. The map was designed using data from ground surveys and remote sensing. The author's technique and a set of spectral indices were used for processing satellite data. Maps of seasonal rangeland yields, which were considered when calculating the total yield, were designed based on the interpretation of space images. The legend to the Rangeland map is a system of headings that take into account zonality, ecological and physiognomic types of vegetation, and soil conditions. Types of rangelands are reflected in the legend by 15 numbers; for each the total yield for the seasons of the year is given. The map can be used to assess the grazing capacity of the territory and calculate the allowable number of wild ungulates to maintain ecosystems in a balanced state.

AB  - Populations are typically defined as spatially contiguous sets of individuals, but large populations of social species can be composed of discrete social communities that often overlap in space. Masai giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) of Tanzania live in distinct social subpopulations that overlap spatially, enabling us to simultaneously explore environmental and social factors correlated with demographic variation in a metapopulation of >1,400 adult females and calves. We considered statistically distinct communities in the social network as subpopulations and tested for variation among the 10 subpopulations in adult female survival, calf survival, and reproductive rate (calf-to-adult female ratio). We then related variation in demographic rates among subpopulations to differences in vegetation, soil type, proximity to 2 types of human settlements, local giraffe population density, and social metrics of relationship strength and exclusivity among adult females. We did not find any among-subpopulation effects on adult female survival, suggesting adult female survival is buffered against environmental heterogeneity among subpopulations. Variation in calf demographic rates among subpopulations were correlated with vegetation, soils, anthropogenic factors, and giraffe population density but not with adult female relationship metrics, despite substantial spatial overlap. Subpopulations with more dense bushlands in their ranges had lower calf survival probabilities, and those closer to human settlements had higher reproductive rates, possibly because of spatial gradients in natural predation. Reproductive rates were higher in subpopulations with more volcanic soils, and calf survival probabilities were greater in subpopulations with higher local adult female densities, possibly related to higher-quality habitat associated with fertile soils or lower predation risk, or to greater competitive ability. The variation in fitness among subpopulations suggests that giraffes do not move unhindered among resource patches to equalize reproductive success, as expected according to an ideal free distribution. The differences in calf survival and reproductive rates could rather indicate intercommunity differences in competitive ability, perception, learning, or experience. Our approach of comparing demography among spatially overlapping yet distinct socially defined subpopulations provides a biologically meaningful way to quantify environmental and social factors influencing fine-scale demographic variation for social species.

AB  - Some deer species are of conservation concern; others are officially managed as a food source or for their trophies, whereas in many regions, deer are regarded as overabundant or even as a nuisance causing damages. Regardless of local management issues, in most cases, reliable data on deer population sizes and sex ratios are lacking. Non-invasive genetic approaches are promising tools for the estimation of population size and structure. We developed and tested a non-invasive genetic approach for red deer (Cervus elaphus) population size and density estimation based on faeces collected from three free-ranging red deer populations in south-western Germany. Altogether, we genotyped 2762 faecal samples, representing 1431 different individuals. We estimated population density for both sexes separately using two different approaches: spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) approach and a single-session urn model (CAPWIRE). The estimated densities of both approaches were similar for all three study areas, ranging between total densities of 3.3 (2.5-4.4) and 8.5 (6.4-11.3) red deer/km(2). The estimated sex ratios differed significantly between the studied populations (ranging between 1:1.1 and 1:1.7), resulting in considerable consequences for management. In further research, the issues of population closure and approximation of the effectively sampled area for density estimation should be addressed. The presented approach can serve as a valuable tool for the management of deer populations, and to our knowledge, it represents the only sex-specific approach for estimation of red deer population size and density.

AB  - Due to the expanding oil-related activities, the arctic and sub-arctic marine environments are increasingly vulnerable to oil-related pollution such as accidental oil spills. These cold-water ecosystems harbor many fish species that are both ecologically and economically important such as the pelagic polar cod (Boreogadus saida), capelin (Mallotus villosus), and benthic long rough dab (Hippoglossoides platessoides). The latter two are much less studied and it is crucial to characterize their responses to oil-related contaminants and develop molecular biomarkers and genomic resources for future monitoring. In this study, liver slice preparation and culture methods were used to characterize the transcriptome responses (using RNA-seq) in capelin and long rough dab to exposures of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compound benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). The liver slice culture and exposure experiments were performed onboard a research vessel in the Barents Sea. Strong up-regulation of genes involved in biotransformation, particularly the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway was observed in both species. A comparison of the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with previously published polar cod exposures indicates that the latter responded more strongly (higher number of genes), suggesting higher uptake and bioconcentration of BaP in the fatty liver tissue, although other factors such as differences in clearance rate could potentially affect the responses. This study provides new genomic resources and gene expression biomarkers in capelin and long rough dab, enhancing our understanding of their response mechanism to oil-related contaminants.

AB  - The development and expansion of road networks pose considerable threats to natural habitats and wildlife, fostering a landscape of fear. In addition to direct mortality caused by road collisions, road construction and maintenance often result in habitat fragmentation and loss, impeding animal movement and gene flow between populations. Mountain ungulates are already confined to fragmented habitat patches and roads can cause substantial disturbances to their critical ecological processes, such as dispersal and migration. In this study, we employed two key mountain ungulates, the wild goat (Capra aegagrus) and mouflon (Ovis gmelini), as functional models to examine how road networks impact the quantity and connectivity of natural habitats in southwestern Iran, where extensive road construction has led to significant landscape changes. We used the MaxEnt method to predict species distribution, the circuit theory to evaluate habitat connectivity, and the Spatial Road Disturbance Index (SPROADI) to assess road impacts. During the modeling process, we selected eleven important variables and employed a model parametrization strategy to identify the optimal configuration for the MaxEnt model. For SPROADI index we used three sub-indices, including traffic intensity, vicinity impact, and fragmentation grade. We then integrated the results of these analyses to identify areas with the most significant environmental impacts of roads on the coherency of the natural habitats. The findings indicate that suitable habitats for wild goats are widely distributed across the study area, while suitable habitats for mouflon are primarily concentrated in the northeastern region. Conservation gap analysis revealed that only 8% of wild goat habitats and 7% of mouflon habitats are covered by protected areas (PAs). The SPROADI map highlighted that 23% of the study area is negatively influenced by road networks. Moreover, 30.4% of highest-probability corridors for mouflon, and 25.7% for wild goat, were highly vulnerable to the impacts of roads. Our combined approach enabled us to quantitatively assess species-specific vulnerability to the impacts of heavy road networks. This study emphasizes the urgent need to address the negative effects of road networks on wildlife habitats and connectivity corridors. Our approach effectively identifies sensitive areas, which can help inform mitigation strategies and support more effective conservation planning in significantly transformed landscapes.

AB  - Plants are attacked by a large diversity of pathogens. These pathogens can affect plant growth and fitness directly but also indirectly by inducing changes in the host plant that affect interactions with beneficial and antagonistic insects. Yet, we lack insights into the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of pathogens on their host plants, and how these effects differ among pathogen species.
   In this study, we examined four fungal pathogens on the wood anemone Anemone nemorosa. We used field observations to record the impacts of each pathogen species on plant growth and fitness throughout the season, and experimental hand pollination and insect feeding trials to assess whether fitness impacts were mediated by pathogen-induced changes in plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore interactions.
   Three out of four pathogens negatively affected plant size, and pathogens differed strongly in their effect on plant architecture. Infected plants had lower fitness, but this effect was not mediated by pollinators or herbivores. Even so, two out of four pathogens reduced herbivory on anemones in the field, and we found negative effects of pathogen infection on herbivore preference and performance in feeding trials.
   Synthesis. Our results are of broader significance in two main respects. First, we demonstrated that pathogens negatively affected plant growth and fitness, and that the magnitude of these effects varied among pathogen species, suggesting that pathogens constitute important selective agents that differ in strength. Second, direct effects on plant fitness were more important than effects mediated by beneficial and antagonistic insects. In addition, although we did not detect insect-mediated effects on plant fitness, the negative effects of some pathogens on herbivore preference and performance indicate that pathogen communities influence the distribution and abundance of herbivores.

AB  - The expansion of road networks and increased traffic loads have resulted in an increase in the problem of wildlife roadkill, which has a serious impact on both human safety and the wildlife population. However, roadkill data are collected primarily from the incidental sighting, thus they often lack the true-absence information. This study aims to identify the factors associated with Korean water deer (Hydropotes inermis) roadkill in Korea using the point processing modeling (PPM) approach. Water deer roadkill point data were fitted with explanatory variables derived from forest cover type, topography, and human demography maps and an animal distribution survey. Water deer roadkill showed positive associations with road density, human population density, road width, and water deer detection point density. Slope and elevation showed negative associations with roadkill. The traffic volume and adjacent water deer population may be the major driving factors in roadkill events. The results also imply that the PPM can be a flexible tool for developing roadkill mitigation strategy, providing analytical advantages of roadkill data, such as clarification of model specification and interpretation, while avoiding issues derived from a lack of true-absence information.

AB  - In view of the difficulties encountered when tuning parameters and the lack of anti-interference capabilities exhibited by high-precision trajectory-tracking control of quadrotor UAVs in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes a fusion control framework based on an improved crowned pig optimisation algorithm (ICPO) and preset performance anti-disturbance control (PPC-ADRC). Initially, this paper addresses the limited convergence efficiency of the traditional crowned pig algorithm (CPO) by introducing a dynamic time threshold mechanism and an adaptability-based directed elimination strategy to balance the algorithm's global exploration and local development capabilities. This results in a significant improvement in the convergence speed and optimisation accuracy. Secondly, a hierarchical control architecture is designed, with the outer loop using a PPC-ADRC controller to dynamically constrain the tracking error boundary using an exponential performance funnel function and a combined state observer (ESO) to estimate the compound disturbance in real time. The inner-loop attitude control uses ADRC, and the 24-dimensional parameters of the ADRC (including the ESO bandwidth and non-linear feedback gain) are optimised autonomously using the ICPO to achieve efficient parameter tuning. The simulation experiments demonstrate that, in comparison with the original CPO, the ICPO attains an average fitness ranking that is superior in the CEC2014-2022 benchmark test, thereby substantiating its global optimisation capability. In the PPC-ADRC controller parameter optimisation, the preset performance of the ICPO-tuned PPC-ADRC controller (PPC-ADRC) is superior to that of the particle swarm optimisation (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA) and original CPO. The ICPO-based PPC-ADRC controller is shown to reduce the total error by more than 45.6% compared to the ordinary ADRC controller in the task of tracking a spiral trajectory, and it effectively reduces the overshoot. Its capacity to withstand complex wind disturbances is notably superior to that of the traditional PID and ADRC architectures. Stability analysis further proves that the system satisfies the Lyapunov convergence condition in a finite time. This research provides a theoretical foundation for the high-precision control of UAVs in complex dynamic environments.

AB  - The climate-smart village (CSV) concept is aimed at helping to improve household welfare through better climate change adaptation. This study used data from small ruminant producers in CSV and non-CSV communities of the Lawra and Jirapa municipalities in the Upper West Region of Ghana. First, we assessed how the project related to adoption of climate change coping and adaptation strategies. Next, we examined how the adoption influenced goat producers' welfare through its effect on herd size. The results showed that farmers located in CSVs adopted about 0.57 more strategy per season for coping with and adapting to climate change than those in non-CSVs. Nevertheless, this higher adoption rate did not translate into any substantial difference in herd size, even though for every additional strategy adopted farmers' welfare increased by about 0.21%, all else equal. These findings indicate that the CSV concept can help reduce farmers' vulnerabilities to climate change and foster sustainable livestock production through better adoption of strategies and enhanced welfare. Thus, strengthening the capacities of existing CSVs and scaling up the project to cover new communities would improve the social welfare function for livestock farmers in Ghana and elsewhere. Nevertheless, future research should investigate reasons why higher adoption did not directly increase herd size and advise project implementers accordingly.

AB  - Conservation surveillance, or the monitoring of people for conservation purposes, is a core component of coercive conservation governance. Over the last decade, in response to the social injustice attributed to top-down applications of surveillance technologies associated with militarised conservation, policies have increasingly prescribed an integration of local populations into conservation law enforcement. The problem with 'inclusive' or 'community-based' forms of conservation surveillance is that little is empirically known about reporting behaviours within rural communities. While reporting rates tend to be low, practitioners have limited understanding of how to engage local people. This knowledge gap significantly undermines conservation's capacity to integrate local people into conservation surveillance and enhance community-based interventions for combating illegal-hunting and illegal wildlife trade (IWT). Drawing on fieldwork among communities in north-west Namibia, where local people are recruited as informants of conservation authorities, we contribute a deeper, qualitative understanding of what motivates local people to report or withhold information on illegal-hunting of rhino and plains game. We show that communal area residents primarily report because they feel morally compelled to do so and/or because they seek to bolster their claims to status, privilege and entitlement. They fail to report due to the pervasiveness of communal disciplinary power, including locally-divergent social rules and sanctions. In contrast to dominant perceptions among policymakers and practitioners, our analysis demonstrates that incentive-based informant networks and reward systems have limited effectiveness, while carrying high risks. Our analysis supports five recommendations for integrating local people into conservation surveillance in more locally acceptable and sustainable ways.

AB  - Fish feeding habit determines the digestive tract structure and intestinal microflora. However, the relationship between feeding habit, digestive intestinal morphology, and microbial diversity of omnivorous, herbivorous, plankton feeder, and carnivorous fish from the same environment has not been compared. This study compared the digestive enzyme activities, intestinal morphology, and intestinal microflora of omnivorous (Carassius auratus), herbivorous (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), carnivorous (Siniperca chuatsi), and plankton feeder (Schizothorax grahami) fishes and predicted the potential functions of specific microflora on different nutrients. Twelve intestine samples were collected from each of the four fishes from Dianchi Lake. The composition and diversity of microbial communities were determined by using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA. The results showed that the carnivorous fish (S. chuatsi) had higher trypsin and pancrelipase activities in the hepatopancreas and enteropeptidase in the intestine, but lower amylase activities in the intestine. The carnivorous fish intestine had more microvilli branches and complex structures than other fish species in the order carnivorous > herbivorous > plankton feeder > omnivorous. The intestinal microflora diversity was higher in the omnivorous fish and followed the order omnivorous > herbivorous > plankton feeder > carnivorous. Acinetobacter species and Bacteroides species were the most dominant flora in the carnivorous and herbivorous fishes, respectively. Acinetobacter species and Pseudomonas species might help the host to digest protein, while Bacteroidetes species may help the host to digest cellulose. Taken together, feeding habit determines the digestive enzyme activities, intestinal tissue morphology, and differential colonization of fish intestinal flora. The knowledge obtained is useful in feed formulation and feeding practices for the studied fish species.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) impact the relationships between plants, aphids (insects that feed on plant phloem), and their natural enemies (insects that prey on or parasitize aphids). The presence of AMF influences the growth and population of different aphid species and affects the development of aphid-killing wasps and their attraction to plants. This research has been conducted also considering the insects' feeding strategy and their feeding specialization. This study provides novel perspectives on how these fungi shape interactions in the natural world, offering potential insights for the development of sustainable pest management strategies in agriculture. Summary Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are major root symbionts regulating plant physiology. Their presence affects the performance of aboveground insect herbivores in relation to their feeding strategy and their feeding specialization. For example, the effect of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis on chewing insects, positive for specialists and negative for generalists, has been previously demonstrated. Conversely, the impact of AMF on phloem-suckers with relatively different levels of specialization remains unexplored. We tested the influence of the AM Funneliformis mosseae on the fitness of the specialist aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum and the generalist aphid Myzus persicae on Vicia faba plants. Further, we investigated the effects of AMF on the higher trophic level, the aphid parasitoids Aphidius ervi (specialist) and Aphidius colemani (generalist), by evaluating plant attractiveness and parasitoid fitness. To support the results of behavioral and biological bioassays we characterized the photosynthetic parameters, the volatilome and the transcriptome of tested plants. Mycorrhizal plants proved unsuitable for the generalist M. persicae but enhanced the fitness of the specialist A. pisum. The AM symbiosis had no effects on the behavioral response of A. colemani and enhanced the attraction and fitness of A. ervi. Volatilome and transcriptome profiling corroborated the results of bioassay highlighting a bottom-up effect of the AMF across a plant-aphid-parasitoid system.

AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), renowned for its exceptional biological diversity, is home to numerous endemic species. However, research on the virology of vulnerable vertebrates like yaks remains limited. In this study, our objective was to use metagenomics to provide a comprehensive understanding of the diversity and evolution of the gut virome in yak populations across different regions of the QTP. Our findings revealed a remarkably diverse array of viruses in the gut of yaks, including those associated with vertebrates and bacteriophages. Notably, some vertebrate-associated viruses, such as astrovirus and picornavirus, showed significant sequence identity across diverse yak populations. Additionally, we observed differences in the functional profiles of genes carried by the yak gut virome across different regions. Moreover, the virus-bacterium symbiotic network that we discovered holds potential significance in maintaining the health of yaks. Overall, this research expands our understanding of the viral communities in the gut of yaks and highlights the importance of further investigating the interactions between viruses and their hosts. These data will be beneficial for revealing the crucial role that viruses play in the yak gut ecology in future studies.

AB  - Since the 1980s, the field of anthracology has continued to expand in Southern Africa to study the interaction between past human societies and their environments, including plant resources and forest management from prehistoric times. To answer such questions, the need for comparative wood anatomy analyses of the local taxa is of particular relevance in this rich species environment to perform rigorous taxonomic identification. This paper introduces the first computerassisted identification tool specifically designed for the analysis of archaeological charcoals from Southern Africa. This online database, called SACHA for Southern African CHArcoals, is accessible via the following link: https://sacha.identificationkey. org/. It currently includes anatomical descriptions, as well as ecological and ethnobotanical information for 68 taxa of modemspecimens collected in the Savanna Biome. An identification key is available on the Xper3 online platform, which is designed for descriptive data management and interactive identification. This article presents a survey of the existing reference collections on Southern African woods and charcoals and proposes an overview of the development of computerised tools for systematic wood descriptions and identification keys. The SACHA database can be easily updated and enriched without requiring computer science skills. Furthermore, it can serve as a training tool for beginners in wood anatomy. The database offers an online interactive key option, a fact sheet catalogue, and conventional dichotomous and tabular keys for offline or printed versions. These functions are facilitated by the various export formats that are available in the database.

AB  - Megaherbivore grazing (e.g. by turtles, and sirenians) plays a major and well-documented role in structuring seagrass meadows around the world; however, we know little about local-scale (intra- and inter-meadow) variability in megaherbivore grazing. This is surprising given that megaherbivores are highly selective eaters who may feed by targeting certain meadows, or areas within a meadow. We ran an experiment in the Great Barrier Reef to test the question: How does megaherbivory vary on a regional scale? We used megaherbivore exclusion cages in 5 meadows along a 50 km region of coastline around Gladstone in the southern Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area to understand variability in megaherbivory between meadows. We found differences in the impacts of megaherbivore grazing on seagrass biomass and shoot heights between meadows. There were also interannual differences in grazing impacts at one meadow that had been studied previously. These differences may be due to megaherbivore population and grazing dynamics, as well as the response of seagrass to grazing pressure. Our results show that seagrass meadows grazed by megaherbivores are dynamic systems that vary on regional spatial scales as well as over time. This is important for management measures that seek to consider the seagrass-herbivore system as a whole and understand the implications of monitoring efforts based on seagrass aboveground condition.

AB  - In this study, we investigated how IBD patterns shared between individuals of the same breed could be informative of its admixture level, with the underlying assumption that the most admixed breeds, i.e. the least genetically isolated, should have a much more fragmented genome. We considered 111 goat breeds (i.e. 2501 individuals) and 156 sheep breeds (i.e. 3304 individuals) from Europe, Africa and Asia, for which beadchip SNP genotypes had been performed. We inferred the breed's level of admixture from: (i) the proportion of the genome shared by breed's members (i.e. "genetic integrity level" assessed from ADMIXTURE software analyses), and (ii) the "AV index" (calculated from Reynolds' genetic distances), used as a proxy for the "genetic distinctiveness". In both goat and sheep datasets, the statistical analyses (comparison of means, Spearman correlations, LM and GAM models) revealed that the most genetically isolated breeds, also showed IBD profiles made up of more shared IBD segments, which were also longer. These results pave the way for further research that could lead to the development of admixture indicators, based on the characterization of intra-breed shared IBD segments, particularly effective as they would be independent of the knowledge of the whole genetic landscape in which the breeds evolve. Finally, by highlighting the fragmentation experienced by the genomes subjected to crossbreeding carried out over the last few generations, the study reminds us of the need to preserve local breeds and the integrity of their adaptive architectures that have been shaped over the centuries.

AB  - Chytrid fungal parasites convert dietary energy and essential dietary molecules, such as long-chain (LC) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), from inedible algal/cyanobacteria hosts into edible zoospores. How the improved biochemical PUFA composition of chytrid-infected diet may extend to zooplankton, linking diet quality to consumer fitness, remains unexplored. Here, we assessed the trophic role of chytrids in supporting dietary energy and PUFA requirements of the crustacean zooplankton Daphnia, when feeding on the filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix. Only Daphnia feeding on chytrid-infected Planktothrix reproduced successfully and had significantly higher survival and growth rates compared with Daphnia feeding on the sole Planktothrix diet. While the presence of chytrids resulted in a two-fold increase of carbon ingested by Daphnia, carbon assimilation increased by a factor of four, clearly indicating enhanced carbon transfer efficiency with chytrid presence. Bulk carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotopes did not indicate any treatment-specific dietary effects on Daphnia, nor differences in trophic position among diet sources and the consumer. Compound-specific carbon isotopes of fatty acids (delta C-13(FA)), however, revealed that chytrids bioconverted short-chain to LC-PUFA, making it available for Daphnia. Chytrids synthesised the omega-3 PUFA stearidonic acid de novo, which was selectively retained by Daphnia. Values of delta C-13(FA) demonstrated that Daphnia also bioconverted short-chain to LC-PUFA. We provide isotopic evidence that chytrids improved the dietary provision of LC-PUFA for Daphnia and enhanced their fitness. We argue for the existence of a positive feedback loop between enhanced Daphnia growth and herbivory in response to chytrid-mediated improved diet quality. Chytrids upgrade carbon from the primary producer and facilitate energy and PUFA transfer to primary consumers, potentially also benefitting upper trophic levels of pelagic food webs.

AB  - We compared embryogenesis of five species of domesticated even-toed and one odd-toed ungulate and used a phylogenetic framework to contextualize such comparison. Organ systems that occur relatively earlier in embryogenesis generally have more time to develop and therefore are found to be more mature at birth when compared to structures that appear later in development. We hypothesized that the less mature the animals' organs are at birth, the more they are susceptible to artificial selection. The horse had the most mature organs at birth, followed by cattle, reindeer, sheep/goat, and pig. This pattern of maturity could be observed almost during the entire development. Heterochronic shifts among species were observed only after fur starts to develop. Changes in the fur coloration are one of the first observable signs of domestication and the heterochrony of this trait may be related to the effects on neural crest-derived pigment cells by artificial selection. The six ungulate species also differ in the relative duration of their weaning period and the potential extent of its artificial shortening. We put all these traits in the context of their inherited evolutionary characteristics and artificial domestication process. Related to their altriciality, carnivoran domesticates, which also belong to Scrotifera, are less mature at birth than all domesticated ungulates. Although we detected clear character correlations to life history traits, it is impossible based on the present data, to trace specific exaptations to the domestication process. We hypothesize a deep time developmental penetration of adult characters into embryogenesis.

AB  - We used ranch records and soil analyses to investigate the effects of cattle ranching on phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) balances in a humid, tallgrass savanna ecosystem in Tanzania. Over a 41-yr period between 1958 and 1999, the ranch supported an average of 10 435 cattle. These consumed an estimated 571 586 tons (t) of dry matter containing 692 t P and 6 230 t N. Of these nutrients, 162 t of P (23%) and 602 t of N (9.7%) were exported in animals leaving the ranch, while 222 t (32 %) P and 2 364 t of N (38 %) were transferred as excreta to the night corrals. The measured excesses of nutrients in the soil of the corrals were equivalent to 59% of all P and 19% of all N deposited in these areas over 41 yr. Total losses from the pastures amounted to 10.2% of P and 6.6% of N in the top 20 cm of tall grass savanna soil. These losses, especially of P, probably reduced the nutritional quality of the pastures and may have contributed to the reported decline in animal fertility. In addition, they may have promoted the spread of secondary woodland dominated by Vachellia (formerly Acacia) zanzibarica. Three general conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, humid tallgrass savannas on nutrient-poor soils are unsuitable for intensive livestock production. Second, over an extended period the loss of nutrients from cattle pastures can be ecologically significant. Ensuring the sustainability of grazing systems requires measures to counteract this loss, such as the use of shifting night corrals. Third, ranch records, while lacking the precision and detail possible in experimental studies, can provide valuable insights into long-term effects of ranching that would be difficult to obtain by other means.

AB  - As detected in warming and ocean acidification, global change can have profound impact on marine life. Its effects on seagrasses are becoming increasingly well-known, since several studies have focused on the responses of these species to global change conditions. However a few studies have assessed the combined effect of temperature and acidification on seagrasses. Overall in this study, the combined effects of increased ocean temperature and pH levels expected at the end of this century (+5 degrees C and pH 7.5) on Cymodocea nodosa from Canary Islands, were evaluated for one month through manipulative laboratory experiments. Growth, net production, respiration, gross primary production, chlorophyll-a concentration and its vulnerability to herbivory were quantified. Results showed a positive effect of decreased pH on growth and gross primary production, as well as greater vulnerability to consumption by the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. In contrast, increased temperature limited net and gross primary production. This study shows than in future scenarios, C. nodosa from the Canary Islands may be a losing species in the global change stakes.

AB  - Classic evolutionary theory suggests that sexual dimorphism evolves primarily via sexual and fecundity selection. However, theory and evidence are beginning to accumulate suggesting that resource competition can drive the evolution of sexual dimorphism, via ecological character displacement between sexes. A key prediction of this hypothesis is that the extent of ecological divergence between sexes will be associated with the extent of sexual dimorphism. As the stable isotope ratios of animal tissues provide a quantitative measure of various aspects of ecology, we carried out a meta-analysis examining associations between the extent of isotopic divergence between sexes and the extent of body size dimorphism. Our models demonstrate that large amounts of between-study variation in isotopic (ecological) divergence between sexes is nonrandom and may be associated with the traits of study subjects. We, therefore, completed meta-regressions to examine whether the extent of isotopic divergence between sexes is associated with the extent of sexual size dimorphism. We found modest but significantly positive associations across species between size dimorphism and ecological differences between sexes, that increased in strength when the ecological opportunity for dietary divergence between sexes was greatest. Our results, therefore, provide further evidence that ecologically mediated selection, not directly related to reproduction, can contribute to the evolution of sexual dimorphism.

AB  - The present study aimed to test the effect of three stocking densities: 100, 200, and 300 ind m(-3) (D100, D200, and D300, respectively) on survival, growth (weight and total length), and condition factor of Microphis brachyurus. At the end of the six-week trial, there were no significant differences in the fish's survival, growth, and condition. The results suggest that this species presents high adaptability under culture conditions. A suboptimal stocking density generates a suboptimal use of infrastructure and decreases the production system's profitability. Based on the present study, a stocking density of 300 ind m(-3) is recommended to increase the aquaculture infrastructure's profitability for ornamental or conservation purposes.

AB  - Top predators can affect the behaviour of prey species via lethal (direct kill) or non-lethal effects (i.e., through predation risk). For example, prey species may move from areas perceived as risky to safer spaces where predation risk is lower, which can have important consequences for investment in foraging, movement, and mating, and for the behaviour and habitat use of other species, such as mesopredators. These changes in prey and mesopredator behaviours are likely mediated by the presence of predator cues in the environment. Here, we test how different predator cues (visual and odor) from familiar and novel predators (brown bear and Amur tiger, respectively) influence ungulate, mesopredator, and top predator visitation rates to camera trap sites in a national nature reserve in China. The comparison of these predator types is of particular interest in this region as Amur tigers may shortly be reintroduced here. We found that visual but not odour cues significantly affected ungulate visitation rates: ungulates showed reduced visitation to sites with either a novel or familiar visual predator cue. When combined, mesopredators and top predators also showed a small reduction in visitation rates to tiger cue sites compared to bear cue sites, suggesting a possible novel predator effect. The generalisation and contextual importance of predator cues for prey and mesopredators have been little studied. Understanding how species respond to novel cues may help to determine extinction probabilities and overall plasticity in the face of change. This study is, therefore, an important step forward in understanding predator cue responses at the community level. This is also the first study to test the ecological function of Amur tiger cues in the wild environment and may serve as essential information in the rewilding process of captive Amur tiger plans.

AB  - About 100 years ago, groups of European beech were reintroduced into Norway spruce stands in some parts of Germany as a restoration approach. The aim of this approach was to maintain or rehabilitate the ecological function of soil fertility and the regeneration option of beech for the next generation. The effect of beech groups on surrounding spruce stands was studied in the Ore Mountains by recording natural regeneration of beech and humus layer thickness and form. Point pattern statistics were used to analyse the spread of beech regeneration and to determine factors influencing its establishment. It was found that the density of regeneration decreases with increasing distance from the beech group. However, beech regeneration was found up to distances of 69 m. Furthermore, it becomes evident that PAR radiation (maximum regeneration densities at PAR values of 35 W/m(2)) and fencing (3.41 times higher regeneration density compared to unfenced areas) against deer have a positive influence on beech regeneration density. Ordered categorical models were used to model humus form and non-linear models were used to model humus layer thickness. It could be proven that the most bioactive humus forms and lowest humus layer thicknesses were found within the beech group. With increasing distance to the beech group, the total humus layer thickness and the proportion of mormoder in the spruce stand increased. The positive influence of the beech group on the humus composition extends to about 40 m from the centre of the beech group. Due to the former arrangement of the beech groups in the terrain, the effects can also extend to the spruce stands in between. The hypotheses on the restoration approach of reintroducing groups of beech into spruce stands formulated by foresters 100 years ago can thus be confirmed. For future restoration approaches of spruce stands, groupwise mixtures of beech should be established with a distance of 40-50 m.

AB  - Simple Summary It is vitally important to understand the effects of climate change on insect pest populations and crop losses. Using elevation as a proxy for climate change, a field study was conducted in farmer's fields in Nepal at various elevations in the Himalayan Mountains. At higher elevations, natural herbivore populations and plant damage from herbivory were significantly higher compared to their low-elevation counterparts. Temperature varied with elevation in the field and significantly affected both insect populations and plant damage. A geographical shift of insect pests towards higher elevations is predicated, so it is important to better understand how biotic and abiotic ecological factors and evolutionary processes will act together to affect ecosystem dynamics to reliably predict future pest problems. Elevation gradients are used as a proxy to simulate climate change effects. A field study was conducted along an elevational gradient in Nepal to understand the effects of abiotic conditions on agriculturally important insect herbivore populations (tobacco caterpillar: Spodoptera litura, tomato fruit worm: Helicoverpa armigera, and South American leaf miner, Tuta absoluta) and herbivory damage on tomatoes. Elevation ranged from 100 m to 1400 m above sea level, representing different climatic zones where tomatoes are grown. Contrary to our hypothesis, natural herbivore populations and herbivory damage significantly increased at higher elevations. Individual insect species responses were variable. Populations of S. litura and T. absoluta increased at higher elevations, whereas the H. armigera population was highest at the mid-elevational range. Temperature variations with elevation also affected insect catch numbers and the level of plant damage from herbivory. In the context of climate warming, our results demonstrate that the interactive effects of elevation and climatic factors (e.g., temperature) will play an important role in determining the changes in insect pest populations and the extent of crop losses.

AB  - American Eel Anguilla rostrata populations along the Atlantic coast of the United States have been in decline over the past several decades. One suggested cause of the decline is construction of barriers that block access to upstream tributaries where they can spend a significant portion of their lives. Success of reintroduction efforts above barriers has rarely been evaluated. Within the Susquehanna River (Chesapeake Bay watershed), over 1 million eels were released above four major downstream barriers in the past decade. We used backpack electrofishing and tagging to monitor growth, sexual differentiation, and population density of reintroduced eels in Buffalo Creek, a tributary to the Susquehanna River (Pennsylvania). From 2012 to 2019, we caught over 2,000 individuals, tagged more than 1,800, and recaptured 229. Recaptured eels provided insight into growth, sexual differentiation, and movement. Nearly 99% of recaptures remained near stocking locations. The average growth rate was 47.8 mm/y and ranged between -5.8 and 116.0 mm/y. Females generally grew significantly faster than males, and growth rates of several females exceeded 100 mm/y, a rate typically associated with estuarine residents. The population density within stocking sites was over 2,300 eels/km, roughly four times higher than Susquehanna River tributaries below the most downstream dam, and exceeded the target stocking goal of 529 eels/km. While we caught most eels in areas sampled near stocking locations, we captured some eels in smaller upstream tributaries away from stocking locations. Our study is the first to examine how reintroduced eels grow following stocking above four major dams on the Susquehanna River. We suggest that managers considering moving eels above blockages account for release location and density to achieve desired benefits to the overall population.

AB  - The canopy water storage capacity of vegetation has great significance for the hydrological cycle. We used the Pereira regression analysis method, scale-up method, and simulated rainfall method to determine canopy water storage capacity from 2014 to 2018. The Pereira regression analysis was affected mainly by the seasonal variation in the leaf area index and the observation method of throughfall. The canopy water storage capacity was 0.68 mm and 0.72 mm for C. korshinskii and H. rhamnoides, respectively. The canopy water storage capacity of C. korshinskii and H. rhamnoides was 0.73 mm and 0.76 mm, respectively, using the scale-up method. The scale-up method showed that water storage capacity per area of the canopy components was in the order of branches (0.31 mm) > leaves (0.27 mm) > trunks (0.15 mm) for C. korshinskii, and trunks (0.33 mm) > branches (0.29 mm) > leaves (0.14 mm) for H. rhamnoides. We used eight simulated rainfall intensities to determine the canopy water storage capacity for C. korshinskii and H. rhamnoides, which was 0.63 mm and 0.59 mm, respectively.

AB  - Milkweeds, despite their toxicity, support a complex and diverse community of specialised herbivore insects, from sap-sucking aphids to leaf-chewing caterpillars and beetles. In the case of butterflies, milkweeds are the feeding plants of the iconic Monarch butterfly and the rest of the milkweed butterflies (Nymphalidae: Danainae). This plant-insect relationship represents one of the most remarkable examples of herbivorous exploitation and plant defence evolution. For the neotropical milkweed butterflies, numerous host plants have been reported inside several genera and species of Apocynaceae. However, new observations still appear. In this work, we report for the first time Telminostelma foetidum as a host plant for two Danaus species and for the Erebidae Euchaetes mitis in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca, Mexico. We also report novel observations of an adult of D. eresimus as a flower visitor of T. foetidum besides the already known honey bee. We discuss the importance of native milkweeds in the maintenance of the urban population of milkweed butterflies and moths.

AB  - The diet of ungulates is often characterized by low protein levels and the presence of indigestible and defensive compounds. It also often lacks micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) essential for growth, health and reproduction. Ungulates select rich plant organs to compensate for nutrient shortages and may consume soil, faeces and even bones. It is common for ungulates to incidentally ingest plant-dwelling insects (PDI) while feeding. It is well known that insects contain protein and essential nutrients that can feed livestock, potentially replacing conventional feed. Based on this, we propose the 'nutritional benefit of incidental ingestion' hypothesis, suggesting that ungulates may nutritionally benefit from ingesting PDI while foraging. Based on evidence from the literature on PDI ingestion by ungulates and on the nutritional properties of different insects, we discuss how and whether the ingestion of PDI while foraging might improve the nutrient balance of ungulates and recommend a set of controlled experiments to test it. We provide a new and unfamiliar dimension of nutritional ecology, which is relevant to various grazing ecosystems. We propose to modify "trivial" food web structures, as direct trophic interactions between ungulates and PDI may hold greater significance for ungulate performance and behaviour.

AB  - Expansion and intensification of agroecosystems is one of the major causes of habitat loss in the savanna biome in South Africa. As such, this study sought to determine the influence of commercial subtropical fruit plantations (banana and macadamia) on species richness, abundance, and composition of surface-active arthropods compared to the savanna biome. Given that pesticides and herbicides are applied from spring to early autumn in banana and macadamia plantations, we sampled in winter to reduce the potential impact of pesticides and herbicides. Surface-active arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps. Habitat type did not affect species richness and abundance of ants and spiders, as well as species richness of beetles. However, significantly greater abundance of beetles was recorded in the macadamia plantation compared to the banana and savanna. This could have been due to greater abundance of herbivorous beetles and other insects, which would have increased the diversity of predatory beetles. Furthermore, unlike the banana plantation, the macadamia plantation was characterised by a deep leaf litter layer and the presence of weeds and grasses, which probably increased abundance of beetles. Species composition indicated that the studied arthropod taxa associate with specific habitats, as demonstrated by the three habitats supporting different species composition. Despite savanna habitat not supporting high species richness or abundance of surface-active arthropods, we recorded the highest number of unique species of ants and spiders in the savanna rather than in the plantations. These results highlight the importance of natural landscapes in conservation of surface-active arthropods.

AB  - Pathogenic viruses are globally distributed and have caused severe diseases or death in wildlife populations, posing enormous threats to wild animals, especially threatened species. The transmission dynamics of pathogenic viral diseases are affected by complex factors and their interactions, such as climate, virus traits, host life-history traits, and environmental conditions. The seroprevalence of viruses can reflect the historical exposure of hosts to viruses and may indicate accumulated pathogenic viral disease severity in wildlife populations. We studied viruses with demonstrated virulence that have caused diseases or death in their natural hosts among wild terrestrial mammals. We extracted data on virus traits, host species, host life-history traits, and climate conditions from the peer-reviewed literature to explore their effects on and interactions with virus seroprevalence in wildlife populations. Ungulates were the most studied group followed by carnivores. The seroprevalence of pathogenic viruses was positively correlated with temperature in wildlife populations. The correlation between precipitation and virus seroprevalence was complicated and depended on different interactions of variables. Gregarious animals and nonmigratory ungulates were more vulnerable to high viral seroprevalence than other species. As global temperatures increase, drought will increase, and gregarious and nonmigratory ungulates may thus experience increased spread and incidence of pathogenic viruses, especially vector-borne viruses. Gregarious carnivores may face a high risk of outbreaks of viruses that are transmitted directly (e.g., canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, and rabies virus). Our results can be used to inform protocols for surveillance of specific viruses and susceptible host life-history traits to prevent epizootics in natural populations, which will be crucial for the conservation of terrestrial mammals under global climate change.

AB  - Declines of large predatory fish due to overexploitation are restructuring food webs across the globe. It is now becoming evident that restoring these altered food webs requires addressing not only ecological processes, but evolutionary ones as well, because human-induced rapid evolution may in turn affect ecological dynamics. We studied the potential for niche differentiation between different plate armor phenotypes in a rapidly expanding population of a small prey fish, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). In the central Baltic Sea, three-spined stickleback abundance has increased dramatically during the past decades. The increase in this typical mesopredator has restructured near-shore food webs, increased filamentous algal blooms, and threatens coastal biodiversity. Time-series data covering 22 years show that the increase coincides with a decline in the number of juvenile perch (Perca fluviatilis), the most abundant predator of stickleback along the coast. We investigated the distribution of different stickleback plate armor phenotypes depending on latitude, environmental conditions, predator and prey abundances, nutrients, and benthic production; and described the stomach content of the stickleback phenotypes using metabarcoding. We found two distinct lateral armor plate phenotypes of stickleback, incompletely and completely plated. The proportion of incompletely plated individuals increased with increasing benthic production and decreasing abundances of adult perch. Metabarcoding showed that the stomach content of the completely plated individuals more often contained invertebrate herbivores (amphipods) than the incompletely plated ones. Since armor plates are defense structures favored by natural selection in the presence of fish predators, the phenotype distribution suggests that a novel low-predation regime favors stickleback with less armor. Our results suggest that morphological differentiation of the three-spined stickleback has the potential to affect food web dynamics and influence the persistence and resilience of the stickleback take-over in the Baltic Sea.

AB  - Antarctic notothenioid fishes are recognised as one of the rare examples of adaptive radiation in the marine system. Withstanding the freezing temperatures of Antarctic waters, these fishes have diversified into over 100 species within no more than 10-20 million years. However, the exact species richness of the radiation remains contested. In the genus Channichthys, between one and nine species are recognised by different authors. To resolve the number of Channichthys species, genetic information would be highly valuable; however, so far, only sequences of a single species, C. rhinoceratus, are available. Here, we present the nearly complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of C. rugosus, obtained from a formalin-fixed museum specimen sampled in 1974. This sequence differs from the mitochondrial genome of C. rhinoceratus in no more than 27 positions, suggesting that the two species may be synonymous.

AB  - Beginning in the 1960s, restoration of the European bison (Bison bonasus) in Ukraine has resulted in seven herds with approximately 350 total individuals currently. For the first time, we describe characteristics of habitats used by these seven European bison herds located in forest, forest-steppe, and mountain zones of Ukraine. During the growing season across all ecological zones and herds, we observed variation in bison use of woodland and open habitats associated with temporal variation in landscape scale habitat characteristics. During winter across all ecological zones and herds, variation in habitat use declined dramatically with supplementary feeding that incentivized sedentary association with woodlands. Our descriptive field observations are intended to improve understanding of European bison landscape ecology and serve as a basis for additional quantitative investigations.

AB  - Habitat or vegetation manipulation is a strategy within conservation biological control, yet, its formal study is relatively recent and lacking in many parts of the world, particularly when using native plants. We found 56 studies dealing with native plants and conservation biological control, from 2002 to 2022. Most were carried out in developed countries, and studied the provision of flower resources to natural enemies' complexes in several crops. The main gaps in knowledge, similar to studies with non-native plants, were the lack of understanding mechanisms, unknown effects on pest populations, and absence of cost-benefit analyses. Breaching these gaps will allow this strategy to be more transferable among cropping systems and locations and will promote its use by farmers.

AB  - Trends in rhinoceroses (rhinos) in Kruger National Park (Kruger) is of key concern. Poaching drives trends in the Park. Reconciling annual population estimates with yearly reports of poached carcasses fuels public critique. We account for trends in rhinos by extracting time series of estimates. Progressively modelling influences of man-agement introductions and removals, effects of environmental variation and rhino density, direct impacts of poaching, consequences of imperfect carcass detection, and indirect impacts of deaths of dependent calves form the basis of accounting for rhinos. Models that considered all these influences explained 93% of white and 83% of black rhino population trends. In addition, the models predicted 2,515 white and 225 black rhinos, similar to estimates of 2,607 (95% CI: 2,475-2,752) and 202 (95% CI: 172-237) during 2020 respectively. The best model, however, predicts slow recovery with a white rhino population equivalent to pre-poaching achieved between 2030 and 2040. For black rhinos, recovery to pre-poaching population size would be between 2040 and 2050. The poaching onslaught in Kruger disrupted eruptive white rhino dynamics and prevented black rhinos from transitioning into eruptive dynamics. Authorities require innovative approaches within and beyond Kruger to help re-ignite rhino conservation.

AB  - In Malaysia, escalating human-wildlife conflicts pose significant risks to both human populations and wildlife species, highlighting the need for advanced systems for effective conflict management. This study introduces the Geo Wild System (GWS), a novel Progressive Web Application (PWA) specifically tailored for Malaysian contexts. GWS integrates data from diverse sources, including citizen reports, park rangers, and licensed hunters, and employs Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to enhance data visualization and identify conflict hotspots. During the study period from January to June 2024, GWS recorded and facilitated the deployment of 117 traps across six districts: Shah Alam, Hulu Selangor, Sungai Besar, Hulu Langat, Georgetown, and Seberang Prai. These deployments, based on reported conflict data, resulted in the capture of 88 wildlife individuals, including 85 long-tailed macaques ( Macaca fascicularis), ), two wild boars ( Sus scrofa), ), and one Asian palm civets ( Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), ), demonstrating the system's operational effectiveness. GWS supports a comprehensive reporting, monitoring, and analysis system, utilizing GIS-based Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to pinpoint critical conflict hotspots, particularly in rapidly urbanizing areas. User feedback was overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the system's user-friendliness and robust data integration. Despite initial deployment challenges and geodetic constraints, GWS has proven to be a valuable tool for mitigating wildlife conflicts, enabling informed, timely management responses, and offering a promising approach to adaptive wildlife management in Malaysia.

AB  - Owing to a variety of causes, the habitat of Asian elephants is shrinking and degrading over time across their ranges. In this context, the present study aims to assess the suitability of the Asian elephant habitat in Buxa Tiger Reserve (BTR), a special elephant conservation area of the country. The habitat suitability has been assessed with the help of remote sensing and GIS data including multiple important criteria. The weightage of eight selected criteria was determined with the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) method. The most influential criteria was forest cover (33.25%) followed by distance to water bodies (23.08%), distance to settlement (15.64%), distance to railway (10.48%), distance to agricultural land (7.03%), distance to road (4.77%), elevation (3.44%) and slope (2.32%). It has been estimated that 30.39 % of areas are highly suitable, 38.93 % moderately suitable, 20.97 % marginally suitable, and 9.71 % not suitable areas in BTR for elephant habitat. Most significantly, highly suitable areas are mostly found in the northern part of the study area having high altitudes, steep terrain and very few anthropogenic disturbances. Therefore, the findings evidently indicate that anthropogenic disturbances have significantly reduced the suitability level of elephant habitats in BTR. The study will be extremely beneficial to policymakers and forest managers for sustainable management and conservation of Asian elephant habitat in a holistic and ecologically sound fashion.

KW  - Quality Deer Management
AB  - Since the early 1980s, Quality Deer Management (QDM) has been used widely to manage populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the United States. Since 2000, QDM has been a catalyst behind a suite of deer management cooperatives (DMCs) forming across the United States. Although QDM has grown in popularity among North American deer hunters, large-scale implementation of multi-landowner DMCs relies on voluntary changes to implement structured hunter harvest behavior to achieve management goals. Therefore, a national review of how DMCs influence harvest behavior of hunters and if the DMC model works to accomplish deer management goals is warranted. We assessed if DMCs change the harvest behavior of their members, and if factors such as state, motivations, and length of membership influence change in hunter behavior. Results from our survey of 459 DMC members across 5 U.S. states found that DMC members' harvest behavior changed after joining their DMC. Deer management cooperative members reported they were more likely to harvest does, less likely to harvest yearling males, and more likely to pass on the harvest of a 3.5 year old (or younger) males after joining the DMC. When analyzed at the state level, Texas and Georgia saw the largest gains in perceived hunt quality (>= $\ge $2.5 point gain on 1-7 scale) and QDM implementation. Motivations for joining the DMC had little impact, but length of membership influenced hunt behavior with more tenured members (>5 years of membership) being more likely to follow QDM practices. Our results suggest that DMCs serve stakeholders by increasing perceived hunt quality, assisting agency personnel with non-regulatory avenues to address management goals, and developing a community engaged with local wildlife management. Deer management cooperatives occupy the critical nexus of agency needs and private landowner deer management objectives, often at scales larger than a single private landowner, that are necessary for effectively managing wild deer populations. Although DMCs may not be widely implemented, they may address a myriad of management objectives that public and private stakeholders desire.

AB  - Megafauna became extinct during the late Quaternary, with climate changes and human activities the two main proposed extinction drivers. Palaeoloxodon naumanni (Naumann's elephant) and Mammuthus primigenius roamed the Japanese archipelago during the Pleistocene. In contrast to the increasing amount of chronological information regarding extinct elephants, stable isotopic composition of these animals is less well studied, despite its potential to reveal foraging ecologies and surrounding paleoenvironments. The isotopic compositions were measured for tooth enamel and dentin collagen of fifteen P. naumanni and five Mammuthus sp. specimens from Lake Nojiri in Honshu and four sites in Hokkaido, Japan. Statistical differences were observed between the carbon isotopic composition of tooth enamel of the Lake Nojiri elephants and those of the two elephant species in Hokkaido, suggesting more open grassland for the former. In Hokkaido, no overlap was observed in the isotopic compositions of the two species, suggesting a separation in foraging behaviors. The specimens had relatively low nitrogen isotopic composition for Late Pleistocene elephants possibly reflecting an environmental stress at the edge of their distributions. The large isotopic variations of Naumann's elephants suggest that their demise was not triggered by inflexibility in their feeding strategies.

AB  - Global calls for greater ocean protection have sparked renewed interest in very large marine protected areas (VLMPAs, >100,000 km(2)) to achieve management targets; however, their conservation value is debated. We assessed the suitability of a VLMPA (640,000 km(2)) in the Indian Ocean for capturing the movements of resident mobile marine megafauna. We found that 95% of foraging, breeding and/or locally migrating individuals occurred within the VLMPA despite variable habitat use; adult hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata, n = 22, 6124 tracking days) foraged on mesophotic banks (>30 m depth), reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi, n = 23, 652 tracking days) used shallow submerged banks, and seabirds (red-footed boobies Sula sula, brown boobies Sula leucogaster, wedge-tailed shearwaters Ardenna pacifica, n = 257, 1084 tracking days) collectively foraged throughout coastal to pelagic waters. To understand the size of MPA necessary to encompass resident mobile species, we assessed overlap with smaller and larger hypothetical MPAs. An MPA meeting the minimum threshold of a VLMPA (>100,000 km(2)) would encompass 97% of manta and 94% of turtle locations, and 59% of all seabird locations because of their more pelagic distribution. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide clear evidence for the value of the large scale of the Chagos Archipelago very large marine protected area for protection of taxonomically diverse mobile megafauna. Further, we highlight the value of the VLMPA approach as a strategy towards achieving 30% ocean protection by 2030.

AB  - Crustose coralline algae (CCA) and other encrusting calcifiers drive carbonate production on coral reefs. However, little is known about the rates of growth and calcification of these organisms within degraded turbid reef systems. Here we deployed settlement cards (N = 764) across seven reefs in Singapore for two years to examine spatio-temporal variation in encrusting community composition and CCA carbonate production. Our results showed that CCA was the dominant encrusting taxa (63.7% +/- 18.3SD) across reefs. CCA carbonate production rates (0.009-0.052 g cm-2 yr & 1) were less than half of those reported for most Indo-Pacific reefs, but similar to other turbid reef systems. Highest CCA carbonate production rates were observed furthest from Singapore's main shipping port, due to a relative increase in CCA cover on the offshore reefs. Our results suggest that proximity to areas of high industrialisation and ship traffic may reduce the cover of encrusting calcifying organisms and CCA production rates which may have negative, long-term implications for the stabilisation of nearshore reefs in urbanised settings.

AB  - Plants and arthropods are primary drivers of terrestrial ecosystem function. Trace fossils of plant-arthropod interactions (PAIs) provide a unique window into assessing terrestrial ecosystem states through geological time and evaluating changes in herbivorous arthropod feeding guilds in the wake of global biotic crises. The end-Permian event (EPE; c. 252 Ma) resulted in the loss of keystone plant species from humid tropical and high-latitude ecosystems and the extinction of several major insect groups. The subsequent Early to Middle Triassic evinced diminished terrestrial productivity, punctuated by a series of second-order biotic crises that hindered recovery. Here, we survey records of Gondwanan Early to Middle Triassic floral assemblages for evidence of PAIs as an indication of ecosystem recovery following the EPE. We compiled a comprehensive dataset of fossil plant taxa and PAIs for lower Mesozoic strata of Gondwana, revealing an increase in specific and generic floral diversity from the Early to Middle Triassic. We noted a lack of PAIs reported from many localities with abundant fossil leaves, which might be interpreted to be a consequence of a post-EPE delay in the recovery of arthropod feeding guilds compared to the flora. However, by comparing floral assemblages between regions of Gondwana, our results also partly attribute the absence of PAIs to the relative paucity of palaeoichnological and palaeobotanical studies of this interval. To test for potential under-reporting of PAIs in the Triassic, we present a case study of the well-described Australian Middle Triassic Benolong Flora. In contrast to existing Australian Early to Middle Triassic PAI reports on only three plant specimens, this systematic investigation revealed 44 PAI traces comparable to published examples, hosted by 40 fossil plant fragments (7.77% of fragments assessed; N = 591). Margin-feeding traces constituted the dominant Functional Feeding Group (FFG) identified (23 examples: 3.72% of fragments assessed). Our review highlights several Early and Middle Triassic Gondwanan plant fossil-rich successions and existing collections that require further examination. We predict that investigations of these assemblages will greatly elucidate the relationships between rapidly changing environments during the Early and Middle Triassic and their effects on the plant and arthropod communities in the Southern Hemisphere.

AB  - Crop raiding ungulates can cause costly yield losses and conflicts between agriculture, game management, and conservation. It is therefore crucial to know how, where, and when ungulates use different habitats and crops. In this study we used resource selection functions and GPS-tagged red deer Cervus elaphus (n = 38) in two different study areas (North - mainly forested land and South - mainly arable land), to investigate how red deer use arable land and different crop types in relation to availability and distance to forest cover in Sweden. Our study shows a transitional use of arable land and forests by red deer. Red deer spend on average 45% and 21% of their time in arable land in South and North respectively. In the North, arable land was selected while forest and wetlands were selected in the South. The selection of different crops also differed between the two study areas, for example rapeseed was highly selected during both seasons in South while it was used to a lower degree in relation to its availability in the North. In both study areas the probability of red deer presence on the agricultural fields decreased with distance to forest. The significant use of arable land and unharvested crops by the increasing red deer population in Sweden highlights a risk for crop damage that may need further consideration for farming practices as well as for damage and wildlife management. In our case damage mitigation should focus on rapeseed in the South, whereas there is a less clear pattern of selection among growing crops in the North. The differences in habitat and crop selection between the two areas also highlights the need of knowledge about red deer habitat selection at a regional level to be able to adapt damage mitigation and wildlife management strategies accordingly. Moreover, the transitional use of arable land and forests by red deer in mixed landscapes may imply that consumption of certain crops can affect browsing patterns and damage levels within forests and vice versa, that may have implication for both agriculture and forestry and calls for future studies.

AB  - Simple Summary: Scent rolling, a behaviour observed in large carnivores like wolves, involves lowering the chin and neck towards a scent, then rubbing the head, neck, shoulders, and back into it. Despite its prevalence, the exact reason for this behaviour remains unknown. In this study, captive wolves at Osijek Zoo responded differently to various odours presented during olfactory enrichment. In the first year, odours like curry, rosemary, and deer/mouflon and rat faeces garnered the highest interest in scented objects and scent-rolling behaviour. In the second year, llama faeces and deer/mouflon faeces elicited longer interest, while others, like guinea pig faeces and oregano, prompted less interest. During the second part of this study, it was observed that only females exhibited scent-rolling behaviour, indicating their higher level of engagement with the scents. Scent rolling did not occur in response to certain odours, suggesting the existence of selective preferences. Sheep's wool prompted the longest scent-rolling sessions. Differences in behaviour between enrichment sessions were not significant; however, mornings generally elicited greater interest in odours. Despite various theories proposing alternative explanations for scent rolling in wolves, it seems to be triggered by novel odours. Scent rolling, a behaviour observed in various large carnivores like wolves, entails the animal lowering its chin and neck towards a scent, followed by rubbing the head, neck, shoulders, and back into it. This behaviour is prevalent among wolves exposed to diverse scents, though its exact purpose remains uncertain. In this study, captive wolves at Osijek Zoo responded differently to odours during olfactory enrichment sessions. In the initial year of this study, the highest level of interest, evidenced by both the frequency of responses and scent-rolling behaviour, was noted when the wolves encountered odours such as curry and rosemary, along with deer/mouflon and rat faeces. While certain odours, such as llama faeces and deer/mouflon faeces, garnered longer durations of interest in the second year of study, others, like guinea pig faeces and oregano, elicited shorter responses. Female wolves demonstrated a higher level of engagement with scents compared with males, particularly through scent rolling behaviour, which was exclusively observed in females during the second year of this study. Interestingly, certain odours did not trigger scent rolling, suggesting selective preferences. On the other hand, sheep's wool induced the longest duration of scent rolling, and a lack of significant differences in behaviour was observed between morning and afternoon sessions. Despite the existence of multiple hypotheses put forward to explain the causation of scent rolling in wolves, it seems to be elicited by unfamiliar odours.

AB  - The white-red deer population in China is composed of 28 individuals introduced from New Zealand. However, the genetic relationships between these individuals is unknown. The aim of the present study was to determine the genetic diversity and genetic relationship in the white-red deer population. We used ten microsatellite loci to genotype all 28 white-red deer individuals in China, and constructed a Neighbor -joining (NJ) tree based on genetic distances. In addition, genetic structure analysis was carried out. The results showed that a total of 67 alleles were detected, and the average number of alleles at each locus was 6.7. There was high genetic diversity but severe inbreeding in the white-red deer population, and there is no father-mother-offspring relationship or father-offspring relationship in white-red deer population. Our study provides the essential data support and reference for the conservation and sustainable development of the domestic white-red deer population in China.

AB  - In western Canada, decades of oil-and-gas exploration have fragmented boreal landscapes with a dense network of linear forest disturbances (seismic lines). These seismic lines are implicated in the decline in wildlife populations that are adapted to function in unfragmented forest landscapes. In particular, anthropogenic disturbances have led to a decline of woodland caribou populations due to increasing predator access to core caribou habitat. Restoration of seismic lines aims to reduce the landscape fragmentation and stop the decline of caribou populations. However, planning restoration in complex landscapes can be challenging because it must account for a multitude of diverse aspects. To assist with restoration planning, we present a spatial network optimization approach that selects restoration locations in a fragmented landscape while addressing key environmental and logistical constraints. We applied the model to develop restoration scenarios in the Redrock-Prairie Creek caribou range in northwestern Alberta, Canada, which includes a combination of caribou habitat and active oil-and-gas and timber extraction areas. Our study applies network optimization at two distinct scales to address both the broad-scale restoration policy planning and project-level constraints at the level of individual forest sites. We first delineated a contiguous set of coarse-scale regions where restoration is most cost-effective and used this solution to solve a fine-scale network optimization model that addresses environmental and logistical planning constraints at the level of forest patches. Our two-tiered approach helps address the challenges of fine-scale spatial optimization of restoration activities. An additional coarse-scale optimization step finds a feasible starting solution for the finescale restoration problem, which serves to reduce the time to find an optimal solution. The added coarse-scale spatial constraints also make the fine-scale restoration solution align with the coarse-scale landscape features, which helps address the broad-scale restoration policies. The approach is generalizable and applicable to assist restoration planning in other regions fragmented by oil-and-gas activities.

AB  - Poaching for ivory has caused disturbances in the behaviour of elephants. The nature and magnitude of such disturbance are not yet fully understood. Here, we studied the daily activity cycles of 10 elephants tracked for a minimum of two years each in the Samburu ecosystem in Kenya. The elephants were tracked over a spatial or temporal gradient of poaching risk in their distribution area. Laikipia Samburu landscape is shared with humans and is a mosaic of land ownership and management practices, all of which lead to varied levels of illegal killing. Using movement data of elephants tracked on various dates between 2002 and 2016, we studied the daily activity cycle when they were in their different core areas. Using Generalized Additive Models, we found that elephants moved less around midday in high poaching areas. Despite the adaptive shift in activity times, elephants were moving for fewer hours per day in areas with higher risk, reducing total movement daily in risky areas or times. The elephants lost one hour daily from their usual movement time when they went into high-risk areas, which they did not compensate for despite increased activity at dawn and dusk. The level of illegal killing was the best explanatory variable for altering the activity cycle. We infer that such risk avoidance behaviour culminates in the potential reduction of foraging efforts in a risky area. A deficit in their activity time may have consequences for their social life, reproduction, or overall foraging success, aspects of elephant ecology that are not fully understood yet. We discuss the results in light of the increasing need for more fine-scale temporal analyses of the influence of risk on the diel activity of elephants for sites that achieve both movement data and verified records of causes of elephant deaths.

AB  - Interest in novel perennial grain crops has increased as a sustainable alternative to conventional annual grain crops due to their improved carbon (C) sequestration and water use efficiency potentials. This study quantified carbon dioxide (CO2) and water fluxes over contrasting cropping systems: a perennial crop (i.e., Secale cereale L. x S. montanum Guss cv. ACE-1 perennial rye) vs. an annual crop (i.e., S. cereale L. cv. Gazelle spring rye). The experiment was conducted over two growing seasons (May to October) using eddy covariance system measurements in two adjacent 4-ha fields in Breton, Alberta, Canada. Substantially greater uptake of atmospheric C was observed in the perennial crop compared to the annual crop, as shown by growing season net ecosystem CO2 exchange of 556 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the perennial crop vs. only 89 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the annual crops. Net ecosystems carbon balances (NECB) of -60 and 448 g C m(-2) were either C neutral or C gain in perennial crops, while NECB of -263 and -336 g C m(-2) in annual crops were C losses during the two growing seasons. Overall, the ecosystem carbon use efficiency of the perennial crop was also greater than that of the annual crops. In addition to the longer growing period of the perennial crop, which enhanced the cumulative C captured via photosynthesis, the greater CO2 sink was attributed to relatively lower ecosystem respiration, which was influenced by soil temperature sensitivity, reduced soil disturbance, and soil moisture factors. Despite the perennial crop registering higher evapotranspiration (ET) at the beginning of growing season, the overall cumulative ET and the associated ecosystems-water use efficiency were similar between the two crops. As such, the perennial crop enhanced atmospheric CO2 sink compared to annual crop, whereas the terrestrial water balance was similar between two crops.

AB  - Wild boar foraging impacts the crops, pastures, and meadows causing remarkable losses to agricultural income. Protected areas located in plains, such as the Ticino Valley Natural Park, are characterized by the coexistence of important natural habitats and intensive agricultural areas. In the Park, from 2010 to 2017, 49% of the complaints report an event of damage to maize and 43% to meadows. The total expense for reimbursements of the maize amounted to euro 439,341.52, with damages concentrated in May, after sowing period and between August and September, during the milky stage of maize. For meadows reimbursements amounted to euro 324,768.66, with damage events concentrated in February and March. To reduce damage to crops, the Park administration carried out lethal control of the wild boar population. From 2006 to 2017, the most used control method was culling from hunting hides. In our analysis, we did not find significant relationships between the number of shot boars and the damage amount. The factors that determine the decrease of damage probability to crops are mainly related to human disturbance and the characteristics of the fields. The predictive model of damage risk built comparing damaged and undamaged fields showed a good predictive ability. The population viability analyses showed that it is impossible to obtain a drastic reduction of population with the current harvest rate. By tripling it and focusing on the females and sub-adult a numerical reduction of 50% of the population would be achievable in 7 years and the probability of population survival would be halved in 3 years.

AB  - Boreal landscapes are exposed to climate change, forestry, and other industrial stressors with consequences for Indigenous people's wellbeing and relationship with traditional lands. As a collaborative and transdisciplinary research team including researchers and students from universities, Indigenous communities, and government and non-government organizations, we addressed the consequences of these environmental changes for an Eeyou (Cree) community and an Anishnaabe community in Eastern boreal Canada (Quebec). Our aims were to (1) develop a landscape value model combining qualitative and quantitative data as well as knowledge from Indigenous land-use experts and forest landscape simulations; (2) evaluate the vulnerability of Indigenous landscape values to environmental changes; and (3) assess the relative importance of climate change and forestry as drivers of environmental changes. We developed a set of 12 variables based on interviews with Indigenous experts, describing four dimensions of landscape value: abundance, quality, access, and experience. We then performed forest landscape simulations (2000-2100) with the model LANDIS-II using scenarios combining climate change and forestry gradients. We presented the simulation outputs to Indigenous experts and elicited the probability of fulfilling their needs in the future. We combined Indigenous knowledge and forest landscape simulations within a probabilistic model (Bayesian network). The projections indicate that rapid and acute changes in forest structure and composition are to be expected. The most vulnerable values are those associated with mature and undisturbed forests and include the ability to trap, hunt moose, and recover health and energy from the land (ressourcement in French, KOKi OTAPiNAN NOPiMiK iNATiSi8iN in Anishnaabemowin). Timber harvesting rate influences the timing and amplitude of change. The influence of climate change varied from one region to another and was mostly associated with wildfire frequency. Adaptation strategies may include reducing timber harvesting rates, implementing wildfire-prevention measures, and valuing alternative forest uses.

AB  - Background Human disturbance alters animal movement globally and infrastructure, such as roads, can act as physical barriers that impact behaviour across multiple spatial scales. In ungulates, roads can particularly hamper key ecological processes such as dispersal and migration, which ensure functional connectivity among populations, and may be particularly important for population performance in highly human-dominated landscapes. The impact of roads on some aspects of ungulate behaviour has already been studied. However, potential differences in response to roads during migration, dispersal and home range movements have never been evaluated. Addressing these issues is particularly important to assess the resistance of European landscapes to the range of wildlife movement processes, and to evaluate how animals adjust to anthropogenic constraints. Methods We analysed 95 GPS trajectories from 6 populations of European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) across the Alps and central Europe. We investigated how roe deer movements were affected by landscape characteristics, including roads, and we evaluated potential differences in road avoidance among resident, migratory and dispersing animals (hereafter, movement modes). First, using Net Squared Displacement and a spatio-temporal clustering algorithm, we classified individuals as residents, migrants or dispersers. We then identified the start and end dates of the migration and dispersal trajectories, and retained only the GPS locations that fell between those dates (i.e., during transience). Finally, we used the resulting trajectories to perform an integrated step selection analysis. Results We found that roe deer moved through more forested areas during the day and visited less forested areas at night. They also minimised elevation gains and losses along their movement trajectories. Road crossings were strongly avoided at all times of day, but when they occurred, they were more likely to occur during longer steps and in more forested areas. Road avoidance did not vary among movement modes and, during dispersal and migration, it remained high and consistent with that expressed during home range movements. Conclusions Roads can represent a major constraint to movement across modes and populations, potentially limiting functional connectivity at multiple ecological scales. In particular, they can affect migrating individuals that track seasonal resources, and dispersing animals searching for novel ranges.

AB  - Understanding the long-term interactions between people and the ecosystem in which they live is vital for informing present-day ecosystem management plans. The use of pollen data for palaeoecological reconstructions is often limited by the low taxonomic resolution of pollen, which often reduces the detail of reconstructions of human influence on past vegetation. This is true for Australia where Myrtaceae, particularly Eucalyptus species, dominate the landscape, but their pollen is difficult to differentiate. We present a pollen record with high taxonomic resolution of Myrtaceae pollen from the Bass Strait area of southeast Australia, focusing on the period of major human occupation there during the Late Glacial transition. These results were compared to records of hydrology, fire, sediment deposition, herbivore abundance and human occupation. We found that Indigenous burning practices promoted open, subgenus Monocalyptus Eucalyptus woodland at the expense of dense subgenus Symphomyrtus Eucalyptus forest. Previous studies have shown the need for management of the vegetation of southeast Australia guided by Indigenous people, to promote ecosystem resilience and reduce the risk of wildfires. Our results reveal that in addition to reducing wildfires, cultural burning by Indigenous people has the potential to promote the diversity of ecosystems and habitats.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Knautia arvensis (L.) Coult. (Field Scabious) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Knautia arvensis is a perennial hemicryptophyte, with a tap root system, and bluish-lilac inflorescences. It is native in Britain. It occurs predominantly on well-drained to moderately dry soils such as dry grassy fields, pastures, roadsides and dry hedge banks. It has a vast Eurasian native distribution. Reproduction occurs through the production of seeds and rhizomes, though K. arvensis possesses very limited clonal growth. It has a gynodioecious breeding system. Flowers are nectariferous and insect pollinated, showing sexual dimorphism in several traits. The hermaphroditic flowers are protandrous and self-compatible. Flowers are mainly pollinated by butterflies (Lepidoptera), Hymenoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera. Knautia is a genus noteworthy for its high occurrence of hybridisation and polyploidy. Knautia arvensis has the widest distribution within the genus, and hybridisation both within members of the same group and with taxa of other groups is frequently reported. Although declining in natural habitats within England, K. arvensis is increasingly being sown within wildflower seed mixtures used in restoration schemes across the country, as it is a late flowering species that provides a good source of nectar for pollinators.

AB  - An important mechanism promoting species coexistence is conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD), which inhibits conspecific neighbors by accumulating host-specific enemies near adult trees. Natural enemies may be genotype-specific and regulate offspring dynamics more strongly than non-offspring, which is often neglected due to the difficulty in ascertaining genetic relatedness. Here, we investigated whether offspring and non-offspring of a dominant species, Castanopsis eyrei, suffered from different strength of CNDD based on parentage assignment in a subtropical forest. We found decreased recruitment efficiency (proxy of survival probability) of offspring compared with non-offspring near adult trees during the seedling-sapling transition, suggesting genotype-dependent interactions drive tree demographic dynamics. Furthermore, the genetic similarity between individuals of same cohort decreased in late life history stages, indicating genetic-relatedness-dependent tree mortality throughout ontogeny. Our results demonstrate that within-species genetic relatedness significantly affects the strength of CNDD, implying genotype-specific natural enemies may contribute to population dynamics in natural forests.

AB  - Comminution is performed by using two main types of machines: grinders and chippers. Grinders are commonly used to treat contaminated wood biomass. In South Korea, cut-to-length harvesting is the main salvage logging method, and felled trees and residues often become dirtied during extraction, where logs are moved from the stump to the roadside using a small shovel. Therefore, grinders are preferred for the comminution of wood biomass for conversion into hog fuel. This study aimed to evaluate productivity and hog fuel quality as outcomes of wood biomass sorting. The productivities for unsorted residues and logs were 11.2 +/- 1.48 ton/PMH0 and 12.4 +/- 1.73 ton/PMH0 at a moisture content of 24%, respectively. Between 33.5% and 46.0% of the total hog fuel mass passed through the screen and reached an acceptable size (3.15 mm to 63 mm). The bulk densities of the two materials ranged from 132.4 kg/m3 to 148.8 kg/m3 on a dry basis. The results of this study suggest that sorting the feedstock has the potential to reduce the number of oversized particles in the hog fuel without screening.

AB  - This paper investigates the ecological-economic sustainability of coral reef socio-ecological systems under fishing and environmental pressures. To achieve this, a dynamic, spatially explicit, multi-species, multi-fleet fisheries model is developed. Stochastic environmental shocks are assumed to alter coral cover and consequently the entire coral reef social-ecological system. The model is calibrated using ecological, socio-economic and environmental data in French Polynesia. Four exploratory fishing strategies and a goal-seeking strategy entitled Stochastic Multi-Species Maximum Sustainable Yield (SMMSY) are compared in terms of ecological-economic outcomes and sustainability of the socio-ecological system. The SMMSY turns out to promote ecological-economic sustainability. It is characterised by a global increase in fishing effort pointing to the relative current under-exploitation of the fishery. SMMSY balances the trophic level of catches after natural shocks and sustains the fundamental herbivore grazing process. SMMSY strategies are also more diversified in terms of temporality, gears, spatial distribution of fishing and target species.

AB  - A series of species introductions, overexploitation, and habitat modification preceded the extirpation of Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi; LCT), historically the apex predator, from Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada, USA. Studies evaluating limiting factors for LCT emphasise the need to elucidate food web interactions, yet important knowledge gaps regarding trophic interactions among nonnative pelagic fishes and invertebrates remain. We quantified the abundance and consumption demand of planktivores with an emphasis on kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka) and Mysis diluviana. We synthesised this new information with existing information for lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). The seasonal supply of copepods satisfied the consumption demand of kokanee, but only supported low feeding and growth rates. Kokanee relied heavily on Mysis as prey, an unusual result. Mysis exhibited a high degree of herbivory initially followed by heavier consumption on copepods by larger individuals. Consumption demand for Mysis on copepods exceeded that of kokanee during all seasons. Mysis contributed to over 50% of the annual energy budget for lake trout up to 625 mm. Consumption of Mysis by lake trout and kokanee represented a significant source of mortality when compared to the production of Mysis. Predation on kokanee was sustainable, only involved lake trout >625 mm, and was focused on prespawning aggregations. Despite the presence of Mysis-fueled lake trout, kokanee have persisted; a noteworthy pattern when considering the negative responses of kokanee to nonnative lake trout and Mysis observed elsewhere. This pattern suggests that there may still be an effective niche for LCT in the invaded Lake Tahoe ecosystem.

AB  - Nopal (Opuntia) is a resource that is discarded after pruning complete cladodes. For this reason, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the combined use of organic matter (nopal) and goat manure on changes in soil characteristics and on the growth and yield performance of carrot and tomato plants. Physicochemical analysis of the soil and goat manure was carried out, and germination tests and physical characterization of the plants and the products obtained were performed on tomato and carrot plants after adding the components of the cladodes alone and the cladodes with goat manure. The results showed that the application of the nopal cladode components increased the cation exchange capacity of the soil. The highest germination rate was obtained by the application of liquid nopal, with a 1.7-fold increase in the germination rate of carrot seeds, while that for tomato seeds was only 14%. Similar results were obtained for the germination percentage. An increase in resistance to water stress of approximately 15 days was observed in both tomato and carrot plants. Plant development and production were achieved in tomato, with a 100% increase in carrot plant length and a threefold increase in production. The addition of nopal to the soil improved the soil characteristics and the production yield of carrots and tomatoes.

AB  - Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR) approaches using noninvasive fecal DNA (fDNA) are applied increasingly to obtain statistically robust abundance estimates for various wildlife species. But SCR has not been widely used for more gregarious species, such as elk (Cervus canadensis). Because of their heterogeneous use of the landscape and grouping behavior, elk present novel challenges to sampling efficiency and statistical assumptions. We employed fDNA SCR and a stratified random sampling approach to estimate abundance in 3 northern California tule elk (C. c. nannodes) populations concurrent with global positioning system (GPS)-telemetry monitoring of 66 elk (32 male, 34 female) in Colusa and Lake counties, California, USA, during June-August 2017-2019. We collected 1,616 fecal pellet groups from the 3 populations, resulting in 1,002 fDNA genotypes (>= 19 microsatellite loci, 1 sex marker) of 425 unique individuals. Based on SCR estimates from a model incorporating both sexes, elk density ranged from 0.31 (95% CI = 0.17-0.55) elk/km(2) to 1.7 (95% CI = 1.3-2.2) elk/km(2), translating approximately to 650 individuals (evenly split between sexes) among the 3 populations. Independent telemetry data from concurrently tracked individuals indicated that activity centers of females, but not males, were clustered on the landscape. This finding was corroborated using fDNA to infer activity centers. Comparison of SCR estimates to non-spatial estimates using physically captured individuals suggested that combined-sex SCR models were robust to spatial clustering of females in all 3 populations. Additionally, single-sex models were robust to female clustering in the 2 populations with multiple female groups, but not in Lake Pillsbury, where all females effectively shared a single activity center. In that case, the estimate of female abundance was deemed an overestimate. Thus, results indicate that SCR was robust to gregariousness in elk in all but the most extreme cases of clustering (single-sex female estimation when all individuals share a single activity center), and that the inclusion of both sexes was sufficient to offset biases stemming from aggregation of females in all cases. Altogether, our findings suggest that SCR methods can be gainfully applied to socially gregarious ungulates such as elk.

AB  - Florida is one of the largest exporters of aquarium ornamental species in the world, but trade is expanding to include harvest of herbivorous invertebrates that play important ecological roles in nature, such as grazing algae from seagrass and corals. Here, stable isotope sclerochronology is used to document life history traits of two of the most intensely harvested herbivorous gastropod species in Florida, the turbinids Lithopoma americanum and Turbo castanea. Such information is -critical to assessing whether current harvest intensities are sustainable. Populations of L. americanum and T. castanea in Florida -consist of rapidly maturing individuals that reach maximum sizes within 2 y and 1 y, respectively. Rapid maturation should allow these populations to recover rapidly from intense harvest, but short-lived species are also intrinsically susceptible to population -collapse from recruitment failure, complicating effective management of the fishery. In addition, the short lifespans of these turbinids suggest that hobbyists may purchase replacement animals frequently, increasing fisheries pressure on natural ecosystems.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the role of organic acids in the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nutrient dynamics of lemon plants by examining the effects of rhizosphere organic acids on N and P forms in the rhizosphere under different fertilization treatments. The objective was to establish a scientific basis for determining the appropriate ratio of chemical fertilizer to organic fertilizer. Four isonitrogenous fertilization treatments were applied: conventional fertilization (FM), decomposed pig manure (P), 70% chemical fertilizer + 30% decomposed pig manure (70FP), and 50% chemical fertilizer + 50% decomposed pig manure (50FP). Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to investigate how fertilizer regulates plant N and P through rhizosphere organic acids. (1) The 70FP and 50FP treatments significantly increased the soil pH, nutrient content, and oxalic acid content in the rhizosphere soil. (2) These treatments also significantly enhanced plant N and P. (3) Regarding rhizosphere N and P forms, the 70FP treatment led to a significant increase in the content of ion-exchangeable N, whereas the 50FP treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of sodium hydroxide-extractable organic P and concentrated hydrochloric acid-extractable organic P. (4) PLS-SEM analysis revealed that rhizosphere organic acids could significantly influence rhizosphere N forms by regulating pH and soil organic carbon. However, their impact on lemon plant nutrition was not significant. Organic acids significantly improved the rhizosphere N and P forms, partially enhancing the lemon plant nutrient levels under the 70FP and 50FP treatments.

AB  - Mining activities accumulate large quantities of waste in tailing ponds, which results in several environmental impacts. In Cartagena-La Union mining district (SE Spain), a field experiment was carried out in a tailing pond to evaluate the effect of aided phytostabilization on reducing the bioavailability of zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) and enhancing soil quality. Nine native plant species were planted, and pig manure and slurry along with marble waste were used as amendments. After 3 years, the vegetation developed heterogeneously on the pond surface. In order to evaluate the factors affecting this inequality, four areas with different VC and an area without treatment (control area) were sampled. Soil physicochemical properties, total, bioavailable and soluble metals, and metal sequential extraction were determined. Results revealed that pH, organic carbon, calcium carbonate equivalent and total nitrogen increased after the aided phytostabilization, while electrical conductivity, total sulfur and bioavailable metals significantly decreased. In addition, results indicated that differences in VC among sampled areas were mainly owing to differences in pH, EC and concentration of soluble metals, which in turn were modified by the effect of non-restored areas on close restored areas after heavy rains due to a lower elevation of the restored areas compared to the unrestored ones. Therefore, to achieve the most favorable and sustainable long-term results of aided phytostabilization, along with plant species and amendments, micro-topography should be also taken into consideration, which causes different soil characteristics and thus different plant growth and survival.

AB  - Ticks and tick-borne diseases are of increasing concern across the United States, particularly in the Northeast. Ixodes scapularis Say (Ixodida: Ixodidae) remains the primary vector for the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi (Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt, and Brenner). Prior studies established that I. scapularis can be found in greatest abundance in the 1-m forested ecotone surrounding the lawn edge in residential backyards. Our study was conducted on 42 properties in Guilford, CT, and sought to expand upon this premise by determining which key habitat features were associated with increased densities of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs. We quantified nymphal abundances in 19 different habitat types that were posited to influence densities. We determined that nymphal I. scapularis densities were greatest in forested areas closest to lawn edges with leaf litter or understory vegetation present, as well as short lawns adjacent to woodland edges. Additionally, we determined that there were no significant declines in nymphal I. scapularis density where leaf litter was removed, lawns were left unmowed, or woodchip barriers were installed. Bird feeders and woodpiles were not associated with increased nymphal I. scapularis densities. However, areas adjacent to stone walls did have nearly 3 times the density of I. scapularis nymphs present compared with habitats without stone walls. The culmination of the results from this study can be utilized to create more targeted acaricide applications rather than broadcast spraying, as well as increase homeowner awareness for areas with heightened risk for exposure to nymphal I. scapularis, which are deemed the most epidemiologically important species and stage for pathogen transfer to humans.

AB  - Remote seawater has been considered a potential refuge for corals in the face of anthropogenic disturbances. However, these remote areas may receive increased atmospheric N deposition, and the ecological consequences remain unclear. This field survey revealed coral-algal phase shifts in the mid-north of the South China Sea. These shifts were observed in 44%, 13.6%, and 26.5% of the sampled reef sites at depths of 1-4 m, 5-8 m, and 10-15 m, respectively. Over 50% of sections in the deeper depths hosted fewer corals compared to shallower areas, coinciding with a higher abundance of macroalgae in the deeper layers. Furthermore, based on long-term observation of atmospheric N flux, laboratory experiments were conducted to explore the cause of coral declines. The results indicate that N supply efficiently promoted macroalgae growth. The saturation of N absorption by macroalgae occurred within 2 weeks, leading to nutrient accumulation in seawater, especially nitrate, which had a direct impact on corals. While moderate N fluxes appeared to mitigate coral bleaching, high N fluxes, even with a balanced P supply or medium level of nutrients with an imbalanced N/P ratio, can both increase the susceptibility of corals to heat bleaching. This study explains the coral-algal phase shift in remote and relatively deep seawater and improves understanding of the cause-and-effect relationship between atmospheric N deposition and coral reef decline.

AB  - Livestock have been and continue to be an important part of the agricultural landscape in North America. Research on how to mitigate livestock predation by North American carnivores developed quickly during the 20th century. We collected information on 75 field-based experiments published since 1970 that evaluated strategies to mitigate livestock predation by wolves and coyotes. Collected research came from journal articles and grey literature, and we identified 22 mitigation strategies. We developed a 'robustness index' to compare each experiment based on its empirical design, temporal/spatial coverage, and sample size. We found the robustness index values increased over time, particularly for lethal mitigation strategies. Overall robustness of research on lethal mitigation strategies was similar to the robustness of research on non-lethal mitigation strategies. Some strategies were not well evaluated as 12 of the 22 mitigation strategies were evaluated only once or twice; some common lethal mitigation strategies (e.g., shooting) were not formally evaluated until the 1990s. We identified some robust assessments of mitigation strategies that reported positive effects (e.g., predator sterilization, protection llamas). In some cases, these were the only evaluation or the only robust evaluation of a strategy. In the few cases where there were multiple robust assessments for a single strategy, the outcomes were inconsistent. No strategies evaluated more than once had consistently high robustness index values and positive outcomes. Importantly, older practices based on less robust research should be re-evaluated or discarded.

AB  - This study uses the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) to simulate the hydrodynamic processes during typhoon "Saola". The simulation results closely match observed data. Typhoon "Saola" was a major system in the Pacific typhoon season, highlighting the complexity and uncertainty of tropical cyclone dynamics. By analyzing historical sea surface temperature data and the typhoon's trajectory, the three-dimensional response of sea temperature during typhoon "Saola" was explored. The key findings are as follows: 1. Typhoon passage affects both coastal and deep-sea warming and cooling. Temperature changes are more pronounced near the coast, with the highest warming and cooling occurring within five days after the typhoon. In deep-sea areas, the highest warming occurs within five days, while the lowest cooling occurs within two days. 2. The nearshore water layers respond quickly to the typhoon, while the deep-sea water layers primarily respond in the middle depths, with a delayed effect. 3. In coastal shallow waters, the response is intense, with the maximum temperature increase and decrease occurring near the bottom, reaching 5.26 degrees C and -5.17 degrees C, respectively. In deep-sea areas, the response is weaker, with the maximum temperature change occurring near the surface: an increase of 0.49 degrees C and a decrease of -0.98 degrees C. The deepest response in coastal waters reaches about 80 m, while in the deep-sea area, it only reaches 50 m due to the thicker mixed layer.

AB  - A 10-year monitoring program was developed to quantify the population dynamics of the long-snouted seahorse population in the Mar Menor coastal lagoon. Based on 985 underwater visual censuses, we estimated the long-snouted seahorse (Hippocampus guttulatus Cuvier, 1829) population size in the Mar Menor lagoon and its reduction in size in the last decades, as well as the effect of eutrophication crises in 2016 and 2019 on the species. The annual recruitment for the 2013-2020 period was estimated by comparing the relative abundance of early seahorse life stages in the ichthyoplankton. The density ranged from 0.0458 specimens/m(3) at the beginning of the sampling period to 0.0004 at the end, showing a statistically significant difference between the three analyzed periods (H-gl=2 = 14.0, p = 0.001). The long-snouted seahorse population from the Mar Menor lagoon exemplifies the impact of fishing activities and human pressure, especially euxinic episodes and habitat destruction. As a result of this, the Mar Menor population has decreased from several million specimens to a few thousand, in only three decades. This species showed considerable resilience, the seahorse population began to recover once fishing activity stopped. In contrast, the long-snouted seahorse showed high vulnerability to habitat loss and an episodic flooding event. Adult seahorses showed preferences for highly complex habitats, especially Caulerpa prolifera-Cymodocea nodosa mixed meadows and habitats of high complexity and anthropogenic origin, such as harbors, jetties, or breakwaters. In contrast, juvenile seahorses preferred monotonous seabeds with low complexity, such as the sandy beds that are characteristic of the Mar Menor lagoon littoral.

AB  - Roads are an important driver of economic development. However, roads also produce negative impacts on humans and wildlife as noise contamination, pollution, habitat loss and fragmentation and mortality due to collisions. It has been observed that roadkill threatens populations of mammals, thus the importance for mitigating actions. Here, we documented roadkill of medium-sized mammals on a 114 km of highway located in southern Mexico. A total of 41 roadkill events were recorded of which the northern anteater Tamandua mexicana, the Mexican porcupine Coendou mexicanus, and the common hog-nosed skunk Conepatus leuconotus showed the highest frequency. The northern anteater is regionally considered at risk, and the other two species as threatened. It was estimated that approximately 36.2 medium-sized mammals are road killed annually, with the northern anteater ranking highest with a third of the total. Most of the collisions occurred at sites with less than 20 % tree cover and less than 350 m from water bodies; half occurred less than 500 m from the nearest highway curve. At the local scale, distance to water bodies and closeness to human settlements were significantly related to road collisions. At the landscape scale, the presence of water bodies was related to roadkill. This highway is acting as a sink for medium-sized mammal populations, particularly for the northern anteater. We propose to establish preventive actions such as reducing speed limits, putting speed bumps, driving fences, ropes, signs in strategic places, and police surveillance. We also propose a program to convince local inhabitants and drivers using this road of the importance of preventing roadkill of wildlife.

AB  - For species of conservation concern and human-wildlife conflict, it is imperative that spatial population data be available to design adaptive-management strategies and be prepared to meet challenges such as land use and climate change, disease outbreaks, and invasive species spread. This can be difficult, perhaps impossible, if spatially explicit wildlife data are not available. Low-resolution areal counts, however, are common in wildlife monitoring, that is, the number of animals reported for a region, usually corresponding to administrative subdivisions, for example, region, province, county, departments, or cantons. Bayesian areal disaggregation regression is a solution to exploit areal counts and provide conservation biologists with high-resolution species distribution predictive models. This method originated in epidemiology but lacks experimentation in ecology. It provides a plethora of applications to change the way we collect and analyze data for wildlife populations. Based on high-resolution environmental rasters, the disaggregation method disaggregates the number of individuals observed in a region and distributes them at the pixel level (e.g., 5 x 5 km or finer resolution), thereby converting low-resolution data into a high-resolution distribution and indices of relative density. In our demonstrative study, we disaggregated areal count data from hunting bag returns to disentangle the changing distribution and population dynamics of three deer species (red, sika, and fallow) in Ireland from 2000 to 2018. We show an application of the Bayesian areal disaggregation regression method and document marked increases in relative population density and extensive range expansion for each of the three deer species across Ireland. We challenged our disaggregated model predictions by correlating them with independent deer surveys carried out in field sites and alternative deer distribution models built using presence-only and presence-absence data. Finding a high correlation with both independent data sets, we highlighted the ability of Bayesian areal disaggregation regression to accurately capture fine-scale spatial patterns of animal distribution. This study uncovers new scenarios for wildlife managers and conservation biologists to reliably use regional count data disregarded so far in species distribution modeling. Thus, it represents a step forward in our ability to monitor wildlife population and meet challenges in our changing world.

AB  - The gut microbiome can be shaped by both intrinsic host factors and extrinsic environmental factors. However, the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in gut microbial composition has rarely been investigated, particularly for a single host across its natural range. Here, we characterise the gut microbiome of an endemic, endangered antelope, the blackbuck or Antilope cervicapra. We evaluated the influence of seven predictor variables, which were classified into intrinsic and extrinsic factors, on the gut microbiome. The intrinsic factors are nucleotide diversity (mitochondrial and nuclear) and blackbuck population density, whereas extrinsic factors are temperature, precipitation, distance to human settlement and anthropogenic land-use. We determined which of these seven variables explains greater variation in the microbiome within (alpha-diversity) and between (beta-diversity) the blackbuck hosts. We analysed the microbiome of n = 60 blackbuck hosts from ten different populations across India. We recorded 11 800 unique OTUs across 30 known phyla and 2.9 million reads. We find an average of 2056 OTUs per individual, with Bacillota and Bacteroidota being the most dominant phyla. Overall, we also show that the genetic diversity (intrinsic) of the host is more important than their environment (extrinsic) for both within- and between-host variation in the microbiome of blackbuck. Our results suggest that an increase in genetic relatedness between blackbuck hosts can lead to a decrease in the variation of their gut microbial composition. Therefore, conservation efforts should be directed to not only preserve natural habitats but also increase the genetic pool of the blackbuck populations, which will positively impact their survival through diverse gut microbiomes.

AB  - Simple Summary Predicting suitable areas and paths for African swine fever (ASF) outbreaks is crucial for early detection and removal of ASF virus (ASFV)-infected carcasses in ASF-prevalent regions, as well as for the establishment of preemptive quarantine measures in ASF-free regions. In this study, we utilized the MaxEnt model and shortest-path betweenness centrality to predict areas with a high likelihood of ASF outbreaks in wild boars while also identifying individual pig farms and pig farm sectors at high risk of ASFV spillover from wild boars. The results of this study are intended to help to save time and cost in searching for carcasses by specifying the search range for ASFV-infected wild boar carcasses. Additionally, the study's findings could help pig farms at high risk of ASFV spillover establish preemptive quarantine measures such as reinforcing biosecurity inside the farms and routinely searching for carcasses around the farms. African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious disease affecting domestic pigs and wild boars, with no effective vaccine or treatment available. In South Korea, extensive measures have been implemented to prevent ASF transmission between wild boars and ASF spillover from wild boars to pig farm sectors, including the search for ASF-infected carcasses in mountainous forests and the installation of fences across wide areas of these forests. To determine the priority search range for infected carcasses and establish pig farm-centered quarantine measures, it is necessary to predict the specific path of ASF outbreaks in wild boars and identify pig farms at high risk of ASF spillover from wild boars. Here, we aimed to predict suitable areas and geographical paths for ASF outbreaks in wild boars using the MaxEnt model and shortest-path betweenness centrality analysis. The analysis identified a high frequency of ASF outbreaks in areas with a suitability value & GE;0.4 on the suitability map and in areas within a 1.8 km range from the path on the shortest-path map, indicating these areas were high-risk zones for ASF outbreaks. Among the 5063 pig farms analyzed, 37 were in the high-risk zone on the suitability map, 499 were in the high-risk zone on the shortest-path map, and 9 were in both risk zones. Of the 51 pig farm sectors with a dense distribution of pig farms (kernel density & GE; 8), 25 sectors were in contact with or partially overlapped the high risk zone on the suitability map, 18 sectors were located within the high risk zone on the shortest-path map, and 14 sectors were located within both risk zones. These findings aided in determining the priority range for searches for wild boar carcasses and enabled the establishment of preemptive ASF prevention measures around the pig farming sectors that are at risk of ASF spillover from wild boars.

AB  - The recolonization of human-dominated landscapes by large carnivores has been followed with considerable scientific interest; however, little is known about their interactive effect on ungulate foraging behavior. This study compared the risks imposed by humans and lynx on ungulate foraging behavior by examining the effects of browsing intensity (at two spatial scales), diet quality, and tree species selection. We hypothesized that: (1) in areas with high risk imposed by humans and lynx browsing intensity would be reduced; (2) risk effects would interact with habitat visibility at a fine scale, resulting in contrasting browsing patterns in response to humans versus lynx risk; (3) ungulates compensate for the higher costs incurred in high-risk areas by switching to a higher diet quality, and (4) browse a higher proportion of more-preferred tree species. These hypotheses were tested by measuring browsing intensity along 48 transects located at different distances from human settlements within the hunted and nonhunted areas of the Bavarian Forest. Dung samples were collected and analyzed as a proxy of diet quality (C:N ratio, fiber). The spatial patterns of browsing intensity, diet quality, and tree species selection were then linked to lynx risk, hunting intensity, recreation intensity, and distance to human settlements. Our results showed that (1) browsing intensity strongly decreased with increasing recreational activities, whereas it increased with lynx risk; (2) only in close proximity to human settlements tree browsing was higher in dense habitats and (3) a higher diet quality was obtained. (4) We found a stronger avoidance of the less preferred tree species in high-hunting intensity areas. In conclusion, our results indicate that the risk effects of human activities outweigh those of a natural large carnivore. Thus, highlighting the importance of taking those activities into account in predicting the impacts of large carnivores on ungulates and their plant-food choices.

AB  - The geographical and climatic characteristics of Turkiye facilitate the growth of many wild edible fruit species in the country. An important fruit species contributing to this richness is sea buckthorn. Seed-propagated sea buckthorn plants exhibit a rich morphological diversity in the country. In this study, we investigated the morphological diversity of 96 selected wild-grown sea buckthorn genotypes from Erzurum province in eastern Turkiye. Their morphological characteristics were described using 22 criteria according to the International Union for the Conservation of New Plant Varieties (UPOV) "Sea buckthorn descriptor" norms. The results showed a great morphological diversity among the 96 seed-propagated wild-grown sea buckthorn genotypes. In terms of habitus, 28 genotypes were upright, 53 genotypes were semi-upright, and 15 genotypes grew horizontally. The growth pattern of the genotypes was different. We found that 32 genotypes were tree-shaped and 64 genotypes were bush-shaped. Regarding shoot density, 27 genotypes were observed rarely, 49 genotypes were moderate, and 20 genotypes were intense. Our findings provide important information for conducting further research on the preservation of genetic resources and breeding of wild edible sea buckthorn genotypes.

AB  - Grassland carrying capacity is an indicator for measuring the stability of grassland ecosystems and can provide a basis for formulating regional sustainable grazing strategies. However, most previous studies on this have only considered annual fluctuations, but seasonal changes were ignored. In this study, the herbage yield and nutrient value of two grassland types in Yellow River Source Park (YRSP) were measured by sampling point survey method in four seasons, and the seasonal and annual grassland carrying capacity, carrying numbers of standard sheep unit (SU) were estimated based on the dry matter (DM) content, crude protein, and metabolic energy of herbage. Due to the carrying capacity being low during the yellow and wintering periods, we combined them and calculated the carrying capacity for only three periods, including the flourishing period, greening period, and withering period. The grassland pressure index (GPI) was measured by the ratio of the actual standard sheep number and the calculated number. The results showed that the herbage yield and nutrient output were higher in spring and summer, lower in autumn and winter, and showed a tendency for alpine meadows to be higher than alpine grasslands during the flourishing period (p < 0.05). The unit area carrying capacity varied significantly with the season and showed the seasonal changing characteristics of the flourishing period > greening period > withering period. The seasonal carrying number was much higher than the actual carrying number during the flourishing period and much lower than the actual carrying number during the withering period. In terms of annual carrying capacity, the GPI was balanced when considering livestock alone, while critical overloaded when considering livestock and wildlife. This study suggested the influence of seasonal change on the grassland carrying capacity should be fully considered in the grassland utilization. Meanwhile, the feeding needs of livestock and wildlife should be taken into account, and timely supplemented when forage is in short supply.

AB  - Neophobia (the fearful reaction to novel stimuli or situations) has a crucial effect on individual fitness and can vary within and across species. However, the factors predicting this variation are still unclear. In this study, we assessed whether individual characteristics (rank, social integration, sex) and species socio-ecological characteristics (dietary breadth, group size, domestication) predicted variation in neophobia. For this purpose, we conducted behavioral observations and experimental tests on 78 captive individuals belonging to 10 different ungulate species-an ideal taxon to study inter-specific variation in neophobia given their variety in socio-ecological characteristics. Individuals were tested in their social groups by providing them with familiar food, half of which had been positioned close to a novel object. We monitored the individual latency to approach and eat food and the proportion of time spent in its proximity. Using a phylogenetic approach and social network analyses, we showed that across ungulate species neophobia was higher in socially more integrated individuals, as compared to less integrated ones. In contrast, rank and sex did not predict inter-individual differences in neophobia. Moreover, species differed in their levels of neophobia, with Barbary sheep being on average less neophobic than all the other study species. As group size in Barbary sheep was larger than in all the other study species, these results support the hypothesis that larger group size predicts lower levels of neophobia, and confirm ungulates as a highly promising taxon to study animal behavior and cognition with a comparative perspective. Significance statement In several species, individuals may respond fearfully to novel stimuli, therefore reducing the risks they may face. However, it is yet unclear if certain individuals or species respond more fearfully to novelty. Here, we provided food to 78 individual ungulates with different characteristics (e.g., sex, rank, social integration, group size, domestication, dietary breadth) in different controlled conditions (e.g., when food was close to novel or to familiar objects). Across species, we found that socially integrated individuals responded more fearfully in all species. Moreover, being in larger groups decreased the probability of fearfully responding to novelty.

AB  - Drought and salt are key abiotic stressors in temperate cities. Biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions, often dominated by trees, influence the urban troposphere and mediate plant-plant and plant-insect interactions. While knowledge on constitutive BVOC emissions is increasing, modulation of blends by stress has yet received little attention. We thus investigated BVOC blends and herbivore-related subsets ('bouquets') of Quercus robur, Fagus sylvatica, Betula pendula and Carpinus betulus seedlings under control, and after 2-weeks of drought and salt stress using PTR-Tof-MS. 22 BVOCs were related to metabolic pathways, and changes among blends and bouquets were assessed. Drought led to a slight increase of isoprene and monoterpene emissions from Q. robur and F. sylvatica, respectively, while total non-isoprene emissions generally declined under water stress. Both drought and salinity led to distinct, species-specific changes in the emission rates of single BVOCs, and resulted in markedly different herbivore-related bouquets in F. sylvatica and C. betulus. Oxygenated VOCs and green leaf volatiles in particular increased in these two salt-sensitive species, while pathway-specific effects were less clear under drought. Findings indicate significant consequences of common urban stressors on BVOC emission spectra, including tropospheric ozone formation and severely hampered plant communication cues under stress.

AB  - Animals are faced with a variety of dangers or threats, which are increasing in frequency with ongoing environmental change. While our understanding of fearfulness of such dangers is growing in the context of predation and parasitism risk, the extent to which non-trophic, interspecific dangers elicit fear in animals remains less appreciated. We provide an experimental test for fear responses of savannah ungulates to a dominant and aggressive megaherbivore, the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), and contrast responses to an apex predator known to elicit fear in this system. Using an automated behavioural response system, we contrast vigilance and run responses of ungulates to elephant, leopard (Panthera pardus), and control (red-chested cuckoo Cuculus solitarius) vocalizations. Overall, we find that ungulates responded to elephant calls, both in terms of an increase in run and vigilance responses relative to controls. The magnitude of most behavioural responses ( four of six considered) to elephant vocalizations were not significantly different than responses to leopards. These results suggest that megaherbivores can elicit strong non-trophic fear responses by ungulates and call to broaden frameworks on fear to consider dominant species, such as megaherbivores, as key modifiers of fear-induced interactions.

AB  - In the past, humans have adapted their strategies of wood collection to shifts in the surrounding environment. Shifts in wood procurement strategies have been assumed to have been heavily influenced by changes in biomes due to shifts in climate. In these models, wood found on archaeological sites is interpreted as being representative of the surrounding environment. Around the world there is an increasing recognition that human preferences and management strategies impacted forest composition and species harvesting. We evaluated charcoal data gathered from 92 archaeological sites in northern China, with chronologies spanning the period from 6500 BP to 2000 BP. By combining the results of the analysis with published paleoenvironment records and archaeological evidence, we aimed to determine when and how there was an anthropogenic impact on wood procurement strategies. Our results indicated that a distinct spatiotemporal pattern of wood utilisation existed in northern China during the period 6500-2000 BP that could not be fully explained by changes in climate. Spatially, anthropogenically-collected woody assemblages showed remarkable differences in northern China. Northern China's climate gradually became colder and drier during the mid to late Holocene, especially during the period 4000-2000 BP. This appears to have led to a decreased use of Quercus L. in the Loess Plateau and the Guanzhong Basin. However, in the Central Plains and Shandong Peninsula, Quercus L. usage continued and increased in the late Holocene. During the same period, a striking shift in wood procurement occurred in the western part of China. In the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, wood procurement shifted from predominantly coniferous to broadleaved trees, and forest succession caused by anthropogenic collection played the significant role. Paleoclimatic information in Hexi Corridor suggests that some arbour trees in archaeological sites were not locally available, suggesting that human preference for certain wood types led them to engage in long distance transport. This finding indicates that starting after 4000 BP, climatically driven shifts in biomes were no longer a primarily influencing variable in human procurement of trees in north-western and eastern China. Key regional differences in strategy emerged. In Eastern China, wood species which humans preferred were still harvested even when climatic change reduced their availability. In North-western China, however, changes in biomes following 4000 BP meant that people needed to change the species on which they had previously relied and began to engage in long distance transport of wood.

AB  - Environmental regulations restricting the use of a natural resource or species often have unintended consequences. One example is prohibitions on the international trade in culturally important endangered wildlife. Trade restrictions may artificially increase scarcity and, consequently, value. In China, international trade restrictions may trigger bouts of speculative investment that have the opposite effect of the restrictions' intent. We examined how China's speculative economy and cultural history have together led to unintended consequences when regulating wildlife trade. In China, wildlife markets occupy a legal gray area that can make regulations ineffectual or even counterproductive. In extreme cases, prohibiting trade can provoke market booms. Further unintended consequences include potential cultural backlash. In China and across the Global South, international trade restrictions are sometimes considered a continuation of a longstanding history of Western intervention and thus may not be enforced as strongly or may generate resentment. This pushback has contributed to rising calls to decolonialize conservation and may lead to growing alliances between China and other Global South countries when negotiating international wildlife trade restrictions in the future.

AB  - Conspecifics may vary in their space use and diet leading to niche partitioning within populations. In social species, such partitioning may correspond to social structure as closely associated individuals likely encounter the same resources. This study investigated whether space use and diet varied among social clusters of a resident estuarine population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. Dolphin photo-identification and behavioral data, as well as tissue samples for stable isotope analysis, were collected during boat-based surveys in the Peel-Harvey Estuary, Western Australia. Potential dolphin prey species were also collected for stable isotope analyses. Six mixing models, one assuming an invariant diet and others allowing for variation in diet according to sex, age class, and/or social cluster, were fitted to the data. The model with social cluster was the best fit and estimated detritivorous fish as the main dietary source for social clusters whose core activity space covered the eastern shores of the estuary and the rivers. These clusters occupied the lowest trophic position in the dolphin population. Benthic omnivores and carnivores contributed most to the diet of clusters whose core activity space included the two estuary entrances. These clusters occupied the highest trophic position. Clusters with core activity space located in the estuary basins reflected the overall mean contributions of fish feeding guilds to dolphin diet in this population. Detritivores, omnivores and herbivores, and benthic omnivores and carnivores each contributed approximately a third and water column species the remainder to the annual fish biomass removed from the estuary by the dolphin population. We conclude that dolphins share resources with fishers and piscivorous birds within the estuary.
   Significance statement
   This study identified intra-population resource partitioning according to social structure in a resident estuarine dolphin population. The heterogeneity in space use and diet among social clusters may result in individuals being susceptible to different pressures and threats. The dolphins' foraging behavior and trophic interactions identified them as an apex predator in the Peel-Harvey Estuary, with their collective minimum annual food intake (similar to 200,000 kg) exceeding the annual fish biomass removed by commercial fishers. As top predators in the system, dolphins may suppress prey populations through consumption and as agents of intimidation by changing prey distribution and behavior. This study provides scientific basis for recognizing dolphins as an important component of the Peel-Harvey Estuary ecosystem.

AB  - Baitfishes may aggregate around megafauna such as whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) to gain protection from larger predatory fishes. Here, we used videos from deployments of animal-borne cameras on whale sharks and provided by tourism operators at Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia to document large schools of trevally (Carangidae spp.) consuming entire schools of baitfishes (Carangidae spp.) swimming with whale sharks within 2-45 s. These videos showed that small baitfishes are still very vulnerable to predatory fishes when accompanying whale sharks, refuting the hypothesis that whale sharks provide baitfishes shelter from predators. It thus seems more likely that the association between whale sharks and baitfishes may confer other advantages such as reduced costs of locomotion and/or enhanced feeding opportunities for baitfishes rather than protection from predation.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilizers boost agricultural yields, but N lost from agricultural systems may endanger the ecosystem. The agronomic practices leading to high N recovery with decreased losses without compromising yields need to be identified. Field experiments were conducted for two consecutive wheat growing seasons using three levels of N fertilizers as urea: recommended dose N (134 kg N ha- 1), 25% less than recommended and 25% more than recommended, a control (no N fertilizer), two alternative N sources (calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) and animal (cattle & buffalo) manure applied with the equivalent of N applied as urea. All N treatments were applied under conventional tillage (0-15 cm) along with the recommended dose of urea under deep tillage (15-30 cm). Higher N fertilizer rates increased grain yield (49% higher than the control), and decreased soil microbial biomass carbon and leucine aminopeptidase activity compared with the control indicated better N utilization efficiency. Nitrate leaching occurred with CAN & urea applications as well as in the deep tillage. Deep tillage improved wheat N recovery and reduced atmospheric reactive N losses. This study indicated that raising N fertilizer rates to improve production may harm soil health and the ecosystem. By boosting N recovery, deep tillage may reduce atmospheric N losses. CAN use lowered wheat production because of low N utilization efficiency, but animal manure enhanced it.

AB  - Lepidoptera biodiversity on Isla Socorro. a small volcanic island in the Islas Revillagigedo Archipelago located off the west coast of Mexico, is poorly known. The native flora of this island was severely degraded for more than 140 years of overgrazing by introduced feral sheep. Sheep were successfully eradicated in 2012, and the habitat is now beginning to recover. The few published records of the butterfly fauna (eight species), however, were obtained more than 30 years ago, well before sheep removal. Here we provide results of a recent survey of the Lepidoptera based on collecting and observation of adult butterflies during November, 2019. We confirmed that five of the eight previously recorded species are still present, and in addition show that Pyrisitia lisa centralis (Pieridae) has now become established. We also analyzed DNA barcodes from the endemic hairstreak Strytnon istapa socorroica (Lycaenidae) that support maintaining its subspecies status. Whether the three previously recorded species not seen by us have been extirpated will require more exhaustive sampling.

AB  - Biogas slurry (BGS) has potential as an organic nutrient source, and understanding its effect on carbon (C) exchange in soils is important for clarifying the contribution of organic amendments to soil fertility and the C budget globally. This study evaluated the effect of BGS, cattle manure (CM), and chemical fertilizer (CF) on carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes, microbial biomass C, and beta-glucosidase activity during the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 maize (Zea mays L.) seasons, covering December-May, in South Africa. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with the treatments as (a) BGS, (b) CM, and (c) CF, applied at 40, 80, and 120 kg nitrogen (N) ha(-1). In both seasons, BGS and CM had higher CO2 fluxes than CF. Relative to CM, BGS resulted in higher CO2 flux earlier in the season and lower flux later in the season. The highest CO2 flux was in February but decreased as the season progressed. When expressed as a percentage of organic C present, CO2 fluxes increased with N rate for CM, decreased for BGS, and changed minimally for CF. At maize harvest, the microbial biomass C and beta-glucosidase activity were higher in CM than BGS at all N levels tested. These findings imply that relative to CF, applications of BGS and CM increase CO2 fluxes, soil organic C, microbial biomass C, and beta-glucosidase activity, and the two organic resources also differ in their contributions to CO2 fluxes, soil organic C, microbial biomass C, and beta-glucosidase activity depending on the part of the season, at least in the short term.

AB  - Six vertebrae (one cervical, three articulated thoracic, and two lumbar) and an incomplete thoracic neural spine from a new late Pleistocene site at Anolaima, Cundinamarca, Colombia, are attributed to the extinct gomphothere (Elephantoidea, Proboscidea) Notiomastodon platensis. The preserved bones exhibit a range of alterations, including porosities, piercings, hollows, and deep bone lesions on the spinous process and the neural arch; asymmetrical zygapophyseal articulations; and osteoarthritic lesions. Diet, behaviour, ecological aspects, selective pressures, and disease have the potential to affect the bones, so the study of individual variations and palaeopathology provides important information for understanding aspects of the life of extinct organisms. Osteological anomalies in the Anolaima gomphothere are interpreted as the result of nutritional deficiencies in essential minerals caused by environmental stresses, possibly related to the palaeoenvironmental instability that characterized the late Pleistocene and that coincides with the age of the fossils. Excessive biomechanical loading on already weakened bones from locomotion through the uneven, upland terrain of the Anolaima region may have contributed to the pathologies. This palaeopathological analysis is the first for Colombian megafauna, and thereby broadens our knowledge of the health conditions of South American gomphotheres.

AB  - In this study, a grid-based network environ analysis (FEM-NEA) framework was developed to identify the ecological risks of the internal components within a landscape scale mining ecosystem with multiple land types. In this framework, an information-based network analysis is applied for addressing ecological risk assessments (ERA) based on control allocation (CA) and energy flow matrix, which can quantificationally reflect the relationship between soil ecosystems and ecological communities. In order to improve the computational accuracy and efficiency, the FEM and information-based network analysis are combined to further quantify the flow risk among different components within each grid as well as the whole ecosystem. Compared with the existing NEAERA model, various risk factors and receptors are compatible with the proposed FEM-NEA framework and both direct and indirect effects can be taken into consideration altogether. By taking an abandoned mining area of the Yanshan mountain as an example, risk propagation between all component of the ecosystem concerning both direct risk and integral risk dynamic were quantified. The results showed that contaminated soil normally poses risks to surrounding ecological environment, thereby affecting local vegetation and microorganisms. Afterward, the risks are passed throughout the ecosystem, forming threats to herbivores and predators via the food chain. Here, the probability of risk is ranked as follows: village> farmland> bare land> woodland. Moreover, the influence of input energy and data attributes on the prediction results are also discussed. When the input energy rises by 50%, the control allocation (CA) from herbivores to soil microorganisms correspondingly increases by 1.00% but the value from herbivores to carnivores decreases by 0.71%. This highlights the robustness of the proposed ecological risk assessment framework (FEM-NEA). In general, the FEM-NEA results not only presents the macro-scale risk distribution caused by the interaction of each component, but also reflects the potential migration direction of the risk center. Findings can provide a new perspective and method for assessing ecological risks and also help support remediation techniques for contaminated areas with different land types.

AB  - Determining the extinction risk of poorly known species is difficult, as data on both their biological traits and the threats to which they are exposed are often not available. Neotropical freshwater stingrays (potamotrygonins) represent such a challenge, as limited ecological data prevent formal assessments. Geographic range size (GRS) was computed for the first time for potamotrygonins (as a longitudinal extent of occurrence measured in km of river length) and, together with two other traits correlated with intrinsic susceptibility to extinction-body size, biological productivity (r(max))-was used to rank potamotrygonins according to their intrinsic susceptibility to extinction. Potamotrygonin GRS was only 6%-7% of that of marine elasmobranchs and is likely to be a significant driver of potamotrygonin extinction risk. The relationship between potamotrygonin GRS and body size differed from the expected triangular theoretical pattern; probably a result of the fragmented nature of freshwater habitats. Using K-medoids clustering, we identified seven groups of species; the most susceptible groups comprised the biggest species such as Potamotrygon brachyura and Paratrygon spp. Intrinsic susceptibility was also highest in the largest hydrographic basins, likely as a result of species with low r(max) being more common there. Exposure to anthropogenic threats is highest for the species most intrinsically susceptible to extinction, which consequently have a high-extinction risk. We recommend the use of longitudinal extents of occurrence as standardized measurements of freshwater taxa GRS. Our ranking method, combining observed and predicted traits, may be a useful tool to assess poorly known taxa to assist conservation prioritization.

AB  - Though far less obvious than direct effects (clinical disease or mortality), the indirect influences of pathogens are difficult to estimate but may hold fitness consequences. Here, we disentangle the directional relationships between infection and energetic reserves, evaluating the hypotheses that energetic reserves influence infection status of the host and that infection elicits costs to energetic reserves. Using repeated measures of fat reserves and infection status in individual bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, we documented that fat influenced ability to clear pathogens (Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae) and infection with respiratory pathogens was costly to fat reserves. Costs of infection approached, and in some instances exceeded, costs of rearing offspring to independence in terms of reductions to fat reserves. Fat influenced probability of clearing pathogens, pregnancy and over-winter survival; from an energetic perspective, an animal could survive for up to 23 days on the amount of fat that was lost to high levels of infection. Cost of pathogens may amplify trade-offs between reproduction and survival. In the absence of an active outbreak, the influence of resident pathogens often is overlooked. Nevertheless, the energetic burden of pathogens likely has consequences for fitness and population dynamics, especially when food resources are insufficient.

AB  - Our study explored the utility of using Importance-Satisfaction Analysis (ISA) to identify critical attributes to deer management cooperative (DMC) member satisfaction. With white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginanus) management by landowners becoming an increasingly popular conservation tool, DMCs represent an approach by private landowners and hunters to collaboratively improve deer herds and hunting quality. Deer management cooperatives are a group of landowners and hunters voluntarily working together to improve the quality of wildlife, habitat, and hunting experiences on their collective acreage. Deer management cooperatives show promise in providing dual benefits to hunter satisfaction and large-scale conservation efforts such as increasing habitat connectivity. Heterogeneity of satisfaction for deer hunting is well-documented and DMC member satisfaction is an important factor in member retention and recruitment. We surveyed 2,817 members of 45 DMCs across five states (Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New York, and Texas) using ISA methodology to better understand their satisfaction with their experience. Hunters' responses (n = 459) to the 22 attributes measured were segmented by their divergent motivations for DMC membership, resulting in four unique clusters for comparison (Solitude Members, Social Members, Representative Members, and Quality Harvest Members). Our results indicated that motivations for membership influenced importance and satisfaction ratings, further elucidating that multiple types of hunters and members exist within DMC networks. Areas of agreement among the four DMC clusters were the need for Neighbors to follow Quality Deer Management practices, that DMCs are performing well on members Seeing deer and Co-op members sharing similar harvest goals, and that Preventing crop damage and the Lease value of the DMC property are low priorities. However, there was little agreement in quadrant placement among the four membership clusters for the remaining 17 attributes indicating the importance of DMCs understanding their individual members' motivations for joining. By retaining satisfied members, DMCs can continue to provide the hunting quality expected as well as the tangential conservation benefits. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Plants growing in nutrient-rich environment are predicted to be less defended than conspecifics under nutrient limitation. However, less is known about the effects of nutrient levels on tolerance and induced resistance, and whether the effects differ between native and introduced populations of invasive plants. We performed a greenhouse experiment with introduced (the USA) and native (Argentina) genotypes of Alternanthera philoxeroides in order to study the effects of soil nitrogen levels on plant growth, constitutive and herbivore (Agasicles hygrophila)-induced chemical defense, and herbivory tolerance. We measured total biomass, elongation rate (as proxy of growth rate), carbon and nitrogen, and the concentration of triterpenoid saponins (defensive chemicals) in leaves and roots. Constitutive resistance (+33% higher leaf triterpenoid saponins in control treatment at low nitrogen level) and tolerance [less decreased total biomass after herbivory treatment (-24% and -15% for high and low nitrogen levels)] were favored at lower nitrogen level, while induced resistance was favored at higher nitrogen level (+24% increased leaf triterpenoid saponins after herbivory treatment at high nitrogen level). Constitutive resistance and tolerance exhibited trade-offs with growth rate, while induced resistance positively correlated with growth rate. Additionally, the introduced genotypes had -6% lower content of leaf carbon in the presence of herbivores than the native genotypes at low nitrogen level, but such difference was absent at high nitrogen level. Our results indicate that soil nitrogen levels influence the preference of different defensive strategies of plant, and interweave with herbivory to determine the performance of introduced genotypes.

AB  - Arid and semiarid environments of the world are characterized by extreme environmental changes that affect the availability of scarce, patchily distributed resources such as water. In response to these changes, animals migrate or partition resources to minimize competition, resulting in temporal patterns within assemblages across multiple scales. Here, we demonstrate that the winter dry season bat assemblage in a semiarid grassland of northwestern India exhibits seasonal changes and temporal avoidance between coexisting species. Using a passive acoustic monitoring framework to quantify activity patterns at different points in the season, we show that members of this assemblage (Rhinolophus lepidus and Tadarida aegyptiaca) exhibit seasonal differences in activity, being more frequently detected in the early and late parts of the dry season, respectively. Other species (Pipistrellus tenths and Scotophilus heathii) do not exhibit seasonal changes in activity, but structure diel activity patterns, minimizing temporal overlap (and thus competition) at water bodies. These data, some of the first on bats from this region, demonstrate the complex temporal patterns structuring bat assemblages in arid and semiarid biomes. Our results hold promise both in understanding bat behavioral ecology and in long-term monitoring efforts.

AB  - Sex-specific differences in habitat selection and space use are common in ungulates. Yet, it is largely unknown how this behavioral dimorphism, ultimately leading to sexual segregation, translates to population-level patterns and density gradients across landscapes. Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra r.) predominantly occupy habitat above tree line, yet especially males may also take advantage of forested habitats. To estimate male and female chamois density and determinants thereof, we applied Bayesian spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models in two contrasting study areas in the Alps, Germany, during autumn. We fitted SCR models to non-invasive individual encounter data derived from genotyped feces. Sex-specific densities were modeled as a function of terrain ruggedness, forest canopy cover, proportion of barren ground, and site severity. We detected pronounced differences in male and female density patterns, driven primarily by terrain ruggedness, rather than by sex-specific effects of canopy cover. The positive effect of ruggedness on density was weaker for males which translated into a higher proportion of males occupying less variable terrain, frequently located in forests, compared to females. By estimating sex-specific variation in both detection probabilities and density, we were able to quantify and map how individual behavioral differences scale up and shape spatial patterns in population density.

AB  - Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are a cosmopolitan species but are only found in ice-free regions of the ocean. It is unknown how their distribution might change in regions undergoing rapid loss of sea ice and ocean warming like Baffin Bay in the eastern Canadian Arctic. In 2014 and 2018, sperm whales were sighted near Eclipse Sound, Baffin Bay: the first recorded uses of this region by sperm whales. In this study, we investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of sperm whales near Eclipse Sound using visual and acoustic data. We combine several published open-source, data sets to create a map of historical sperm whale presence in the region. We use passive acoustic data from two recording sites between 2015 and 2019 to investigate more recent presence in the region. We also analyze regional trends in sea ice concentration (SIC) dating back to 1901 and relate acoustic presence of sperm whales to the mean SIC near the recording sites. We found no records of sperm whale sightings near Eclipse Sound outside of the 2014/2018 observations. Our acoustic data told a different story, with sperm whales recorded yearly from 2015 to 2019 with presence in the late summer and fall months. Sperm whale acoustic presence increased over the 5-year study duration and was closely related to the minimum SIC each year. Sperm whales, like other cetaceans, are ecosystem sentinels, or indicators of ecosystem change. Increasing number of days with sperm whale presence in the Eclipse Sound region could indicate range expansion of sperm whales as a result of changes in sea ice. Monitoring climate change-induced range expansion in this region is important to understand how increasing presence of a top-predator might impact the Arctic food web.

AB  - The gut microbiomes of the host are large and complex communities, which helps to maintain homeostasis, improves digestive efficiency, and promotes the development of the immune system. The small mammals distributed in Sichuan Province are the most popular species for biodiversity research in Southwest China. However, the effects of different diets on the structure and function of the gut microbial community of these small mammals are poorly understood. In this study, whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing has been used to analyze the composition and functional structures of the gut microbiota of seven small mammals in Laojunshan National Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province, China. Taxonomic classification revealed that the most abundant phyla in the gut of seven small mammals were Bacteroides, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes. Moreover, Hafnia, Lactobacillus, and Yersinia were the most abundant genus in the gut microbiomes of these seven species. At the functional level, we annotated a series of KEGG functional pathways, six Cazy categories, and 46,163 AROs in the gut microbiomes of the seven species. Comparative analysis found that the difference in the gut microbiomes between the Soricidea and Muridae concentrated on the increase in the F/B (Firmicutes/Bacteroides) ratio in the Soricidea group, probably driven by the high-fat and -calorie digestive requirements due to their insectivorous diet. The comparative functional profiling revealed that functions related to metabolism and carbohydrates were significantly more abundant in Muridae group, which may be attributed to their high carbohydrate digestion requirements caused by their herbivorous diet. These data suggested that different diets in the host may play an important role in shaping the gut microbiota, and lay the foundation for teasing apart the influences of heritable and environmental factors on the evolution of gut microbial communities.

AB  - Context. Vehicle-based shooting has been widely used to kill deer, but the animal-welfare outcomes of this technique have not been evaluated in Australasia. Aim. To assess the animal-welfare outcomes of peri-urban deer culling by quantifying the fates of deer seen and shot at, the duration of procedures, and the number and location of bullet wounds in deer. Methods. We assessed vehicle-based night shooting of peri-urban rusa deer (Cervus timorensis) by professional contractors in eastern Australia. Shooters targeted the heads of deer using .223 Remington (R) rifles and 55 grain bullets. Independent veterinarians conducted ante-mortem (i.e. from the shooting vehicle) and post-mortem (i.e. inspecting the carcass) observations. The ante-mortem data were used to estimate the proportion of deer seen that were shot at, killed, wounded, and escaped. The influence of variables predicted to affect shooting outcomes was assessed. The numbers and locations of bullet wounds were recorded post-mortem. Key results. Of the 269 deer seen in 21 nights, 48% were shot at and 85% of those shot at were killed by either one (87%), two (10%) or three (3%) shots. The frequency of non-fatal wounding (i.e. escaping wounded) was 3.5% for those shot at and hit, and the median time to insensibility for the deer that were shot multiple times was 289 s. There was variation among shooters in their ability to hit a deer, and also to do so with a killing shot. The number of bullet wounds per deer ranged from 1 to 3 (mean = 1.1), with 83% of shots striking the brain and 17% striking the anterior skull, neck and jaw. Conclusions. The animal welfare outcomes we observed were comparable to those reported from other professional ground-based shooting programs for ungulates, but were poorer than those reported for professional ground-based shooting of peri-urban kangaroos.

AB  - Cryptosporidium spp. are important foodborne and waterborne pathogens in humans and animals, causing diarrheal diseases. Cattle are one of the reservoirs of Cryptosporidium infection in humans. However, data on the occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. in cattle in Yunnan Province remains limited. A total of 700 fecal samples were collected from Holstein cows (n = 442) and dairy buffaloes (n = 258) in six counties of Yunnan Province. The occurrence and genotypes of Cryptosporidium spp. were analyzed using nested PCR and DNA sequencing. Furthermore, the C. andersoni isolates were further analyzed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) at four gene loci (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS16), and the C. parvum isolate was subtyped by 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) loci. The occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. in Holstein cows and dairy buffaloes was 14.7% (65/442) and 1.1% (3/258), respectively. Of these positive samples, 56 Holstein cow samples represented C. andersoni, four Holstein cow samples represented C. bovis, three Holstein cow samples represented C. ryanae, and one represented C. parvum. Meanwhile, only three dairy buffalo samples represented C. ryanae. MLST analysis of subtypes of C. andersoni detected four subtypes, including A5A4A2A1 (n = 7), A4A4A4A1 (n = 7), A1A4A4A1 (n = 2), and A4A4A2A1 (n = 1). One C. parvum isolate was identified as the IIdA18G1 subtype. These results revealed the high occurrence and high genetic diversity of Cryptosporidium spp. in Holstein cows in Yunnan Province, enriching the knowledge of the population genetic structure of Cryptosporidium spp. in Yunnan Province.

AB  - In the context of global warming and human disturbances, many habitats of endangered waterfowl on migration routes have been threatened. Due to the limits in monitoring methods and technologies, the potential habitat quality of Grus japonensis on its migration routes is understudied. The impact of climate changes on the habitat suitability of these species requires further investigation. In this study, an ensemble species distribution model was constructed based on 174 occurrence samples and 10 habitat features to assess the habitat suitability of Grus japonensis on migration routes in eastern Asia. We also predicted the changes in the suitable habitat areas of Grus japonensis in 2060 and 2100 under two future climate scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). The results showed that the ensemble species distribution model achieved a higher accuracy in mapping potentially suitable habitats of Grus japonensis compared with the single species distribution models. The area under curve (AUC) value, true skill statistics (TSS) value, and Kappa coefficient were determined as 0.98, 0.94, and 0.96, respectively. At present, the total area of suitable habitats of Grus japonensis on the migration route of eastern Asia is approximately 3.95 x 105 km2. Under the intermediate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenario (SSP2-4.5), the area of suitable habitats on the migration route is predicted to decrease to 3.67 x 105 km2 by 2100, with a reduction rate range from 7.34 % to 13.92 %. Under the very high GHG emission scenario (SSP5-8.5), the area of suitable habitats on the migration route is predicted to decrease to 3.65 x 105 km2 by 2100, with a reduction rate range from 11.13 % to 14.43 %. This study is important for simulating the habitat suitability of endangered waterfowl on migration routes. It also provides key decision support for the conservation and restoration of the potential habitats for endangered waterfowl.

AB  - In case of Northern region of Vietnam, many provinces and cities such as Thai Nguyen that have much and enough conditions for feeding wild pigs in Thai Nguyen ecological environment. Feeding wild pigs and managing wild pork meat quality is meaninful in Vietnam, esp. In Thai Nguyen province as pork products can offer variety of tastes due to food processing and suitable for Vietnamese tastes and can export to the world widely. We might note that wild pigs prefer to live in herds. from 5-10 pigs and live in mixed forests. To meet demand from global markets including US and Europe, we need better solutions for feeding wild pigs and enhance quality of wild pork meat. From wild pork meat, people can offer delicious food via pork processing as suggested in the paper. Last but not least, we propose protein and energy mechanism for wild pigs feeding in case study of Vietnam. On conclusion, it's stated that, In Thailand and China, wild boars have also been domesticated and crossed with native pigs to become livestock in the breeding system for 12-18 years. Purebred Thai wild pork has many advantages over Vietnamese wild boar such as high resistance, less care, self-fertilization without human intervention, simple housing, low cost. livestock production is low but the output is stable. With the development of society. the demand for wild pork meat and pure local pigs are being preferred. Therefore, farmers are gradually taming farming in the direction of concentration but still keeping their wild behavior.

AB  - AimThe biodiversity of the Malay Archipelago is the product of the region's rich biogeographical history with periods of island connectivity and isolation during the Pleistocene glacial cycles. Here, the case of two endemic suid species, the Javan (Sus verrucosus) and Bawean (S. blouchi) warty pigs, was used to illustrate how biogeographic processes and recent anthropogenic pressures can shape demographic histories with significant implications for species conservation. LocationMalay Archipelago, with focus on Bawean and Java. MethodsWe employed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms from the Porcine SNP60 v2 BeadChip to assess interspecific genetic differentiation, to estimate divergence times and to perform demographic model selection. ResultsIn contrast to the hypothesis of recent divergence during the last glacial maximum, S. blouchi was found to have diverged from S. verrucosus at least 166 k years ago following a founder event. The contemporary S. blouchi population was characterised by a recent bottleneck that reduced the effective population size to less than 20. The genomic assessment supports the single species status of S. blouchi, as was previously proposed based on morphometrics. The demographic history of S. verrucosus showed evidence of secondary contact with the sympatric banded pig (S. scrofa vittatus) that colonised Java 70 k years ago. Main ConclusionsWhile the Javan and Bawean warty pigs have persisted throughout the Pleistocene climatic oscillations, contemporary pressures from human activities threaten their survival and immediate action should be taken to grant legal protection to both S. verrucosus and S. blouchi. This study highlighted the use of demographic history modelling using genomic data to identify evolutionary significant units and inform conservation.

AB  - The role of predation by large carnivores in suppressing prey populations and structuring ecosystems is highly debated, calling for a detailed understanding of carnivore diets. Wolves (Canis lupus) roam across three continents and persist throughout widely different ecosystems. Their diet is flexible and may vary spatially as well as seasonally, which requires analysis of diet on different spatial and temporal scales. Few studies have investigated the summer diet of wolves, which is more variable, consists of smaller prey, and requires different methods than studying their winter diet. To better understand the summer diet of wolves, we combined three independently collected wolf scat data sets from three distinctly different portions of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem: Yellowstone National Park (2009), Grand Teton National Park (2003 - 2009), and the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness (2009 - 2010). These areas represent different ecological conditions and management regimes, which may impact wolf diet. We estimated relative biomass and compared occurrence of different prey species among packs, years, as well as the three regions. In total, we analyzed 1,906 wolf scats and found that neonate cervids, adult elk, and adult deer were the most important prey species in the summer diet of the wolves. We found dietary variation among packs residing in the same area, as well as across years. The occurrence of neonate cervids displayed the most variation, and low occurrence of this prey type often was associated with a more diverse diet. Wolf packs within the national parks had a higher occurrence of medium-sized prey (similar to 50 - 70 kg) and lower occurrence of small-sized prey (<= 20 kg) compared to wolves in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness. These results demonstrate flexibility in summer diet across packs, years, and between regions within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

AB  - A classic question in community ecology is how species coexist within a community. Studies have sought to understand how species occurrence vary according to habitat structure, space, food, predators, and competitors. Small mammals are widely used as a model system in community ecology, since they represent the most diverse group of mammals in the neotropical forests. Hence, we investigated whether microhabitat features, food resource (fruits), and presence of medium and large mammals can explain fine-spatial scale richness, abundances, and habitat use of small mammals in a forest in Brazil. Three species represented 83% of all captured individuals (Didelphis albiventris, Oligoryzomys nigripes, Akodon montensis). Species richness, abundance, and habitat use of small mammals were affected positively by the distance of bamboo (Chusquea sp.) thickets. The occurrence of predators (carnivores and omnivores) and potential competitors (large herbivores), however, did not affect richness, abundance, and habitat use of small mammals at small spatial scales. Our findings suggest that the bamboo patches can influence spatial distribution and shape small mammal communities in tropical forests.

AB  - Although it is well recognized that the strength of plant-herbivore interactions can vary with the plant sex, the distance, and the density of conspecific neighbors, no study has yet assessed their combined influence. Here, we filled this knowledge gap by focusing on the dioecious palm Chamaeropshumilis L., and its two main herbivores, the invasive moth Paysandisiaarchon Burmeister and the feral goat Caprahircus L. We evaluated levels and spatial patterns of herbivory, as well as those of plant size and number of inflorescences in two palm populations in Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain). Our spatial point pattern analyses revealed that palms not affected by moth herbivory or goat florivory were spatially aggregated, goats fed more strongly upon inflorescences in palms with more neighbors, but they consumed more leaves in isolated palms. Interestingly, we could reveal for the first time that plant sex is a key plant trait modulating neighborhood effects. For instance, whereas aggregated female palms experienced lower intensity of goat florivory than isolated ones, male palms showed the opposite pattern. Palm size and number of inflorescences also showed sex-related differences, suggesting that sexual dimorphism is a key driver of the observed neighborhood effects on herbivory. Our study highlights the importance of considering relevant plant traits such as sex when investigating plant neighborhood effects, calling for further research to fully understand the dynamics governing plant-herbivore interactions in dioecious systems.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has caused drastic changes in urban ecosystems, resulting in various urgent management needs from mitigating biodiversity loss to preventing human-wildlife conflicts. Using species distribution modeling to understand urban species??? distributional patterns and predict their future changes is thus important to support decision-making. Raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) that previously inhabited Shanghai had been extirpated from the metropolitan area but recently returned to and expanded in almost all districts, causing hundreds of human-raccoon dog conflicts. In this study, we initiated a citizen science project, identified factors associated with raccoon dog habitat selection, and predicted its current suitable habitat as well as potential future ranges under different city development scenarios. By constructing an ensemble modeling using data from camera trap surveys, interviews and rescuing records, we found that raccoon dog distribution was positively associated with several anthropogenic factors including nighttime light, human population, and percentage area of buildings. We predicted a 156,024 ha suitable habitat for raccoon dogs throughout Shanghai, among which only 5,811 ha (3.72 %) was currently occupied. Our results indicated considerable potential of raccoon dogs??? future expansion, which had been consistently ignored in previous management plans. To alleviate the increasing human-raccoon dog conflicts, we found strategies to slow down raccoon dog movement effective tools, and suggest adaptive management to provide fast response and flexible solutions. This is the first study to investigate human-wildlife conflict in China???s urban environment, and our approach has substantial implications for Shanghai as well as other regions where urban species are undergoing rapid expansion.

AB  - The southwestern Cape of South Africa is a particularly dynamic region in terms of long-term climate change. We analysed fossil pollen from a 25,000 year sediment core taken from a near-coastal wetland at Pearly Beach that revealed that distinct changes in vegetation composition occurred along the southwestern Cape coast. From these changes, considerable variability in temperature and moisture availability are inferred. Consistent with indications from elsewhere in southwestern Africa, variability in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) was identified as a strong determinant of regional climate change. At Pearly Beach, this resulted in phases of relatively drier conditions (similar to 24-22.5 cal ka BP and similar to 22-18 cal ka BP) demarcated by brief phases of increased humidity from similar to 24.5-24 cal ka BP and 22.5-22 cal ka BP. During glacial Termination I (similar to 19-11.7 ka), a marked increase in coastal thicket pollen from similar to 18.5 to 15.0 cal ka BP indicates a substantial increase in moisture availability, coincident, and likely associated with, a slowing AMOC and a buildup of heat in the southern Atlantic. With clear links to glacial and deglacial Earth system dynamics and perturbations, the Pearly Beach record represents an important new contribution to a growing body of data, providing insights into the patterns and mechanisms of southwestern African climate change.

AB  - We present the Late Pleistocene extinct shrub-ox, Euceratherium collinum (Bovidae), dung pellets recovered from Pontatoc Ridge Shelter, a dry alcove in the Santa Catalina Mountains of southern Arizona. The shelter is at the current upper edge of the ArizonaUpland subdivision (the highest and coldest part) of the Sonoran Desert. Packrat (Neotoma) middens with macrobotanical fossils and a floor deposit consisting of midden debris and dung pellets were sampled and are described here. Six packrat middens radiocarbon date to 15,690-22,874 cal yr B.P. (calibrated years before present); dung pellets from the floor deposit date to 14,990 cal yr B.P. Macrobotanical fossils primarily from the middens but also from the floor deposit indicate that a woodland composed of Arizona cypress (Hesperocyparis [Cupressus] arizonica), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), a hybrid singleleaf pinyon pine (Pinus monophylla var. fallax), border pinyon (Pinus discolor), juniper (Juniperus), manzanita (Arctostaphylos pungens), and canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) grew outside the shelter. Dung pellets were measured, compared with other extant and extinct species, and sampled for phytoliths and pollen. Based on size, morphology, DNA, and physiographic setting (cliff face), our assumption is that only a single taxon of slickrockclimbing ruminant used the small, extremely inaccessible Pontatoc Ridge Shelter and that all large pellets belong to the extinct shrub-ox. The distribution of Late Pleistocene shrub-ox is reviewed; the stocky, rather short ruminant is recovered mainly in mountainous and canyon-county terrains of western United States and northern Mexico.

AB  - The Asian elephant Elephas maximus is at risk of extinction as a result of anthropogenic pressures, and remaining populations are often small and fragmented remnants, occupying a fraction of the species' former range. Once widely distributed across China, only a maximum of 245 elephants are estimated to survive across seven small populations. We assessed the Asian elephant population in Nangunhe National Nature Reserve in Lincang Prefecture, China, using camera traps during May-July 2017, to estimate the population size and structure of this genetically important population. Although detection probability was low (0.31), we estimated a total population size of c. 20 individuals, and an effective density of 0.39 elephants per km(2). Social structure indicated a strong sex ratio bias towards females, with only one adult male detected within the population. Most of the elephants associated as one herd but three adult females remained separate from the herd throughout the trapping period. These results highlight the fragility of remnant elephant populations such as Nangunhe and we suggest options such as a managed metapopulation approach for their continued survival in China and more widely.

AB  - During the Final Gravettian, the Reclau Caves (northeast Iberia) were intensively occupied by hunter-gatherer communities. The study of residential level D (c. 25.4-19.7 kyr bp) of Arbreda Cave offers a new view of subsistence strategies of communities which inhabited the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, a transition region between the steppe-tundra and the Iberian wooded steppe biomes, during Greenland Stadial 3. Presented here are the results of the zooarchaeological and taphonomic analysis of ungulate and carnivore remains recovered from level D. The study confirms that the faunal assemblage of this level was mainly brought there by humans. The zooarchaeological analysis indicates selective hunting based on the exploitation of familial groups of horses and deer, while other ungulate taxa appear to be infrequent. Hunter-gatherers frequented the site throughout the year, but more intensive use in spring is indicated by subadult sensu lato horses. There was extensive exploitation of ungulate carcasses: various butchery activities, marrow extraction, the use of bone as fuel and 'less elaborate tools' are documented. Carnivore canines were exploited to produce ornaments. The great dominance of horses reveals cold conditions and the expansion of open environments related to the chronology span of Greenland Stadial 3.

AB  - Niche differentiation is a key stabilizing mechanism in the maintenance of biodiversity and species coexistence. Recent work shows that trophic niche partitioning between parrotfishes (Labridae: Scarini) is more extensive than previously described. One Indo-Pacific species, Scarus spinus, appears highly specialized, scraping crustose coralline algae (CCA) with powerful oral jaws. CCA are of low nutritional value, suggesting that the dietary targets of this parrotfish are protein-rich microphotoautotrophs associated with CCA, particularly filamentous cyanobacteria. We collected feeding substrata samples at mid-shelf and outer-shelf sites near Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Scarus spinus were followed on snorkel. When biting was observed, bite substrata were photographed and then a 22-mm-diameter core extracted around the bite site. Density of biota including filamentous cyanobacteria and diatoms was quantified microscopically on photographs of the bite cores (up to 630 x magnification). The taxonomy of cyanobacteria and CCA was refined using next-generation sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes, respectively. CCA and filamentous cyanobacteria were present on all bite cores and the density of filamentous cyanobacteria where S. spinus fed did not vary between mid-shelf and outer-reef samples. Epiphytic and shallow endophytic cyanobacteria were consistently associated with the CCA where S. spinus fed, including Calothrix spp., Mastigocoleus testarum, Leptolyngbya spp., Hyella patelloides and Oscillatoriales. Our results emphasize the importance of high-resolution species-specific dietary data for parrotfishes. We conclude that polyphasic methods are essential both for diet tracing and to develop our understanding of the cyanobacteria that are integral to coral reef functioning.

AB  - Studies on the predation of vertebrates by armadillos are scarce, and most of them refer to the consumption of small reptiles and rodents, attributing the remains of larger prey to the ingestion of carrion. However, there is evidence that some species of the Chlamyphoridae family may have predatory habits, killing and consuming even larger prey. In this study, we document predation of a black-and-white tegu (Salvator merianae) and a gray brocket deer (Mazama gouazoubira) by a yellow armadillo (Euphractus sexcinctus) in the northeast of Argentina, and we review attacks and captures of other medium- to large-sized vertebrates by this armadillo. The results suggest that the yellow armadillo could play a hitherto underestimated role in the food webs of the communities of which they are a part.

AB  - As part of the current global change scenario, invasive species have caused many direct impacts on native biodiversity and the interactions among species. European rabbits and hares are two herbivore species that have been introduced worldwide, displacing native species within their trophic level, but also affecting native predators. Both species have become extremely abundant in their exotic distributions, becoming primary prey for many predators, a function that they also play in their native ranges. These relatively new and strong interaction links created with their consumers have the potential to destabilize food webs by precluding the occurrence of weaker links. Here, we have compiled the diet of 32 predator species from three food webs and compared them: one in Europe, where these species are native, and two where they are introduced, in South America and Oceania. We found that these lagomorphs are the primary prey in all study sites, generating a dietary shift of predators in the invaded regions. In all food webs studied, these two preys channeled most of the biomass input towards the higher trophic level, generating the strongest interaction links, affecting the food web configuration and stability. They destabilize food web structure by homogenizing predators' diets, augmenting their niche overlap and web vulnerability. Moreover, rapid population changes of these prey, either natural (e.g., diseases) or anthropic (e.g., control measures), create new conservation challenges for predators and scavengers. This highlights that invasive species can strongly affect interactions among species and it should be considered in management and conservation actions.

AB  - Large area hyperspectral remote sensing monitoring of physiological parameters of reclaimed vegetation is an important technology for environmental regulation in mining areas, but accurate identification of reclaimed tree species is a prerequisite. In this study, we collected hyperspectral data of six typical vegetation leaves at the Jiazibei reclamation site and analyzed the characteristics of the original vegetation spectrum, including its reciprocal logarithm, first derivative, and continuum removal. Additionally, on the basis of the mean confidence interval method that reduces the dimensionality of the hyperspectral data to select the characteristic bands, the ttest detection method was used to select the best characteristic bands on the basis of the significant difference among the characteristic bands. Finally, three discrimination models, Fisher, stepwise discrimination (SD), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were constructed to discriminate typical vegetation types based on th e best feature bands. The results show that the first derivative and continuum removal processing can intensify the characteristic difference of the spectral curve and that the blueshift in the vegetation spectrum based on the first derivative of the red edge feature indicates that the Camellia is the most severely stressed in the mining area. Compared with other research on the characteristic bands selected based on reclaimed vegetation in the mining area, we obtained richer water content information for vegetation types. Among the three discriminate models, the SD method based on the hyperspectral measured leaf sample data in the mining area had the best effect in identifying the reclaimed vegetation in the study area, in which the average discriminative accuracy of Wetland pine is 93.6%. The identification and analysis of reclaimed vegetation provide technical support and a theoretical basis for the inversion of physiological parameters of reclaimed vegetation in rare earth mining areas and the monitoring of reclamation effects, which is of significance for realizing large-scale monitoring of the ecological environment of mining areas.

AB  - Wild prey can reduce predation risk by avoiding areas used by their predators. As they get older, individuals should be able to fine-tune this avoidance based on their increased experience with predation risk. Such learning mechanisms are expected to play a key role in how individuals cope with risk during their life, particularly in altered landscapes where human disturbances have created habitat conditions distinct from those of the past. We studied the role of experience on the avoidance of risky areas by boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in a system where they are under high predation pressure from gray wolves (Canis lupus) and black bears (Ursus americanus). Using telemetry data collected on 28 caribou, 31 wolves, and 12 bears, we investigated whether caribou adjusted their level of predator avoidance with passing monitoring years, a proxy of increasing experience. We observed an increase in the avoidance of areas suitable to wolves (during two study periods) and bears (during all study periods) with passing years. Periods during which caribou did not adjust their behavior toward wolves (winter and calving) were characterized by persistent-potentially innate-avoidance. Our results suggest that, in most circumstances, caribou became more efficient at avoiding areas selected by their predators as they gained experience. Future work should attempt to demonstrate whether such tactics are heritable; if so, our results would suggest that, given time, caribou living in disturbed environments would have the potential to adapt to changing levels of risk. This would give hope for the conservation of caribou, a species at risk in Canada, provided levels of risk do not surpass the limits of their behavioral plasticity.

AB  - Monitoring population trends for bird species in the Arctic and sub-Arctic can be difficult and cost prohibitive. Breeding populations of birds in these remote locations may be changing and have garnered much attention regarding their conservation. We analyzed data from bird lists (daily species observations) collected while conducting other targeted research to estimate trends in the probability of observing species at two sub-Arctic study sites. For Akimiski Island, Nunavut (52 species) we estimated positive trends with high confidence (95% credible limits do not include 0) for 14 species and negative trends with high confidence for 18. For Burntpoint Creek, Ontario (46 species) we estimated that 12 species had positive trends with high confidence and 12 had negative trends with high confidence. More than 60% of species at each site matched population trends for at least one of three larger geographic scales that we compared estimates with; regional, provincial and national. We hypothesized that trends may be due to climate change effects or because of effects related to intensive herbivory from nesting geese. Trends for most of the species where we made specific predictions from these hypotheses agreed with those predicted; however, well-designed experiments are needed to conclusively determine the driving mechanisms of these trends. Collecting bird list data while simultaneously conducting other research is not nearly as time consuming or expensive as targeted breeding bird surveys (e.g., point counts, call counts, nest searching, etc.). This analysis method may be of utility for other remote field study sites where gaps in trend data exist.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities and climate change are degrading wildlife habitats, making it crucial to assess suitability of remaining habitat for effective conservation and management of threatened wildlife. This study aimed to determine the variables influencing habitat selection and spatial distribution of caracal (Caracal caracal) in southwestern Iran from 2019 to 2020. Ensembles of Small Models (ESM) were used based on eight species distribution models that included a combination of statistical and machine learning methods (GLM, CTA, FDA, GBM, ANN, MARS, RF, and MaxEnt). The outputs of two ensemble models were hybridized by simple averaging. In ESM 1, distance to water resources was used as a representative of environmental variables and in ESM 2, annual precipitation was used as a representative of bioclimatic variables. In both ESMs, these variables were combined with ecological variables such as the distribution of wild goat (Capra aegagrus) and livestock. The average importance of the model variables for ESM 1 and ESM 2 showed that the distribution of wild goat and livestock were the most important factors in predicting suitable habitat for caracals, respectively. Habitat suitability was higher close to the distribution of wild goat and livestock, near water sources and during periods of higher precipitation. Probabilistic predictions of caracal presence based on the hybridization of ESM 1 and ESM 2 suggest that only 1.3 % (206 ha) of the study area was highly suitable habitat, while 58.4 % (9570 ha) was unsuitable. Based on the ensemble of binary presence-absence maps, caracals were certainly absent in 76.2 % (12,490 ha) of the area, while their presence was uncertain in 21.6 % (3536 ha). The presence of caracals was certain in 2.2 % (363 ha) of the study area. Awareness of the habitat and distribution of caracal can help to make better decisions towards conservation and management and also reduce its conflict with humans.

AB  - The profitability of a swine enterprise depends heavily on high productivity, which to some extent can be achieved using trace elements. However, there are discordant results on the impact of zinc (Zn) supplementation, one of such trace elements on performance indices of weaned pigs. This study aimed to use the meta-analytic method to assess the impact of Zn supplementation on growth performance [i.e., average daily feed intake (ADFI), feed to gain ratio (F/G), average daily gain (ADG) and blood Zn levels] of weaned pigs. 1200 studies on the impact of Zn supplementation on growth performance were identified in a systematic search performed in Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus databases and screened based on set inclusion criteria. Thirty studies met the inclusion criteria. Pooled results showed that Zn supplementation had a small effect on ADFI [standardised mean difference (SMD = 0.33; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.23 to 0.44) and F/G (SMD = 0.18; 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.30)], but had a moderate effect on ADG (SMD = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.77) in weaned pigs. Additionally, Zn supplementation had a large effect on blood Zn (SMD = 2.83; 95% CI: 2.13 to 3.52). Subgroup analyses revealed that moderator variables [duration of supplementation (DOS), supplementation level (SL), Zn form and number of pigs included in each group] influenced the results of the meta-analysis, taking cognizance of heterogeneity. Meta-regression analyses found that moderators accounted for most of the sources of heterogeneity. It is concluded that Zn supplementation increased ADG and blood Zn in weaned pigs.

AB  - Grasshoppers are preeminent herbivores and perhaps the most significant rangeland pests in the United States (US). Despite the important ecosystem functions they provide, grasshopper populations often obtain densities that cause significant economic harm to grazing operations and agricultural production. Although numerous studies conducted at the level of individual field sites have examined potential mechanisms contributing to grasshopper population "boom and bust'' cycles, there has yet to be a large, regional scaled analysis that quantified grasshopper variation across the Western US as a whole. While taking steps to account for data collection biases, mediating effects, and variable confounding, we assessed the influence of Pacific Ocean sea surface temperature oscillations on a 40-year record of grasshopper density in the Western US. Central to our analysis was employing spatially varying coefficients to model time and location-specific variation in grasshopper response to climate. Our results quantitatively demonstrated interannual changes in grasshopper density to be indirectly effected by seasonal El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) variability and to exhibit spatial asynchrony and non-stationarity such that the relative influence of climate on grasshopper density varied through time and across geographic space. Our model is the first to incorporate climate indices as spatially varying coefficients for assessment of a terrestrial species and represents a critical step towards understanding causal drivers of regional grasshopper density.

AB  - Common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) (hereafter hippos) are iconic and understudied ecological engineers in African aquatic and terrestrial systems. Temporal changes in hippo group size in response to changes in wading areas have been described in river systems, but hippo group dynamics remain generally understudied and have not been quantified in a seasonal floodplain. We used monthly census data collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle between August 2016 and July 2017 to identify changes in hippo distribution, density, and group size at the most used wading areas in the seasonal floodplain in Ndumo Game Reserve, South Africa. We found that hippos congregate into large groups when the wading area decreases in seasonal floodplain systems, similar to perennial river systems. Moreover, as the inundation area increased, overall individual and group density decreased, hippo abundance decreased, and the mean distance between groups increased. Periods of low water availability tend to coincide with periods of food scarcity; thus, competition for water may compound with competition for food, likely affecting cycles of population growth or decline. Increased unpredictability in seasonal and annual rainfall patterns because of climate change will affect the predictability and availability of hippo wading areas, which will likely affect the distribution, size, and persistence of hippo populations. The results of our study provide additional information necessary for the conservation and management of hippos in seasonal floodplain systems in the context of climate change.

AB  - Periphyton community grown on submerged substrate in water could serve as a preferred natural food item to herbivorous and omnivorous fish and crustacean species. To determine the optimum substrate area for the growth of periphyton biomass serving as natural food and to reduce the requirement of pellet feed quantity, a 150-day pond experiment was conducted with four treatments of brackishwater polyculture: total feeding and no periphyton substrate (P0), and partial feeding with periphyton grown on nylon net substrate equivalent to 50 (P50), 75 (P75) and 100 (P100) % of pond surface area. Each treatment had three randomly assigned replicate ponds (50 m2). After 15 days of substrate fixation in the surface layer of ponds up to 50 cm water depth, stocking was made with seeds of Mugil cephalus Linnaeus, 1758, Planiliza parsia (Hamilton, 1822), Chanos chanos (Forsskal, 1775) and Penaeus monodon Fabricius, 1798 at 1800, 18000, 2000 and 30,000 number ha- 1, respectively. A low-cost pellet feed (30.76% crude protein) was provided at 6-3% of fish biomass per day. Dry matter (DM) of periphyton biomass was estimated from each replicate pond under P50, P75 and P100 from 15 x 15 cm2 net substrate, and then total periphyton DM was calculated according to the substrate surface area at 15-day intervals. Then, the total periphyton biomass was divided to find out daily DM availability. The feed amount in P50, P75 and P100 ponds was reduced proportionately to the equivalent daily periphyton DM availability and the feeding at this reduced quantity was continued for 15 days. The experiment revealed significantly lower levels of nitrogenous and phosphorus compounds, and dissolved organic carbon content in water of P75 and P100, compared to that of P0 and P50 (P < 0.05) and there were interaction effects of experimental period and periphyton substrate area on these parameters. All the species had an increasing growth pattern with experimental period and there was an interaction effect of experimental period and periphyton substrate area on growth of these species, indicating periphyton had positive effects. The highest specific growth rate was recorded in P. monodon and the lowest was in M. cephalus. Pooled survival of fishes and shrimp, and total productivity did not differ among treatments (P > 0.05). Although, the highest level of feed reduction (42%) by the utilization of periphyton biomass was in P100, P75 performed better in terms of productivity and economic return with 30% feed reduction in polyculture. Similarly, there was 26-41% reduction in feed conversion ratio with the highest level being in P100 (41%), followed by P75 (40%) in comparison to P0. Moreover, carcass composition of cultured fishes and shrimp indicated that periphyton based systems with partial feeding could meet up the nutrient requirement of the animals with no negative effects in comparison to the feed-based system. Therefore, this study suggests that provision of periphyton substrate equivalent to 75% of pond surface area along with partial feeding is the most appropriate approach for achieving higher return with environmental sustainability in brackishwater polyculture.

AB  - Ink disease of sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) caused by the oomycetes Phytophthora cinnamomi and P. x cambivora is the limiting factor for chestnut cultivation in several European regions. The objective of this study was to explore how the spatial landscape heterogeneity affects the distribution pattern of ink disease over a large chestnut area in Central Italy using an approach that combined remote sensing, ground truthing activities and GIS. A multivariate model was developed that explained a large proportion of the variance of the impact of the disease using the density of roads and drainage networks as predictor variables. The association of these landscape elements, specifically with ink disease foci, also provides practical tool to improve the accuracy of monitoring of this disease and the preparation of risk maps.

TI  - The efficacy of wildlife fences for keeping reindeer outside a chronic wasting disease risk area
T2  - ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Emerging wildlife diseases often comes with negative cultural and economic impact. Limiting disease spread is a recurrent goal and challenge, but the efficacy of various mitigation measures is rarely assessed. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a lethal disease among cervids that was discovered among alpine reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in the Nordfjella mountain range of Norway in 2016. After de-population, the entire range was fallowed to avoid re-emergence from environmental pathogen reservoirs. This involved installing perimeter fences in the alpine areas in order to keep reindeer from adjacent populations outside of the CWD risk area, while other cervids (red deer Cervus elaphus, roe deer Capreolus capreolus and moose Alces alces) were likely to enter through the forested areas. We used camera trapping and surveillance reports to assess the efficacy of the perimeter fences. All four species of cervids were documented inside the CWD risk area. For reindeer, only 12.0% of observations were inside the CWD risk area, while this was 28.7% for the other cervids. The higher proportion of observations outside of the fenced area indicate that fences provided a barrier and lowered the number of crossings also of red deer, roe deer and moose. Fences do not provide complete barriers, and we discuss practical solutions for how to avoid 'intruders' entering a given area, such as maintenance at critical points (e.g. river and road crossings) and height of fences (e.g. species variation in jumping; deep snow) to uphold their desired effect. We argue that two fence lines with a buffer zone would be required when re-introduction of reindeer are planned in the CWD risk area after fallowing, similar to what has been suggested for other wildlife diseases.

AB  - TG interaction factor 1 (TGIF1) plays a major role in transcriptional inhibition and suppression of TGF-& beta; signaling, but its functional roles in granulosa cells (GCs) have not been elucidated; in particular, there is no information about the yak (Bos grunniens) TGIF1 gene. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to clone yak TGIF1 and investigate TGIF1 functions in yak GCs. RT-PCR results showed that the coding region of yak TGIF1 is 759 bp and encodes 252 amino acids. Its nucleotide sequence showed 85.24-99.74% similarity to mouse, human, pig, goat and cattle homologous genes. To explore the functional roles of TGIF1, we studied proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, steroidogenesis and the expression levels of related genes in yak GCs transfected with small interfering RNA specific to TGIF1. The results showed that TGIF1 knockdown promoted proliferation and cell cycle progression and inhibited apoptosis and estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) production in cultured yak GCs. Conversely, TGIF1 overexpression inhibited proliferation and cell cycle progression and stimulated apoptosis and E2 and P4 production. In addition, these functional changes in yak GCs were observed parallel to the expression changes in genes involved in the cell cycle (PCNA, CDK2, CCND1, CCNE1, CDK4 and P53), apoptosis (BCL2, BAX and CASPASE3), and steroidogenesis (CYP11A1, 3 & beta;-HSD and StAR). In conclusion, TGIF1 was relatively conserved in the course of animal evolution. TGIF1 inhibited GC viability and stimulated apoptosis and the secretion of E2 and P4 by yak GCs. Our results will help to reveal the mechanism underlying yak follicular development and improve the reproductive efficiency of female yaks.

AB  - In mountain socioecological systems, the interaction between nature and people is at the core of planning local long-term sustainable development strategies. Pastoralism is the main traditional socioeconomic livelihood in dryland mountains. It is strongly associated with long-established land use practices that provide essential material and relational contributions, both of which shape human populations and nature. The aim of this work is to characterize the traditional pastoralist system of the Puna (northwest Argentina) in a framework that highlights its diverse values and valuations within nature-people coproductions. We use the conceptual framework of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services as a tool to analyze and understand these socioecological systems. We also identify 3 coproduction types at different steps of the benefit flow from ecosystems to quality of life. Pastoral livelihood persists in the Argentine Puna, cocreating a landscape with natural and anthropic (water sources, grasslands, wildlife, livestock, and techniques) elements interacting through complex mechanisms involving environmental conditions and cultural and economic practices. Some drivers that threaten the system's sustainability are overexploitation and land use change. These are visible as poaching or conversion of pasturelands into mining areas. Finally, we identify a number of knowledge gaps. These include lack of information on some regulatory contributions of nature to people, biodiversity status, and trends and statistical information on Indigenous Peoples and local communities; the flow of relationships; and coproductions related to the local expression of the quality of life. We also highlight the need for spatially explicit information and comprehensive knowledge of drivers and socioecological dynamics of the landscape.

AB  - The abundance of herbivorous fishes is known to vary strongly with latitude. However, our understanding of this pattern is largely based on the examination of nominally herbivorous fishes (i.e. both herbivores and detritivores) as a single group. Therefore, we do not know how this collective classification may have confounded our understanding of distribution patterns, nor how different trophic pathways function across latitudes and associated temperature gradients. This constrains our ability to predict how tropicalising reefs may function as oceans warm, especially following range extensions of tropical taxa. Here, we explored the productivity of seven groups of roving nominally herbivorous fishes across eastern (34 degrees of latitude; similar to 3800 km) and western (23 degrees; similar to 2600 km) Australia, with specific consideration of the herbivore versus detritivore dichotomy across key spatial and environmental gradients. In terms of the total nominally herbivorous fish community, we found near-continuous declines in species richness with increasing distance from the equator, while total biomass and productivity were maintained across nearly 30 degrees of latitude in eastern Australia. However, when we separated herbivores and detritivores, we found detritivore productivity dominated the tropics but declined abruptly in temperate regions, with this decline closely correlated with decreasing temperature in a synchronous manner along both coastlines. No such synchronous relationship was observed between herbivore productivity and temperature. These results highlight the importance of the herbivore versus detritivore division in understanding reef trophodynamics across latitudes, and the importance of understanding fish-based detritivory when predicting how the trophodynamic functioning of reefs may change along warming coastlines.

AB  - The rusa deer has been introduced to Merauke region and later to Vogelkop Peninsula in Indonesian New Guinea (West Papua) in 1928. It has widely dispersed across much of the West Papuan lowlands, but little is known on population size and its role for the livelihoods of rural communities. Here, our aim was to assess the population status of rusa deer, and to investigate the extent of hunting practices on this mammal in West Papua. We conducted camera trapping and line transect surveys simultaneously to estimate rusa deer population abundance in the Kwoor basin of the Tambrauw regency, Papua Barat province, Indonesia. We also interviewed hunters (n = 134), informants (n = 9) and households (n = 91) to assess hunting patterns and socioeconomic importance of rusa deer across 15 districts of the Tambrauw regency. We estimated rusa deer density within a 48-km(2) forested area at 10.34 (5.36-19.98) and 21.04 individuals/km(2) using line transect and N-mixture modelling approach using camera trapping data, respectively. Both density estimates are considerably higher than those from its native range in Java and Bali (0.08 individual/km(2)). Almost 92% of hunters reported that they hunted rusa deer in their traditional forests, being the most frequent amongst the 18 hunted species, particularly for commercial (62%) and subsistence (38%) purposes. Our results suggest that traditional hunting has become a significant livelihood activity and important income source in the study area. It is therefore imperative to identify potential management strategies on wildlife hunting while also considering that the high densities of introduced rusa deer may potentially exert adverse effects on native flora and fauna. This study further suggests that traditional knowledge (locally called 'sasi' system) and wildlife taboos still govern wildlife hunting and utilization of forest resources in West Papua, and these need to play a role in integrated community-based wildlife management.

AB  - Background and Aims Plants have evolved various defences against herbivores, including direct chemical and structural defences and co-opted biological defences by predatory insects. However, the effects of abiotic habitat conditions on the quantitative expression of defence traits of spiny species have not been elucidated. Methods Here, we investigated whether a spiny deciduous tree, Aralia elata (Miq.) Seem., changes its defence expression across light and nutrient gradients. We measured allocation to spines and C-based secondary metabolites (condensed tannins and total phenols) on A. elata plants growing across light and nutrient gradients in situ in natural landscapes in Japan. Second, we examined the effects of light and soil nutrient condition on allocation to shoot organs, spines and chemical defences of juveniles of two genotypes of the species, respectively spiny (mainland population) and non-spiny (island population), grown in a glasshouse. Key Results In the field investigation, absolute spine mass, spine mass fraction, total phenols and condensed tannins all responded positively to canopy openness. Total phenol content was also negatively related to soil N. In the glasshouse, spiny genotype individuals had less total biomass, had lower stem allocation and were shorter than non-spiny genotype individuals. In spiny genotype trees, both spine mass fraction and total phenols decreased under low light conditions. Nutrient additions had negative effects on spine mass fraction and total phenols, but no effect on absolute spine mass. Conclusions These results suggest that development of spines is costly for A. elata and receives greater allocation when carbohydrate supply is more plentiful. Thus, light is a more important determinant of spine allocation than soil nutrients for A. elata.

AB  - Bottom[and hardwoods forests (BLHW) are increasingly subject to active management for water quality improvement, streambank stabilization, to mitigate for urban expansion and to improve habitat for wildlife. Since the majority of remaining BLHW are degraded, restoration attempts are becoming commonplace within the Western Gulf Coastal Plain (WGCP) of the US. However, restoration success in terms of obtaining high stem densities of desirable species has been mixed, with managers observing survival rates <15 per cent for planted oak and hickory seedlings in some situations due to a variety of [imitations. Over two growing seasons, we investigated the effectiveness of portable electric fences, individual tree shelters and 2.4-m woven wire high fences for mitigating herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and feral swine (Sus scrofa). Treatments fell within degraded forested areas and abandoned agricultural fields where we tested four species of interest: Nuttak oak (Quercus texana Buckley), Shumard oak (Q. shumardii Buckley), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa Michx.) and pecan (Carya illinoinensis K. Koch). Where herbivory occurred, mitigation techniques produced a higher survival rate (<(X)over bar> = 17.6 per cent) than unprotected areas ((X) over bar = 9.1 per cent). In areas of high white-tailed deer density, prominent browsing was evident, resulting in two-growing-season height growth of seedlings being Less in non-fenced ((X) over bar = 2.33 cm) and electric (X = 4.33 cm) fenced plots compared with high fences ((X) over bar = 13.02 cm) and individual tree shelters ((X) over bar = 24.23 cm). Additionally, we observed a negative relationship between survival and the number of days seedlings that were inundated with flood waters during the growing season. Matching species of interest to the site conditions, specifically the local hydrologic regimes, should carry a high priority in planning a restoration project within BLHW in the WGCP.

AB  - Facilitation is an ecological interaction that has allowed plant lineages to survive past climate aridification. This same interaction can be expected to buffer the effects of current climate change, which is tending to become more arid in the Mediterranean basin. However, facilitation may wane when stress conditions are extreme. Here we argue that the erosion of the facilitation signal between Quercus ilex and its nurses detected by Garcia-Fayos et al. (2020) along 50 years in the eastern Iberian Peninsula may have been due to the reversion of facilitation to competition imposed by an increasingly arid climate. To support this speculation, we reconstructed the climatic niche of Q. ilex and its nurses as well as the local climate change occurring in the populations studied. We found that the decreasing trend in precipitation is pushing Q. ilex out of its climatic optimum in the stressful (semi-arid) but not in the mild (sub-humid) habitats. These results suggest that facilitation will be unable to mitigate the effects of climate change, especially those related to aridification. However, other scenarios linking climatic change with herbivory and rural abandonment should be considered to fully understand the past, present and future of facilitation interactions. Reconstructing past interactions can serve as an early warning signal about the future of populations in the face of climate change.

AB  - Simple Summary Sheep are often transported in cold conditions. Some of the coldest exist in northern China and we tested the effects of transporting sheep in these conditions. In order to find out how to limit any of the cold temperatures' adverse effects, we tested journeys of two durations, in covered and open trucks, and investigated the effects of feeding sheep before transport. We found that sheep had less evidence of cold stress in a covered vehicle. Longer journeys actually allowed the sheep to warm up, but sheep appeared more stressed after the long journeys. Feeding the sheep before transport also helped to ameliorate the adverse effects of cold stress. Low temperatures can provide a risk to the welfare of sheep during transport because of increased ventilation chilling the sheep, and we examined the importance of three factors-covering the vehicle, duration of transport, and feeding prior to transport-on the welfare of sixty transported 4-month-old Dorper x Mongolian female sheep in a cold climate. Sheep in a covered vehicle had greater increases in head and ear temperatures than those in an open vehicle. Sheep transported for 2 h increased their leg temperatures, whereas those transported for 1 h had reduced leg temperatures. Increases in non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the blood samples during the long transport suggested that sheep had more muscular and metabolic activity, compromising their well-being. Feeding prior to transport did not affect body temperatures, but those not fed prior to transport had reduced alanine transferase, HSP and cortisol in their blood, whereas those that were fed had reduced NEFAs, LDH and creatine kinase. Prior feeding had no effect on the sheep temperature indices over a two-hour transport period. Thus, the sheep most at risk of the adverse effects of cold temperatures were those transported in open vehicles, those transported for a longer time, and those not fed before transport.

AB  - High temperatures during the production of fish feed can induce Maillard reaction and protein crosslinking. These reactions are known to reduce protein digestibility and bioavailability of amino acids in mammals, but information in fish is scarce. Therefore, this research aimed to understand the effect of Maillard reaction and protein crosslinking on protein digestibility in Nile tilapia. An animal-based protein diet and plant-based protein diet were stored at 7 degrees C and 50 degrees C for seven days to induce a contrast in Maillard reaction and protein crosslinking. Fish were reared for 31 days at 24 degrees C or 32 degrees C to create a contrast in gut fermentation and study its role in protein digestion. Feed and faeces were collected to determine the apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) of crude protein, lysine, Maillard reaction products (MRPs) as fructosyllysine, carboxymethyl-lysine and, carboxyethyl-lysine and crosslinked amino acids (CLAAs) as lanthionine and lysinoalanine. Surprisingly, the ADC of MRPs and CLAAs was similar to that of crude protein, indicating no effect of the Maillard reaction and protein crosslinking on protein digestibility. The gut microbiota composition was affected by water temperature and diet type but not by feed storage temperature, indicating the gut microbiota were not responsible for the high ADC of MRPs and CLAAs. However, positive correlations found between certain bacterial taxa and the ADC of MRPs might suggest involvement of gut microbiota in the digestion of heat-damaged proteins. This study shows that the effects of Maillard reaction and protein crosslinking on protein digestibility in fish deviates from the known effects in mammals.

AB  - Presently, there are an estimated 6.9 million wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in the U.S., which cause over US$1 billion in damage to agriculture, environmental impacts, and control costs. However, estimates of damage have varied widely, creating a need for standardized monitoring and a method to accurately estimate the economic costs of direct wild pig damage to agriculture. The goal of our study was to integrate remotely sensed imagery from drones and crop harvest data to quantify wild pig damage in corn fields. We used drones with natural color (red, green, blue) cameras to monitor corn fields at different growth stages in an agricultural matrix in Delta County, Texas, USA, during 2019-2020. We flew 36 drone missions and classified wild pig damage in 18 orthomosaics by a combination of manually digitizing and deep-learning algorithms. We compared estimates of damage from drone imagery to those derived from ground-based transect surveys, to verify pig damage. Finally, we compared damaged areas of fields to maps of collected real-time yields at harvest to estimate yield loss. All classified drone orthomosaics of pig damage had >80% overall accuracy for all growth stages. Ground transect surveys, which subsampled 2.6-4.1% of the field, were found to miss damage compared to the complete field coverage provided by drone imagery. Most damage occurred in latter growth stages, when corn ears were maturing, seed was most nutritious, and producers had already invested in the majority of annual crop inputs. Wild pigs damaged up to 9.2% of a single monitored field, which resulted in a mean loss of 3,416 kg of corn/ha and a direct cost to producers of US$17.18-48.24 per ha of damage. Drone imagery, when combined with spatially- explicit, harvest yield data, provides an accurate assessment of crop damage and yield loss due to wild pigs in the currency required for the cost-benefit evaluation of management actions.

AB  - Differences in the bacterial communities inhabiting mammalian gut microbiomes tend to reflect the phylogenetic relatedness of their hosts, a pattern dubbed phylosymbiosis. Although most research on this pattern has compared the gut microbiomes of host species across biomes, understanding the evolutionary and ecological processes that generate phylosymbiosis requires comparisons across phylogenetic scales and under similar ecological conditions. We analysed the gut microbiomes of 14 sympatric small mammal species in a semi-arid African savanna, hypothesizing that there would be a strong phylosymbiotic pattern associated with differences in their body sizes and diets. Consistent with phylosymbiosis, microbiome dissimilarity increased with phylogenetic distance among hosts, ranging from congeneric sets of mice and hares that did not differ significantly in microbiome composition to species from different taxonomic orders that had almost no gut bacteria in common. While phylosymbiosis was detected among just the 11 species of rodents, it was substantially weaker at this scale than in comparisons involving all 14 species together. In contrast, microbiome diversity and composition were generally more strongly correlated with body size, dietary breadth, and dietary overlap in comparisons restricted to rodents than in those including all lineages. The starkest divides in microbiome composition thus reflected the broad evolutionary divergence of hosts, regardless of body size or diet, while subtler microbiome differences reflected variation in ecologically important traits of closely related hosts. Strong phylosymbiotic patterns arose deep in the phylogeny, and ecological filters that promote functional differentiation of cooccurring host species may disrupt or obscure this pattern near the tips.

AB  - Moose (Alces alces L.) browsing in Gros Morne National Park has damaged its balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) dominated forest. A forest estate model was used to evaluate (i) the impacts of moose browsing and woodcutting on forest succession and (ii) strategies of forest restoration through planting and moose population management. The simulation results show that under current heavy browsing pressure growing stock of balsam fir decreases by 38%, but the area of spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP and P. glauca (Moench) Voss) increases by 32% over a 100-year planning horizon, compared to that under light browsing scenario which is assumed to be similar to the forest outside the Park due to moose population management. Annual allowable cut (AAC) for the Park's 19 400 ha domestic harvest area is estimated to be around 120 979 m(3) in a light browsing scenario, 21% higher than the sustainable harvest level in a heavy browsing scenario. The model forecasts a 97% reforestation of the Park's 7 194 ha disturbed area by planting in the heavy browsing scenario, leading to an increase in total forest growing stock by 22% and AAC by 12%. Integration of planting with moose population management could be a more efficient way of restoring forest under high browsing pressure in GMNP.

AB  - The globose scale (GS) Sphaerolecanium prunastri (Boyer de Fonscolombe) (Hemiptera: Coccidae) is a serious pest affecting plants within the Rosaceae, notably wild apricot, Armeniaca vulgaris (Lamarck). Following its initial detection in 2019, more than 80% of valleys with wild apricots have become affected in the Ili River Basin of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, China. This study assessed GS population dynamics post invasion and its effects on the growth and reproductive traits of wild apricot trees from 2019 to 2024. Nymph densities have decreased but remain high, with densities per 20 cm of shoots of 986 (1st-instar nymphs) and 120 (2nd-instar nymphs) in 2024, respectively. Damage has declined, with high damage rankings decreasing from 24% to 11% of wild apricot trees. However, the mortality of trees was higher (25%) in infested than non-infested areas (13%). Interestingly, GS feeding stimulated the growth of spring shoots but significantly reduced the reproductive capacity of wild apricots. Heavily infested trees exhibited increased shoot length (2-3 times), decreased fruit yield (20-fold), lower flowering percentage (8-fold), and reduced flower bud density (2-fold) compared to non-infested trees. Overall, despite a decrease in damage severity, wild apricot forests remain threatened by GS. Implementing integrated pest management (IPM) strategies is essential for effective GS management and the recovery of wild apricot forests.

AB  - Northern elephant seals Mirounga angustirostris were extirpated from California in the 19th century, and only in recent decades have they recolonized. A key demographic parameter underlying population viability is the survival of pups, from birth to weaning. We evaluated local factors acting directly on pup survival prior to weaning and basin-wide factors reflecting oceanic conditions which may impact maternal condition and behavior, using a 37 yr time series from 2 adjacent islands off central California: Southeast Farallon Island (SEFI) and West End Island (WEI). Mixed-effects logistic regression indicated that annual pup survival decreased with increasing frequency of extreme waves during January and February, which may inundate haulout locations when pups are present, and increased with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) index, reflecting increased primary productivity. Moreover, the impact of extreme waves was manifest only for WEI, which may reflect a greater risk of inundation compared to SEFI. Annual pup survival was most highly correlated with NPGO values during the 6 mo period preceding and including arrival and the pupping period (fall and winter). Our findings suggest that favorable foraging conditions for females during the 4 mo prior to hauling out led to better maternal condition, which improved pup survival. Impacts of storm surges on pup survival is of concern since the frequency and severity of storms is expected to increase in the future. To support population recovery, we recommend studies consider demographic parameters such as recruitment of females to the Farallon breeding population and to adjacent coastal California colonies.

AB  - Feral cattle (Bos taurus) live in socially stable herds. Due to farm management practices, intensively managed dairy cows experience frequent regrouping, which can disrupt affiliative bonds and induce social stress. This study examines how changes in herd composition affect milk yield and udder health traits in resident dairy cows exposed to the withdrawal of herd members or the introduction of new individuals. Milk yield, electrical conductivity, and blood presence in milk were measured in 798 cows using precision dairy sensors over 9 years. Milk yield decreased significantly (p < 0.001) one day after the removal of familiar herd members, while introducing cows had no effect. A higher number of cows being withdrawn (up to 10) was associated with reduced milk yield (p < 0.001), elevated milk electrical conductivity (p = 0.01), and an increased prevalence of blood presence in milk (p = 0.01), which can indicate potential udder health issues linked to social stress. Holstein Friesian, primiparous, and first-lactation-stage cows were more affected than Czech Simental and multiparous cows later in lactation. These findings underscore the influence of social stability on dairy cow welfare and productivity, emphasising the need for strategies to mitigate stress when herd changes are necessary.

AB  - Urbanization and habitat fragmentation can disrupt wildlife behavior and cause declines in biodiversity and ecosystem function. Most urban wildlife research has compared highly urbanized regions with rural areas. However, human development is also rapidly occurring in exurban areas, which consist of a matrix of lower-density housing and natural patches. Thus, although such "exurbanization" is intensifying, little research has examined how mammals respond to exurban development. To address this knowledge gap, we evaluated the activity of 12 species using 104 camera traps in exurban and rural areas across southeastern New Hampshire, USA, during summer 2021 and winter 2021-2. We quantified species' activity levels (overall portion of daily activity) and patterns (variation of diel activity period) to test hypotheses regarding how species' space requirements and nocturnality modulated their responses to exurban development. We found mixed support for our hypotheses. Two species with large space requirements (bobcats Lynx rufus and white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus) reduced activity levels in exurban areas, following hypothesized predictions, while other species (e.g., coyote Canis latrans) did not. As predicted, nocturnal species were less likely to shift activity patterns, but this varied across species and seasons. We also found evidence for a coupled predator-prey response among bobcats and lagomorphs in summer, with similarly altered activity in exurban areas. These results suggest that wildlife modify activity in response to exurban development with substantial species and season-specific variation within the mammal community, highlighting the complex ways wildlife adapt to urbanization and the potential consequences thereof for mammal communities.

AB  - Timely and accurate detection and estimation of animal abundance is an important part of wildlife management. This is particularly true for invasive species where cost-effective tools are needed to enable landscape-scale surveillance and management responses, especially when targeting low-density populations residing in dense vegetation and under canopies. This research focused on investigating the feasibility and practicality of using uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) and hyperspectral imagery (HSI) to classify animals in the wild on a spectral-rather than spatial-basis, in the hopes of developing methods to accurately classify animal targets even when their form may be significantly obscured. We collected HSI of four species of large mammals reported as invasive species on islands: cow (Bos taurus), horse (Equus caballus), deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and goat (Capra hircus) from a small UAS. Our objectives of this study were to (a) create a hyperspectral library of the four mammal species, (b) study the efficacy of HSI for animal classification by only using the spectral information via statistical separation, (c) study the efficacy of sequential and deep learning neural networks to classify the HSI pixels, (d) simulate five-band multispectral data from HSI and study its effectiveness for automated supervised classification, and (e) assess the ability of using HSI for invasive wildlife detection. Image classification models using sequential neural networks and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks were developed and tested. The results showed that the information from HSI derived using dimensionality reduction techniques were sufficient to classify the four species with class F1 scores all above 0.85. The performances of some classifiers were capable of reaching an overall accuracy over 98%and class F1 scores above 0.75, thus using only spectra to classify animals to species from existing sensors is feasible. This study discovered various challenges associated with the use of HSI for animal detection, particularly intra-class and seasonal variations in spectral reflectance and the practicalities of collecting and analyzing HSI data over large meaningful areas within an operational context. To make the use of spectral data a practical tool for wildlife and invasive animal management, further research into spectral profiles under a variety of real-world conditions, optimization of sensor spectra selection, and the development of on-board real-time analytics are needed.

AB  - Understanding mechanisms allowing plants to thrive in challenging conditions is critical for predicting their responses to global environmental change. An often overlooked ecological adaptation is marcescence, where leaves and stems are retained beyond their typical shedding time, with implications for nutrient recycling and carbon sequestration. Marcescence can be expected in plants with conservative resource-use strategies, especially in environments with limited resources and marked seasonality, such as deserts and alpine regions. However, the extent to which marcescence occurs in different taxa across different habitats and its relationship to seasonality and plant functioning as reflected in ecophysiological traits remains understudied. We studied 600 individuals across 40 Himalayan herb species found in desert, steppe, alpine and subnival habitats, spanning 3000-5400 m elevation. Marcescence was observed in 37 of the 40 species evaluated, with 57% of the sampled individuals displaying dead phytomass, indicating the widespread nature of this phenomenon in Himalayan ecosystems. Environment and plant traits emerged as significant factors influencing the amount of dead-standing biomass. These findings remained robust after accounting for intraspecific variation and phylogenetic inertia. Desert and steppe species exhibited greater marcescent biomass, characterized by 10-fold more dead stem biomass than alpine and subnival plants. In contrast, the proportion of dead phytomass increased with elevation due to increased dead leaf fraction. Taller desert species with heavily lignified stems and limited nitrogen and phosphorus content had high levels of stem marcescence, which not only may aid litter photodegradation and nutrient recycling but also deter herbivory and promote seed dispersal (tumbleweed). Conversely, slow-growing alpine and subnival plants with higher water-use efficiency, foliar C:N ratios and parenchymatic storage tissue rich in mobile carbohydrates had a high proportion of marcescent leaves, which may aid survival in these resource-limited environments by providing delayed nutrients through moisture-conserving mulch that also provides insulation and protection from frost. This study provides new insights into the complex interplay of habitat, seasonality and plant traits in dead phytomass retention in Himalayan plants. Marcescence is prevalent in resource-conservative species in highly seasonal, resource-limited habitats and may significantly shape the functioning and biodiversity of Himalayan ecosystems.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Saltmarsh, a prominent buffer ecosystem, has been identified as an important sink for nitrogen (N) pollutants from marine- and land-based anthropogenic activities. However, how the enriched anthropogenic N impacts saltmarsh sustainability has been neglected due to limited understanding of marsh resilience based on seedling establishment and population dispersal under anthropogenic N inputs. This study combined mesocosm experiments and model simulations to quantify the effects of increased anthropogenic N on the seedling-based vegetation expansion of Spartina alterniflora. The results indicated that seedling survivals, growth rates, and morphological indicators were inhibited by 20.08 %, 37.14 %, and > 35.56 %, respectively, under 1.5 gN/kg anthropogenic N. The sensitivity rate of vegetation expansion was increased by 70 % with 1 gN/kg increased N concentration under the scenario of low seedling density (< 15 m/yr). These findings revealed an important unidentified weakness of the marsh development process to anthropogenic N inputs. Finally, we highlighted the importance of appropriate protection measures to control nutrient pollution in salt marshes. Our study provides new insights for enhancing the resilience and sustainability of saltmarsh ecosystems.

AB  - Gigantism results when one lineage within a clade evolves extremely large body size relative to its small-bodied ancestors, a common phenomenon in animals. Theory predicts that the evolution of giants should be constrained by two tradeoffs. First, because body size is negatively correlated with population size, purifying selection is expected to be less efficient in species of large body size, leading to increased mutational load. Second, gigantism is achieved through generating a higher number of cells along with higher rates of cell proliferation, thus increasing the likelihood of cancer. To explore the genetic basis of gigantism in rodents and uncover genomic signatures of gigantism-related tradeoffs, we assembled a draft genome of the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), the world's largest living rodent. We found that the genome-wide ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations (omega) is elevated in the capybara relative to other rodents, likely caused by a generation-time effect and consistent with a nearly neutral model of molecular evolution. A genome-wide scan for adaptive protein evolution in the capybara highlighted several genes controlling postnatal bone growth regulation and musculoskeletal development, which are relevant to anatomical and developmental modifications for an increase in overall body size. Capybara-specific gene-family expansions included a putative novel anticancer adaptation that involves T-cell-mediated tumor suppression, offering a potential resolution to the increased cancer risk in this lineage. Our comparative genomic results uncovered the signature of an intragenomic conflict where the evolution of gigantism in the capybara involved selection on genes and pathways that are directly linked to cancer.

AB  - Phenolic compounds, abundant secondary metabolites in plants, profoundly influence soil ecosystems, plant growth, and interactions with herbivores. In this study, we explore the intricate relationships between phenolics, soil microbes, and gall formation in Ageratina adenophora ( A. adenophora ), an invasive plant species in China known for its allelopathic traits. Using metabolomic and microbial profiling, significant differences in soil microbial composition and metabolite profiles were observed between bulk and rhizosphere soil samples. Phenolics influenced bacterial communities, with distinct microbial populations enriched in each soil type. Additionally, phenolics impacted soil metabolic processes, with variations observed in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis between different soil treatments. Analysis of phenolic content in plant and soil samples revealed considerable variations, with higher concentrations observed in certain plant tissues and soil types. Bioactive phenols extracted from plant and soil samples were identified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC -MS), providing insights into the diverse chemical composition of these compounds. Furthermore, the effects of phenolics on plant growth and gall formation were investigated. Phenols exhibited both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on plant growth, with optimal concentrations promoting emergence but higher concentrations hindering growth. Gall formation was influenced by phenolic concentrations, leading to structural alterations in stem tissue and gall morphology. Histochemical analysis revealed starch and lipid accumulation in gall tissues, indicating metabolic changes induced by phenolics. The presence of phenolics disrupted tissue structures and influenced vascular bundle orientation in gall tissues. Overall, our study highlights the multifaceted roles of phenolic compounds in soil ecosystems, plant development, and gall formation, facilitating the utilization of secondary metabolites in agriculture.

AB  - We hypothesized that cyclopoids, being predators, have a stronger allelopathic influence than calanoids on life-history variables of herbivorous rotifers. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the allelopathic effects of conditioned medium obtained separately from males and females of a calanoid (Arctodiaptomus dorsalis) and a cyclopoid (Mesocyclops longisetus) on the life table demography of the rotifer Brachionus havanaensis. The conditioned medium of the male and female A. dorsalis and male M. longisetus caused a significant reduction (14-18%) in the life expectancy at birth of B. havanaensis. Gross and net reproductive rates of rotifers reduced significantly on the conditioned medium of male or female A. dorsalis; however, the conditioned medium from either sex of M. longisetus had no significant effect on these variables. The population growth rate, r, varied from 0.53 to 0.64 d(-1) depending on the treatment; the r was significantly lower when cultured on the conditioned medium from A. dorsalis (males or females) and female M. longisetus Contrary to our hypothesis, calanoid allelochemicals adversely affected the life history variables of rotifers more than those produced by the cyclopoids.

AB  - The increasing availability of satellite imagery has supported a rapid expansion in forward-looking studies seeking to track and predict how climate change will influence wild population dynamics. However, these data can also be used in retrospect to provide additional context for historical data in the absence of contemporaneous environmental measurements. We used 167 Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images spanning 13 years to identify environmental drivers of fitness and population size in a well-characterized population of banner-tailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis) in the southwestern United States. We found evidence of two decoupled processes that may be driving population dynamics in opposing directions over distinct time frames. Specifically, increasing mean surface temperature corresponded to increased individual fitness, where fitness is defined as the number of offspring produced by a single individual. This result contrasts with our findings for population size, where increasing surface temperature led to decreased numbers of active mounds. These relationships between surface temperature and (i) individual fitness and (ii) population size would not have been identified in the absence of remotely sensed data, indicating that such information can be used to test existing hypotheses and generate new ecological predictions regarding fitness at multiple spatial scales and degrees of sampling effort. To our knowledge, this study is the first to directly link remotely sensed environmental data to individual fitness in a nearly exhaustively sampled population, opening a new avenue for incorporating remote sensing data into eco-evolutionary studies.

AB  - Home range is the spatial evolutionary arena where an individual can succeed or fail. Its size reflects the balance between individual energy requirements and acquisitions. Since various behavioural traits can affect individual energy demand, we investigated how these traits affect individual space-use behavior and resulting home range size of aquatic organisms. We compiled data for 172 freshwater and marine species, ranging from invertebrates to marine mammals, spanning 8 orders of magnitude in body size and 13 in home range size. Across all taxa, home range size scaled allometrically with body size (R2 = 0.78, exponent = 1.68 +/- 0.07). Behavioural traits explained an additional 27.15% of the variance beyond that explained by body size alone. In particular, carnivorous and pelagic species exhibited significantly larger home ranges than herbivorous and benthic ones, whereas migration and sociality were not retained as significant predictors beyond body size, despite migration affecting the intercept of the scaling relationship. We show that while body size is a strong predictor of home range, behavioural categories significantly modulate the allometric relationship. Our findings provide new insights into the behavioural constraints shaping spatial ecology in aquatic environments. These results underscore the role of energy-demanding behaviours in shaping spatial ecology, with implications for individual density, the intensity of intra-specific interactions, and patterns of interspecific coexistence.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of the significant greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Different land use patterns are the sink or source of N2O, which plays a vigorous role in controlling N2O emissions. Yet, how different land use patterns affect soil N2O emissions in the Loess Plateau of Central Gansu is still not clear. Therefore; in order to fill this gap, six different land use patterns, including Picea asperata (PA), Hippophae rhamnoides (HR), Medicago sativa (MS), No-tillage wheat field (NT) and Conventional tillage wheat field (T) were studied. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of different land use patterns on soil properties and N2O emission flux. Our results showed that compared with other treatments, Picea asperata woodland increased the soil bulk density, organic matter and soil water content, total nitrogen accumulation and microbial biomass nitrogen whilst reduced the soil pH. The wheat field is more favorable to accumulating soil nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen. Moreover, soil N2O emission rates followed the trend of T>NT>HR>GL>MS>PA. In addition, soil physicochemical properties were closely related to N2O emission flux and soil temperature was the most significant factor affecting N2O emission. General, Picea asperata woodland could significantly increased soil nutrient and reduce N2O emissions. We suggest that more forest land should be selected as the optimal site for nitrogen fixation and emission reduction for sustainable development of the terrestrial ecosystem on the Loess Plateau in Central Gansu.

AB  - Few concurrent studies exist of sympatric gray wolf (Canis lupus) and coyote (C. latrans) harvest at far northern latitudes. Moreover, no studies explicitly examine effects of concurrent harvest on phenotypes of wolves and coyotes. We documented changes in sex and age characteristics and morphology of gray wolves and coyotes harvested by hunters near Ptarmigan Lake, east-central Alaska, USA, between 1998 and 2001. We hypothesized that the harvest would result in larger, heavier canids, reduce densities, and increase young to adult ratios in both wolves and coyotes. We generated von Bertalanffy growth curves indicating that wolves and coyotes of both sexes increased in length or weight until 2 or 3 years old. No significant changes in either mean length or weight or length to weight ratios occurred during the 3-year study, except that coyote mean length was longer over the last winter of study. Catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) for wolves ranged from 0.061 to 0.112 killed/day and for coyotes from 0.552 to 0.11 killed/day over the study. CPUE indicated that coyotes but not wolves declined in abundance. Changes in male to female and young to adult ratios did not differ significantly for either canid. We posit that coyote populations were disproportionately affected by the conflation of the severe Arctic environment and sustained harvest. Our findings will be beneficial for managing sympatric canid populations and for understanding demographic responses to density-dependent processes in wolves and coyotes, especially at far northern latitudes.

AB  - The monitoring of animal weight gain is expensive as it often involves the rounding up of animals over large areas and long distances. Such monitoring is an arduous process that causes stress related health problems and weight loss in animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of remotely sensed vegetation indices for modelling sheep weight gain in semi-arid rangelands. The temporal and spatial patterns of grazing were investigated using Sentinel-2 imagery, collar data obtained from a global position system (GPS), and data of sheep weight related to grazing hotspots. Historical animal weight data were compared statistically with nine commonly used spectral indices extracted from Sentinel-2 imagery to determine how vegetation conditions relate to sheep weight gain. Sheep appeared to adapt their grazing behaviour according to time of the year, with the average distance walked per sheep per day in line with previous studies. In contrast to distance walked, sheep at lower stocking densities used less grazing area than at higher densities. The normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) proved to best model liveweight changes. By combining remote sensing (RS) and GPS data, our understanding of sheep grazing patterns and sheep weight gain was improved. This can lead to the optimisation of production potential through precision farming. The finding has applications for studies conducted on non-reproductive sheep in semi-arid Karoo rangeland systems of South Africa. Because the model is both cost-effective and replicable, it offers a long-term monitoring template for livestock studies elsewhere.

AB  - Plants adapted to different habitats exhibit differences in functional traits and these characteristics are influenced by soil properties. We tested the hypothesis that soil resource availability influences the functional traits of plants, affecting therefore herbivory levels. We examined three Byrsonima plant species with different life forms that occurred across a distinct edaphic habitat along the Doce River Basin, South-eastern Brazil. We characterized habitats according to soil nutrient concentration and measured functional characteristics of crown architecture, leaf nutrients, sclerophylly, leaf area and leaf density. In addition, we evaluated how these variables influenced herbivory levels of congeneric plants. Our data show that species along a gradient of soil nutrients have functional characteristics influenced by habitat, which in turn affect herbivory levels. By comparing congeners with different life forms found along a stress-gradient of continuous habitats, we describe a corresponding gradient of plant functional traits and tissue consumption by herbivorous insects.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the morphological characteristics of fruits and seeds from Diptychocarpus strictus, a plant species inhabiting the cold desert pastoral area of China. Furthermore, this study sought to evaluate the germination potential of these seeds following digestion by sheep. This study employed the sheep rumen fistula method to simulate rumen digestion at various time intervals. Subsequently, an in vitro simulation method was utilized to simulate true gastric and intestinal digestion after rumen digestion. Paper germination tests were then conducted to assess the impact of the digestive process on the heteromorphic seed morphology and germination. During rumen digestion, the seeds were protected by wide wings. The results revealed a highly significant negative correlation (p < 0.01) between seed wing length and digestion time. Post-rumen digestion, variations in the germination rate among seeds from fruits at different locations were observed. Indicators, such as germination rate, exhibited a highly significant negative correlation with rumen digestion time (p < 0.01). In vitro simulated digestion tests demonstrated that Diptychocarpus strictus seeds retained their ability to germinate even after complete digestion within the livestock's digestive tract. The polymorphic nature of Diptychocarpus strictus seeds, coupled with their capacity to survive and germinate through the digestive tract, facilitates the spread of these seeds. This finding has implications for mitigating desert grassland degradation and promoting sustainable ecological development.

AB  - The Yushu yak is one of China's distinctive yak breeds, primarily distributed in the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province and its surrounding areas. Yushu yaks are not only economically and culturally significant but also play a crucial role in protecting the ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and promoting sustainable development. However, there are no clear records regarding the ancestry, population structure, and unique traits of Yushu yaks. Therefore, this study conducted an analysis of genetic diversity, population structure, and selection signals in Yushu yak populations, aiming to provide references for the conservation and utilization of the breed genetic resources. The results of the analysis showed that the Yushu yak population has high genetic diversity and low inbreeding coefficients, indicating a stable genetic structure. Population structure analysis revealed that the Yushu yak lineage is unique, with limited gene flow between domestic and wild yaks. Functional enrichment analysis of positively selected genes in Yushu yaks indicated prominent selection features related to growth and development as well as energy metabolism. Additionally, we classified the Yushu yak breeding bulls into family lineages based on kinship, which is essential for improving the efficiency of utilizing genetic resources and scientifically managing the population.

AB  - To clarify the response mechanisms of soil nematodes as bioindicators of ecosystem health to precipitation variations in loess hilly forests, this study investigated soil nematodes in pure Populus hopeiensis forests across different precipitation gradients in Wuqi County. Through soil physicochemical analysis and high-throughput sequencing of soil nematodes, we analyzed the characteristics of soil nematode communities and their responses to precipitation variation. The results demonstrated the following: (1) Dominant genera and trophic groups of soil nematodes were significantly influenced by precipitation, with Acrobeloides prevailing across all gradients while Paratylenchus reached maximum abundance (26.8%) in moderate precipitation zones. (2) Bacterivorous nematodes prevailed in both low- and high-precipitation zones, while herbivorous nematodes constituted the highest proportion in moderate precipitation zones. The abundances of herbivorous and fungivorous nematodes exhibited an initial increase followed by a decrease with rising precipitation, whereas predatory-omnivorous nematodes displayed the opposite trend. (3) The Chao1 and Shannon indices of soil nematodes initially increased and then decreased with increasing precipitation, reaching a peak in the Jinfoping site. Moreover, there were significant differences in nematode community structure among different precipitation gradients. (4) Redundancy analysis and PLS-PM modeling identified soil water content (SWC), total nitrogen (TN), and capillary water holding capacity (CWHC) as key drivers of nematode communities. Precipitation indirectly regulated nematode functionality by modifying soil physicochemical properties and microbial activity. (5) Ecological function analysis revealed bacterial-dominated organic matter decomposition (Nematode Channel Ratio, NCR > 0.75) in the Changcheng and Baibao sites, contrasting with fungal channel predominance (NCR < 0.75) in Jinfoping. This research elucidates the mechanism whereby precipitation drives nematode community divergence through regulating soil physicochemical properties and microbial activity. The findings provide scientific basis for soil biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration benefit assessment in regional ecological restoration projects, and soil health management and sustainable land use in agricultural ecosystems.

AB  - Direct and indirect ecological interactions, environmental factors, and the phenology of host plants can shape the way mites interact. These relationships interfere with species occurrence and consequently alter the structure and stability of the intraplant community. As predatory mites act as regulators of herbivorous mites, we hypothesized that these mites may occupy a central position in a network of interactions among mite species associated with mango trees, and the occurrence of these species is mediated by environmental variables and the phenological stage of the host plant. We evaluated the global structure of the interaction network of mites associated with individual Mangifera indica plants and analyzed the interspecific relationships of the species using an undirected Bayesian network approach. Additionally, we observed a correlation between mite population density and plant phenological stage. Environmental variables, such as average monthly temperature, monthly precipitation, and average monthly relative humidity at different sampling date were used in the correlation analysis. The modularity at the mite-plant network level showed a low specialization index H-2 = 0.073 (generalist) and high robustness (R = 0.93). Network analysis revealed that Amblyseius largoensis, Bdella ueckermanni, Parapronematus acaciae, and Tuckerella ornata occupied central positions in the assembly of mites occurring on mango trees. Environmental variables, average monthly temperature, and monthly precipitation were correlated with the occurrence of Brachytydeus formosa, Cisaberoptus kenyae, Oligonychus punicae, T. ornata, and Vilaia pamithus. We also observed a correlation between the plant phenological stage and population densities of Neoseiulus houstoni, O. punicae, P. acaciae, and V. pamithus.

AB  - Predicting the likelihood of wildlife presence at potential wildlife-livestock interfaces is challenging. These interfaces are usually relatively small geographical areas where landscapes show large variation over small distances. Models of wildlife distribution based on coarse data over wide geographical ranges may not be representative of these interfaces. High-resolution data can help identify fine-scale predictors of wildlife habitat use at a local scale and provide more accurate predictions of species habitat use. These data may be used to inform knowledge of interface risks, such as disease transmission between wildlife and livestock, or human-wildlife conflict. This study uses fine-scale habitat use data from wild boar (Sus scrofa) based on activity signs and direct field observations in and around the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, England. Spatial logistic regression models fitted using a variant of penalized quasi-likelihood were used to identify habitat-based and anthropogenic predictors of wild boar signs. Our models showed that within the Forest of Dean, wild boar signs were more likely to be seen in spring, in forest-type habitats, closer to the center of the forest and near litter bins. In the area surrounding the Forest of Dean, wild boar signs were more likely to be seen in forest-type habitats and near recreational parks and less likely to be seen near livestock. This approach shows that wild boar habitat use can be predicted using fine-scale data over comparatively small areas and in human-dominated landscapes, while taking account of the spatial correlation from other nearby fine-scale data-points. The methods we use could be applied to map habitat use of other wildlife species in similar landscapes, or of movement-restricted, isolated, or fragmented wildlife populations.

AB  - Population management of herbivores is widely applied to decrease damage to forests in the northern hemisphere. Culling more antlerless deer, including females and fawns, is an effective means of reducing the population and helps to improve management efficiency. To increase the efficiency of antlerless-biased culling, we assessed the spatiotemporal distribution of the antlerless ratio in culled sika deer (Cervus nippon) in relation to population density. We hypothesized that the antlerless ratio is higher at the center of the distribution than at the margins of the deer's range, because dispersal processes differ according to sex and age: Young male deer first disperse into an unoccupied area, and then males may become established in the new area for approximately 10-15 years before the number of females increases. A statistical model revealed spatiotemporal changes in the antlerless ratio of culled sika deer. The change in the ratio basically fit the density distribution of the deer, which was estimated independently on the basis of fecal pellet count surveys. The antlerless ratio estimated from the model increased asymptotically as deer density rose. The results support our hypothesis and suggest that antlerless sika deer will be more easily culled at the center rather than at the margins of the distribution range. These findings should help to increase the efficiency of managing the deer via antlerless-biased culling.

AB  - The monitors have recently been defined as the organisms in which changes in known characteristics can be measured to assess the extent of the environmental contamination. Among numerous game species, wild boar as an omnivore is characterized as an exceptionally good biomonitor. The concentrations of one heavy metal (Hg) and one metalloid (As) were measured using cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometer and atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the liver tissue of free-living wild boars. From 11 hunting areas that cover the whole territory of North Macedonia in a period of 7 years (2016-2022) a total of 608 wild boar liver samples were harvested during the regular hunting season. The mean concentration of Hg from 11 hunting grounds ranged from 12.7 mu g/kg to 68.8 mu g/kg, and mean concentration for all was 45.67 mu g/kg. The average concentration of arsenic ranged from 22 mu g/kg to 55.3 mu g/kg, and mean concentration for all was 33.1 mu g/kg. For mercury, 6.56% or 40 of the total number of samples (608) exceeded the maximum allowed limits, and for arsenic none of the examined samples exceeded the allowed limit. For both elements, a statistically significant difference was determined in relation to the years, with irregular oscillations from year to year. The mean values for mercury and arsenic are encouraging and generally indicate the relatively low contamination in the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia. However, the statistical differences due to the year as a factor suggest there is a need for further research.

AB  - Landscape composition affects the performance and pest status of insect herbivores in farmland, though these interactions are mediated by population-level processes and agroecological context. These context-dependent responses contribute to the variability of pest reactions to landscape composition across studies, which arise from a complex set of biotic or abiotic factors that are poorly understood. Here, we provide a systematic literature review on the key determinants of context-specificity and a hierarchical meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the organismal and habitat-related determinants of pest pressure in agricultural landscapes globally. We discussed the potential effects ofpest species traits, population processes, habitat quality, and the spatiotemporal scale of research influence pest responses to landscape composition in landscape-level studies. The hierarchical meta-analysis of 227 effect sizes from 70 studies for 58 herbivorous pests showed that pest success in crop fields is greatly affected by feeding mode, the exact stage of its population dynamic and crop habitat quality. In general, landscapes with more semi-natural habitats tend to enhance the colonization level of specialist pests, while more crops land increase season-long population density of the generalist. Large areas of low-quality crop habitats within the landscape reduce pest abundance and these effects are clearer for season-long population density. By accounting for these parameters, landscape-level processes can be harnessed to strengthen the ecological regulation of pests and thereby advance the ecological intensification of agriculture.

AB  - There are rich and vast genetic resources of indigenous pig breeds in the world. Currently, great attention is paid to either crossbreeding or conservation of these indigenous pig breeds, and insufficient attention is paid to the combination of conservation and breeding along with their long-term effects on genetic diversity. Therefore, the objective of this study is to compare the long-term effects of using conventional conservation and optimal contribution selection methods on genetic diversity and genetic gain. A total of 11 different methods including conventional conservation and optimal contribution selection methods were investigated using stochastic simulations. The long-term effects of using these methods were evaluated in terms of genetic diversity metrices such as expected heterozygosity (He) and the rate of genetic gain. The results indicated that the rates of true inbreeding in these conventional conservation methods were maintained at around 0.01. The optimal contribution selection methods based either on the pedigree (POCS) or genome (GOCS) information showed more genetic gain than conventional methods, and POCS achieved the largest genetic gain. Furthermore, the effect of using GOCS methods on most of the genetic diversity metrics was slightly better than the conventional conservation methods when the rate of true inbreeding was the same, but this also required more sires used in OCS methods. According to the rate of true inbreeding, there was no significant difference among these conventional methods. In conclusion, there is no significant difference in different ways of selecting sows on inbreeding when we use different conventional conservation methods. Compared with conventional methods, POCS method could achieve the most genetic gain. However, GOCS methods can not only achieve higher genetic gain, but also maintain a relatively high level of genetic diversity. Therefore, GOCS is a better choice if we want to combine conservation and breeding in actual production in the conservation farms.

AB  - Ticks and tick-borne diseases are on the rise across the world. The reasons are multifactorial but all associated with human practices, notably climate modifications and socio-economic and ecosystem changes. In the northern hemisphere, Lyme borreliosis and its vector, the tick belonging to the Ixodes ricinus complex, are particularly studied. Changes in silviculture and the expansion of certain wild ungulates since the Second World War could explain the increasing presence of the tick in our environment. As this tick is capable of transmitting other potentially pathogenic microorganisms to humans, an integrated multidisciplinary approach to identify human practices that favor its expansion is essential in order to control the (re)-emergence of infectious diseases. Other ticks benefit from the same anthropized context to increase their numbers in the environment.

AB  - The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is the only sea turtle species to reside year-round in New Zealand waters, with juveniles using shallow coastal habitats as foraging grounds before dispersing throughout the Pacific. Rangaunu Harbour in northern New Zealand was surveyed in the austral summer to assess the feasibility of aerial drones for monitoring green turtles. Across 163 km of drone transects, 27 turtle sightings representing potentially 18 unique individuals were recorded, predominantly in shallow seagrass (Zostera muelleri novozelandica) habitats during high tides. Five green turtles were observed actively foraging on floating seagrass and among the subtidal seagrass beds. These sightings provide visual confirmation that the harbour is a temperate neritic foraging ground for green turtles in New Zealand. The survey also documented diverse marine fauna, including eagle rays (Myliobatis tenuicaudatus), stingrays (Bathytoshia spp.), and several teleost species, confirming the feasibility of drones as a monitoring tool for turtles and other marine megafauna. Anthropogenic pressure to estuaries and coastal New Zealand ecosystems, including Rangaunu Harbour, highlight the need to identify and protect critical green turtle habitat in New Zealand waters as soon as possible. Further drone surveys in nearby harbours are feasible and recommended to locate additional foraging areas for green turtles across northern New Zealand.

TI  - Comparing survival and cause-specific mortality of different translocation release methods for desert bighorn sheep

AB  - Historically, desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) were prevalent throughout the Trans -Pecos region of Texas. However, they were extirpated by the 1960s due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, predation, and disease transmission from livestock. Restoration efforts have been successfully conducted by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to increase population numbers of resident (i.e., animals that currently populate a region of inter-est) desert bighorn sheep at Black Gap Wildlife Management Area (BGWMA) through the use of translocations. Because there is a lack of knowledge on alternative release methods for large mammal translocations, our goals were to monitor cause-specific mortality and postrelease survival of desert bighorn sheep translocated during 2017. Survival estimates of desert bighorn sheep were compared amongst resident, hard-released, and soft-released individuals throughout the study. In winter 2017-2018, we radio-collared and released 30 resident (8 M, 22 F) and 70 within-state-translocated (36 M, 34 F) desert bighorn to BGWMA. Of the 70 translocated individuals, 28 (12 M, 16 F) were hard released (i.e., released immediately onto the landscape) and 42 (24 M, 18 F) were soft released (i.e., released into an enclosure before onto the landscape). Resident desert bighorn had the highest probability of survival over time (S = 0.83), followed by hard-released (S = 0.67) and then soft-released (S = 0.54) individuals. To date, 26 mortalities (13 M, 13 F) were recorded. Of those mortalities, 4 were residents (15%), 6 were hard released (23%), and 16 were soft released (62%). The soft release is thought to be a better strategy for translocating large mammals; however, in this study, it did not improve survival. Survival is potentially influenced by acclimation time and individual exit strategy from the soft-release pen, which should be managed for future restoration efforts. Incorporating a flushing-method exit strategy would aid in removing soft-released individuals from the high-fenced pen simultaneously and may increase survival estimates. This could potentially allow individuals to form larger groups when exiting the enclosure and entering the new habitat. The soft-release method is also more costly to implement, which could be challenging for wildlife managers.

AB  - Colonization of a new environment may trigger an evolutionary radiation, defined as an accelerated accumulation of species in a short period of time. However, how often colonization events trigger such radiations is still an open question. We studied the worldwide dispersal of Caninae to investigate whether the invasion of new continents resulted in elevated species diversification. We used a combination of ancestral range estimation and phylogenetic analyses to estimate the ancestral ranges of 56 extant and extinct species of Caninae, as well as variation in speciation and extinction rates through time and across clades. Our findings indicate that canids experienced an evolutionary radiation event when lineages were able to reach Eurasia and South America around 11 million years ago. A large number of species arising in a short period of time suggests that canids experienced ecological opportunity events within the new areas, implying that the differences in the ecological settings between continents, and size variation among Canidae and other carnivores may be responsible for the variation in clade dynamics. We suggest that the increase of grasslands and the new herbivorous fauna that came with it were the major forces responsible for the diversification of wolves in North America, while empty niches and the absence of competitors can explain the success of canids in Africa and South America. Interaction with other carnivores probably also affected the diversification dynamics of canids.

AB  - Societal Impact StatementWith increasing demand for sustainable goods, botanical dyes are of increasing interest and value to consumers, industry and small-scale artisanal producers. Goldenrod is a widely used dye plant with a long history of traditional use. The impact of the well-studied goldenrod stem gall produced by Eurosta solidaginis on goldenrod botanical dyes-and the broader impact of insect herbivory on plant dyes-has not been explored. Our research provides an initial investigation into how dye strength and colour are affected by the complex gall-maker-host-plant relationship-an essential step in understanding the value insect herbivory may bring to botanical dye production, as well as potential limitations of this dye variation in larger scale production.Summary Goldenrod (Solidago spp.) plants produce botanical dyes with a long history of traditional use. The concentration and profile of phenolic compounds in goldenrod, influenced by biotic and abiotic factors, impact the properties of the resulting dyes. We investigated whether the presence of the stem-galling insect E. solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae) affected dye produced from goldenrod. Leaves collected from upper and lower stem sections of galled and non-galled goldenrod plants were processed to extract dye compounds into a soluble form. The dye was analysed through colourimetric comparison of dyed fabric swatches and spectrophotometry of aqueous extracts to evaluate phenolic content. Through colourimetric analysis using a paired t-test, we found that the colour difference between upper and lower leaves was significantly affected by whether the plant was galled (t[6] = -2.80, p = 0.02). Comparing dyes made from lower versus the upper leaves of the same plants showed a larger colourimetric difference in non-galled than galled plants. This indicates that the galling insect affected the availability of dye compounds. Spectrophotometric analysis showed that increases in total phenolics between lower and upper leaves of galled plants were not significantly greater than in non-galled plants (p = 0.103), indicating a possible response to insect herbivory. The differing effects of the gall on dye content and total phenolics illustrate the complexity of plant-herbivore interactions and provide insight into the influence of biotic factors on botanical dyes.

AB  - Simple Summary Grazing/browsing goats ingest a diverse diet selected from the forage resources available in the range/paddock intending to meet their nutritional requirements. Intake and selection of any given forage can be modified by several factors, such as its nutrient content, including secondary compounds, as well as its biomass availability in the environment. The animal's previous browsing experience can also be an important factor driving intake and selection. Therefore, the present study evaluated all these factors as well as their interaction. The results showed that the goats' browsing experience guided the selection and intake towards those forage resources of better nutritional quality when there was no restriction in forage supply, as is the case for cafeteria trials. Goats with browsing experience showed their ability to limit secondary compounds and optimize their selection and intake for plants with better digestibility. This cafeteria protocol made it possible to identify the selection and consumption pattern of plant species with limited availability in the natural vegetation. This methodology could help identifying the forage resources that may be useful for small ruminant feeding, versus those resources that are not consumed by goats despite having a suitable chemical composition and in vitro digestibility or a high abundance. We evaluated the effect of browsing experience, nutritional quality and secondary compounds of forage resources, and the interaction between these factors on the selection and intake of goats in a cafeteria trial. Twelve juvenile Criollo goats from 7 to 9 months of age, weighing 22 +/- 3 kg, were divided into two groups: (a) browser goats group (n = 6, BG), and (b) naive goats group (n = 6, NG), formed according to their previous browsing experience (with and without, respectively). Animals were housed in individual pens. The cafeteria experiment lasted 21 days considering pen adaptation, foliage adaptation, and measurements, which included the selection index (SI) of experimental forage resources (Chesson's alpha) and their dry matter intake (DMI/Kg(0.75)), using a multiple Latin square design. Furthermore, correlation and regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between the aforementioned factors. The NG did not show any selection pattern, while the BG selected Piscidia piscipula and Senegalia gaumeri (p = 0.0002). The BG consumed smaller amounts of secondary compounds compared to NG (p = 0.0001). In the BG, the flavonoids affected negatively their selection (R-2 = 97.51, p = 0.0001), while the DMI was affected by in vitro DM digestibility and flavonoids (R-2 = 99.85; p = 0.0001). For the NG, the crude protein and organic matter contents were associated with DMI, but none had a significant relationship with SI. The BG selected and consumed forages with suitable nutritional quality avoiding those with high content of secondary compounds such as flavonoids. Conversely, NG did not show a clear pattern for their selection or intake.

AB  - Common hunting practices in Germany include stand hunts and driven hunts. Unlike stand hunts, driven hunts involve setting game in motion. This could potentially induce stress in animals and consequently affect meat quality. In order to evaluate the potential impact of the "driven hunt" method on certain standard-relevant meat quality parameters, 150 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), 57 wild boar (Sus scrofa) and 20 red deer (Cervus elaphus) tongues from areas in East Westphalia, North and East Hesse were examined using a new standardised method. A particular advantage of this study is the use of tongue tissue (m. lingualis proprius) as sample material. Tongues are usually discarded, leaving muscle parts preferred for consumption intact. To verify results, tongue and shoulder (m. biceps brachii) muscle samples from ten roe deer per hunting method were directly compared. The method evaluated sensory parameters such as meat texture, colour, cooking juice loss and drip loss. Chemical analyses included pH values as an indicator of meat maturation, as well as D-glucose content to assess individual stress levels. All parameters consistently indicated high quality of game meat, which was measured in both shoulder and tongue muscles, regardless of hunting method. The particularly low amount of elevated stress values measured shows that hunting can be a gentle method of acquiring meat. This highlights the strict adherence to ethical hunting practices and hygiene standards in Germany, ensuring production of a premium product.

AB  - China's hog production is facing the dual pressures of the market and environment. A systematic analysis of the ecological efficiency (eco-efficiency) of hog cultivation is of great significance for the development of sustainability and distribution optimization in the industry. This paper investigates the eco-efficiency of hog production and the determinants of eco-efficiency in China using panel data (2004-2018). An optimal super efficiency slacks-based measure (SBM)-Malmquist-Tobit model is adopted for hog production analysis, and the empirical results show a great variation in eco-efficiency across provinces, ranging from 0.557 to 1.19 with a mean value of 0.937 in 2018. The predominant production area of hogs is found being transferred from north to south, with small- and medium-scale predominant production areas shifted from East China to Southwest China, and large-scale predominant production areas shifted from North China to South Central China. Another finding is that eco-efficiency increased by the improvement of technical efficiency. In addition, the Tobit regression results show that rural economic development, the government's investment in environmental control, the market advantage index, and transportation conditions had positive effects on the eco-efficiency; meanwhile, the forbidden policy for livestock cultivation in certain areas, the structure of the hog breeding industry, the density of slaughtered fattened hogs, and the prices of hogs had negative effects on the eco-efficiency.

AB  - Direct application of pig slurry to agricultural land, as a means of nutrient recycling, introduces pathogens, antibiotic resistant bacteria, or genes, to the environment. With global environmental sustainability policies mandating a reduction in synthetic fertilisation and a commitment to a circular economy it is imperative to find effective on-farm treatments of slurry that maximises its fertilisation value and minimises risk to health and the environment. We assessed and compared the effect of storage, composting, and anaerobic digestion (AD) on pig slurry microbiome, resistome and nutrient content. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and HT-qPCR arrays were implemented to understand the dynamics across the treatments. Our results identified that each treatment methods have advantages and disadvantages in removal pollutants or increasing nutrients. The data suggests that storage and composting are optimal for the removal of human pathogens and anaerobic digestion for the reduction in antibiotic resistance (AMR) genes and mobile genetic elements. The nitrogen content is increased in storage and AD, while reduced in composting. Thus, depending on the requirement for increased or reduced nitrogen the optimum treatment varies. Combining the results indicates that composting provides the greatest gain by reducing risk to human health and the environment. Network analysis revealed reducing Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes while increasing Firmicutes will reduce the AMR content. KEGG analysis identified no significant change in the pathways across all treatments. This novel study provides a data driven decision tree to determine the optimal treatment for best practice to minimise pathogen, AMR and excess or increasing nutrient transfer from slurry to environment.

AB  - The germination index (GI) is the best index for evaluating compost phytotoxicity and maturity. In order to improve GI and reduce phytotoxicity of chicken manure compost, superphosphate, biochar, and a microbial inoculum were added in this study. Maturity indices (pH, electrical conductivity, and GI), water-soluble ion, organic matter, humic acid, humic precursor contents, and the bacteria community were analyzed during the experiment. NH4+, volatile fatty acids, and humic acid strongly affected the GI, which increased as the humic acid content increased and the volatile fatty acid and NH4+ contents decreased. The three additives affected compost maturity differently. Adding biochar decreased microbial diversity and complexity, but improved the GI mainly by affecting abiotic factors. Adding the microbial inoculum increased biotic activity and promoted humus and precursor formation. Superphosphate activated core functional bacteria and increased bacterial diversity and complexity, and 16 genera and 2 phyla (Gemmatimonadota and Chloroflexi) were found only in this composting pile. Superphosphate markedly accelerated humification and decreased the salt (NH4+ and NO3-) and heavy metal ion (Cu2+, Cd2+, Cr3+) contents, forming stable substances to reduce the key phytotoxic matters, which in turn decreased the compost phytotoxicity and improved the GI. These results provide a new sight for promoting maturity by functional material regulation in composting.

AB  - Common horse???chestnut is frequently infested by the insect pest horse???chestnut leaf miner [HCLM]. The caterpillar, feeding on leaf parenchyma, cause browning and dehydration of leaves, which may be shed as early as in summer. The major aims of this study were: (1) to assess the effect of infestation by HCLM on ring???width dynamics in common horse???chestnut; (2) to determine the date of invasion of the pest; and (3) to compare the growth???climate response in the period before and after the invasion of HCLM. In north???western Poland, samples from 30 horse??? ???chestnut trees for the dendrochronological analysis were taken with help of a Pressler increment borer. The ring???width chronology was developed using standard dendrochronological methods. Dendroclimatological analyses were made in 2 periods: before the determined date of HCLM invasion (till 1999) and after the invasion (2000???2016). In 2000, in spite of favourable weather conditions, a reduced growth rate was observed in 91% of the analysed trees. The period of strong reductions lasted till 2010. Before the invasion, radial growth rate was dependent on tem??? perature and precipitation in May and June of the current year, whereas after the invasion, the growth???climate response was dependent on temperature and precipitation in the preceding year and the correlation was stronger. Surprisingly, in recent years (2011???2016), in spite of infestation by HCLM every year, the health condition of the analysed trees has improved and tree???ring width has increased.

AB  - We investigated the distribution patterns of galling insects in veredas with varying degrees of drying in the Brazilian Cerrado. We tested if the insect gall diversity is higher in degraded veredas (dry veredas) compared to preserved (wet veredas) ones, as predicted by the hygrothermal stress hypothesis. Additionally, we also tested whether the composition of galling insects varied along the veredas and if species richness and abundance of galling insects are higher in the upstream zone of the veredas. In total, we recorded 99 species of galling insects, distributed across 54 plant species and 24 botanical families. We found that galling species richness was high in degraded veredas compared to preserved ones, while the abundance of galling insects was higher in preserved veredas than in degraded ones. When examining the different zones along the veredas, we observed variations in the richness and abundance of galling insects in preserved veredas. Specifically, the galling insect richness was higher in the upstream and middle zones compared to the downstream zone, while the abundance of galling insects was higher in the middle zone compared to the upstream zone. However, in the degraded veredas, there were no significant differences in galling species richness and abundance among the zones studied. The composition of galling insect species differed significantly between degraded and preserved veredas, with a higher faunal similarity observed in preserved veredas for both the downstream and upstream zones compared to degraded veredas (upstream zone). Our results indicate a preference of galling insects for more hygrothermally stressed environments, such as dry veredas and upstream zones of wet veredas.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have broad applications. However, their use for wildlife surveys in rugged mountains with dense vegetation is uncommon. Therefore, developing appropriately designed methods, selecting suitable facilities, establishing effective monitoring processes, and managing databases that align with a region's distinctive geographic landscapes, environments, ecology, and habitats are essential. This study focuses on the Giant Panda National Park in China's densely vegetated Qinling Mountains to carry out surveys using UAVs to assess the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey population size (Rhinopithecus roxellana) over an area of 30,000 ha. The results indicate that eight distinct groups were identified, totaling 648-755 individuals. Thus, this study offers proof-of-principle for using UAVs for surveying wildlife in remote mountainous regions with complex landscapes and dense vegetation and demonstrates how UAVs can be used in animal monitoring and conservation. Furthermore, the study highlights the broader potential application of UAVs in other remote mountainous regions, where animal demographic information is urgently needed to establish database-driven conservation strategies.

AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is characterized by an extreme hypoxia, which may lead to lack of sufficient oxygen for compost production, and thus seriously affecting the compost quality. The moisture content (MC) has a direct effect on the oxygen content of composting pile. At present, the research on the optimum moisture content of compost production on the QTP is still lacking. This study aimed to investigate the influences of MC on fermentation quality of sheep manure composting on the QTP and to further analyze the changes of microbial metabolic function and enzyme activity under different MC. Composting experiment with low MC (45%) and conventional MC (60%) was conducted in both summer and autumn. The results showed that the composting efficiency of 45% MC was better than 60% in both seasons, which was mainly manifested as longer high-temperature period (summer:16 d vs 14 d, autumn: 7 d vs 2 d), higher germination index (summer:136.1% vs 128.6%, autumn:103.5% vs 81.2%), and more humus synthesis (summer:159.8 g/kg vs 151.2 g/kg, autumn:136.1 k/kg vs 115.5 k/kg). The 45% MC can improve microbial metabolism, including increasing the abundance of functional genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism and improving the activities of cellulase, beta-glucosidase, protease, polyphenol oxidase, and peroxidase. In conclusion, 45% MC can improve the fermentation efficiency and products quality of sheep manure compost on QTP.

AB  - Type III interferon (IFN), also known as IFN-lambda, is an innate antiviral protein. We retrieved the sequences of IFN-lambda and their receptors from 42 tetrapod species and conducted a computational evolutionary analysis to understand the diversity of these genes. The copy number variation (CNV) of IFN-lambda was determined through qPCR in Indian cattle and buffalo. The tetrapod species feature intron-containing type III IFN genes. Some reptiles and placental mammals have 2 IFN-lambda loci, while marsupials, monotremes, and birds have a single IFN-lambda locus. Some placental mammals and amphibians exhibit multiple IFN-lambda genes, including both intron-less and intron-containing forms. Placental mammals typically possess 3-4 functional IFN-lambda genes, some of them lack signal peptides. IFN-lambda of these tetrapod species formed 3 major clades. Mammalian IFN-lambda 4 appears as an ancestral form, with syntenic conservation in most mammalian species. The intron-less IFN-lambda 1 and both type III IFN receptors have conserved synteny in tetrapod. Purifying selection was noted in their evolutionary analysis that plays a crucial role in minimizing genetic diversity and maintaining the integrity of biological function. This indicates that these proteins have successfully retained their biological function and indispensability, even in the presence of the type I IFNs. The expansion of IFN-lambda genes in amphibians and camels have led to the evolution of multiple IFN-lambda. The CNV can arise from gene duplication and conversion events. The qPCR-based absolute quantification revealed that IFN-lambda 3 and IFN-lambda 4 have more than 1 copy in buffalo (Murrah) and 6 cattle breeds (Sahiwal, Tharparkar, Kankrej, Red Sindhi, Jersey, and Holstein Friesian). Overall, these findings highlight the evolutionary diversity and functional significance of IFN-lambda in tetrapod species.

AB  - This study examines the effects of sous-vide cooking with varying concentrations of sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) on the physicochemical, microstructural, and sensory characteristics of frozen buffalo loins. Samples were prepared with 0.15% and 0.30% STPP, alongside a control group without STPP, and cooked using a two-stage sous-vide process at 45 degrees C for 3 hr, followed by 60 degrees C for an additional 3 h. The results demonstrated that STPP significantly influenced pH, cooking loss, water-holding capacity (WHC), colour properties, Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF), microstructure, and sensory characteristics. Raising STPP concentration improved WHC and lowered cooking loss. STPP generated a pH rise, which delayed the denaturation of myoglobin and resulted in the sous-vide-cooked buffalo loins having a redder appearance. Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) supported the notable increase in tenderness with STPP addition, by showing structural changes in the muscle fibres; 0.3% of STPP samples displayed noticeably looser fibres and a thinner perimysium. The 0.3% STPP samples had a higher overall acceptability, texture, juiciness, and appearance score than the other samples, as indicated by the sensory evaluation using generic descriptive analysis (GDA) and principal component analysis (PCA). Therefore, it is recommended to incorporate 0.3% STPP into the sous-vide cooking process to optimize the eating quality of the frozen buffalo loins.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The increasing societal concern in animal welfare has changed centuries-old practices in pig breeding. One of the most debatable is the surgical castration of piglets commonly used in many European countries primarily performed to avoid boar taint. Boar taint is an undesirable and unpleasant odor that is released by mature entire male pigs. The two main compounds responsible for boar taint are androstenone and skatole. While androstenone as a steroid is mainly affected genetically, skatole as a product of microbial degradation of the amino acid tryptophan in hind gut can be influenced by nutrition and feeding. Recently, several studies revealed that hydrolysable tannins in the pig diet have the potential to reduce skatole accumulation in fat tissue. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of tannin administration (1, 2, 3, and 4%-sweet chestnut extract rich in hydrolysable tannins) on skatole as well as androstenone deposition in adipose tissue, and to observe the impact on carcass and meat quality, chemical, amino and fatty acid composition, and boar taint perception. The results showed that tannins in the diet of entire males did not affect chemical composition, androstenone accumulation, amino, and fatty acid profile in subcutaneous tissue. The effect on carcass value was only slight. However, higher doses of tannins (3 and 4%) increased cooking loss, and partially increased (4% dosage) electrical conductivity in semimembranosus muscle. Skatole concentration in fat tissue had a tendency to decline after 2-4% administration compared to control group. Similarly, a tendency to drop in boar taint perception using "hot iron" method was found between control and 2%-supplemented pigs. Higher dietary tannins supplementation (3 and/or 4%) increased several saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in pork.
   The slaughtering of entire males increases the probability of incidence of tainted pork due to the presence two main compounds-androstenone and skatole. If a surgical castration of young entire male pigs is stopped in the EU countries, fattening of boars is likely to become one of the most commonly used systems in pig farming. Since skatole production and accumulation in fat tissue can be controlled by dietary approaches, several studies have investigated various feed additives to reduce this compound of boar taint. Ones of the most promising is tannins. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different dietary tannin level supplementation on carcass, pork quality, chemical, amino and fatty acid composition. as well as perception of boar taint and accumulation of skatole and androstenone in adipose tissue. Eighty entire males were randomly distributed to control (T0) and four experimental groups. Control pigs received standard feed mixture (16.8% CP, 13.9 MJ ME) without any tannin supplementation. Experimental pigs received the same diet with administration of 1% (T1), 2% (T2), 3% (T3) and 4% (T4)-sweet chestnut extract rich in hydrolysable tannins for 40 days (from average live weight of 80 kg until slaughter at average weight 122.28 kg +/- 5.63 kg). Dietary tannins supplementation did not show any significant effect on chemical composition, cholesterol content, and amino acid composition of muscle as well as fatty acid composition and androstenone accumulation in adipose tissue. A slight or small effect was observed on carcass and meat quality, respectively.
   Pigs in groups T4 and/or T3-T4 had higher electrical conductivity in semimembranosus muscle and cooking loss value compared to T1, T2 or T0, T1, and T2 groups (p < 0.05). Tannins in the pig's diet greatly affected fatty acid profile in meat of entire males. The highest tannin levels (4%) increased concentrations of lauric, myristic, vaccenic, linoleic, total PUFA, and n-6 PUFA in muscle compared to the control. Similar results were found in group T3 except for vaccenic, linoleic, and total PUFA. On the contrary, concentrations of heptadecanoic and oleic acids in groups T3 and T4 were lower than those in T1 and T2 groups. Perception of boar taint using hot iron" method (insertion a hot iron tip of soldering iron into adipose tissue) tended to decrease in T2 group compared with control. Skatole accumulation in fat tissue was reduced in groups T2-T4 at significance level (p = 0.052-0.055) compared to the control pigs. In summary, tannins supplementation had no effect on chemical and amino acid composition as well as fatty acid profile in adipose tissue, and only slight on carcass value. However, 4% concentration of tannins significantly increased content of some fatty acids compared to control group.

AB  - Conservation genomics is an important tool to manage threatened species under current biodiversity loss. Recent advances in sequencing technology mean that we can now use whole genomes to investigate demographic history, local adaptation, inbreeding, and more in unprecedented detail. However, for many rare and elusive species only non-invasive samples such as faeces can be obtained, making it difficult to take advantage of whole genome data. We present a method to extract DNA from the mucosal layer of faecal samples to re-sequence high coverage whole genomes using standard laboratory techniques. We use wild collected faecal pellets collected from caribou (Rangifer tarandus), a species undergoing declines in many parts of its range in Canada and subject to comprehensive conservation and population monitoring measures. We compare four faecal genomes to two tissue genomes sequenced in the same run. Quality metrics were similar between faecal and tissue samples with the main difference being the alignment success of raw reads to the reference genome due to differences in low quality and endogenous DNA content, affecting overall coverage. One of our faecal genomes was only re-sequenced at low coverage (1.6 x), however the other three obtained between 7 and 15 x, compared to 19 and 25 x for the tissue samples. We successfully re-sequenced high-quality whole genomes from faecal DNA and are one of the first to obtain genome-wide data from wildlife faecal DNA in a non-primate species. Our work represents an important advancement for non-invasive conservation genomics.

AB  - Until the outbreak of African swine fever in almost the entire Europe and consequently in the Republic of North Macedonia (2022), the population of wild boars was in increase. The biological characteristics of this species make it suitable to be used as a bioindicator for environmental pollution. The concentrations of cadmium and lead (Cd and Pb) were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the liver of free ranging wild boars. Samples were taken from 608 animals, harvested in a period of 7 years (2016-2022), in 11 hunting locations that cover the whole territory of the Republic of North Macedonia. The mean value of Pb in the liver in all hunting areas was 0.225 mg center dot kg-1 wet weight with range of 0.154-0.722 mg center dot kg-1, while mean Cd was 0.366 mg center dot kg-1 and ranged from 0.177 to 0.464 mg center dot kg-1. A statistically significant difference in Cd was found between the hunting locations, while Pb differed between hunting years. The mean Cd concentrations were significantly higher in Pelagonisko, Krivore & ccaron;ansko and Ohridsko-Prespansko hunting areas than in those from Polosko hunting area, while the mean Pb values in 2019 and 2020 were significantly higher than the mean value determined in 2021. For Cd, 18.2% of the total number of samples exceeds the maximum allowed limit provided in the legislation, while for Pb it was 6.7%. The maximum mean value for Pb (0.336 mg center dot kg-1) was measured in 2020 and for Cd (0.449 mg center dot kg-1) in 2016. The mean values for Pb and Cd obtained in this study were in line with data reported for wild boar from other European countries.

AB  - Urban environments provide challenging conditions for species survival, including increased temperatures, drought and pollution. Species can deal with these conditions through evolution across generations or the immediate expression of phenotypic plasticity. The resulting phenotypic changes are key to the performance of species and their interactions with other species in the community. We here document patterns of herbivory in Arabidopsis thaliana along a rural-urban gradient, and tested the genetic background and ecological consequences of traits related to herbivore resistance. Aphid densities increased with urbanization levels along the gradient while plant size did not change. Offspring of urban mothers, raised under common garden conditions, were larger and had a decreased trichome density and seed set but a higher caterpillar (Pieris brassicae) tolerance. In contrast, no urban evolution was detected for defences against aphids (Myzus persicae). Aphids reduced seed set more strongly in urban offspring, but this effect disappeared in second-generation plants. In general, urban adaptations as expressed in size and caterpillar tolerance were found, but these adaptations were associated with smaller inflorescences. The maternal effect on the response of seed set to aphid feeding demonstrates the relevance of intergenerational plasticity as a direct ecological consequence of herbivory. Our study demonstrates that the urban environment interacts with the plant's genotype and the extended phenotype as determined by ecological interactions.

AB  - The antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) content of composted pig manure remains high, but little is known about the impacts of its use in agriculture soil. In this study, the effects of three types of biochar (corn straw biochar, bamboo charcoal, and pig manure biochar) and pig manure compost fertilizer on ARGs and bacterial community in agriculture soil were compared. It was discovered through pot experiments that the pig manure added with biochar compost will still introduce ARGs into the soil vegetable system. And applying fertilizer with low ARG abundance does not guarantee that the soil system will have low ARGs abundance following fertilization. Corn biochar compost will increase the abundance of pathogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas and Massilia) in soil. In addition, tetC, tetG, tetX, Sul1, sul3, and qnrS genes were positively correlated with pathogenic bacteria, posing a health danger to the environment. Bamboo carbon compost will increase the abundance of soil probiotics (Arenimonas), so bamboo carbon compost has more advantages. Our findings have significant implications for the low-risk utilization of pig manure and risk evaluation of pig manure composting fertilizer.

AB  - The increasing demand for pork products has contributed to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Based on survey data of pig farms in Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, China, we developed a hybrid model DICPig (DNDC and IPCC combined model for pig husbandry) by combining the Manure-DNDC (denitrification and decomposition model for manure) model with the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) agricul-tural greenhouse gas calculation method to calculate the total GHG emissions from the pig husbandry life cycle. This hybrid model allowed the analysis of the pig husbandry carbon emissions component structure and the identification of the factors affecting the level of emissions. The results showed that CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) emission per pig in its life cycle is about 672.27 kg CO2-eq. In the process of pig waste disposal, the N2O (Nitrous oxide) emitted is 1.17 kg, and the CH4 (Methane) emitted is 1.36 kg. Pig waste disposal and feed production processes were the two most important contributors to total pig husbandry GHG emissions, accounting for 56.92% and 28.62% of the total emissions respectively. GHG emissions from pig farms could be reduced significantly by optimizing manure management measures, constructing and utilizing biogas digesters, reducing the amount of fertilizer applied to cropping, and adopting a planting-breeding combination policy.

AB  - Understanding the foraging strategies of marine megafauna that interact with fisheries is key to conflict mitigation. Bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus in the northern Aegean Sea frequently depredate bottom-set nets, but whether they exhibit prey selection within depredation events remains unknown. We conducted 80 fishing trials over 2 seasons (2020 and 2021) using gillnets in the Thermaikos Gulf, and investigated patterns in the catch and gear damage to determine whether bottlenose dolphins target certain genera over others. A high preference index was calculated for demersal fish like Mullus and Trachurus, as well as less frequently occurring pelagic fishes like Sphyraena. We also found a strong indication that dolphins target certain sizes of fish in certain genera, namely the shorter specimens of larger fishes and the larger specimens of shorter fishes. In conjunction with the patterns in the vertical position of holes torn in the nets, our findings suggest that bottlenose dolphins take advantage of whichever fish are seasonally prevalent.

AB  - Climate-induced variation in lake level can affect physicochemical properties of endorheic lakes, but its consequences for phototrophic production and regime shifts are not well understood. Here, we quantified changes in the abundance and community composition of phototrophs in Kenosee and White Bear lakes, two endorheic basins in the parkland Moose Mountain uplands of southeastern Saskatchewan, Canada, which have experienced > 8 m declines in water level since similar to 1900. We hypothesized that lower water levels and warmer temperatures should manifest as increased abundance of phytoplankton, particularly cyanobacteria, and possibly trigger a regime shift to turbid conditions due to evaporative concentration of nutrients and solutes. High-resolution analysis of sedimentary pigments revealed an increase in total phototrophic abundance (as beta-carotene) concurrent with lake-level decline beginning similar to 1930, but demonstrated little directional change in cyanobacteria. Instead, significant increases in obligately anaerobic purple sulfur bacteria (as okenone) occurred in both lakes during similar to 1930-1950, coeval with alterations to light environments and declines in lake level. The presence of okenone suggests that climate-induced increases in solute concentrations may have favored the formation of novel bacterial habitats where photic and anoxic zones overlapped. Generalized additive models showed that establishment of this unique habitat was likely preceded by increased temporal variance of sulfur bacteria, but not phytoplankton or cyanobacteria, suggesting that this abrupt change to physical lake structure was unique to deepwater environments. Such climate-induced shifts may become more frequent in the region due to hydrological stress on lake levels due to warming temperatures across the Northern Great Plains.

AB  - Background Based on world experience, first, a modern assessment of the flora is needed to develop strategies for the conservation of ecosystems of rare and endangered plant species. A regional and global biodiversity strategy should focus on assessing the current state of bioresources. To preserve the biodiversity of the species and its habitat, we evaluated botanical features, ontogenetic phases, the ecological and phytocenotic structure of the rare and endangered of Rhodiola rosea L. (golden rose root) populations from the highlands of Eastern Kazakhstan. Results R. rosea in the study region lives on damp mossy rocks, rocky slopes, overgrown moraines and along the banks of mountain rivers in the upper limit of cedar-larch forests, subalpine and alpine belts, in the altitude limit of 1700-2400 m. In the studied region, R. rosea begins to vegetate in May-June, blooms in June-July, the fruits ripen in August. The species is encountered in the high mountain ranges of the Kazakh Altai and Saur-Tarabagatai. Unfavorable habitat conditions for the species are overgrown by sedge-grass and birch-moss communities. The most common species at sites with R. rosea are: Schulzia crinita, Achillea ledebourii, Doronicum altaicum, Macropodium nivale, Hylotelephium telephium, Rhodiola algida, Carex capillaris, C. aterrima. Ontogenetic study revealed that all age-related phases were present, with the exception of the senile states. Individual life expectancy shown to be 50-55 years. The analysis of the species composition in the communities with R. rosea showed that the leading families in terms of the number of accompanying species are Poaceae, Ranunculaceae, Asteraceae, Rosaceae and Caryophyllaceae, Apiaceae, Fabaceae; while the most dominant genera are: Carex, Aconitum, Dracocephalum, Festuca, Pedicularis, Poa, Salix; the ecological groups are dominated by psychrophytes, mesophytes mesopsychrophytes; the Asian, Eurasian, and Holarctic groups are the most represented groups. Dominant life forms according to Serebyakov were rod-rooted, brush-rooted, short-rooted and long-rooted grasses, while based on Raunkiaer's groups the overwhelming majority consisted of Hemincryptophytes (74%). Conclusions The R. rosea populations of Kazakhstan represent an important gene stock of the species. Our study provides new insights into the species' biology thus contributes to the conservation of biodiversity on a wide spatial scale.

AB  - Elephants were once widely distributed across the Indonesian island of Sumatra but now exist in small, isolated populations. Using the best data available on elephant occurrence, we aimed to (a) predict potential habitat suitability for elephants (Elephas maximus sumatranus) across the island of Sumatra and (b) model landscape connectivity among the extant elephant populations. We used direct sightings and indirect observations of elephant signs, as well as six remotely sensed proxies of surface ruggedness, vegetation productivity and structure, and human land use and disturbance, to model habitat suitability in a Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. We validated the habitat suitability prediction using 10-fold spatial block cross validation and by calculating the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR), sensitivity, and specificity for each model iteration. We also used a geolocation dataset collected from global positioning system (GPS) collars fitted on elephants as an independent validation dataset. Models showed good predictive performance with a mean AUC-PR of 0.73, sensitivity of 0.76, and specificity of 0.68. Greater than 83% of the independent GPS collar geolocations were located in predicted suitable habitat. We found human modification, surface ruggedness, and normalized difference vegetation index to be the most important variables for predicting suitable elephant habitat. Thirty-two percent, or 135,646 km(2), of Sumatra's land area was predicted to be suitable habitat, with 43 patches of suitable habitat located across Sumatra. Areas with high connectivity were concentrated in the Riau and North Sumatra provinces. Though our analysis highlights the need to improve the quality of data collected on Sumatran elephants, more suitable habitat remains on Sumatra than is used by known populations. Targeted habitat conservation, especially of the suitable habitat in and around the Lamno, Balai Raja, Tesso Tenggara, Tesso Utara, Bukit Tigapuluh, Seblat, Padang Sugihan, and Bukit Barisan Selatan ranges, may improve the long-term viability of this critically endangered species.

AB  - When adopted, wildlife protection policies in Canadian forests typically cover large areas and affect multiple economic agents working in these landscapes. Such measures are likely to increase the costs of timber for forestry companies operating in the area, which may hinder their acceptance of the policies unless harvesting remains profitable. We propose a bi-level wildlife protection problem that accounts for the profit-maximizing behavior of forestry companies operating in an area subject to protection. We consider the regulator with a wildlife protection mandate and forestry companies licensed to harvest public forest lands. We depict the relationship between the regulator and forestry companies as a leader-follower Stackelberg game. The leader sets the protected area target for each license area and the followers adjust their strategies to maximize payoffs while meeting the protection target set by the leader. The leader's objective is to maximize the area-wide protection of spatially contiguous habitat while accounting for the followers' profit-maximizing behavior. We apply the approach to investigate habitat protection policies for woodland caribou in the Churchill range, Ontario, Canada. We compare the game-theoretic solutions with solutions that do not consider the forest companies' objectives and also with solutions equalizing the revenue losses among the companies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As the population and range of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) continue to grow across North America, there has been an increase in environmental and economic damages caused by this invasive species, and control efforts to reduce damages have increased concomitantly. Despite the expanding impacts and costs associated with population control of wild pigs, the extent to which wild pig control reduces populations and diminishes environmental and agricultural damages are rarely quantified. The goal of this study is to quantify changes in wild pig relative abundance and subsequent changes in damages caused by invasive wild pigs in response to control.
   RESULTS: Using a combination of wild pig population surveys, agricultural damage assessments, and environmental rooting surveys across 19 mixed forest-agricultural properties in South Carolina, USA, we quantified changes in wild pig relative abundance and associated damages over a 3-year period following implementation of a professional control program. Following implementation of control efforts, both the number of wild pig detections and estimated abundance decreased markedly. Within 24 months relative abundance was reduced by an average of similar to 70%, which resulted in a corresponding decline in environmental rooting damage by similar to 99%.
   CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that sustained wild pig control efforts can substantially reduce wild pig relative abundance, which in turn resulted in a reduction in environmental rooting damage by wild pigs. Ultimately this study will help fill critical knowledge gaps regarding the efficacy of wild pig control programs and the effort needed to reduce impacts to native ecosystems, livestock, and crops.

AB  - Large herbivores, particularly in water limited systems, are vulnerable to the impacts of poaching (illegal hunting) and human-induced climate changes. However, we have little understanding of how these processes can reshape their populations. With some rapidly declining populations there is a need to understand the effects of these stressors on populations of vulnerable large herbivores like the white rhino (Ceratotherium simum simum). We developed age-structured models for the rhino population in Kruger National Park, home to 49% of South Africa's rhinos. We wanted to determine the relative influence of poaching and climate on the current and future population size and demographics, examine the potential of a dependency effect (the loss of calves from poached females) and quantify the compound effect (loss of future young). Our results indicated that population declines were largely driven by poaching and included a dependency effect. Rainfall had a measurable but smaller influence on rhino populations and had an additive effect; reduced rainfall exacerbated poaching losses. Current poaching levels have resulted in a reduction to the lifetime reproductive output per cow from approximately 6 to 0.7 calves: a compound effect of 5.3 future offspring. Under current levels of poaching, we project a 35% decline in the Kruger rhino population in the next 10 years. However, if poaching intensity is cut in half, we project a doubling of the current population over the same time frame. Overall, our models showed little sensitivity to demographic and environmental parameters, except for adult survival. Our results suggest that maintaining and improving the lifetime reproductive output of rhino cows should thus be the highest management priority and that new management targets should consider both the dependency and compound effects associated with poaching on rhino cows.

AB  - Simple Summary Through calculating landscape indexes and constructing an ecological risk assessment model, we assessed the landscape pattern and ecological risk of moose (Alces alces) habitat in the Nanwenghe National Nature Reserve of the Great Khingan Mountains in China. The results show that the areas with high habitat suitability for moose were mainly concentrated in forests and rivers. However, under the premise of global warming, the risk of landscape pattern fragmentation tends to increase from 2015 to 2020. Moose preference patch type is dispersed, the degree of polymerization is low, and the risk of patch type transformation is increased. In terms of ecological risk: the medium- and high-risk areas in the moose habitat are mainly concentrated in the river area and its nearby forests, showing a fine and scattered distribution. The low ecological risk area is mainly distributed on both sides of the road and the mountainous area, and the patch type is single. It shows that the moose habitat will have a weak ability to resist risk in the future. The study suggests that we should avoid further human intervention in forests and rivers, formulate reasonable forest protection and sustainable development plans in cold temperate zones, and effectively monitor and protect the dynamics of cold temperate forests and moose populations.Abstract The change in habitat pattern is one of the key factors affecting the survival of the moose population. The study of the habitat landscape pattern is the key to protecting the Chinese cold-temperate forest moose population and monitoring the global distribution of moose. Through the ecological risk assessment of the moose habitat landscape pattern in a cold-temperate forest, we hope to assess the strength of habitat resistance under stress factors. This study provides a theoretical basis for the protection of the moose population in the cold-temperate forest in China and the establishment of the cold-temperate forest national park. In the study, the MaxEnt model, landscape index calculation and ecological risk assessment model construction were used to analyze the field survey and infrared camera monitoring data from April 2014 to January 2023. The habitat suitability layer of the moose population in the Nanwenghe National Nature Reserve of the Great Khingan Mountains was calculated, and the range of the moose habitat was divided based on the logical threshold of the model. The landscape pattern index of the moose habitat was calculated by Fragstats software and a landscape ecological risk assessment model was established to analyze the landscape pattern and ecological risk dynamic changes of the moose habitat in 2015 and 2020. The results showed that under the premise of global warming, the habitat landscape contagion index decreased by 4.53 and the split index increased by 4.86 from 2015 to 2020. In terms of ecological risk: the area of low ecological risk areas increased by 0.88%; the area of medium ecological risk areas decreased by 1.11%; and the area of high ecological risk areas increased by 0.23%. The fragmentation risk of the landscape pattern of the moose habitat tends to increase, the preferred patch type is dispersed, the degree of aggregation is low, and the risk of patch type transformation increases. The middle and high ecological risk areas are mainly concentrated in the river area and its nearby forests, showing a fine and scattered distribution.
   Under the interference of global warming and human activities, the fragmentation trend of the moose habitat in the study area is increasing, and the habitat quality is declining, which is likely to cause moose population migration. For this reason, the author believes that the whole cold temperate forest is likely to face the risk of increasing the transformation trend of dominant patch types in the cold-temperate coniferous forest region mainly caused by global warming, resulting in an increase in the risk of habitat fragmentation. While the distribution range of moose is reduced, it has a significant impact on the diversity and ecological integrity of the whole cold-temperate forest ecosystem. This study provides theoretical references for further research on the impact of climate warming on global species distribution and related studies. It is also helpful for humans to strengthen their protection awareness of forest and river areas and formulate reasonable protection and sustainable development planning of cold-temperate forests. Finally, it provides theoretical references for effective monitoring and protection of cold-temperate forests and moose population dynamics.

AB  - Because facial hair is one of the most sexually dimorphic features of humans (Homo sapiens) and is often perceived as an indicator of masculinity and social dominance, human facial hair has been suggested to play a role in male contest competition. Some authors have proposed that the beard may function similar to the long hair of a lion's mane, serving to protect vital areas like the throat and jaw from lethal attacks. This is consistent with the observation that the mandible, which is superficially covered by the beard, is one of the most commonly fractured facial bones in interpersonal violence. We hypothesized that beards protect the skin and bones of the face when human males fight by absorbing and dispersing the energy of a blunt impact. We tested this hypothesis by measuring impact force and energy absorbed by a fiber epoxy composite, which served as a bone analog, when it was covered with skin that had thick hair (referred to here as "furred") versus skin with no hair (referred to here as "sheared" and "plucked"). We covered the epoxy composite with segments of skin dissected from domestic sheep (Ovis aries), and used a drop weight impact tester affixed with a load cell to collect force versus time data. Tissue samples were prepared in three conditions: furred (n = 20), plucked (n = 20), and sheared (n = 20). We found that fully furred samples were capable of absorbing more energy than plucked and sheared samples. For example, peak force was 16% greater and total energy absorbed was 37% greater in the furred compared to the plucked samples. These differences were due in part to a longer time frame of force delivery in the furred samples. These data support the hypothesis that human beards protect vulnerable regions of the facial skeleton from damaging strikes.

AB  - Primate communities in the Genting Highlands consist of a single species of Hylobatidae and four species of Cercopithecidae, which are known to exhibit social interaction behaviour. Thus, a study on the diets of Symphalangus syndactylus (siamang; family Hylobatidae) and Macaca nemestrina (pig-tailed macaque; family Cercopithecidae) was carried out at Genting Highlands, in order to compare the dietary preferences and interspecific competition between the two primate families. A DNA metabarcoding approach was used to analyse diet intake using non-invasive samples based on the trnL region. Based on the 140 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) generated, 26 plant orders, 46 different families, 60 genera and 49 species were identified from 23 different plant classes. Fabaceae and Moraceae were classified as the most preferred plants at the family level for S. syndactylus ; meanwhile, Piperaceae and Arecaceae were classified as the most preferred for M. nemestrina . Only six out of the 60 different plant genera classified in this study, were found to be consumed by both species. Therefore, the low similarity of preferred plants in the diets between the two families suggests that there is little interspecific competition. These findings are important for future conservation management of highland primates, especially in the Genting Highlands.

AB  - Camera traps are an important tool for animal resource surveys, allowing non-invasive wildlife image capture and providing essential data for species identification. However, the vast number of images generated requires significant manual effort for sorting, limiting its development in biodiversity studies. Deep learning offers a promising solution by accurately identifying species from large datasets, enhancing processing efficiency, and reducing costs. While existing deep learning methods have achieved significant success in species identification, they often struggle with accurately recognizing all species due to the class imbalance prevalent in camera trap datasets, which limits the application of deep learning models in biodiversity monitoring. This study proposed an ensemble learning method based on common species modeling to automatically identify common species, which constitute the majority of camera trap datasets. We utilized three base models: ResNet-18, ResNeXt-50, and ViTBase to validate our method on the Snapshot Serengeti dataset. The experimental results showed that the performance of the ensemble learning method improved with the performance of the selected base model. When ResNeXt-50 was used as the base model, the recall and precision of all common species on the in-sample test set exceeded 98 % and 97 %, respectively, except for Gazelle Grants. The automation rate of the ensemble model was 80.67 %, and the omission error of rare species was 2.03 %. On the out-of-sample test set, all species except for Zebra, Buffalo, and Gazelle Grants had a recall of over 95 %. Apart from Gazelle Grants, the precision for the other species was above 90 %. The automation rate of the ensemble model was 72.27 %, and the omission error of rare species was 5.31 %. Our method achieved the automatic identification of common species, thus reducing the workload of manual sorting. In addition, our approach separated rare species images from the dataset by identifying common species, minimizing potential omission errors. As a result, ecologists focusing on rare species only need to handle rare species images that only represent a small proportion of the dataset.

AB  - Leaves are the largest component of forest litter. Their decomposition rate depends mainly on plant species, leaf chemical composition, microorganism biodiversity, and habitat conditions. It is known that herbivory by insects can modify the chemical composition of leaves, such as through induction. The aim of this study was to determine whether the rate of leaf decomposition is related to the susceptibility of the plant species to insect feeding and how leaf damage affects this rate. For our research, we chose six species differing in leaf resistance to insect damage: Cornus sanguinea, Frangula alnus, and Sambucus nigra (herbivore resistant), and Corylus avellana, P. padus, and Prunus serotina (herbivore susceptible). The decomposition of these plant leaves was examined in two monoculture forest stands, deciduous (Quercus robur) and coniferous (Pinus sylvestris). Litter decay rate k and change of litter mass, content of defensive metabolites (total phenols (TPh) and condensed tannins), and substances beneficial for organisms decomposing litter (nitrogen (N) and nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC)) were determined. Contrary to our expectations, leaf litter of herbivore-resistant species decomposed faster than that of herbivore-susceptible species, and damaged leaves decayed faster than undamaged leaves. We found that faster decaying leaf litter had a lower content of defensive compounds and a higher content of TNC and N, regardless of the plant species or leaf damage. Leaf litter decomposition caused a large and rapid decrease in the content of defensive compounds and TNC, and an increase in N. In all species, the tannin content was lower in damaged than in undamaged leaves. This pattern was also observed for TPh, except in S. nigra. We interpret this as the main reason for faster decay of damaged leaves. Moreover, the loss of leaf mass was greater under oak than pine stands, indicating that the microorganisms in deciduous stands are more effective at decomposing litter, regardless of leaf damage.

AB  - Variation in the size and number of axial segments underlies much of the diversity in animal body plans. Here we investigate the evolutionary, genetic and developmental mechanisms driving tail-length differences between forest and prairie ecotypes of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). We first show that long-tailed forest mice perform better in an arboreal locomotion assay, consistent with tails being important for balance during climbing. We then identify six genomic regions that contribute to differences in tail length, three of which associate with caudal vertebra length and the other three with vertebra number. For all six loci, the forest allele increases tail length, indicative of the cumulative effect of natural selection. Two of the genomic regions associated with variation in vertebra number contain Hox gene clusters. Of those, we find an allele-specific decrease in Hoxd13 expression in the embryonic tail bud of long-tailed forest mice, consistent with its role in axial elongation. Additionally, we find that forest embryos have more presomitic mesoderm than prairie embryos and that this correlates with an increase in the number of neuromesodermal progenitors, which are modulated by Hox13 paralogues. Together, these results suggest a role for Hoxd13 in the development of natural variation in adaptive morphology on a microevolutionary timescale.

AB  - This study develops a comprehensive evaluation framework for identifying the dynamic rule of ecological risk transmission among ecological communities in naphthalene-contaminated groundwater ecosystems. This framework is integrated with techniques of numerical simulation, network environmental analysis, and surrogate model. An information-based network analysis is applied for ecological risk assessment (ERA) based on a control allocation (CA) matrix, which can quantificationally reflect the relationship between groundwater ecosystems and ecological communities. Stepwise quadratic response surface analysis (SQRSA) is employed for determining a set of surrogates between pumping rates at injection/extraction wells and ecological risks of different communities. Results reveal that soil microorganism is the most vulnerable among four communities. Herbivores and carnivorous can receive indirect ecological risk via an environmental information network. In terms of the integrated risk in soil microorganism, 60.13% comes from initial risk and 39.87% is from direct risk (including 31.86% from vegetation). The SQRSA results show that the surrogates can well fit with the risk outputs from information-based network analysis due to a majority of scatter points evenly distributed on both sides of a straight line. Findings can support system design, risk assessment, and pollution abatement of groundwater ecosystems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plants can be severely affected by insect herbivores and phytopathogenic fungi, but interactions between these plant antagonists are poorly understood. We analysed the impact of feeding damage by the abundant herbivore Orchestes fagi on infection rates of beech (Fagus sylvatica) leaves with Petrakia liobae, an invasive plant pathogenic fungus. The fungus was not detected in hibernating beetles, indicating that O. fagi does not serve as vector for P. liobae, at least not between growing seasons. Abundance of the fungus in beech leaves increased with feeding damage of the beetle and this relationship was stronger for sun-exposed than for shaded leaves. A laboratory experiment revealed sun-exposed leaves to have thicker cell walls and to be more resistant to pathogen infection than shaded leaves. Mechanical damage significantly increased frequency and size of necroses in the sun, but not in shade leaves. Our findings indicate that feeding damage of adult beetles provides entry ports for fungal colonization by removal of physical barriers and thus promotes infection success by pathogenic fungi. Feeding activity by larvae probably provides additional nutrient sources or eases access to substrates for the necrotrophic fungus. Our study exemplifies that invasive pathogens may benefit from herbivore activity, which may challenge forest health in light of climate change.

AB  - Simple Summary Wolves normally howl in response to unfamiliar vocalisations, to defend their territory and the important resources within it (e.g., pups and prey). During the non-rendezvous period (late autumn and winter), the protectiveness of adults towards pups decreases, as well as reactions to unfamiliar vocal stimuli. In the late fall of 2010, we performed a saturation wolf howling design in the Cicolano area (Central Apennines, Italy), aiming to identify environmental and human-related characteristics of locations where wolves are prone to respond to unfamiliar howling and to assess their eventual ability to provide insights into the distribution of valuable resources (aside from pups) during the cold season. We found that winter response sites (WRS) were characterized by diverging conditions, with respect to all available sites, suggesting that they are non-randomly located but, instead, had been selected by wolves for some reason. We recorded a positive role of thermal refuges and the occurrence of wild boar drive hunts, as well as the negative roles of other forms of human presence and activities, including the occurrence of free-ranging dogs. These results could be of interest both for conservation purposes and for assessing interactions with human activities. Winter resources are crucial for wildlife, and, at a local scale, some anthropogenic and environmental factors could affect their availability. In the case of wolves, it is known that vocalisations in response to unfamiliar howls are issued to defend their territory and the important resources within it. Then, we studied the characteristics of winter response sites (WRS) during the cold season, aiming to assess their eventual ability to provide insights into the distribution of valuable resources within their territories. Within this scope, we planned a wolf-howling survey following a standardised approach. The study covered an Apennine (Central Italy) area of 500 km(2). A hexagonal mesh was imposed on the area, in order to determine the values of different variables at the local scale. A logistic LASSO regression was performed. WRS were positively related to the presence of thermal refuges (odds = 114.485), to patch richness (odds = 1.153), wild boar drive hunting areas (odds = 1.015), and time elapsed since the last hunt (odds = 1.019). Among negative factors, stray dogs reply considerably affects wolves' responsiveness (odds = 0.207), where odds are the exponentiated coefficients estimated by the logistic lasso regression. These results suggest that WRS are related to anthropogenic and environmental factors favouring the predation process.

AB  - Comprehending the genetic architecture of complex traits has many applications in evolution, ecology, conservation biology and plant and animal production systems. Underlying research questions in these fields are diverse species that often have limited genetic information available. In aquaculture, for example, genetic progress has been slow in many species due to a lack in such genetic information. In this study, zebrafish (as a well-studied model species) was used in cross-species transfer to develop genomic resources and identify candidate genes underling growth differentials in dusky kob. Dusky kob is a Sciaenid finfish and an emerging aquaculture species. The zebrafish All Exon Predesigned Probe-set capture protocol was used to enrich fractionated DNA samples from kob, classified as either large or small, before massive parallel sequencing on the Ion Torrent platform. Although vast quantities of sequence data were generated, only about 30% of contigs could be identified as zebrafish homologues. There were numerous species-specific sequences and inconsistent coverage of sequencing products across samples, likely due to non-specific binding of the probe-set as a result of the evolutionary divergence between zebrafish and kob. Nonetheless, more than 55,000 SNPs could be reliably identified and genotyped to the individual level. Using SNP genotypic divergence estimates, between large and small cohorts, a number of candidate genes associated with growth was also identified for future investigation. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the utility of a cross-species capture approach in the development of important genomic resources for understanding traits of interest in species without reference genomes.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a toxicant of concern, particularly in aquatic food webs. Mercury can move to terrestrial systems through consumption of aquatic prey or emergence of insects with aquatic larval phases. The possible movement of Hg from sediments to wetland plants and into terrestrial food webs though primary consumers has received less attention. We investigated differences and correlations in Hg in soil, wood and leaves of willows (Salix caroliniana) and folivorous beetles from a wetland with enhanced levels of Hg. Further, we compared samples from tree islands that had enriched Hg in soil through bird guano with control islands. Hg in any sample type did not correlate with Hg in any other sample type from the same island. We found higher [Hg] in soils and significantly higher [Hg] in leaves from colony islands, while [Hg] in beetles appeared to be higher in control islands. In any case, despite comparatively high [Hg] in soil and leaves, Hg in folivorous beetles was below detection levels and lower than that reported from other studies. We conclude that movement of Hg from wetland trees to terrestrial food webs through wetland vegetation is negligible in this ecosystem.

AB  - The Buffalo National River in northwest Arkansas preserves an extensive Quaternary record of fluvial bedrock incision and aggradation across lithologies of variable resistance. In this work, we apply optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating to strath and fill terraces along the Buffalo River to elucidate the role of lithology and climate on the development of the two youngest terrace units (Qtm and Qty). Our OSL ages suggest a minimum strath planation age of ca. 250 ka for the Qtm terraces followed by a ca. 200 ka record of aggradation. Qtm incision likely occurred near the last glacial maximum (LGM), prior to the onset of Qty fill terrace aggradation ca. 14 ka. Our terrace ages are broadly consistent with other regional terrace records, and comparison with available paleoclimatic archives suggests that terrace aggradation and incision occurred during drier and wetter hydrological conditions, respectively. Vertical bedrock incision rates were also calculated using OSL-derived estimates of Qtm strath planation and displayed statistically significant spatial variability with bedrock lithology, ranging from similar to 35 mm/ka in the higher resistance reaches and similar to 16 mm/ka in the lower resistance reaches. In combination with observations of valley width and terrace distribution, these results suggest that vertical processes outpace lateral ones in lithologic reaches with higher resistance.

AB  - Several aspects of the Cecropia-Azteca mutualism can vary across space and time. The present study explored this variation by focusing on correlations between morphophysiological characteristics of Cecropia pachystachya plants and the sizes of the populations of their breeding ant colonies (Azteca ovaticeps and A. alfari) in secondary forest and pasture habitats in the Atlantic Forest. We hypothesize that forest plants are (i) larger and (ii) harbor more populous colonies than pasture plants. More populous colonies have a greater number of workers to defend their host plant, so we hypothesize that aggressiveness depends on the (iii) ant species and habitat. In each habitat, we collected 60 plants hosting Azteca colonies (queen, worker, immature, and winged individuals). The heights and stem diameters of the plants were measured and the Mullerian bodies were counted. We counted the number of workers, immature individuals, and winged individuals as an indicator of the size of the Azteca populations. We conducted aggressive behavior tests among individuals from 35 different colonies. In general, plants and colonies were smaller in the pasture than in the forest. In both habitats, the populations of A. ovaticeps were larger than those of A. alfari, but they were not more aggressive. The habitat directly influenced the physical structures of the plants and those in turn influenced the size of the ant populations. The conversion of forests into simplified habitats such as pastures can lead to a drastic reduction or local extinction of certain ant populations and compromise Cecropia-Azteca mutualistic relations.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change and habitat alterations increase the importance of understanding the causes and consequences of variation in phenological traits. Although the timing of phenological events may vary in response to both direct and mediated effects, methods to measure and distinguish direct and mediated effects have seldom been used. We used a Bayesian structural equation model (SEM) to evaluate potential direct and mediated effects of intrinsic individual and environmental factors on the timing and progression of spring molt in bighorn sheep. The SEM showed that molt phenology varied across years, was earlier in prime-aged and in heavier individuals, slower in males, and later in lactating ewes, especially if they were light. These results highlight how individual variation in intrinsic traits and life-history leads to substantial variation in a phenological trait. Indirect effects in the SEM predicted a delay in sheep molt phenology at high population density mediated through negative density effects on body mass and lactation probability. Cooler temperatures in late spring were also predicted to delay molt phenology via a negative effect on body mass. Finally, lactation reduced ewe mass which was predicted to delay molt phenology. This mediated effect thus increased the total delay (sum of direct and mediated effects) in molt phenology experience by lactating ewes. Our results underline the importance of estimating direct and indirect effects when modeling phenological traits. Because indirect effects could substantially affect estimates of total plasticity, they should be critically important to accurately predict phenological mismatches and demographic consequences of environmental change.

AB  - Marine fish species with complex life cycles undergo ontogenetic changes in their physiological and habitat requirements. Therefore, predicting how warming ocean conditions are likely to impact fish populations requires size-(age-) and habitat-specific analyses. We determined the habitat exposure and scope of adaptability of 4 shelf-oriented flatfish species in the Bering Sea to projected climate-driven warming. We quantified present day and end-of-century habitat exposure based on hindcasts and forecasts of regional ocean circulation models and quantified fish adaptability based on changes in depth distribution and from published thermal tolerances of northern rock sole Lepidopsetta polyxystra, yellowfin sole Limanda aspera, Alaska plaice Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus, and flathead sole Hippoglossoides elassodon. These 4 species complete their life cycle within the Bering Sea shelf but have different depth preferences and thermal tolerances throughout ontogeny. We found that species or size ranges that occupy the inner shelf, such as northern rock sole, yellowfin sole, and Alaska plaice, are exposed to higher seasonal variability compared to outer shelf species. While these inner shelf species are likely adapted to large seasonal changes in temperature, the future range of seasonal variability was projected to exceed their thermal tolerances. Therefore, we expect species that reside inshore during part of their life cycle and have high temperature sensitivity and limited mobility to be particularly vulnerable to climate change.

AB  - Conservation of biodiversity in protected areas is often threatened by invasive alien plants (IAPs), and its successful management requires proper planning, resources, and monitoring to adjust future interventions. Although follow-up controls and evaluation of different management actions through monitoring programs are crucial in an adaptive management strategy, they are often neglected. Acacia longifolia is one of the most widespread IAPs in the Portuguese coastal areas, causing several negative impacts. This study reports the results of different control methods of A. longifolia in two forest plantations over coastal dunes in two protected sites in Portugal, under different management regimes and for over 4 years. The best results were achieved after hand pulling, but due to its high cost, this method is not suitable for large areas. Mechanical cuts, which include the use of brush hogs, brush cutters, and chainsaws, resulted in variable levels of resprouting of A. longifolia stumps. Follow-up treatments, whether mechanical and/or chemical, reduced the number of A. longifolia resprouts and kept its cover below 20% and height below 50 cm. Furthermore, controlling with brush cutters/hogs reduced the seed bank of A. longifolia by 74% while that with a disc harrow allowed an even greater reduction (91%). In areas where no follow-up treatments were carried out, A. longifolia started producing flowers two and a half years after the initial treatment, restarting the cycle of seed production. Nevertheless, a biological control agent that reduces A. longifolia seed production (Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae) establishment was confirmed in the controlled areas, suggesting that new seed production by these plants will be soon controlled. Although species characteristic of the protected habitats are currently poorly represented, it is expected that they begin to emerge with the reduction of A. longifolia. Our results stress the importance of persistence of follow-up treatments if higher success in IAPs control is to be achieved, not only because of the resprouting ability of many species (despite this not being very common in A. longifolia) but also because invasive plants can produce extensive persistent seed banks. The role of the management regime on the level of success in controlling IAPs will be discussed.

AB  - Simple Summary The ongoing range expansion of the wolf (Canis lupus) in Italy is currently leading the species closer to highly anthropized landscapes. Long-term research projects carried out in focal areas along the Apennines provide the opportunity to finely monitor the dynamics of this expansion and to predict the new scenarios of wolf-human coexistence. We carried out a monitoring project (2007-2022) based on the collection of indirect signs of presence along routes in an area of the Northern Apennines where both the wolf's range and its feeding habits greatly changed. Wolves first settled in the mountains of our study area and, once it had been saturated, they began to occupy the hill zones. These recently occupied zones are markedly different from the undisturbed mountains: woodlands are restricted to small patches, and agricultural lands are predominant. Nevertheless, wolves rapidly colonized the hills, driven by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) abundance. This widespread species became very abundant during the last few decades and supported the wolf range expansion; indeed, its consumption greatly increased until it became the staple of the wolf diet. Our results suggest that wolf expansion will follow that of the roe deer across the Po Plain with the settlement of wolf packs in roe deer high-density areas.Abstract The comprehension of the factors that have influenced the recent changes in wolf (Canis lupus) range and diet that have occurred in our study area, characterized by a highly heterogeneous landscape, can shed light on their current process of expansion toward the plain. Wolf presence was monitored using a standardized protocol from 2007 to 2022 by carrying out eight monitoring sessions organized in seasonal surveys, during which, we collected wolf presence data. To model wolf range dynamics, we used dynamic occupancy models considering land cover types and wild ungulate abundances as covariates. Moreover, we studied the wolf diet through scat analysis, identifying the consumed items from undigested remains. Wolf occupancy in the study area progressed from mountains to lower hills gradually; the observed range dynamics were driven by prey abundance and human presence: in particular, the probability of colonization increased with roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) abundance, whereas the probability of extinction increased with urban areas. The wolf diet showed a gradual shift from the prevalent consumption of wild boar (2007-2008 and 2011-2012) to the prevalent consumption of roe deer (continuously increasing from 2015 onward). Our results might be related to a specific adaptation of the predator to the local ecology of the most consumed species: the roe deer.

AB  - Soil ingestion by livestock is common in grazing ecosystems, but few studies have been conducted to assess its effect on the animal organism. The topic is worthy of attention because these potential effects are likely to be enriched in the food chain and interfere with animal and human health. In this study, we present an indoor feeding trial conducted based on a completely randomized design to comprehensively evaluate the effects of simulated soil ingestion during grazing on nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation, and microflora, and mineral deposition in the organs and tissues of sheep. Eighteen Mutton Merino crossbred sheep (42.7 +/- 2.34 kg) were randomly allotted to three treatments and fed diets containing 0% (Control), 5% (SOIL5), and 10% (SOIL10) for 62 d, including a 7-d metabolism trial. It was found that soil intake altered the rumen fermentation in sheep, as evidenced by a decrease in total volatile fatty acids (VFA) and acetate concentrations in rumen fluid of 50.6% and 51.3%, respectively (p < 0.01), with soil proportion in the diet increased from 0% to 10%. Soil ingestion also reduced the species richness of rumen bacteria, with the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes decreasing significantly (p < 0.01), while that of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria increased considerably (p < 0.05). In terms of mineral elements deposition, higher levels of iron (Fe) were detected in the spleen and liver, and a higher concentration of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in the liver were found in sheep fed a diet containing 5% soil compared to the other two groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the concentrations of lead (Pb) in the liver and kidney, and arsenic (As) in the heart were also clearly increased after ingestion of soil (p < 0.05). Our findings indicate that although soil intake had no significant effect on the growth performance of sheep, it altered ruminal fermentation and increased the risk of excessive Fe, Pb, and As in their organism. This study supplies a theoretical basis for risk assessment of soil ingestion in grazing livestock.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants that have potentially harmful and toxic effects. MPs are frequently ingested by aquatic animals, as microplastics share a similar size and color to their food. Heavy metals are harmful and difficult to degrade, have a wide range of sources and an extended residual time from exposure to recovery. Although the effects of MPs and heavy metals on the performance of aquatic species have been extensively studied, the molecular mechanisms of MP and heavy metal (Pb, Cd and Cu) exposure on aquatic organisms remain unclear. Here, the effects of MPs and heavy metal accumulation on the line seahorse, Hippocampus erectus, were investigated at the molecular level using transcriptome analysis. Using gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses, we found that immune, metabolic, and apoptotic pathways were affected in the heavy metal group, whereas the DNA damage repair and metabolism pathways were mainly involved in the MP group. Both types of stress caused significant changes in the genes related to the antioxidant pathway in H. erectus larvae. Transcriptome differences between the treatment groups were analyzed, and sensitive candidate genes (Hsp70, Hsp90, Sod, etc.) were screened. The response characteristics of seahorses to MP environmental stress were also investigated. Using seahorse as a biological model and candidate sensitive genes as a basis, our results provide a theoretical basis for detecting MPs and heavy metals pollution in coastal areas.

AB  - A survey of the Pearl Island archipelago discovered a Preceramic shell-bearing midden on the island of Pedro Gonz?alez located in Panama Bay in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. This occupation dates between ca. 6200 and 5600 cal yr BP, and revealed a mixed marine and terrestrial economy including the exploitation of sea and terrestrial turtles, snakes, iguanas, dolphins, and land mammals such as dwarf deer. Test excavations in 2007?2010 provided well-preserved invertebrate and vertebrate samples, which were considerably more diverse taxonomically for fish than for other vertebrate categories. At that time, only boa among a large snake sample was identified to species. A 7 ? 4 m pit dug in 2015 increased the faunal sample but added little to diversity. Development of the ophidian comparative collection, augmented by on-line research, enhanced snake diversity and highlighted the dietary importance of snakes. Two marine turtle species ? hawksbill and Pacific green? remain the only ones exploited. Improvements in stratigraphic sectioning have fine-tuned chronological fluctuations of faunal populations as in the case of green iguana and terrestrial mammals. Birds have experienced the greatest increase in diversity, but not as much as expected on the basis of the present-day island avifauna. Only two terrestrial mammal genera ? squirrel, and rabbit ? were added to the inventory inferred during 2007?2010, which comprised deer, opossum, monkey, agouti, paca, spiny rat, furry spiny rat, and probable capybara. The occupants of Pedro Gonz?alez took advantage of the abundant agate nodules eroding from the island?s volcanic bedrock. This latest study reveals the presence of a substantial microlithic component that relied on the specialized heat treatment of whole nodules of lithic raw materials. As an idea to be explored further, we suggest that these microliths may have been produced by women for the manufacture and maintenance of composite cutting and/or grating tools used for the preparation of various foods. Ongoing analyses from the 2015 excavations are providing new information on the impact of these early colonists on the local fauna and have demonstrated how the physical properties of the island?s lithic raw materials influenced their reduction strategies.

AB  - In the early 1800s, the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) was probably extirpated from Switzerland, due to overhunting and deforestation. After a federal law was enacted in 1875 to protect lactating females and young, and limiting the hunting season, the roe deer successfully recovered and recolonized Switzerland. In this study, we use mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA markers to investigate the recolonization and assess contemporary genetic structure in relation to broad topographic features, in order to understand underlying ecological processes, inform future roe deer management strategies, and explore the opportunity for development of forensic traceability tools. The results concerning the recolonization origin support natural, multidirectional immigration from neighboring countries. We further demonstrate that there is evidence of weak genetic differentiation within Switzerland among topographic regions. Finally, we conclude that the genetic data support the recognition of a single roe deer management unit within Switzerland, within which there is a potential for broad-scale geographic origin assignment using nuclear markers to support law enforcement.

AB  - Mountain landscapes are characterized by rich biodiversity shaped by variations in topography and climate. Elucidating the interplay between elevation, genetic variability, cyanogenesis, and herbivory in these ecosystems is critical for understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics. The production of hydrogen cyanide acts as a defense against herbivory, but is limited by self-toxicity, which restricts cyanogenic individuals at high elevations. Here, we investigated a population of Trifoliumrepens within the Itatiaia National Park, Brazil for understanding the evolutionary strategy of this species across an elevational gradient (1,700 - 2,400 m a.s.l). Genetic analysis by inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers revealed high genetic diversity (HT = 0.3387) but significant differentiation among elevations (GST = 0.1848), thus suggesting an influence of elevation on the population genetic structure. The frequency of cyanogenic individuals was inversely proportional to elevation, as expected based on potential environmental pressures. Herbivore damage, however, exhibited a positive correlation with elevation, but not significantly associated with cyanogenesis, emphasizing the role of elevation in shaping plant-herbivore interactions. Our findings underscore the critical involvement elevation gradients in shaping plant-herbivore dynamics and evolutionary strategies within mountain ecosystems.

AB  - Inducible defenses can affect the persistence, structure, and stability of consumer-resource systems. Theory shows that these effects depend on characteristics of the inducible defense, including timing, costs, efficacy, and sensitivity to consumer density. However, the expression and costs of inducible defenses often vary among life stages, which has not been captured in previous unstructured models. To explore how inducible defenses expressed in stage-structured populations affect consumer-resource dynamics, we developed a model based on the biology of plant-herbivore interactions, with the plant (resource) population structured into juvenile and mature stages. We then investigated the joint effects of inducible defenses and resource life history (i.e., patterns of fecundity, maturation, and mortality) by simulating dynamics for plant populations occurring along a fast-slow pace-of-life continuum. In general, high inducible defense costs, or a slow pace of life coupled with high herbivore growth rates, promoted persistent cycles. However, these cycles fundamentally differed, with either the plant or the herbivore population peaking first. Additionally, plant population pace of life influenced the relative effects of stage-specific induction strength on equilibrium densities and the extent to which inducible defenses enabled persistence. Our work illustrates how life history modifies the population-level effects of trait-mediated interactions, with implications for conservation and pest management.

AB  - Predation risk is known to affect the spatial use of prey species, imposing a trade-off between feeding requirements and predation avoidance. As a result, prey species can leave high-quality forage areas to use sub-optimal, but safer, habitat patches, defined as "refuge areas." In this study, we describe changes in the spatial use of an introduced ungulate species, the Mediterranean mouflon Ovis aries musimon, following the recolonization (in 1996) of wolves Canis lupus into the Albergian Hunting Estate (Italian Western Alps). Since 1988, we monitored the mouflon population by spring counts from vantage points. We georeferenced all observations and recorded the size and structure of the spotted groups. Finally, we identified available refuges by selecting patches characterized by (i) the presence of rocks and (ii) high values of steepness and ruggedness. We found that mouflons significantly reduced the average distance from refuge areas over the years, with the yearly average distance from refuges being 56% lower after wolves recolonized the area (i.e., 93.8 +/- 32.1 vs. 213.1 +/- 40.9 m). The analysis of orographic parameters showed that mouflons used patches with higher values in elevation, slope, ruggedness, and a significant difference in all three parameters when comparing years pre and post wolf return. Both sexes were significantly affected, but ewes were particularly sensitive and selected patches closer to refuge areas (75.8 +/- 30.3 m) than males (131.0 +/- 53.6 m). Our results suggest that the presence of new predators can alter the distribution of an introduced species such as the Mediterranean mouflon, triggering the resurgence of anti-predation behavior.

AB  - Grouping behavior is a fundamental component of animal population dynamics, shaped by both environmental factors and the social interactions among individuals, ultimately enhancing adaptability to their habitats. However, the social organization of the wapiti subspecies inhabiting the Tian Shan Mountains remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the grouping behavior of Tianshan wapiti in the Bogda Peak Nature Reserve, northwestern China from July 2019 to November 2020. Using infrared-triggered camera traps, we analyzed seasonal variation in group size and group frequency, as well as sex-specific aggregation and segregation pattern. Our results showed that Tianshan wapiti group sizes varied considerably, ranging from 1 to 32 individuals, with most groups being relatively smaller, typically consisting of 1 to 9 individuals. Seasonal differences in group size were significant (H = 28.91, df = 3, p < 0.05). Additionally, group type showed significant variation across seasons (chi 2 = 93.32, df = 18, p < 0.05). Anakysis of sex-specifia aggregation and segregation (SSAS) indicated no consistent segregation of females and males throughout the year. However, there was a notable tendency for sex-specific aggregation during July and from October to December. These findings provide new insights into the social organization and seasonal grouping behavior of Tianshan wapiti, contributing to a better understanding of their behavioral ecology and informing conservation and management strategies for this subspecies.

AB  - Large carnivores such as the lion are declining across Africa, in part because their large herbivore prey is declining. There is consensus that increased protection from prey depletion will be necessary to reverse the decline of lion populations, but few studies have tested whether increased protection is sufficient to reverse the decline, particularly in the large, open ecosystems where most lions remain. Here, we used an integrated population model to test whether lion demography and population dynamics were measurably improved by increased protection. We used data from monitoring of 358 individuals from 2013 to 2021 in the Greater Kafue Ecosystem, where prior research showed that lions were strongly limited by prey depletion, but protection increased in several well-defined areas beginning in 2018. In some other areas, protection decreased. In areas with high protection, lion fecundity was 29% higher, and mean annual apparent survival (phi) was 8.3% higher (with a minimum difference of 6.0% for prime-aged adult females and a maximum difference of 11.9% for sub-adult males). These demographic benefits combined to produce likely population growth in areas with high protection (lambda$$ \hat{\lambda} $$ = 1.085, 90% CI = 0.97, 1.21), despite likely population decline in areas with low protection (lambda$$ \hat{\lambda} $$ = 0.970, 90% CI = 0.88, 1.07). For the ecosystem as a whole, population size remained relatively constant at a moderate density of 3.74 (+/- 0.49 SD) to 4.13 (+/- 0.52 SD) lions/100 km2. With the growth observed in areas with high protection, the expected doubling time was 10 years. Despite this, recovery at the scale of the entire ecosystem is likely to be slow without increased protection; the current growth rate would require 50 years to double. Our results demonstrate that increased protection is likely to improve the reproduction and population growth rate of lions at a large scale within an unfenced ecosystem that has been greatly affected by poaching.

AB  - There are several issues such as low maturity degree of compost product and severe pollution gas emissions during the composting process. Carbon/Nitrogen (C/N) ratio and aeration rate (AR) are the most important factors affecting the composting performance. According to the results of previous studies, the proper C/N ratio and AR were 20-30:1 and 0.1-0.4 L kg(-1) DM center dot min(-1), respectively. Therefore, a lab-scale experiment was con-ducted to investigate the effects of C/N ratio and AR on sheep manure composting process and associated gaseous emissions. The initial C/N ratio in this experiment were set at 23, 26 and 29 to simulate the C/N ratio at low, medium and high levels. The AR were decided at 0.12, 0.24 and 0.36 L kg(-1) DM center dot min(-1) to simulate the aeration at low, middle and high levels. The results showed that as the C/N ratio or AR increased, the methane (CH4) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) emissions decreased. The nitrous oxide (N2O) emission peaked at the low C/N ratio or AR treatments. The total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions decreased with the increase of C/N ratio or AR, and the maximum value occurred in the treatment with C/N ratio 23 and AR 0.24 L kg(-1) DM center dot min(-1). In the treatment with C/N ratio 26 and AR 0.36 L kg(-1) DM center dot min(-1), the GI value of compost product was the highest (about 250%), and the total greenhouse effect was the lowest (2.36 kg CO2-eq center dot t(-1) DM). Therefore, considering reduction of pollution gas emissions and improvement of the quality of compost products comprehensively, the optimum conditions were initial C/N ratio 26 and AR 0.36 L kg(-1) DM center dot min(-1) during the co-composting of sheep manure and cornstalks. In addition, the key physicochemical factors and eight key bacterial communities were deter-mined to regulate compost maturity and pollution gas emissions during the sheep manure composting, which could provide scientific support and theoretical reference for controlling pollution gas emissions and obtaining high quality sheep manure compost products.

AB  - The anaesthetic effectiveness of separate and combined eucalyptus Eucalyptus globulus and oregano Origanum vulgare essential oils (EO) were investigated in silver kob Argyrosomus inodorus and were compared with clove oil Eugenia caryophyllata. Argyrosomus inodorus adults (595.61 [SE 11.82] g) were exposed to three concentrations of oregano EO (OEO: 25, 50 and 100 mu l l(-1)), eucalyptus EO (EEO: 300, 500 and 600 mu l l(-1)), and their mixtures (12.5 mu l l(-1) OEO to 150 mu l l(-1) EEO; 12.5 mu l l(-1) OEO to 300 mu l l(-1) EEO; 25 mu l l(-1) OEO to 150 mu l l(-1) EEO), with each fish treated as a replicate. Fish were also exposed to 40 mu l l(-1) of clove oil (CEO), which acted as a control. The two EOs and their mixtures proved to possess anaesthetic capacity in A. inodorus. Anaesthesia induction time (seconds) decreased with increased concentrations, whereas the inverse was reported for the recovery response. Only OEO qualified as an ideal anaesthetic agent for A. inodorus, especially 25 and 50 mu l l(-1), as the anaesthesia induction times with these concentrations were less than 180 s and recovery was within 300 s. It seems that EEO could achieve greater anaesthetic effectiveness only at a higher concentration (600 mu l l(-1)) or when mixed with OEO (at 25 mu l l(-1) OEO to 150 mu l l(-1) EEO). This study introduces oregano as a promising anaesthetic in A. inodorus compared with clove oil and EEO. However, further evaluations are deemed necessary.

AB  - Aim Population density is a key parameter in ecology and conservation, and estimates of population density are required for a wide variety of applications in fundamental and applied ecology. Yet, in terrestrial mammals these data are available for only a minority of species, and their availability is taxonomically and geographically biased. Here, we provide the most plausible predictions of average population density, their natural variability and statistical uncertainty for 4,925 terrestrial mammal species. Location Global. Time period 1970-2021. Major taxa studied Terrestrial mammals. Methods We fitted an additive mixed-effect model accounting for spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelation on a dataset including 5,412 average population density estimates for 737 species. Average density was modelled as a function of body mass, diet, locomotor habits and environmental conditions. We validated the model using spatial and taxonomic block cross-validation and used the estimated error to quantify the uncertainty around statistical predictions of population density for 4,925 mammal species. Results Small body size, fossorial behaviour and herbivorous diets were associated with the highest population densities, whereas large size, aerial behaviour and carnivorous diets were related to the lowest densities. Species in non-seasonal environments yielded higher densities than species in environments with high precipitation seasonality. Empirical estimates of population density vary by about four times on average within the same species, and statistically independent predictions for the majority of species deviate by about five times from observed values, indicating that prediction errors are similar to the natural variability in population densities. Main conclusions Our predictions and uncertainty estimates of average population densities open up a number of applications in macroecology and conservation biogeography, including biomass estimation, setting population targets in conservation assessments and planning, and supporting Red List assessments. The methodology can be replicated easily for other taxonomic groups with a representative sample of georeferenced density estimates.

AB  - A fundamental assumption of many ecological studies is that researchers are studying a representative sample of the population of interest. However, fish and wildlife studies, including many telemetry studies, often rely upon data from marked individuals that are sampled opportunistically rather than randomly and may provide little information on unmarked individuals. Data that are unrepresentative at the time of marking may need to be censored until marked animal distributions are representative of the population. In the absence of additional data on unmarked individuals, evaluating the representativeness of newly marked individuals within a population of interest can be difficult. If previously marked individuals can be assumed to be spatially representative of the population, comparing the spatial distributions of different cohorts of marked individuals can provide an alternative means to assess the representativeness of newly marked animals. We used simulations to assess the effectiveness of a randomization test that compared the spatial distribution between newly marked and previously marked individuals as an alternative to recapture-based methods for evaluating mixing of newly marked individuals with the population of interest and compared different metrics of spatial overlap. We then tested this randomization test on radio-collared caribou (Rangifer tarandus) from 2 different herds with very different marking strategies. We found that, based on simulation results, kernel-based metrics outperformed cluster analysis metrics and that Bhattacharyya's Affinity (BA) index of kernel overlap was a good metric to identify differences in spatial distribution between marked cohorts. The time it took for newly marked caribou to become mixed with previously marked animals was primarily related to the timing of marking in relation to seasonal movement patterns (periods of aggregation and dispersion, and seasonal differences in spatial fidelity) and the spatial distribution of marking relative to seasonal distribution. In some cases, mixing did not occur until calving aggregations formed in early June. We recommend that researchers evaluate the assumption that marked individuals are spatially representative of their study population and carefully assess sampling time and location of their marking program to increase the likelihood that marked individuals represent the population of interest.

AB  - Ciguatera poisoning (CP) is the most common form of phycotoxin-borne seafood poisoning globally, affecting thousands of people on an annual basis. It most commonly occurs in residential fish of coral reefs, which consume toxin-laden algae, detritus, and reef animals. The class of toxins that cause CP, ciguatoxins (CTXs), originate in benthic, epiphytic dinoflagellates of the genera, Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa, which are consumed by herbivores and detritivores that facilitate food web transfer. A number of factors have hindered adequate environmental monitoring and seafood surveillance for ciguatera including the low concentrations in which the toxins are found in seafood causing illness (sub-ppb), a lack of knowledge on the toxicity equivalence of other CTXs and contribution of other benthic algal toxins to the disease, and the limited availability of quantified toxin standards and reference materials. While progress has been made on the identification of the dinoflagellate taxa and toxins responsible for CP, more effort is needed to better understand the dynamics of toxin transfer into reef food webs in order to implement a practical monitoring program for CP. Here, we present a conceptual model that utilizes empirical field data (temperature, Gambierdiscus cell densities, macrophyte cover) in concert with other published studies (grazing rates and preference) to produce modeling outputs that suggest approaches that may be beneficial to developing monitoring programs: 1) targeting specific macrophytes for Gambierdiscus and toxin measurements to monitor toxin levels at the base of the food web (i.e., toxin loading); and 2) adjusting these targets across sites and over seasons. Coupling this approach with other methodologies being incorporated into monitoring programs (artificial substrates; FISH probes; toxin screening) may provide an "early warning" system to develop strategic responses to potential CP flare ups in the future.

AB  - Artiodactyl livestock animals have a vomeronasal system that detects pheromones. Vomeronasal receptors comprise type 1 (V1R) coupled with G protein ??-i2 (G??i2) and type 2 (V2R) coupled with G protein ??-o (G??o). Laboratory rodents have two segregated V1R and V2R pathways that reach separately to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). In contrast, the AOBs of goats and sheep are entirely positive for G??i2, indicating that they have only the V1R pathway. However, we detected a few V2R genes in the genome of cattle, goats, sheep and pigs by genome assembly. Thus, we immunohistochemically analyzed the AOBs of cattle and pigs to confirm which type of the vomeronasal system is present in artiodactyl livestock species. The glomerular layer of the AOB in cattle and pigs was entirely positive for anti-G??i2 and weakly positive for anti-G??o, as in the V1R uniform type of vomeronasal system in other mammal species. These findings indicated that artiodactyl livestock species have a uniform type of vomeronasal system composing the V1R pathway. Therefore, caution is advised when extrap-olating knowledge of laboratory rodents with two vomeronasal pathways to livestock animals that have one.

AB  - With increasing levels of outdoor recreation activities, consequences for wildlife through interactions with recreationists are highly variable. Behavioural changes in wildlife are one potential consequence of interactions with outdoor recreationists. In ungulate populations, vigilance and flight responses are well-known antipredator behaviours, and an increase in their level indicates a more intense stress level which, ultimately, can have consequences for animal fitness. In Scotland, the geographical distribution of red deer (Cervus elaphus) overlaps greatly with areas used for popular outdoor activities such as hill walking. In this piece of research, we studied red deer time allocation, vigilance, and flight behaviours near a popular hiking path using camera traps. We positioned the cameras in transects at different distances (25, 75, and 150 m) from the path and recorded hiking activity using an automated people counter. Red deer behaviour was categorized from photo analysis as (1) no response (e.g. feeding and resting), (2) vigilant (i.e. upright head position), and (3) flight response. We also investigated demographic variables (group size and sex) and the direction of red deer movement relative to the trail. We used generalised linear mixed models to analyse behaviour in relation to the distance from the hiking track, hiking activity, time of the day, demographic, and environmental variables. We did not find an increase in vigilance or flight behaviour in relation to the distance from the hiking path or the hiking activity. These results suggest that red deer, in our study area, are habituated to the presence of hikers and may spatially avoid areas close to the hiking path instead of displaying cost-intensive behaviour (i.e. flight or vigilance behaviour).

AB  - ContextNumerous wildlife species use a polygynous mating system, where males use auditory courtship behaviors to secure breeding opportunities. The acoustic adaptation hypothesis, risk reward, and landscape of fear theories suggest spatial variation in male auditory courtship will be influenced by areas in landscapes where sound transmission is increased, and predation risk is reduced. However, it is often unclear what landscape features drive spatial variation in courtship behaviors.ObjectivesWe quantified the influence of predation risk, land cover type, and resource selection on spatial trends in the auditory courtship behavior (gobbling activity) of Eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris).MethodsWe used 53,025 gobbles coupled with GPS locations from 111 turkeys and 36 coyotes (Canis latrans), and distance metrics associated with hunter activity and land cover type, to investigate influences of predation risk, resource selection, and land cover type on spatial variation in gobbling activity in Georgia, USA.ResultsDistance to public access during hunting was the most influential predictor of gobbling activity, wherein the expected number of daily gobbles increased by 40% for every 500 m farther from public access. Daily gobbles decreased by 22% for every 500 m farther away from private property during hunting. We failed to find significant effects of land cover type and coyote use but found limited evidence that areas with increased predicted probability of turkey use was associated with increased gobbling.ConclusionsPredation risk associated with increased anthropogenic disturbance had the greatest influence on gobbling activity. Our findings suggest that altering hunter access by closing roads to vehicle use, reducing hunter activity, or creating refuge areas on the landscape could positively influence gobbling activity.

AB  - Due to their invasiveness in North America, grass (Ctenopharyngodon idella), bighead (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) are management priorities. Comparing electrophysiological responses to olfactory cues, such as amino acids, could help identify stimuli to facilitate management efforts (i.e., repellants or baits). We assessed olfactory response magnitude to individual amino acids between fish species using electro-olfactogram recording techniques (EOG). We measured EOG responses (peak EOG magnitude) of juvenile grass (n = 21), bighead (n = 21), and silver carp (n = 22) to 10(-4) molar amino acid solutions containing one of L-alanine, L-arginine, L-aspartic acid, L-asparagine, L-glutamine, or L-glutamic acid. Amino acid EOG responses differed across species; grass carp had the greatest mean EOG response. Statistical analyses showed no inter- or intra-specific differences in EOG response among amino acids. The greater EOG response of grass carp matched their selective grazing habits compared to more passive, generalist-tending, filter-feeding bighead and silver carp. All amino acids elicited significant EOG responses in all species, meaning they are candidates for future behavioral research. Such research could explore the management potential of amino acids, testing if amino acids are attractants or deterrents that could facilitate the removal of these fishes by congregating and/or directing movement.

AB  - Monitoring is critical to assess management effectiveness, but broadscale systematic assessments of monitoring to evaluate and improve recovery efforts are lacking. We compiled 1808 time series from 71 threatened and near-threatened terrestrial and volant mammal species and subspecies in Australia (48% of all threatened mammal taxa) to compare relative trends of populations subject to different management strategies. We adapted the Living Planet Index to develop the Threatened Species Index for Australian Mammals and track aggregate trends for all sampled threatened mammal populations and for small (< 35 g), medium (35-5500 g), and large mammals (> 5500 g) from 2000 to 2017. Unmanaged populations (42 taxa) declined by 63% on average; unmanaged small mammals exhibited the greatest declines (96%). Populations of 17 taxa in havens (islands and fenced areas that excluded or eliminated introduced red foxes [Vulpes vulpes] and domestic cats [Felis catus]) increased by 680%. Outside havens, populations undergoing sustained predator baiting initially declined by 75% but subsequently increased to 47% of their abundance in 2000. At sites where predators were not excluded or baited but other actions (e.g., fire management, introduced herbivore control) occurred, populations of small and medium mammals declined faster, but large mammals declined more slowly, than unmanaged populations. Only 13% of taxa had data for both unmanaged and managed populations; index comparisons for this subset showed that taxa with populations increasing inside havens declined outside havens but taxa with populations subject to predator baiting outside havens declined more slowly than populations with no management and then increased, whereas unmanaged populations continued to decline. More comprehensive and improved monitoring (particularly encompassing poorly represented management actions and taxonomic groups like bats and small mammals) is required to understand whether and where management has worked. Improved implementation of management for threats other than predation is critical to recover Australia's threatened mammals.

AB  - When several polyphagous herbivore species share a parasitoid, the tri-trophic interaction networks can be difficult to predict. In addition to direct effects, the parasitoid may influence the herbivore community by mediating indirect interactions among hosts. The plant species can also modulate the parasitoid preference for a specific host. One of the indirect effects is apparent competition, a negative interaction between individuals as a result of the action of shared natural enemies. Here, we focus on the interactions between the parasitoid Fopius arisanus (Braconidae) and two generalist fruit fly pests: Bactrocera dorsalis and Bactrocera zonata (Tephritidae). This parasitoid was introduced into La Reunion in 2003 to control populations of B. zonata and can also interact with B. dorsalis since its invasion in 2017. Our main objective is to characterize the tri-trophic interactions between F. arisanus, fruit fly and host plant species. We developed a long-term field database of fruit collected before and after the parasitoid introduction and after the B. dorsalis invasion in order to compare parasitism rate and fruit fly infestation for the different periods. In laboratory assays, we investigated how the combination of fruit fly species and fruit can influence the preference of F. arisanus. In the field, before the invasion of B. dorsalis, the parasitism rate of F. arisanus was low and had a little impact on the fruit fly infestation rate. After the B. dorsalis invasion, we observed an increase in parasitism rate from 5% to 17%. A bioassay showed that females of F. arisanus could discriminate between eggs of different fruit fly and host plant species. The host plant species preference changed in relation to the fruit fly species inoculated. Field observations and laboratory experiments suggest the possible existence of apparent competition between B. dorsalis and B. zonata via F. arisanus.

AB  - The analysis of stable isotopes in different tissues has been widely used to obtain information on the ecology and nutritional patterns of wildlife. The isotope ratios of the stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (delta C-13 and delta N-15) analysed in different tissues are directly related to the animal's diet and, to some extent, to the environment where the individual has growth. Specifically, this type of analysis in hair samples has become relevant as it provides information on the quality and long-term composition of the diet that produced the isotope accumulation during the tissue growth. We took samples of wild boar (Sus scrofa) hair from 7 different populations in the south-west of Spain (Mediterranean habitats), in the 2018/2019 hunting season. The main objectives of this study were (i) to investigate the use of hair stable isotopes to reveal differences in composition and quality of the diet of wild boar within the same population or between populations, and (ii) to use hair isotopes as a tool to uncover hidden management practices that may occur in hunting areas associated with the use of supplementary feeding or even captive breeding and release. Each animal had a hair (long 10 cm) analysed in duplicate, previously cut into parts of equal size (from the oldest part of the hair to the most recent part), that were analysed separately. We found differences in delta C-13 and delta N-15 between hair parts and populations, which can be related to management actions at different times during the hair growth. Moreover, the use of corn, a type of plant not occurring naturally in the study area, can be documented with the isotope analysis to prove unauthorized supplementary feeding or captive origin of wild boar in hunting areas.

AB  - Biological manipulation, involving fish stockings, is commonly used to counteract the deterioration of submerged vegetation in eutrophic lakes. Nevertheless, the non-consumptive effects (NCEs) of stocked carnivorous fish are often overlooked. Using a controlled experimental system, we investigated the NCEs of a native carnivorous fish, snakehead (Channa argus), on two key biological factors, herbivore-dominated grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) and disturbance-dominated loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus), influencing submerged plants growth. Additionally, we conducted a meta-analysis on predation risk and primary productivity. The results reveal that predation risk induces oxidative stress damage and affects grass carp growth. Non-significant changes in cortisol and glucose may be linked to predation risk prediction. Simultaneously, predation risk reduces fish feeding and disturbance behavior, relieving pressure on submerged plants to be grazed and disturbed, thereby supporting plant development. The presence of submerged plants, in turn, enhances loach activity and influences water body characteristics through negative feedback. Furthermore, the meta-analysis results indicate the facilitative effect of predation risk on primary producers. Our findings contribute to the understanding of biological manipulation theory. We demonstrate that the predation risk associated with introducing carnivorous fish can promote the growth of submerged plants through behaviorally mediated indirect effects. This highlights the potential utility of predation risk in lake restoration efforts.

AB  - White-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, home range size (HR) is one of the most studied aspects of its biology. However, in the southern portion of its distribution, information about its HR is scarce, limiting the capacity for management of the species. To understand the effect of sex and seasonality on the HR of white-tailed deer in a tropical area, we radiotracked 11 adult white-tailed deer (7 females and 4 males) from 2016 to 2019 in a tropical wetland of western Campeche, Mexico. We found female HR to vary from 12.67 ha (+/- 3.52) in the early dry season to 21.57 ha (+/- 18.14) during the late dry season, and from 37.31 ha (+/- 16.93) for the late dry season to 90.16 ha (+/- 72.64) during the rainy season in males. We did not find differences of HR among seasons. However, we found seasonal differences when we tested separately the HR for females and males, showing that female HR is similar among seasons, whereas males had smaller HR during the dry seasons than during the rainy season. Our results indicate that water availability and flooding levels could affect the HR and configuration of the white-tailed deer in the study area.

AB  - Under the ecological speciation model, divergent selection acts on ecological differences between populations, gradually creating barriers to gene flow and ultimately leading to reproductive isolation. Hybridisation is part of this continuum and can both promote and inhibit the speciation process. Here, we used white-tailed (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (O. hemionus) to investigate patterns of speciation in hybridizing sister species. We quantified genome-wide historical introgression and performed genome scans to look for signatures of four different selection scenarios. Despite ample modern evidence of hybridisation, we found negligible patterns of ancestral introgression and no signatures of divergence with gene flow, rather localized patterns of allopatric and balancing selection were detected across the genome. Genes under balancing selection were related to immunity, MHC and sensory perception of smell, the latter of which is consistent with deer biology. The deficiency of historical gene-flow suggests that white-tailed and mule deer were spatially separated during the glaciation cycles of the Pleistocene and genome wide differentiation accrued via genetic drift. Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities and selection against hybrids are hypothesised to be acting, and diversity correlations to recombination rates suggests these sister species are far along the speciation continuum.

AB  - The white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) is considered a key species for its role as an ecosystem engineer. Given their important ecological function, there is a great concern in the scientific community regarding the many reports of disappearances or great abundance reductions throughout its distribution (from southern Mexico to northern Argentina). Based on an extensive survey effort, we report new data of presence of WLP after a period of no detections in the Argentine Yungas. The study was conducted in the Yungas ecoregion, provinces of Jujuy and Salta, Argentina. Data was collected from camera trap, direct sightings and footprints during 2013-2021. From a total of 30,186 trap nights, we obtained 8 WLP detections. There were no detections before 2017, while as of 2018 there was at least one camera trap record in each of the years. Additionally, opportunistic records were obtained yearly from 2019 to 2021. The period without detections could be related to a period of a population cycle, as suggested in different regions of America during the last century, being disease the most likely cause. These cycles generally follow a pattern of a rapid population decline, a period of absence or low abundance followed by slow population growth. We believe that if the trend continues and the number of detections increases, we could be facing the early stages of the increase phase in the WLP population cycle in the Argentine Yungas. This type of report is important to document and contribute to a better understanding of the WLP population cycle process.

A 32 -day laboratory feeding experiment was conducted to explore the effects of different sizes of the crabs Parasesarma plicatum foraging on leaf litter of Kandelia obovata on OC accumulation in mangrove soils. Mean rates of soil OC accumulation due to leaf foraging by large, medium, and small crabs were 21.11, 16.11, and 0.77 mg C ind-1 d-1, corresponding to the rates of OC removal from leaf litter of 62.60%, 51.37%, and 2.19%, respectively. Large and medium crabs ingested larger amounts of leaf litter, and soil OC accumulation rates resulting from leaf foraging by large and medium crabs were approximately 8 times higher than those by leaf litter decomposition and triple those by non -leaf foraging. Small crabs ingested the smallest amount of leaf litter, which was almost used for their growth and metabolism. These results underline the key ecological roles of leaf foraging by crabs, especially those with large and medium sizes, in OC accumulation in mangrove soils, which is conducive to estimating carbon sequestration in mangrove soils.

AB  - Genetic variation among host plants can influence herbivore behaviour and consequently their abundance, performance and environmental impact. In the Andean-Patagonian forest, the arboreal vegetation is dominated by species of genus Nothofagus. Previous studies of Nothofagus alpina demonstrated differences in genetic diversity among and within its populations. The native caterpillar Perzelia arda feeds on various Nothofagus sp. Our aim was to evaluate host selection behaviour of P. arda larvae towards different genetic pools of N. alpina trees. We collected leaf samples from trees growing in a common garden field trial and evaluated, by paired comparisons, not only differences among provenances but also variation between and within open pollinated families. Our results demonstrated that P. arda performed a choice between the leaves of the host plants offered. This larva was able to choose specific provenances, open pollinated families and genotypes of N. alpina. In conclusion, the larva is guided by characteristics of individuals and host plant species. These innovative results in insect-plant interaction studies demonstrate that it is important to evaluate discrimination between intra-specific hosts. Further study is required to fully understand the use of resources by this native insect, as well as the ecological consequences.

AB  - Simple Summary Porcine circoviruses (PCVs) are major viral agents of farmed swine, causing relevant economic impact due to direct losses and control measures expenses. Wild boar may serve as a PCVs reservoir for the domestic pigs, thus threatening for production efficiency in pig farms. PCV infection in both domestic pigs and wild boar has been chiefly studied in Northern Italy, a densely populated area with a highly developed pork industry. However, data on circulation of PCV are scarce in other Italian areas. For the above reasons, along with the increasing sanitary relevance of wildlife as host of many livestock diseases, we carried out an epidemiological study to assess the prevalence and genetic characteristics of the PCVs circulating in wild boar in Basilicata region (Southern Italy), characterized by large forested areas with limited anthropic presence. A high prevalence was detected, suggesting that PCVs infection is endemic in the study population. These findings are of particular interest as the pig production system of the study area involves local breeds raised outdoor for the production of high-quality cured meat, thus having a high risk of being in contact with infected wild boar. Porcine circovirus (PCV) infection is associated with relevant economic impact to the pig industry. To date, four species of PCV (PCV1 to 4) have been identified but only PCV2 has been associated firmly with disease in pigs. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of PCV2 and PCV3 in the wild boar population in Basilicata region, Southern Italy, since this region is characterized by large forested and rural areas and the anthropic pressure is lower than in other Italian regions. Liver samples from 82 hunted wild boar were collected in 2021 from 3 different hunting districts. Sixty (73%, 95%CI: 63-82) samples tested positive for PCVs by quantitative PCR. In detail, 22 (27%, 95%CI: 18-37) were positive for PCV2, 58 (71%, 95%CI: 60-79) for PCV3, and 20 (24.4%, 95%CI 16-35) for both PCV2 and PCV3. On genome sequencing, different types and sub-types of PCV2 and PCV3 were identified, remarking a genetic diversity and hinting to a global circulation for the identified PCV strains. Overall, the high prevalence suggests that PCV2 and PCV3 infections are endemic in the wild boar population, posing risks for semi-intensive and free-range pig farming, typical of this region, due to contact with PCV-infected wild boar.

AB  - Opportunities to hunt big game species such as elk (Cervus canadensis) are often rationed through a lottery permit system when demand for permits exceeds the population's ability to sustain harvest levels. We conducted a survey of elk hunters and would-be elk hunters in the summer of 2016 to compare elk-hunting constraints among 3 groups of individuals. Groups consisted of 1) individuals who possessed a landowner hunting permit at some point between 2011 and 2016 (Landowner), 2) individuals who did not possess a landowner permit but did possess a general hunting permit between 2011 and 2016 (General), and 3) individuals who had not possessed a Nebraska elk-hunting permit of any kind between 2011 and 2016 but had attempted to draw a permit from the lottery system at least once during these years (Lottery). We used latent class regression to classify survey participants based on their responses to 7 questions related to constraints to elk hunting that were either experienced (Landowner and General) or perceived (Lottery) on a 5-point scale (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree). Probability of latent class membership was estimated for each hunter group. Latent class regression revealed 6 latent classes with Landowner participants most likely to belong to classes who exhibited the least difficulty negotiating all constraints. General and Lottery participants were most likely to fall into classes exhibiting more difficulty negotiating constraints related to interactions with property owners for permissions to hunt on their land. Our findings can assist policy makers and managers with tailoring lottery permit systems, particularly in locations where most of the hunting opportunity is restricted to privately owned land.

AB  - Taenia hydatigena is a tapeworm that affects herbivores in different regions of the world. Cysticercus tenuicollis (larvae of T. hydatigena), is prevalent in ruminants and pigs. In the current study, phylogenetic analysis of the published mt-CO1 gene of C. tenuicollis sheep isolates was analyzed using in-silico method and vertical and horizontal transmission at the global level by using a meta-analysis approach. A total of 82 mt-CO1 nucleotide sequences (339 bp) of C. tenuicollis sheep isolates from the NCBI database (Italy -Sardinia-, Iran, Palestine, Iraq, Finland, India and China) were used to investigate haplotype and genetic relationships. Tajima's D (-2,2984) value was negative for the mt-CO1 sequences signifying the population expansion and/or purifying selection. The highly negative Fu's Fs (-60,528) values determined for the sequences reflecting the existence of uncommon haplotypes. The mt-CO1 of C. tenuicollis haplotype network had 47 haplotypes arranged within a star-like configuration with a main haplotype, which encompassed 25.6 % of the total isolates. In the mt-CO1 haplotype network analyzed, there were 80.5 % unique single haplotype and highest ratio was observed in C. tenuicollis from sheep originating from Iran, followed by Sardinia, Palestine and Finland. If the current condition continues, genetic differences in T. hydatigena will be able to rise, and possible new strains and/or genotypes that may influence the host adaptation and life cycle of the parasite may emerge.

AB  - Understanding the complexities of pasture responses (the overall seasonal gains or losses in herbage mass) under different environmental conditions is critical to the effective management of total grazing pressure, whether to achieve agricultural, cultural or biodiversity conservation outcomes. Whilst large-scale management programmes for kangaroos (Macropus spp. and Osphranter spp.) occur across much of south-eastern Australia, there is limited understanding of how such programmes influence the overall pasture response across different environmental contexts in the temperate environment. This study investigates the effects of potential grass productivity (measured as the growth of pasture protected from large herbivore grazing), initial herbage mass (measured as the attached, above-ground component of grass tussocks), kangaroo density (measured at the site scale) and season on the overall pasture response in plots dominated by six common grass types from south-eastern Australia. Using generalised additive mixed modelling, we demonstrate potential grass productivity (related to but not synonymous with grass palatability) to be the major predictor variable for pasture responses across all six grass types. Kangaroo density, either directly or via an interaction with initial herbage mass, was related to overall pasture responses for most grasses in spring and remained an important variable in favoured areas dominated by preferred Kangaroo Grass (Themeda triandra) and Redleg Grass (Bothriochloa macra) throughout the autumn survey period. Plots dominated by grazing-tolerant species, including wallaby grasses (Rytidosperma spp.) and Phalaris (Phalaris aquatica; an introduced pasture grass), showed marginally positive pasture responses under higher kangaroo densities, whilst plots with Wild Oats (Avena fatua; an introduced annual grass) and less preferred native spear grasses (Austrostipa spp.) showed no significant effect of kangaroo density on pasture response. Results support a context-specific mix of 'bottom-up' (resource-driven) and 'top-down' (consumer-driven) processes in temperate grassy ecosystems, highlighting the importance of considering landscape productivity, existing herbage mass and grass species composition when informing kangaroo management decisions.

AB  - Tokashiki Island with convenient access from urban areas and blessed with rich marine resources, attracts numerous tourists seeking recreational activities such as diving and snorkeling. The island heavily relies on a tourism industry centered on marine resources. However, with the escape and rapid increase in the population of Japanese boars, which were initially introduced as livestock, various damages have become evident. Particularly in recent years, a major concern for local tourism industry stakeholders has been the predation of sea turtle eggs by boars because sea turtles are highly popular marine creatures among snorkelers and divers. Identifying the locations of sea turtle egg predation by wild boars and examining the conditions and situations that increase the likelihood of damage are crucial tasks in considering measures to mitigate the impact. Therefore, in this study, we analyze the factors influencing egg predation using a two-variable logistic regression model. The damage site data from on-site surveys conducted during the 2023 nesting season were utilized along with topographical, land-use, and vegetation data. Explanatory variables included in the regression analysis are average slope angle around the damage sites, predominant vegetation around the damage sites, distance to buildings, distance to roads, distance to rivers, and width of the sandy beach. Results from the regression analysis revealed that the predominant vegetation surrounding the damage sites and the width of the sandy beach significantly influence the risk of damage. Despite encountering challenges during the regression analysis, such as utilizing data from a single year's nesting season, relatively coarse geographical information, and limited explanatory variables, future endeavors should focus on collecting and accumulating more data for a more comprehensive analysis. Nevertheless, this analysis underscores the value of information provided by such studies in establishing spatial priorities for implementing measures to capture wild boars and protect sea turtle eggs in the future.

AB  - IntroductionDeclining hunter populations across North America present wildlife management agencies with the prospect of declining revenues for wildlife conservation and management and the need for new tools to evaluate management strategies and predict future status of game species and hunters.MethodsHere we present a modeling framework and potential decision support tool for managers to link future hunter population dynamics to regulatory restrictiveness, prey abundance, and harvest success. Our hunter model is parameterized based on the authors' judgment and can be used for demonstration purposes. We simulated three scenarios of restricted harvest, moderate harvest and liberal harvest.ResultsOur simulations show that even though liberal harvest predicts higher cumulative license sales revenue, it corresponds with a slight decline in buck abundance over 10 years. In contrast, highly restrictive harvest corresponds with deer population growth, but a near collapse of hunter populations. Our model demonstrates that managers might face tradeoffs between managing for deer population abundance and hunting revenue and clarifies how these factors might affect decision making.DiscussionThe utility of our tool would be dependent on accessing data on hunter retention and recruitment, however, the strength of our paper is in highlighting a new way of thinking about and potentially addressing these potential tradeoffs. Further, these simulations demonstrate that these tools could be used to evaluate management strategies but also highlight uncertainties, establish research priorities, and potentially design an adaptive management framework.

AB  - Concerns relating to cost and availability have directed traditional farmers to expand options on the induced spawning of fish for viable production of seeds. The study was conducted to examine the potential of using pituitary extracts (PE) from goat (Capra aegagrushircus) and pig (Sus scrofa domesticus) on the induced spawning of African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). Pituitary extract of African catfish using 4 mg kg(-1) body weight dosage (control) and PE from goat and pig using 4 mg kg-1 and 200 mg kg(-1) body weight dosages were single intramuscularly injected to female breeders. Utilisation of goat and pig PE has successfully induced the spawning of African catfish. All female breeders attained ovulation within 10-12 h which is under the prescribed latency period. Total number of eggs spawned ranged from 36200 to 67600. The three PE used attained comparable result in terms of relative fecundity. Fertilisation rate revealed that PE from goat at 4 mg kg(-1) dosage attained similar result to that of control treatment. Hatching period occurred within 24 - 36 h and goat PE using both dosages gave the highest results in hatching rate. The current study provides preliminary information on the success of using PE from goat and pig for the induced spawning of African catfish.

AB  - Romanian territory represents a key point in the dispersal of domestic pigs into Europe, due to its geographical position. Our study gathers a high number of samples from different archaeological sites on Romanian territory in order to establish a more accurate chronological view of the spread of domestic pig into Europe and to investigate the possibility of a local domestication process. Approximately 200 samples from 45 archaeological sites on Romanian territory, covering a large period of time, from the Neolithic to the Middle Ages, were subjected to DNA analysis. The sequencing of a short fragment from the D-loop region of the mitochondrial DNA identified a different prevalence of domestic pig genetic signature between two periods of time: the Neolithic period and the Early Bronze Age-Middle Ages period. While the Neolithic period is characterized by the presence of domestic pigs with a Near-Eastern signature, during the Early Bronze Age-Middle Ages period this genetic signature is replaced with a European one. Two European and two Near-Eastern signatures were described for all the analysed samples, each of them prevailing within the wild, respectively domestic Sus scrofa. The data also revealed the introgression process as a form of domestication in Romanian territory.

AB  - Prairie dogs can reduce the carrying capacity on rangelands by up to 50% through direct consumption of vegetation and by clipping plants. Studies have shown that forage quality and digestibility are greater on prairie dog towns than off town; however, research is lacking that quantifies rates of forage and nutrition intake by cattle. In 2012-2016, a study was conducted in South Dakota to evaluate livestock grazing behavior, diet quality, and forage intake on three plant communities in pastures occupied by prairie dogs. Plant communities studied were grass dominated on-town sites (PDOG-GRASS), forb dominated on-town sites (PDOG-FORB), and grass dominated off-town sites (NO-PDOG). Three pastures with varying levels of prairie dog occupation (0%, 20%, and 40%) were studied. Each pasture was grazed by a herd of yearling steers, a subset of which were fitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars. Daily time spent grazing was estimated for each plant community. Forage quality and intake were estimated using ruminally fistulated steers that were allowed to graze in 30-min increments within each plant community for June, July, and August of each year. Rumen samples were weighed and analyzed for forage quality. Intake was calculated as the rate of organic matter per minute and multiplied by average grazing time based on GPS collar data. Livestock grazing preference decreased linearly (P < 0.001) on PDOG-GRASS sites and increased linearly (P = 0.001) for NO-PDOG sites through the growing season. Crude protein content was significantly higher (P = 0.002) on the PDOG-FORB sites versus PDOG-GRASS and NO-PDOG. Few differences in forage quality were evident between the PDOG-GRASS and NO-PDOG communities. Organic matter intake rates were similar between PDOG-GRASS and NO-PDOG communities; PDOG-FORB intake rates were reduced 59% compared with NO-PDOG sites. This study will inform land managers of potential forage contributions of on-town and off-town plant communities in pastures colonized by prairie dogs. (C) 2021 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - The mangrove tree-climbing crab Aratus pisonii (Sesarmidae) is one of the most abundant and iconic arboreal brachyurans in the Neotropics. Despite being traditionally regarded as an herbivorous consumer leaving visible rasping marks on Rhizophora mangle leaves, gut content analyses, field observations and experimental feeding trials also suggest facultative omnivory. In addition, there are still questions regarding the nutritional challenge of leaf consumption, particularly whether the relatively nutrient-poor mangrove leaf litter is assimilated when offered as the sole component of the diet. This study aimed to: 1) experimentally compare consumption rates of fresh (green) and senescent (yellow) Rhizophora mangle leaves during a 26 d experiment; 2) estimating stable isotope trophic discrimination of carbon and nitrogen between leaves and muscle tissue after a 58 d controlled feeding experiment with A. pisonii from the Southwestern Caribbean Sea (Atrato River Delta, Colombia). A. pisonii consumed a total of 17.11 +/- 20.75 mg leaf dry wt (g crab wet wt) -1 d-1 of R. mangle leaves during the experimental trial. However, the consumption was greater for green leaves (12.05 +/- 13.07 mg) than for yellow leaves (5.06 +/- 13.85 mg). Our experimental estimates of mean +/- SD TDFs (trophic discrimination factors) were Delta 13C 5.4 +/- 0.9%o and Delta 15N 3.9 +/- 0.5%o, close to those suggested for other sesarmid crabs. These results can be used in future estuarine food webs studies from Neotropical mangrove habitats, and provide new insights into the importance of A. pisonii as a key herbivore converting low-quality mangrove material into nutritious secondary production (biomass), potentially linking primary producers with intermediate and top predators (both aquatic and terrestrial).

AB  - Native saltbush, Atriplex polycarpa, shrub populations are widely diminished and fragmented in the southern San Joaquin Desert of California due to habitat conversion and invasion by exotic annual grasses of mostly Mediterranean origin. The role these grasses play in saltbush population demography is not well understood. We hypothesized that saltbush seedling recruitment and growth is limited by the competitive interactions with exotic grasses, preventing saltbush stands from maintaining their populations and expanding. We predicted that saltbush seedling recruitment would be reduced by (1) light and moisture competition with the grasses; and (2) the physical barrier of grass residual dry matter (RDM) formed during senescence. To test our predictions, we investigated saltbush seedling recruitment under field conditions across six saltbush populations. We examined how variations in edaphic structure and water availability by site may have affected saltbush seedling recruitment and longer-term population dynamics. In experimental plots where saltbush seeds were sowed, exotic grass RDM reduced saltbush seedling emergence compared to seeds sown in the absence of RDM; competition post-emergence was not significant. Saltbush seedlings transplanted into the field had lower mortality and less herbivory in invaded grassy habitats compared to seedlings planted in bare zones in between established, mature saltbush shrubs. Edaphic variation and water availability by site were likely key factors affecting the success of both grass invasion and saltbush recruitment. Our results suggest that there is a seed-seedling conflict: Sites favorable for saltbush seedling emergence (minimal grass cover among mature shrubs) are unfavorable for seedling survival due to high herbivory. Conversely, sites favorable for saltbush seedling survival (high grass coverage away from mature shrubs) are unfavorable for seedling emergence. The RDM produced by grasses represents an important stabilizing feedback favoring continued grass dominance.

AB  - Rapid climate change has significantly impacted species distribution patterns, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of dominant tree dynamics for effective forest resource management and utilization. The Camellia subgenus Camellia, a widely distributed taxon in subtropical China, represents an ecologically and economically important group of woody plants valued for both oil production and ornamental purposes. In this study, we employed the BIOMOD2 ensemble modeling framework to investigate the spatial distribution patterns and range dynamics of the subgenus Camellia under projected climate change scenarios. Our analysis incorporated 1455 georeferenced occurrence records from 15 species, following the filtering of duplicate points, along with seven bioclimatic variables selected after highly correlated factors were eliminated. The ensemble model, which integrates six single species distribution models, demonstrated robust predictive performance, with mean true skil l statistic (TSS) and area under curve (AUC) values exceeding 0.8. Our results identified precipitation of the coldest quarter (Bio19) and temperature seasonality (Bio4) as the primary determinants influencing species distribution patterns. The center of species richness for the subgenus Camellia was located in the Nanling Mountains and eastern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The projections indicate an overall expansion of suitable habitats for the subgenus under future climate conditions, with notable scenario-dependent variations: distribution hotspots are predicted to increase by 8.86% under the SSP126 scenario but experience a 2.53% reduction under the SSP585 scenario. Furthermore, a westward shift in the distribution centroid is anticipated. To ensure long-term conservation of Camellia genetic resources, we recommend establishing a germplasm conservation center in the Nanling Mountains region, which represents a critical biodiversity hotspot for this taxon.

AB  - The co-existence of antibiotics and heavy metals in soil with manure application poses high risk to both envi-ronment and human health, and thus effective remediation methods are in urgent need. This study investigated the synergistic effects of electrokinetic remediation (EKR) on antibiotic resistance and arsenic (As) in co -contaminated paddy soils. EKR treatments in soil amended with pig manure (EKR-PD) showed better remedia-tion efficiency compared with that without pig manure. In detail, the content of available As and the abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) decreased by 25.2 %-41.4 % and 9.5 %-21.1 % after 7-d remediation, respectively, due to a relatively higher current density for EKR-PD. The role of the electric field contributed to 33.9 % of antibiotic degradation. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) with ribosomal-protection and enzymatic -deactivation types were easier to remove, with the removal ratio of 37.8 %-41.6 % in EKR-PD. Brevundimonas was the most significantly different species during remediation. Bacillus and Clostridium_ sensu_stricto_1 were potential host bacteria of ARGs in the electric field. Membrane transport might be an effective strategy for microorganisms to respond to the stress of both electric field and co-contaminated environments. This study supports the potential role of EKR in the co-contamination of heavy metals and antibiotic resistance under manure application.

AB  - Waterbirds constitute a prominent biota and reflect the ecosystem health and functionality of the freshwater wetlands. Documentation of the bird species assemblages of wetlands is therefore carried out as a part of monitoring of wetlands from a sustainability viewpoint. Using the emerging wetland of Purbasthali, West Bengal, India, as a model study area, the diversity of the associated bird species was estimated to supplement necessary information for conservation management of birds and ecosystems. The point count method was applied to count the waterbirds from each sighting location with a 25 m radius covering 360 degrees arc and the counting period lasted 10 min for each site, and counts were made in the winter of 2016/2017. The data on the waterbirds encountered were recorded and subjected to diversity analysis, including the residential status, global population trend and feeding guilds. Apparently, the wetland was considered as suitable habitat for 27 waterbird species, which could be grouped under 24 genera, 10 families and 5 orders. Among these, the family Anatidae with maximum relative density and abundance dominated in the wetland. Out of the 27 recorded species, 5 species were widespread winter visitors, 3 species widespread resident, as well as, widespread winter visitors and 2 species were sparse local winter visitors. A globally near threatened species, the Black-headed Ibis (Threskiornis melanocephalus) was very common in the sampling sites. The waterbird assemblage in the wetland was dominated by carnivores followed by omnivores and herbivores. The abundance of the waterbirds with considerable variations in the foraging guild reflects availability and exploitation of multiple resources of the Purbasthali wetlands. Prominence in the differences in relative abundance of the different waterbirds could be linked with the heterogeneity in the habitat quality. The present information on waterbird assemblage calls for appropriate measures for conservation of the species and appropriate management of Purbasthali wetlands.

AB  - Ailanthus excelsa, family Simaroubaceae is a deciduous, perennial, and fast-growing multipurpose tree commonly known as Tree of Heaven and is widespread in the semi-arid to temperate region of central India, southern India and Sri Lanka. Its leaves are used as fodder for cattle, goats, sheep, and camels. The tree has been widely explored in the ancient Indian traditional medicine system of Ayurveda to cure asthma, dysentery, pile, and leucorrhea. The plant has many pharmacological properties, viz. antihelminthic, antiamoebic, antiplasmodial, anti-inflammatory, antidiarrheal, antifertility, antioxidant, and antimicrobial. The plant is also known to have many phytochemicals such as alkaloids and flavonoids besides proteins, fatty acids, and carbohydrates. The present review first presents the state of knowledge regarding the geographical distribution, ecology, morphology, propagation methods, growth performances, and genetic diversity, of Ailanthus excelsa. It then summarizes what is known regarding its phytochemical components and their pharmaceutical properties. It finally explores the various uses (traditional medicine, bio-remediation, biofuel, feed-fodder, timber) of A. excelsa reported in the literature as well as its potential as an agroforestry tree crop. We believe this review will be useful for researchers aiming to develop a comprehensive understanding of this important tree species and for those wishing to explore more specific characteristics of the tree or/and of its uses.

AB  - Across most of their native North American range, the horns of mountain sheep (Ovis spp.) males are getting smaller, a pattern attributed to selective hunting pressure. We measured the horns of 755 Dall's sheep males (Ovis dalli dalli) in the southern Mackenzie Mountains, Northwest Territories, between 2002 and 2017. For each male, we measured the circumference and length of each annulus for the right horn and calculated horn volume for each year. We examined changes in horn size in 4 different outfitter areas, using age at harvest as a covariate. Hunting pressure across years in the study area was consistently low, and this population did not experience the decline in horn size observed in several other mountain sheep populations in Canada. Over the 16-year period, the average horn volume of harvested males was stable and even increased in 1 outfitter area. Local management of Dall's sheep delivered independently by the guide outfitters in the Mackenzie Mountains appears to contribute to maintaining a population of males that has not been adversely affected by strong selective hunting pressure. The resilience of this management strategy may be challenged by environmental changes associated with rapid warming in northern mountain environments.

AB  - A conceptual conversion from material/energy flow to information flow is presented in this study for evaluating network environment analysis (NEA) within the naphthalene-contaminated groundwater ecosystems under stochastic-fuzzy uncertainties. Four components (i.e., vegetation, herbivore, soil microorganism, and carnivore) are considered into the NEA framework for quantifying their direct and integral ecological risks. Carcinogenic risk related to human health concern is also evaluated under four remediation periods. The developed method is then applied to a power plant site. Results reveal that the average naphthalene concentration after pump-andtreat treatment would significantly decrease from 8.672 to 1.232 mu g/L when remediation period extends to 10 years. The probabilities of suffering from carcinogenic risk would reach 0.9862, 0.9566, 0.8746, and 0.6142 under different remediation periods. Soil microorganism would receive more input risk than vegetation owing to its higher vulnerability. Although the upper-layer components (such as herbivore and carnivore) are not exposed to risk sources, they would gradually accumulate to a high-level ecological risk through food chains. Sensitivity analysis shows that variations in standard boundaries would have a significant impact on the risks of all components within groundwater ecosystems. This study can offer a novel perspective and methodology for comprehensively assessing the system-scale environment risks.

AB  - The Cuvier's gazelle Gazella cuvieri is a vulnerable species of high conservational importance, which is endemic in Northwestern Africa. The present study aimed to characterize gastrointestinal parasites in G. cuvieri and to understand the relationship between seasonality factor and parasitic infection rates as well as to analyse their conservational importance in seasonally-variable environments in northern Algeria. To-tally, 48 faecal samples were analysed and ten gastrointestinal parasite species were identified, represent-ing seven species of gastrointestinal helminths and three species of parasitic protozoans. It was observed that the seasonal faecal samples were mostly infected with Nematodirus sp. (prevalence 97.9 %). The overall prevalence of Marshallagia sp. and Eimeria sp. were significantly very higher in rainfall season compared to harsh environmental season. The highest gastrointestinal parasite counts were recorded dur-ing and soon after peak rainfall, while the lowest value was in the dry season. These findings show that seasonality can be an important driver of gastrointestinal parasitic infections. It seems that observations such as the high prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites and intensity of the infection, especially in the winter season, should be specifically considered by the wildlife conservation officers. This study could be the key to success in the long-term conservation of this vulnerable species in its native range and in providing a wealth of new information about parasite biodiversity.

AB  - Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) is the most abundant forage fish species in Arctic seas and plays a pivotal role in the transfer of energy between zooplankton and top predators. The dominance of Arctic cod and the Arctic's relatively low biodiversity interact such that changing population dynamics of Arctic cod have cascading effects on whole Arctic marine ecosystems. Over the last decades, warming in the Arctic has led to a decline in Arctic cod populations in the Barents Sea, but in the Canadian Arctic these conditions have been correlated with up to a 10-fold higher biomass of age -0 Arctic cod at the end of summer. However, whether this enhanced larval survival with warmer waters endures through age-1+ populations is unknown. A better understanding of spatial variation in the response of Arctic cod populations to environmental conditions is critical to forecast future changes in Arctic ecosystems. Here, we rely on a 17-year time series of acoustic-trawl surveys (2003-2019) to test whether ice-breakup date, sea surface temperature, zooplankton density, and Arctic climate indices during early life stages affect the subsequent recruitment of age-1+ Arctic cod in the Beaufort Sea and Baffin Bay. In the Beaufort Sea, the biomass of age-1+ Arctic cod correlated with both Arctic Oscillation indices and age -0 biomass of the previous year. In Baffin Bay, the biomass of age-1+ Arctic cod correlated with previous-year North Atlantic Oscillation indices and the timing of ice breakup. This study demonstrates that climate and environmental conditions experienced during the early life stages drive the recruitment of the age-1+ Arctic cod population and helps to quantify spatial variation in the main environmental drivers.

AB  - Licuala ferruginea Becc., a tropical forest understorey palm, is observed to have fruits that appear red in colour when unripe, turning pink, then white, purple and finally black in colour as they ripen. We monitored 13 fruiting palms in rainforest fragments and recorded the consumption of fruits by animals via camera traps. We also documented the fruiting phenology of two palms in the nursery. In the rainforest fragments, a Cream-vented Bulbul (Pycnonotus simplex) was observed plucking a mature purple fruit from a L. ferruginea palm, before flying away with the fruit in its beak. This was the only bird that was observed feeding on the mature fruit. A range of mammals, dominated by edge species such as the Long-tailed Macaque and Wild Boar, were observed to consume L. ferruginea fruits indiscriminately across all five colour stages, thereby limiting the dispersal of the fruits. Forest bulbul gape sizes also matched the fruit size, suggesting that forest bulbuls are the likely dispersers of the palm in the original forest where edge species are not in high densities. We further posit that the initial phase of red fruits, with high contrasting red reflectance against a green foliage background, might be a form of early advertisement to birds. The fruit then turns pink and white, which have high green reflectance and is less contrasting, thereby reducing the conspicuity of the fruit. This allows the fruit to ripen with high fructose and glucose content, and turn purple and black, which are known visual cues for birds. This study provides indicative support for the dispersal syndrome hypothesis and highlights the potential effects of forest fragmentation on plant-frugivore interactions.
   We record the changes in colour, sugar content, reflectance and predation of the fruits of a tropical understorey palm, Licuala ferruginea, as they ripen. Based on these signatures, we posit that the fruits are likely dispersed by birds such as forest bulbuls, and are predated upon but ineffectually dispersed by edge forest mammal species such as wild boar and long-tailed macaques. This studdy provides indicative support for the dispersal syndrome hypothesis and highlights the potential effects of forest fragmentation on plant-frugivore interactions.image

AB  - Carrion is increasingly recognized as an important part of food web ecology that impacts multiple trophic levels and creates an arena for multiple species interactions. The pulsed nature of hunter-derived carrion, in the form of gut piles, is a form of carrion that has been overlooked in the study of food webs and scavenger interaction. The Offal Wildlife Watching project aims to better understand scavenger species that benefit from offal and how they interact with each other and this resource. Through citizen science efforts by hunters and Zooniverse volunteers, we have collected and analyzed over 230,000 images of scavengers at white-tailed deer gut piles. At some gut piles, we have observed barred owls and bobcats both scavenging at hunter provided gut piles and preying on rodents that were also attracted to the gut pile. This interaction, made possible by a food subsidy that is historically novel in time and space, may have implications for rodent populations, predator survival and fecundity, and the activity patterns of both. Continued research and investigation will shed light on the impacts of cascading carrion on species interaction.

AB  - The changes in semen and cryodamage after the cryopreservation process negatively affect sperm function and motility. However, possible proteomic alterations of yak semen during cryopreservation have not yet been achieved. In this study, we compared proteomes of fresh and frozen thawed yak sperm using iTRAQ combined with LC-MS/MS proteome approach. Totally, 2064 proteins were quantitatively identified, including 161 in fresh sperm that showed significant differences compared to frozen thawed sperm. According to the Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) are predominantly associated with spermatogenesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, ATP synthesis, and differentiation biological process. Furthermore, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that DEPs were mainly involved in metabolic pathways related to pyruvate metabolism, carbon metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, together with the citrate (TCA) cycle. In the analysis of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, 15 potential proteins (PDHB, DLAT, PDHA2, PGK1, TP5C1, etc.) that could be related to the sperm quality of the yaks were obtained. Furthermore, 6 DEPs were validated by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), confirming that the iTRAQ data were reliable. These results indicate that cryopreservation alters the proteome of yak sperm, which is possibly related to cryodamage and fertilization ability.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of data on the circumstances surrounding the bites, which undermines the development of effective mitigation measures. To address this gap, we actively tracked reports involving aggressive dogs in the Kampala metropolitan area in Central Uganda. Our approach included tracing the responsible dogs to rule out rabies and conducting interviews with victims and community members. We investigated seven incidents, including two rampages, two instances of aggressive behavior in dogs, two cases of livestock predation, and one incident where a dog strayed into a residence. In three of the seven incidents, the dogs managed to escape due to factors such as nighttime cover, easy access to hideouts in slums, and limited community support. Of the four dogs that were traced, three were confirmed positive for rabies using the fluorescent antibody test. In total, 53 bite cases were recorded, affecting 29 humans-predominantly children (72.4 %)-and 24 animals, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, pet dogs, and poultry. Notably, the two rampages accounted for 47 bite cases (88.7 %), with the highest dog-to-bite incident ratio of 1:37 occurring in Matugga, Wakiso District. Despite 96.6 % of the human victims being eligible for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) due to sustaining deep wounds, 58.6% sought treatment from traditional healers, 13.8 % self-medicated with local herbs, and 3.4% did not take any intervention. The community's response to the rampages was to kill the responsible dogs. However, in one instance where the dog could not be traced, the community resorted to indiscriminately killing roaming dogs in the area, using sticks and stones in a mob. Our study underscores the significant threat that FRDs pose in the transmission of rabies. To achieve the global target of eliminating dog- mediated rabies by 2030, it is essential to enhance rabies vaccination coverage for dogs to meet the WHO- recommended threshold of 70 %. Additionally, mass education efforts should be prioritized at both the community level and in schools, particularly in areas where rabies is endemic and dogs roam freely.

AB  - Losses in coffee crops due to the pest attack harm up to 50% of production. In an attempt to control the progress of these herbivores, chemical inputs are used on crops, but with limited success and negative impact on biodiversity and on human health. We investigated in a field experiment whether cover crop intercropping with coffee would reduce coffee pest population by increasing natural enemy abundance. The cover crops Crotalaria juncea and Fagopyrum esculentum were selected based on agronomic traits and on the provision of food resources to natural enemies. They were tested in plots in a single cultivation and in mix combination intercropped with coffee. The control treatment was represented by coffee monoculture with bare soil. Predation rate of a key coffee pest, the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera coffeella, was higher in intercropped plots than in the monoculture. Increased parasitism rate of L. coffeella was found in plots intercropped with F. esculentum. However, during the experimental period, L. coffeella abundance was not affected by the cover crops. Phytophagous mites from Tetranychidae family were less abundant when coffee was intercropped with C. juncea. Their predators, Phytoseiidae mites, were more abundant on coffee intercropped with C. juncea and C. juncea plus F. esculentum. Diversification of coffee crops by intercropping with cover crops promotes biological control of phytophagous mites and shows potential for coffee leaf miner control. These results, together with the improvement of chemical, physical and biological characteristics of the soil and reduced weed competition, make cover crop intercropping a suitable strategy for coffee cultivation.

AB  - Analysis of long-term trends in abundance of animal populations provides insights into population dynamics. Population growth rates are the emergent interplay of inter alia fertility, survival, and dispersal. However, the density feedbacks operating on some vital rates ("component feedback") can be decoupled from density feedbacks on population growth rates estimated using abundance time series ("ensemble feedback"). Many of the mechanisms responsible for this decoupling are poorly understood, thereby questioning the validity of using logistic-growth models versus vital rates to infer long-term population trends. To examine which conditions lead to decoupling, we simulated age-structured populations of long-lived vertebrates experiencing component density feedbacks on survival. We then quantified how imposed stochasticity in survival rates, density-independent mortality (catastrophes, harvest-like removal of individuals) and variation in carrying capacity modified the ensemble feedback in abundance time series simulated from age-structured populations. The statistical detection of ensemble density feedback from census data was largely unaffected by density-independent processes. Long-term population decline caused from density-independent mortality was the main mechanism decoupling the strength of component versus ensemble density feedbacks. Our study supports the use of simple logistic-growth models to capture long-term population trends, mediated by changes in population abundance, when survival rates are stochastic, carrying capacity fluctuates, and populations experience moderate catastrophic mortality over time.

AB  - Pulsed resources can dramatically influence spatial ecology of wildlife. Black vulture (Coragyps atratus) movements depend on habitat structure and foraging opportunities, but their responses to pulsed resources are poorly understood. In contrast, changes to home ranges during large-game hunting seasons are well documented in mammalian predators. Thus, we hypothesized that increased access to carrion would decrease black vulture space use. To test for changes in space use, we quantified home ranges using data from 12 GPS-tagged black vultures during nonhunting, archery-only, and firearms study periods in Indiana and Kentucky, USA. We compared estimated home range size, home range overlap, density of forest edge, and density of roads within each home range. Home range sizes decreased 52.9% from the nonhunting to archery-only period (t(35) = 2.77, P = 0.024), then remained stable (increased 9.98%, t(35) = -0.25, P = 0.967) throughout the firearms period. Home range overlaps decreased with greater resource pulse intensities. Estimated forest edge and road densities within home ranges did not change across study periods. Black vultures in our study area changed space use in response to pulsed resources associated with deer hunting. Thus, vultures may shift space use in response to other resource pulses, such as afterbirth and stillbirths from livestock. Pulsed resource locations can serve as targeted survey sites for estimating scavenger abundance and distribution. Integrating resource pulse dynamics into wildlife management strategies can improve efforts to monitor disease risks at aggregation sites and address ecological challenges arising from human activities.

AB  - Plant biogeography and ongoing changes in plant distributions are influenced by long-distance dispersal (LDD) of seeds, and migratory waterfowl (Anatidae: Ducks, geese and swans) are particularly important for the dispersal of plants in and around wetlands through gut passage (endozoochory). However, this dispersal is not contemplated by classical dispersal syndromes; hence, currently we have limited understanding of what angiosperm traits predict seed dispersal by waterfowl and any differences due to avian trait variation among waterfowl species. We conducted a literature search for data on the presence of seeds in the alimentary canal or faeces of North American waterfowl as a proxy for dispersal interactions, since an important fraction of these seeds survives gut passage. We present a list of North American flowering plant species (N = 536) from 95 families potentially dispersed by 38 waterfowl species, together with traits of these plants and their vectors. Owing largely to limited sampling effort, 47% of plant species and 35% of plant genera recorded were only found in a single waterfowl species. A suite of analytical approaches revealed major differences in the traits of plants whose seeds are ingested and likely dispersed between foraging groups (guilds) and in relation to other waterfowl traits. Diving ducks and sea ducks are associated with sublittoral plants that have submerged or floating leaves, and hence with the classical hydrochory syndrome. Dabbling ducks and herbivorous waterfowl (notably geese) are associated with terrestrial herbaceous plants, and also with the unspecialised dispersal syndrome common in terrestrial plants. Plants with larger seeds or of greater height are more likely to be dispersed by dabbling ducks, whereas shorter plants are more likely to be dispersed by geese than by other waterfowl. Network analyses of interactions between waterfowl species and plant traits were generally consistent with these results, but also provided evidence that not all geese, dabbling ducks, or sea duck species are alike in their interactions with plants along the terrestrial-aquatic gradient, but instead occupy distinct dispersal niches. The traditional classification of waterfowl into guilds therefore does not accurately reflect their differing roles in the ingestion and dispersal of plant seeds. Aquatic plant species had more vector species than terrestrial ones. Detailed studies of waterfowl endozoochory and more trait determinations for North American plants are needed to facilitate predictions of LDD as waterfowl population sizes and migration patterns vary in the future with climate change.

AB  - Simple Summary This study addresses the growing risk of tick bites, which is becoming more prevalent due to changes in landscape, leading to an increase in wildlife that supports tick populations, raising the risk of disease transmission to humans and animals. To better understand this, we explored the ecology of ticks by examining the relationship between wildlife presence and tick abundance in two regions: an alpine hunting district and a natural park in the Apennines. We used camera traps to monitor wildlife and conducted tick sampling nearby. Additionally, we considered factors like altitude, vegetation, and climate. Our findings highlight the significant role of altitude and wildlife presence-both influenced by habitat and land management-in the global abundance of ticks in the environment. In particular, the species most impacting tick presence was roe deer. These insights could be valuable for managing natural environments, helping to reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases, and they show the utility of camera trap data, which are gathered with great detail and little disturbance of wildlife.Abstract The increase in acarological risk of tick bites is significantly driven by profound changes in landscape, which alter the density and distribution of wildlife that support tick populations. As a result of habitat shifts and land abandonment, which create environments conducive to tick proliferation, the risk of disease transmission to humans and animals is increasing. In this context, it is important to explore tick ecology by applying a comprehensive methodology. In this study, we examined the relationship between wildlife temporal occupancy and tick abundance in two distinct regions: an alpine hunting district and a natural park in the Apennines. For each sampling point, we calculated wildlife temporal occupancy from camera trap pictures and estimated ticks' abundance from dragging transects in the area immediately surrounding camera traps. In modelling the relationship between those two variables, we included abiotic factors such as saturation deficit, normalized difference vegetation index, and altitude. Results show the importance of altitude and wildlife temporal occupancy (itself related to different habitat and land management characteristics) on the ecology of questing ticks. If employed in management decisions for natural environments, such information is useful to modulate the acarological risk and thus the risk of tick-borne pathogens' transmission.

AB  - Simple Summary Internal parasitism has been an important constraint to small ruminant production and anthelmintic resistance has become a worldwide issue. This study evaluated a 3-year genetic selection program through activities on-farm and a centralized performance test and also provided estimates of genetic parameters of growth and response to artificial infection with Haemonchus contortus by goats and sheep in the southcentral USA. Considerable species as well as breed differences were found in average daily gain and response to parasite infection. Average daily gain was greater for Boer than for Kiko and Spanish goats and slightly greater for Dorper than for St. Croix sheep. Infection level (number of eggs found in feces) of Spanish and St. Croix were relatively low each year, whereas that of Kiko and Dorper was lower after selection. An indicator of anemia (packed cell volume) did not always reflect infection level, which is probably reflective of differences among animals in resilience and susceptibility to haemonchosis. Moderate to high heritabilities were found for growth performance and response to parasite infection for growing meat goat and hair sheep males under a standardized environment that suggests considerable potential for genetic improvement through selection. Internal parasitism has been the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in small ruminants in many areas such as the southcentral USA. Among the different approaches and management practices to cope with internal parasitism, genetic selection for internal parasite resistance is recognized as one with considerable potential long-term impact. A central performance test with artificial infection of Haemonchus contortus for selection of growing meat goats and hair sheep for breeding to increase resistance to internal parasitism and on-farm selection of females was conducted for 3 years. The results varied considerably among breeds of goats and flocks of sheep. Spanish goats and St. Croix sheep maintained relatively low fecal egg count (FEC) each year, whereas for goats categorized as being of high resistance and Dorper sheep FEC decreased with advancing year. Packed call volume (PCV) and total serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were not strongly related to FEC. Genetic parameters varied between the two species, which might be related to previous selection pressure exerted for parasite resistance. Heritability of FEC was higher in goats than sheep. The genetic correlation between FEC and IgM and IgG was negative for both species, which suggests possible genetic association. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between ADG and FEC were nonsignificant for both species. In conclusion, different relationships of FEC and PCV between species require careful attention during selection and the lack of relationship between ADG and FEC suggests that selection of growing male meat goats and hair sheep for resistance to internal parasitism will not adversely affect growth performance.

AB  - African elephants Loxodonta africana can alter the structural components of savanna ecosystems, often through the reduction of the large tree (>= 5 m height) cover component. Elephant impact can be amplified in small, protected areas, or areas where water is readily available to elephants. One management option is to protect large trees directly using applied mitigation methods to limit elephant impact. In this paper, we assessed and compared the effectiveness and logistical requirements of four mitigation methods that have been applied to protect large trees from elephant impact in South Africa's Greater Kruger National Park - namely African honeybees Apis mellifera scutellata in beehives; creosote oil in glass jars, concrete pyramids arranged in circles around trees, as well as wire-netting the trees' main stems. For each method, elephant impact levels and tree mortality rates were measured over a 2-5-year period depending on the method in use. Sample sizes ranged from 43 to 59 trees per mitigation method, with a comparable control, which was a tree of the same species and morphological dimensions but lacking any mitigation application. Beehives were the most effective method at reducing tree loss, significantly reducing tree mortality from 34% (6.8%/year) in control trees to only 10% (2% year(-1)) over the five-year experimental period. However, beehives were the most expensive method to apply to a tree, although this cost can be compensated through honey sales. Concrete pyramids reduced tree loss when the combined pyramid radius was > 1.5 m in length, whilst wire-netting was effective against bark-stripping by elephants but was still vulnerable to heavier forms of impact such as uprooting and stem snapping. Creosote jars did not prevent elephants from impacting treated trees. Our results provide managers with a toolkit for protecting large trees against elephant impact, commenting on both the efficacy and the logistical constraints for each method.

AB  - Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) is economically one of the most important conifer species in Europe. Spruce forests are threatened by outbreaks of the bark beetle Ips typographus L., and this will worsen with a projected warmer and drier climate and increased outbreak dynamic following storms. Volatile terpenes and aromatics play pivotal roles in defence of trees, however little is known about the emission dynamics of these compounds from trees colonized with I. typographus, particularly in dependence on the beetle's developmental stages and colonization densities. Here, we analysed the emission profiles of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from spruce logs colonized with low (LDT) and high (HDT) densities of I. typographus from the initial colonization until the emergence of the next beetle generation. A first VOCs emission peak appeared directly after colonization and lasted for 1 week. It mainly consisted of monoterpenoids and most likely reflected the trees' constitutive defence against herbivory. Under HDT, a second emission maximum occurred during the larval stage, whereas under LDT a second peak appeared later during maturation feeding of callow beetles. In contrast to the first peak, sesquiterpenoids, aromatics and oxygenated monoterpenoids dominated the second peak, possibly reflecting the trees' induced defence. Developing beetles seem to face a variety of defence compounds even if the tree has been overwhelmed and colonization by parental beetles was already successful. The specific release patterns under LDT and HDT might be due to different availability of precursor compounds, depletion of constitutively stored compounds and differences in microbial activities associated with the bark beetles. The present study highlights constitutive defence of spruce trees upon herbivore attack, and the effect of infestation density on the temporal dynamics of induced defence. Particularly the oxygenated monoterpenoid terpinen-4-ol may be used as cue to assess habitat quality and competition by newly arriving beetles.

AB  - Invasive species have competitive advantages over neighboring native species and decrease the biodiversity of the local community. The novel weapon hypothesis suggests that invasive plants affect local plants and suppress soil-borne pathogens by exuding allelochemicals to facilitate invasion. Therefore, the following study was designed by focusing on the extracts derived from certain parts of plants, and the impact of the collected root exudates of invasive plants on soil-borne pathogens has been documented, but there is still a need to identify its mechanisms. We conducted several experiments to test whether the alien invasive plant species Wedelia trilobata (L.) Hitchc. can suppress soil-borne pathogens through its root exudates. We also attempted to explain the inhibition mechanism of the root exudates on soil-borne pathogens. The results showed that the root exudates of W. trilobata significantly inhibited the growth and activities of soil-borne pathogens under sterile petri dish and sand cultures. Specifically, root exudates decreased the conidial germination, mycotoxin production, and hydrolytic enzyme (pectinase, cellulase, and amylase) activities of soil-borne pathogens in liquid culture, indicating the inhibition mechanism of root exudates of W. trilobata on soil-borne pathogens. Our results provided direct evidence that the root exudates of W. trilobata help it to spread by suppressing resident pathogens and promoting its invasion.

AB  - Fishes of the genus Rhinogobius (Gobiidae) display paternal care of their nests, constructed beneath stones. Rhinogobius flumineus often coexist with larger Rhinogobius congeners (hence, stronger competitors for the nest site). To understand how R. flumineus reproduce successfully with the presence of a potential nest site competitor, nest-use characteristics of R. flumineus and Rhinogobius nagoyae were investigated in two rivers in southern central Honshu, Japan: one site with both species in sympatry and the other site with R. flumineus in allopatry. Analyses of nest stone, egg clutch, and male body sizes demonstrated that reproductive success, namely the number of eggs deposited, increased with male body size in both species and was positively correlated with nest stone size only in R. nagoyae. The pattern that R. flumineus males are less insistent on using large stones for nesting may partly explain the coexistence mechanism of the two species.

AB  - The effects of hunting on predator-avoidance behaviour are increasingly being recognised on land but have received less attention in marine systems. We examined whether predator-avoidance behaviour of temperate reef fishes differed between areas protected and not protected from recreational fishing by examining the flight-initiation distance (FID; the distance a predator can approach before the prey animal flees) of six common species in southeastern Australia. By testing species that ranged in desirability to recreational fishers, we could determine if behavioural differences were specific to target species or extended more broadly throughout the assemblage. After accounting for potential variability among sites within protection levels, we found that the FID of all species was higher in fished areas than protected areas, with FID up to 2.4 times higher in fished areas. The two commonly targeted species had the greatest FID response to fishing. FID also increased with body size for all but one species. Our findings indicate the potential for assemblage-wide effects of fishing on predator-avoidance behaviour and are consistent with an indirect mechanism of behavioural modification.

AB  - BACKGROUNDInvasive ungulates (hoofed mammals), including deer, feral pigs, feral goats, and feral sheep, are known to cause damage to agriculture, property, natural resources, and many other commodities. Most of the information regarding the economic impacts of wild ungulates is from North America, where some of these species are native. To evaluate invasive ungulate damage to livestock producers in the Hawaiian Islands, which have no native ungulates, a survey was distributed to livestock producers across the state.RESULTSSurvey results described how total annual costs are distributed among damage, control, and repairs for survey respondents, who represented a significant percentage of total ranchland acreage across the islands. The estimates, excluding fixed fence installation, revealed an annual cost to livestock producers who responded to the survey of US$1.42 million, which ranged from $3.6 million to $7.5 million when extrapolated to the entire state. The large cost contributors included damage to property, pastureland repair, control costs (excluding fencing), supplemental feed, and predation of calves by wild pigs. Additionally, producers reported spending more than $2 million in upfront fence installation costs. Most of these costs were reported by respondents on the islands of Hawai'i and Moloka'i.CONCLUSIONStudy results revealed substantial damage to state livestock producers due to wild ungulates and are useful in determining an invasive ungulate management strategy that can appropriately aid the most impacted sectors of Hawai'i.

AB  - Simple Summary Monensin has been successfully used in the ruminants' diets to manipulate ruminal fermentation and improve feed efficiency, but its use is facing decreased levels of social acceptance due to the potential impacts on public health. Understanding the ruminal bacterial community successions in response to monensin supplementation would help the search for alternatives. We found that the ruminal ecosystem was reshaped through a series of succession processes during the adaption to monensin rather than following a clear dichotomy between Gram-positive and Gram-negative cell types, and the carbohydrate-degrading bacteria presented a higher adaptability. Therefore, a potential alternative for monensin as a rumen modifier could be one with similar patterns of ruminal microbial community successions. Previous studies have demonstrated that the effects of monensin on methanogenesis and ruminal fermentation in ruminants were time-dependent. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we investigated the ruminal bacterial community successions during the adaptation to monensin supplementation and subsequent withdrawal in goats. The experiment included a baseline period of 20 days followed by a treatment period of 55 days with 32 mg monensin/d and a washout period of 15 days. Monensin supplementation reduced the alpha diversity and changed the structure of ruminal microflora. The alpha diversity was gradually restored during adaption, but the structure was still reshaped. The temporal dynamics of 261 treatment- and/or time-associated ruminal bacteria displayed six patterns, with two as monensin-sensitive and four as monensin-resistant. The monensin sensitivity and resistance of microbes do not follow a clear dichotomy between Gram-positive and Gram-negative cell types. Moreover, the temporal dynamic patterns of different bacterial species within the same genus or family also displayed variation. Of note, the relative abundance of the total ruminal cellulolytic bacteria gradually increased following monensin treatment, and that of the total amylolytic bacteria were increased by monensin, independent of the duration. In conclusion, under the pressure of monensin, the ruminal ecosystem was reshaped through a series of succession processes, and the carbohydrate-degrading bacteria presented a higher level of adaptability.

AB  - The largest land use change in Europe is woodland expansion, through planting and natural regeneration. Unforeseen consequences of this could include changes in environmental hazards, such as exposure to parasites and pathogens. Tick-borne Lyme disease is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere and is often associated with woodlands. Therefore, to inform the planning and management of expanding woodlands, we test how land covers that reflect different types and stages of the woodland expansion process, along with their deer management, impact tick densities and Lyme disease hazard (density of infected nymphs). We also test whether differences in rodent abundance play a mechanistic role in explaining differences in Lyme disease hazard. In Northwest Scotland, a touristic area undergoing woodland expansion, we recorded deer management, rodent densities, Ixodes ricinus nymph densities, pathogen prevalence and Lyme disease hazard between open moorland, young pine and mature pine, and birch and spruce. These represent pre-, early and late stage woodland establishments, and the three woodland types in the region. Rodents, ticks, pathogen prevalence and Lyme disease hazard were generally lowest in moorland and young pine and highest in mature woodland, especially birch, although variability was high. Deer management reduced tick densities and, marginally, Lyme disease hazard. There was insufficient evidence for rodents increasing Lyme disease hazard, but rodents augmented tick densities and the most abundant Lyme disease pathogen was that transmitted by rodents. Practical implication. woodland expansion could, once mature, eventually lead to higher tick densities, pathogen prevalence and Lyme disease hazard. Importantly, an environmental solution could be to control deer populations.

AB  - Change in the subtidal reef fish assemblage at Kuchierabu-jima Island, southern Japan, since the 1970s was investigated using an underwater visual census in October 2005. A comparison of this survey with data from 1972 revealed that the frequencies of species that had either increased, remained stable, or declined in abundance were dependent on the geographic range category and the major feeding guild. Temperate herbivorous fishes had noticeably declined in abundance, while subtropical carnivorous species had increased. We discuss causes of the change in the reef fish assemblage from the aspect of water temperature, loss of macroalgal beds, and anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - Land-based nitrogen pollution is a major threat to coastal ecosystems, especially in tropical regions home to high biodiversity habitats such as coral reefs and seagrass beds. The sustained addition of excess nutrients (in the form of nitrates) to these ecosystems, which are adapted to oligotrophic environments, disrupts ecosystem function and the ability to provide services that support livelihoods and benefit human well-being. Nitrogen (N) primarily originates from agricultural crop production, livestock waste, and human sewage, as well as excretion from seabird and feral ungulates for some small atolls and cayes. Determining the most effective mitigation strategies to reduce N pollution in a given location begins with identifying and quantifying input from the source. Here we model four major sources of N pollution - crop production, livestock production, wastewater generated from permanent residents and wastewater generated from seasonal populations - at the regional scale, measuring inputs and impacts from 430 watersheds that drain into the Mesoamerican Reef region. We find that leaching of fertilizer from crop production and runoff associated with livestock contribute the majority of N pollution (92%), while contributions from residential and tourism wastewater sources were lower (8%). A north-south divide in N pollution was observed, with watersheds from the south, Guatemala and Honduras, associated with the highest levels of N pollution. The top 20 most polluting watersheds contributed nearly 90% percent of N pollution from all sources analyzed to the MAR, with the majority (11) located in the southern part of the MAR. The top two most polluting watersheds on their own, the Rio Ulua, Honduras, and Rio Motagua, Guatemala, contribute approximately 50% percent of the total N input to the MAR. However, high biodiversity habitats were more exposed to plumes originating from smaller, coastal watersheds. Our approach provides a map of the N pollution in the region highlighting hotspots for managers to target for mitigation, as well as the main sectors and industries to engage when designing solutions.

AB  - Once widespread in their homelands, the Anatolian mouflon (Ovis gmelini anatolica) and the Cyprian mouflon (Ovis gmelini ophion) were driven to near extinction during the 20th century and are currently listed as endangered populations by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. While the exact origins of these lineages remain unclear, they have been suggested to be close relatives of domestic sheep or remnants of proto-domestic sheep. Here, we study whole genome sequences of n = 5 Anatolian mouflons and n = 10 Cyprian mouflons in terms of population history and diversity, comparing them with eight other extant sheep lineages. We find reciprocal genetic affinity between Anatolian and Cyprian mouflons and domestic sheep, higher than all other studied wild sheep genomes, including the Iranian mouflon (O. gmelini). Studying diversity indices, we detect a considerable load of short runs of homozygosity blocks (<2 Mb) in both Anatolian and Cyprian mouflons, reflecting small effective population size (N-e). Meanwhile, N-e and mutation load estimates are lower in Cyprian compared with Anatolian mouflons, suggesting the purging of recessive deleterious variants in Cyprian sheep under a small long-term N-e, possibly attributable to founder effects, island isolation, introgression from domestic lineages, or differences in their bottleneck dynamics. Expanding our analyses to worldwide wild and feral Ovis genomes, we observe varying viability metrics among different lineages and a limited consistency between viability metrics and International Union for Conservation of Nature conservation status. Factors such as recent inbreeding, introgression, and unique population dynamics may have contributed to the observed disparities.

AB  - The current paper evaluates the phytoremediation ability and physiological responses of selected resistant plant species to the hazardous levels of elements in the marble waste polluted ecosystem. Preliminary results demonstrate that all the indicator/resistant plant species i.e., Ailanthus altissima, Arundo donax, Cynodon dactylon, Erigeron canadensis, Cannabis sativa, Ficus carica, Lathyrus aphaca, Morus alba, Populus alba, Robinia pseudoacacia and Vitex negundo were the best Phyto-extractors and Phyto-stabilizers for most of the heavy metals in general and Mg, Ca, Fe, Cu and Na in particular (at p < 0.05). Structural Equation Modeling confirmed that marble waste pollution has a direct and significant (R2 =0.80) impact on proline synthesis and hence a role in combating the pollution. Chlorophyll content decreased by 4% in studied plant species when the concentration of pollutants increased. It is concluded that the studied bio-indicators - the abundant plant species of the Marble Waste Polluted Systems (MWPS) have a significant role in its remediation. Increasing proline accumulation and decreasing chlorophyll contents with an increase in pollution in the studied plants show resilience of the ecosystem in response to the external lithospheric toxicities. It is recommended that the recognized plant species could be planted abundantly to remediate the MWPS around the marble processing and other such industries and their catchments.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that environmental change associated with urbanization can drive rapid adaptation. However, most studies of urban adaptation have focused on coarse urban vs. rural comparisons or sampled along a single urban-rural environmental gradient, thereby ignoring the role that within-city environmental heterogeneity might play in adaptation to urban environments. In this study, we examined fine-scale variation in the presence of hydrogen cyanide (HCN)-a potent anti-herbivore defence-and its two underlying genes (Ac and Li) between park green spaces and surrounding suburban habitats for five city parks in the Greater Toronto Area. We show that fine-scale urbanization has driven the formation of micro-clines in HCN on a scale of <2 km, though the presence and strength of micro-clines varied across parks. Interestingly, these micro-clines were driven by lower HCN frequencies inside park green spaces, and are therefore in the opposite direction to that predicted based on previously described patterns of HCN frequency change along urban-rural gradients. Synthesis: These results suggest larger scale, adaptive urban-rural clines occur across a complex matrix of environmental heterogeneity within cities that drives fine-scale adaptive microclines of varying strengths and directions.

AB  - An exemplary urban adapter, the wild boar ( Sus scrofa) ) has successfully colonized urban ecological niches worldwide. Improvement of strategies for optimal management of urban wild boar need to gather more empirical evidence of their spatial ecology. This study is based on GPS tracking and capture-mark-recapture (CMR) of 10 and 59 wild boar, respectively, captured in Bordeaux Metropolis (France). It shows that wild boar have become urban dwellers, with intra-urban home ranges varying from 1.3 to 64.6 km(2) (MCP 100 %) and from 0.5 to 9.6 km(2) (KDE 95 %), depending on urban conditions. CMR results confirm the low propensity to move away from urban areas (with a mean distance of 2 km between capture and recapture sites), despite a relatively low oneyear survival rate since capture (47.5 %), primarily attributable to removal efforts. Wild boar strongly depended on urban woods, mostly during daytime resting, and highly frequented urban meadows during night foraging. Their use of urban agricultural areas was minimal, but they were mostly monitored following corn and grape harvests. Wild boar mitigated the risk associated with close proximity to humans by: a nocturnal activity (72.2 % of active locations registered from sunset to sunrise), which could also be partially attributed to their sensitivity to heat; a strong use of covered habitats, especially during daytime resting and when close to buildings and roads; and a low mobility during night-time foraging (1974 m average daily distance travelled). Moreover, we demonstrate inter- and intra-individual in the behaviour of urban wild boar. Finally, we discuss the gap between these results and the narratives surrounding the spatial ecology of urban wild boar. Our results not only confirm the species' ability to adapt to urban environments, but also highlight their behavioural flexibility, underscoring the relevance of significant changes in representations and management activities to mitigate human-urban wild boar conflicts.

AB  - Insect foliar herbivory is ubiquitous in terrestrial ecosystems, yet its impacts on soil nitrogen cycling processes remain not yet well known. To examine the impacts of insect foliar herbivory on soil N2O emission flux and available nitrogen (N), we conducted a pot experiment to measure soil available N content and soil N2O emission flux among three treatments (i.e., leaf herbivory, artificial defoliation, and control,) in two broad-leaved trees (Cinnamomum camphora and Liquidambar formosana) and two conifer trees (Pinus massonianna and Cryptomeria fortunei). Our results showed that insect foliar herbivory significantly increased soil inorganic N (i.e., NH4+-N and NO3--N), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) contents, and urease activity compared to control treatment. However, there were no differences in soil available N contents and urease activity between artificial defoliation and control treatments, implying that insect foliar herbivory had greater impacts on soil available N contents compared to physical damage of leaves. Moreover, soil N2O emission fluxes were increased by insect foliar herbivory in Cinnamomum camphora and Pinus massonianna, but not for the other two tree species, indicating various effect of insect foliar herbivory on soil N2O emission among tree species. Furthermore, our results showed the positive correlations between soil N2O emission flux and soil NO3--N, DON, MBN, and acid protease activity, and soil inorganic N, pH, and MBN mainly explained soil N2O emission. Our results implied that insect foliar herbivory can speed up soil nitrogen availability in subtropical forests, but the impacts on soil N2O emission are related to tree species.

AB  - Group living has well-known costs and benefits. Large groups may experience greater competition for resources, while simultaneously benefit from reduced risk through predator dilution. When there is a tradeoff between forage acquisition and predation risk, the ability to congregate into large groups may unlock access to previously unavailable habitat with high risk of predation, thereby increasing forage available to the population. We evaluated whether forage availability increased with population size and how it was mediated through changes in group size. There was a tradeoff between forage availability and predation risk. Larger groups used areas with more forage biomass and greater predation risk than smaller groups. Group size also increased with population abundance, meaning bighorn sheep used gentler terrain and areas with more forage biomass at greater population abundance. Group size functionally increased carrying capacity by yielding access to more resources for growing populations of gregarious ungulates.

AB  - Simple Summary The actin-related protein complex 2/3 complex (Arp2/3) is a kind of actin regulatory protein that regulates the nucleation, aggregation and assembly of F-actin. In recent years, there have been reports at home and abroad about the effects of the Arp2/3 complex on oocyte maturation of mammals such as pigs and mice, but few studies are about its effects on goats. In present study we showed that the Arp2/3 complex is necessary for the maintenance of cytoskeletal meiotic dynamics, such as F-actin assembly and spindle organization in goat oocytes. Additionally, these cytoskeletal dynamics are essential for the regulation of mitochondrial distribution and function, including mitochondrial activity and redox homeostasis, which are critical for the meiotic maturation of goat oocytes. F-actin is of critical importance in oocyte meiotic maturation. Actin assembly and its dynamics are mainly regulated by actin nucleation factors. The actin-related protein complex 2/3 (Arp2/3) is responsible for the organization of F-actin filaments. However, the role of Arp2/3 complex in goat oocytes has not been fully elucidated. Our findings demonstrate that Arp2/3 complex activity is necessary for the maturation of goat oocytes. The Arp2/3 complex-specific inhibitor CK666 impairs the maturation of goat oocytes and alters the genes associated with cumulus expansion, both of which suggest that normal meiosis is affected. Arp2, one of the subunits of the Arp2/3 complex, was found to be mainly accumulated at the oocyte cortex and to co-localize with F-actin during goat oocyte maturation in our results. Thus, we further investigated the cytoskeleton dynamics and found that Arp2/3 complex inhibition disrupts the F-actin assembly and spindle organization. Further analysis revealed that, in addition to direct effects on the cytoskeleton, Arp2/3 complex could also induce ROS accumulation and oxidative stress by disrupting mitochondrial distribution and function, ultimately increasing the rate of early apoptosis in goat oocytes. Our study provides evidence that the Arp2/3 complex is a key regulator of goat oocyte maturation through its regulation of the cytoskeleton dynamics and mitochondrial function.

AB  - Soil microbiota can either slow down or facilitate plant invasions through their effects on plant performance. Associations with soil microbiota can also modify other plant traits such as herbivore resistance, which can indirectly affect the outcome of plant introductions. We studied the effects of soil microbiota on the perennial herbaceous legume Lupinus polyphyllus that hosts nitrogen-fixing mutualistic bacteria. We compared the plant performance, herbivore resistance and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of plants from native (North American) and invasive (Finnish) populations of the species that were inoculated with intact or autoclaved soil from an invasive population. We found that plants of both origins greatly benefited from the intact soil inoculum with respect to all performance measures considered, suggesting that beneficial nitrogen-fixing rhizobia in the soil play a major role in shaping plant phenotypes. For three traits, effects of the intact soil inoculum were stronger in plants of native origin than in plants of invasive origin (number of leaves, herbivore resistance and total biomass). With the intact soil inoculum, plants of invasive origin were more resistant to snails than plants of native origin. Strikingly, differences in resistance to snails between plants of different origins disappeared entirely when soil microbes were reduced. Soil inoculum treatment altered the composition of the leaf VOC bouquet similarly regardless of plant origin. Synthesis. These results demonstrate the ability of Lupinus polyphyllus to associate with and benefit from putatively novel soil microbiota including rhizobia, which has likely contributed to its invasion success. Furthermore, it appears that the invasive populations have adapted to be less reliant on their symbionts, which further facilitates species spread. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that differences in herbivore resistance between native and invasive plant populations of the same species can depend entirely on soil microbiota.

AB  - Although herbivores are well known to incur positive density-dependent damage and mortality, thereby likely shaping plant community assembly, the response of belowground root feeders to changes in plant density has seldom been addressed. Locally rare plant species (with lower plant biomass per area) are often smaller with shallower roots than common species (with higher plant biomass per area) in competition-intensive grasslands. Likewise, root feeders are often distributed in the upper soil layers. We hypothesized, therefore, that root feeders would incur negative density (biomass)-dependent damage across plant species. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the diversity and abundance of plant and root feeder species in an alpine meadow and determined the diet of the root feeders using metabarcoding. Across all species, root feeder load decreased with increasing aboveground plant biomass, root biomass, and total plant biomass per area, indicating a negative density dependence of damage across plant species. Aboveground plant biomass per area increased with increasing individual plant biomass and root depth per area across species, suggesting that rare plant species were smaller in size and had shallower root systems compared to common plant species. Both root biomass per area and root feeder biomass per area decreased with soil depth, but the root feeder biomass decreased disproportionately faster compared to root biomass with increasing root depth. Root feeder load decreased with increasing root depth but was not correlated with the feeding preference of root feeder species. Moreover, the prediction derived from a random process incorporating vertical distributions of root biomass and root feeder biomass significantly accounted for interspecific variation in root feeder load. In conclusion, the data indicate that root feeders incur negative density-dependent damage across plant species. On this basis, we suggest that manipulative experiments should be conducted to determine the effect of the negative density-dependent damage on plant community structure and that different types of plant-animal interactions should be concurrently examined to fully understand the effect of plant density on overall herbivore damage across plant species.

AB  - This study examines the bird fossils unearthed from the natural tank deposits of the Jo & atilde;o Cativo Paleontological Site (JCPS), nestled in Itapipoca, Cear & aacute; State, Brazil. These deposits, a cornerstone in our understanding of the paleoecology of the Brazilian Intertropical Region during the Quaternary period, have conserved a staggering diversity of fauna, notably the Quaternary megafauna. In addition to the megafauna, the JCPS natural tanks have safeguarded unidentified bird fossil remains. Our research uncovers the presence of birds from the Accipitridae family, a group with a broad distribution across the American continent, and the record of Rhea americana, a terrestrial bird that populates biomes such as Cerrado, Caatinga, and the Pampa grasslands. The existence of these fossils underscores the JCPS's pivotal role as an exceptionally diversified deposit, not only in mammals but also in birds and other animal groups.

AB  - Biodiversity on an island presents complicated and unexpected patterns of evolution. Ulleungdo Island is a well-known example of such an oceanic island. Most systematic and evolutionary studies of Ulleungdo Island have focused on endemic species, for which the ancestral population derived from the mainland isolated and ultimately evolved into a distinct species. To gain a better understanding of the origin of the biodiversity of Ulleungdo, non-endemic taxa on the island should also be examined. Daphniphyllum macropodum, distributed in warm-temperate regions in China, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, is an evergreen tree commonly found in the maritime broad-leaf vegetation on Ulleungdo. Thirty-two populations of D. macropodum from Ulleungdo and other areas in Korea and Japan and its close relative D. teijsmannii were included in a phylogeographic analysis using nuclear ITS and chloroplast DNA regions. Each species was found to form a distantly related monophyletic group in the MP trees based on the ITS data. In contrast, the chloroplast DNA data showed that the clade of D. macropodum was mixed with certain samples of D. teijsmannii. Some individuals of D. macropodum on Ulleungdo and those on southeastern Honshu consist of haplotypes typically found in D. teijsmannii. Our results suggest that some of the D. macropodum on Ulleungdo Island likely derived via introgression between D. teijsmannii and D. macropodum and that D. teijsmannii, currently not distributed on Ulleungdo, likely served as the maternal source. Our results also imply that plants of D. macropodum in the Kanto region derived independently from introgression between D. teijsmannii and D. macropodum with different maternal parents.

AB  - Habitat suitability of Vachellia stuhlmannii and Vachellia tortilis was evaluated using MaxEnt. Location data was collected, and nineteen bioclimatic variables data downloaded from the WorldClim database. Soils were analysed to investigate their influence on habitat suitability of the two species. MaxEnt effectively predicted current habitat suitability with an average test Area Under Curve value of 0.936 for V. stuhlmannii and 0.689 for V. tortilis. Key influential variables were BIO-1 (Annual mean temperature) with 71.7% highest gain for V. stuhlmannii and BIO-17 (Precipitation of driest quarter) with 65.3% highest gain for V. tortilis. However, BIO-14 (Precipitation of driest month) exhibited limited influence in predicting habitat suitability. V. stuhlmannii is estimated to cover an area of similar to 3 255.8 hectares, while V. tortilis is estimated to cover similar to 11 180.7 hectares. Both species predominantly occur on Prismacutanic/pedocutanic B-horizons. V. tortilis also thrive on Glenrosa and Mispah soils, which are crucial for diverse plant and animal life. These findings have practical implications for conservation efforts aimed at protecting these species. Identifying suitable habitats and preserving soil types is crucial as soil affects microclimate conditions and influences moisture retention. Overall, this study provides insights for the conservation of V. stuhlmannii and V. tortilis in the semi-arid African savanna.

AB  - Cleaning interactions between mammals and birds have been widely observed worldwide. Here, we report cleaning interactions between sika deer and crows in Japan, based on a field observations using camera traps and online research. Online research was performed on social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, and personal blogs. We finally collected 27 cases of cleaning associations between sika deer and crows. Crows associated with male more than female deer and mainly pecked their heads or necks, suggesting that crows remove Ixodid ticks from the deer's surface. Given that ticks on sika deer are vectors of several zoonotic pathogens such as Rickettsia and Borrelia spp., further studies should be conducted to examine the roles of crows as biocontrol agents of ticks and tick-borne diseases.

AB  - Kangaroo populations have increased significantly across Australia's arid rangelands where the Dingo (Canis dingo) is excluded, with some of the highest concentrations in western New South Wales. Novel adaptive management tools are needed to conserve kangaroo (Macropus and Osphranter spp.) populations and avoid negative impacts to biodiversity, agricultural production and animal welfare associated with their overabundance. Kangaroo densities within the Wild Deserts ecosystem restoration project within Sturt National Park in western New South Wales exceeded 100/km(2) in mid-2016, during an 18-year regional population high. Following mass population declines attributed to emigration, an estimated 7,700 (+/- 2,100 SE) kangaroos died within the 350-km(2) Wild Deserts site over an 8-month period during drought (December 2017-August 2018). Population trends recorded at Wild Deserts were similar to population declines recorded during annual aerial survey counts across western New South Wales over the same period. With New South Wales (NSW) National Parks and Wildlife Service, Wild Deserts developed a kangaroo management plan to avoid future catastrophic mortality from starvation and mitigate associated ecosystem impacts. Conservation management centred upon a 104-km(2) Adaptive Management Zone, fenced to trial adaptive management of sustainable kangaroo populations and restore habitats for the reintroduction of locally extinct mammals. Kangaroos were removed from two 20-km(2) exclosures, adjacent to the Adaptive Management Zone, to provide baselines against which kangaroo populations could be assessed under variable environmental conditions. To effect this management, we assessed the effectiveness of one-way weldmesh spear and flap gates to provide passive unidirectional movement through fences. Of 171 approaches by adult Red Kangaroos to spear gates, 57 resulted in successful exits, while none of 51 approaches resulted in return movements, supporting the utility of spear gates as a practical and effective tool for directional exits of kangaroos through fences.

AB  - Effective wildlife management requires information on population status and distribution. Survey methods that provide estimates of these population parameters can vary greatly in effort required, area covered, precision of estimates, and cost. Trade-offs are required, because increasing precision and area coverage generally requires increasing field effort and incurs a higher cost. We compare DNA-and camera trap based-spatial capture-recapture approaches (DNA-SCR and CT-SCR) to the widely-used, dung-based line transect distance sampling (LTDS) method to assess their performance when applied to three relatively large populations of forest elephant Loxodonta cyclotis (> 500 individuals), in order to evaluate their feasibility for future use at national and regional scales. Six of the nine surveys had a coefficient of variation below 20%; area coverage via DNA-SCR and LTDS was comparable and greatly exceeded that of the CT-SCR as applied; overall cost was highest for the LTDS surveys compared to the other two methods. We designed a new metric with which to compare survey methods: an integrated feasibility index (IFI). This combines three typical survey components: total area covered, level of precision achieved, and cost. The IFI suggests that DNA-SCR and LTDS are equally acceptable in terms of the combination of the three survey components, and that either survey method is suitable for large (national or regional) spatial scales for forest elephant density estimation. CT-SCR provides more precise estimates, but has double the IFI, due to the high cost per km(2). DNA-SCR in particular, given the improvements highlighted in this study, is now being used at a national scale in Gabon. In conclusion, we recommend that the use of these spatial capture-recapture (SCR) methods, and their development, continue. Future findings and improvements should be compiled across studies to ensure their robust evolution as an option for monitoring the African forest elephant across its range and inform strategies and action for its conservation.

AB  - Massive antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) were detected in the soil modified by manure, which may affect human life safety through the food chain. However, the transmission of ARGs through the soil-plant-animal food chain is still unclear. Therefore, this study used high-throughput quantitative PCR technology to explore the effects of pig manure application on ARGs and bacterial communities in soil, lettuce phyllosphere, and snail excrement. The results showed that a total of 384 ARGs and 48 MEGs were detected in all samples after 75 days of incubation. The diversity of ARGs and MGEs in soil components increased significantly by 87.04% and 40% with the addition of pig manure. The absolute abundance of ARGs in the phyllosphere of lettuce was significantly higher than that of the control group, with a growth rate of 212.5%. Six common ARGs were detected between the three components of the fertilization group, indicating that there was internal transmission of fecal ARGs between the trophic levels of the food chain. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were identified as the dominant host bacteria in the food chain system, which were more likely to be used as carriers of ARGs to promote the spread of resistance in the food chain. The results were used to assess the potential ecological risks of livestock and poultry manure. It provides theoretical basis and scientific support for the formulation of ARG prevention and control policies.

AB  - Chhattisgarh, India, harbours a metapopulation of 250-300 Asian elephants Elephas maximus that has expanded its range from neighbouring states since 2000. Elephants in the state occur across a mosaic of forests interspersed with agricultural settlements, leading to frequent interactions with people, some of which culminate in conflict. We assessed patterns of crop losses as a result of elephant incursions, at two spatial scales. We found widespread crop losses, with 1,426 settlements in and around 10 forest divisions and four protected areas reporting elephant-related crop losses during 2015-2020. At the landscape scale, spanning c. 39,000 km2, intensity of habitat use by elephants, forest cover and number of forest patches explained variations in intensity of crop losses. At a finer spatial scale, covering c. 1,200 km2 of forest-agriculture matrix in Surguja, probability of crop loss was low near roads but high close to forest patches and was also affected by patch heterogeneity. Both male and female elephant groups fed on crops. As areas with high crop losses are also areas used intensively by elephants, management to increase elephant occupancy in relatively large and connected forest patches is imperative, to minimize crop losses and improve elephant conservation. Concomitantly, expansion of elephant range into agricultural areas that lack forests should be discouraged. In forest divisions, options to reduce negative human-elephant interactions include institutionalizing elephant monitoring, transparent and prompt ex gratia payment for crop losses, and the use of portable physical barriers.

AB  - Metabolism is a complex phenotype shaped by natural environmental rhythms, as well as behavioral, morphological and physiological adaptations. Metabolism has been historically studied under constant environmental conditions, but new methods of continuous metabolic phenotyping now offer a window into organismal responses to dynamic environments, and enable identification of abiotic controls and the timing of physiological responses relative to environmental change. We used indirect calorimetry to characterize metabolic phenotypes of the desert-adapted cactus mouse (Peromyscus eremicus) in response to variable environmental conditions that mimic their native environment versus those recorded under constant warm and constant cool conditions, with a constant photoperiod and full access to resources. We found significant sexual dimorphism, with males being more prone to dehydration than females. Under circadian environmental variation. most metabolic shifts occurred prior to physical environmental change and the timing was disrupted under both constant treatments. The ratio of CO2 produced to O-2 consumed (the respiratory quotient) reached greater than 1.0 only during the light phase under diurnally variable conditions, a pattern that strongly suggests that lipogenesis contributes to the production of energy and endogenous water. Our results are consistent with historical descriptions of circadian torpor in this species (torpid by day, active by night), but reject the hypothesis that torpor is initiated by food restriction or negative water balance.

AB  - Studies using marine animals instrumented with biologging devices to estimate phytoplankton biomass have typically omitted continental shelf regions due to the confounding effects of optically active constituents other than phytoplankton present. The lack of algorithms for these regions is problematic, as they are some of the most biologically productive in the world and are often inhabited by the species of interest. We developed a bio-optical model to estimate chlorophyll a concentration (chl a) using light attenuation (LA) measured using a standard oceanographic instrument in an optically complex water body that is applicable to data collected by animal-borne devices. To achieve this, we conducted a replicated experiment to compare measurements made using time-depth-light recorders (TDLRs) to those of a standard oceanographic instrument (the HyperPro) in an adjacent water body, the Bedford Basin, Nova Scotia, Canada. Measurements of LA made by TDLRs were comparable to those of the HyperPro at-depth. The best supported bio-optical model for the estimation of chl a included both LA measured by the HyperPro and season as a fixed effect. The use of animal-borne devices to collect subsurface chl a data not only provides an opportunity to collect valuable oceanographic data but also allows for the exploration of broader ecological questions relating to the influence of primary productivity on the movement patterns of wide-ranging marine species.

AB  - Current and proposed human development throughout high northern latitudes must assess and try to mitigate impacts on caribou and reindeer ( Rangifer tarandus ) herds. Sound created by development can be far-reaching, and determining the potential impacts of noise on wildlife can inform landscape use. To advance our understanding of Rangifer 's potential response to anthropogenic noise, we must first understand what they can hear. Using domestic reindeer from the Large Animal Research Station at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, we performed a Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response to estimate auditory thresholds of the species. We assessed the central auditory response and tested the sensitivity in 6 female reindeer of various ages. Prior to our work, the lowest audible frequency for the species was reported to be 63 Hz in previous studies. We identified an auditory threshold lower limit of 30 Hz in our study subjects and quantified reindeer sensitivity thresholds (dB peSPL) to frequencies ranging from 30 to 16,0 0 0 Hz. Our results indicate that anthropogenic sounds previously thought to be beyond the hearing range of Rangifer -such as seismic exploration-are likely to be audible to the species, and therefore have the potential to affect their soundscape. We compared our findings on Rangifer hearing with new measurements of anthropogenic sounds recorded on passive acoustic monitors distributed throughout northern Alaska, as well as biological sounds produced by the Rangifer themselves (e.g., vocalizations and sesamoid clicks produced by the ankles). All classes of anthropogenic sound fall within the threshold range that we identified for Rangifer . Our findings have important implications for the assessment of environmental impacts within Rangifer range and will inform future soundscape ecology research. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Ecosystems worldwide receive large amounts of nutrients from both natural processes and human activities. While direct subsidy effects on primary production are relatively well-known (the green food web), the indirect effects of subsidies on producers as mediated by the brown food web and predators are poorly considered. With a dynamical green-brown food web model, parameterized using empirical estimates from the literature, we illustrate the effect of organic and inorganic nutrient subsidies on net primary production (NPP) (i.e., after removing loss to herbivory) in two idealized ecosystems-one terrestrial and one aquatic. We find that nutrient subsidies increase net primary production, an effect that saturates with increasing subsidies. Changing the quality of subsidies from inorganic to organic tends to increase net primary production in terrestrial ecosystems, but less often so in aquatic ecosystems. This occurs when organic nutrient inputs promote detritivores in the brown food web, and hence predators that in turn regulate herbivores, thereby promoting primary production. This previously largely overlooked effect is further enhanced by ecosystem properties such as fast decomposition and low rates of nutrient additions and demonstrates the importance of nutrient subsidy quality on ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Marine-derived resource subsidies can generate intrapopulation variation in the behaviors and diets of terrestrial consumers. How omnivores respond, given their multiple trophic interactions, is not well understood. We sampled mice (Peromyscus keeni) and their food sources at five sites on three islands of the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, to test predictions regarding variation in the spatial behavior and consumption of marine-subsidized foods among individuals. About 50% of detections (n = 27 recaptures) occurred at traps closest to shoreline (25 m), with capture frequencies declining significantly inland (up to 200 m). Stable isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15), particularly delta N-15, in plant foods, forest arthropod prey, and mouse feces were significantly enriched near shorelines compared with inland, while delta C-13 patterns were more variable. Bayesian isotope mixing models applied to isotope values in mouse hair indicated that over one-third (35-37%) of diet was comprised of beach-dwelling arthropods, a marine-derived food source. Males were more abundant near the shoreline than females and consumed more marine-derived prey, regardless of reproductive status or availability of other food sources. Our results identify how multiple pathways of marine nutrient transfer can subsidize terrestrial omnivores and how subsets of recipient populations can show variation in spatial and dietary response.

AB  - Identifying and quantifying the main factors that are jeopardizing amphibian communities worldwide is essential for planning effective amphibian conservation. We collected data on the presence/absence of salamanders and newts (Caudata) and frogs and toads (Anura) in >3600 water points from a large region (30,000 km(2)) in NW Spain during a 10-year period (2004-2013). We contrasted a large set of hypotheses explaining presence/absence as a function of anthropogenic factors across the regional elevation gradient (1-2036 m). Logistic regression modeling revealed that salamanders and newts were mainly influenced by pollution and by land use changes, and that the effect of these factors changed with elevation. However, frogs and toads were affected by a larger set of factors acting synergistically, although not including land use changes, and their effect operated at all elevation ranges, except in the case of biological factors (invasive species and wild boar abundance) with higher effects at low elevation. Changes in land use was the most common factor at any elevation and included the abandonment of rural areas, which favors shrub and tree encroachment on former open land, and loss of water points. The most resilient species at any elevation were two frogs, Pelophylax perezi and Rana parvipalmata. The least resilient species were two salamanders, Chioglossa lusitanica and Lissotriton helveticus, followed closely by two toads, Alytes obstetricans and Pelobates cultripes. Unoccupied sites had higher frequencies of biological effects and of changes in land use in the first 5 years of study and lower frequencies of direct human influence factors in the second period. Overall, our results showed that the studied amphibian metacommunity was negatively influenced both by direct and indirect anthropogenic factors, but also that many amphibian species were not only capable of occupying sites which had been altered by human action, but were even favored by land uses generating open habitat, a habitat type that is increasingly uncommon in the region, in the entire Iberian Peninsula and in Europe.

AB  - Vertebrate herbivore excrement is thought to influence nutrient cycling, plant nutrition, and growth; however, its importance is rarely isolated from other aspects of herbivory, such as trampling and leaf removal, leaving questions about the extent to which herbivore effects are due to feces. We hypothesized that as a source of additional nutrients, feces would directly increase soil N concentrations and N2O emission, alleviate plant, and microbial nutrient limitations, resulting in increased plant growth and foliar quality, and increase CH4 emissions. We tested these hypotheses using a field experiment in coastal western Alaska, USA, where we manipulated goose feces such that naturally grazed areas received three treatments: feces removal, ambient amounts of feces, or double ambient amounts of feces. Doubling feces marginally increased NH4+-N in soil water, whereas both doubled feces and feces removal significantly increased NO3--N; N2O flux was also higher in removal plots. Feces removal marginally reduced root biomass and significantly reduced productivity (that is, GPP) in the second year, measured as greater CO2 emissions. Doubling feces marginally increased foliar chemical quality by increasing %N and decreasing C:N. Treatments did not influence CH4 flux. In short, feces removal created sites poorer in nutrients, with reduced root growth, graminoid nutrient uptake, and productivity. While goose feces alone did not create dramatic changes in nutrient cycling in western Alaska, they do appear to be an important source of nutrients for grazed areas and to contribute to greenhouse gas exchange as their removal increased emissions of CO2 and N2O to the atmosphere.

AB  - Quantifying feral pig movements and understanding the fine-scale ecological drivers of feral pig landscape use are important factors for optimising pest management programs. We tracked 59 GPS-collared feral pigs at four sites in eastern Australia between 2017 and 2021, for a mean of 375 +/- 277 (s.d.) days. The mean number of successful GPS fixes was 15 577 +/- 11 833 (s.d.) and these were recorded at 30-min intervals. We calculated mean hourly and daily distances travelled to determine feral pig activity and investigated the influence of sex, site, season and time of day on this activity. We also investigated the proximity of highly active sites to habitat covariates, along with intensity and frequency of site use. Male daily movement, 4.9 km (95% CI = 4.2, 5.6 km), was significantly greater than it was for females, 3.6 km (95% CI = 3.0, 4.1 km) and males maintained a high level of activity all night, while female activity was predominantly crepuscular. Study site was a significant determinant of daily movement, but season was not, across either sex or site. Highlyvisited site selection was negatively associated with distance from creeks, dams, cultivation, open herbaceous vegetation and medium woody vegetation. Both medium woody vegetation and dam sites had the longest duration of use (3 and 2.7 h respectively) and the shortest time between visitations (14.5 and 13 h respectively). Quantifying feral pig activity and key habitat feature preference are important steps in improving management programs. Better prediction of feral pig movement and behaviour allows for more targeted placement of control tools, potentially increasing encounter rates.

AB  - Large animals could be important drivers of spatial nutrient subsidies when they ingest resources in some habitats and release them in others, even moving nutrients against elevational gradients. In high Andean deserts, vicunas (Vicugna vicugna) move daily between nutrient-rich wet meadows, where there is abundant water and forage but high risk of predation by pumas (Puma concolor), and nutrient-poor open plains with lower risk of predation. In all habitats, vicunas defecate and urinate in communal latrines. We investigated how these latrines impacted soil and plant nutrient concentrations across three habitats in the Andean ecosystem (meadows, plains, and canyons) and used stable isotope analysis to explore the source of fecal nutrients in latrines. Latrine soils had higher concentrations of nitrogen, carbon, and other nutrients than did nonlatrine soils across all habitats. These inputs corresponded with an increase in plant quality (lower C:N) at latrine sites in plains and canyons, but not in meadows. Stable isotope mixing models suggest that similar to 7% of nutrients in plains latrines originated from vegetation in meadows, which is disproportionately higher than the relative proportion of meadow habitat (2.6%) in the study area. In contrast, similar to 68% of nutrients in meadow latrines appear to originate from plains and canyon vegetation, though these habitats made up nearly 98% of the study area. Vicuna diel movements thus appear to concentrate nutrients in latrines within habitats and to drive cross-habitat nutrient subsidies, with disproportionate transport from low-lying, nutrient-rich meadows to more elevated, nutrient-poor plains. When these results are scaled up to the landscape scale, the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus subsidized in soil at plains latrines was of the same order of magnitude as estimates of annual atmospheric nitrogen and phosphorus deposition for this region (albeit far more localized and patchy). Thus, vicuna-mediated nutrient redistribution and deposition appears to be an important process impacting ecosystem functioning in arid Andean environments, on par with other major inputs of nutrients to the system.

AB  - The predation and/or dispersal of Quercus seeds by rodents play an important role in the creation of the tree species. The present study examined the effects of community habitats on the predation and dispersal of Quercus wutaishanica seeds by rodents. We released seeds with densities set at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 seed square meter with litter cover, soil burial, and bare ground in the Liupan Mountains National Nature Reserve in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, northwest China. The results showed that (1) the litter cover and soil burial significantly increased the seed survival probability compared with bare ground treatments, especially the predation in situ (PIS) (p < 0.05). Both the scatter hoarding (SH) and larder hoarding (LH) for litter cover and soil burial were significantly increased compared with bare ground (p < 0.05). (2) The large seeds are preferentially predated after dispersal and their long-distance dispersal (>5 m) was significantly greater than that of small seeds (p < 0.05), while small seeds are more likely to be preyed on in situ or during short-distance dispersal (<3 m). (3) The Q. wutaishanica seed predation by rodents increased at a high density rather than at a low density, indicating a negative density-dependent predation. These findings provide insights into the ecological characteristics of Quercus tree regeneration and shed light on the coexistence between rodents and different-sized seeds.

AB  - Invasive plants may display age or genotype-specific defenses against herbivory. Thus, the importance of herbivory for preventing or mitigating plant invasions may depend on genetics and age-structure of invader populations. We used an excised-leaf experiment to test whether constitutive herbivore defenses in Butomus umbellatus L. (flowering rush) plants decline with age between colonizing (1st year) and established (2nd year) plants and whether the decline was parallel between introduced diploid and triploid genotypes. Leaves from colonizing and established plants were fed to the generalist herbivore fall armyworm (FAW; Spodoptera frugiperda) and then short-term FAW development was measured. Additionally, leaf dry matter content (DMC), % carbon (%C), % nitrogen (%N), carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio, and total leaf phenolics were determined for leaves from a subset of test plants. FAW fed leaves from diploid plants grew 27 % less than those fed leaves from triploid plants but were only 1 % smaller when fed leaves from second-year versus first-year plants of either cytotype. DMC of diploid leaves was 11 % greater overall (11 % DMC) but the difference in cytotypes depended on age (1 % difference in colonizing plants vs. 21 % difference in established plants). In general, diploid plants were characterized by 29 % higher total phenolics, 17 % less leaf nitrogen, and 21 % higher C:N ratio, regardless of age. Measured traits were, on average, 27 % more variable for diploid than triploid plants, possibly a reflection of increased genetic diversity of diploid flowering rush populations used in the study. These results demonstrate that diploid B. umbellatus plants are, overall, better defended against generalist herbivory than triploid plants. Differences in herbivore performance on B. umbellatus lineages, and to a lesser extent plants of varying ages, may therefore contribute to spatial or temporal heterogeneity in the dominance of genotypes in areas where they grow together.

AB  - In the estuaries of large Siberian rivers, ice coverage and the timing of ice retreat have varied in recent decades under the ongoing climate change. The seasonal development and functioning of the mesozooplankton community depend to a great extent on the timing of ice retreat. In the Arctic estuaries, the response of zooplankton to the timing of ice melt remains unclear. An earlier ice retreat was suggested to result in an advanced seasonal development of zooplankton, and higher biomass and feeding rates. Zooplankton composition, biomass, demography and grazing (assessed with the gut fluorescent approach) were studied in the Ob Estuary in July 2019 ("typical" ice retreat time). The obtained results were compared with the published data for July 2016 (ice retreat three weeks earlier). Zooplankton biomass in 2019 was considerably lower than in 2016, while species composition was similar; dominant populations were at an earlier stage of development. Herbivorous feeding of the dominant copepod, Limnocalanus macrurus, was also lower in 2019. The consequences of an earlier ice melt and increased temperature on seasonal population dynamics of the dominant brackish-water species are discussed. Our findings demonstrate that zooplankton communities in the Arctic estuaries are highly sensitive to the environmental changes associated with early sea-ice reduction.

AB  - Application of organic fertilizers is a potential practice to prevent soil erosion by changing the physicochemical properties of the soil, such as macroaggregates, soil organic carbon (SOC) content, and exchangeable cations. However, the practical performance of organic fertilizer in soil erosion after a long-term application has scarcely been reported. To reveal the response of soil erosion resistance (i.e., the soil susceptibility to resist external erosion force) to 43 years of organic fertilization, five treatments were investigated: (1) CK (no fertilizer), (2) NPK (mineral fertilizer), (3) M (pig manure), (4) MN1 (pig manure + 138 kg N ha -1), and (5) MN2 (pig manure + 276 kg N ha -1). The results showed that NPK, M, MN1, and MN2 significantly increased soil critical shear stress (tau c) by 54 %, 87 %, 101 %, and 67 %, respectively, compared to CK. However, rill erodibility (kd) was increased significantly only in the MN2 treatment. The optimal partial least squares regression model showed that the increase in soil exchangeable Ca2+ was the dominant contributor to the tau c increase, while soil mean weight diameter (MWD) had the greatest negative effect on kd. Compared with CK, the soil exchangeable Ca2+ in M and MN1 increased significantly by 123 % and 135 %, respectively. The MWD in M and MN1 increased by 86 % and 83 %, respectively, compared with that in CK. The application of pig manure was beneficial for decreasing exchangeable Na+ and increasing SOC content, which could improve MWD. Manure with a high N content did not increase MWD due to SOC decomposition. Our results indicate that the long-term application of manure, alone or combined with moderate N, improves rill erosion resistance.

AB  - Although climate change impacts on the agricultural sector were investigated intensively, however, vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning at the community level are still limited. This study aimed at providing a comprehensive climate change vulnerability assessment of four agriculture responses of barley production, wheat production, olive trees production, and goats' mortality at the Yarmouk River Basin in northern Jordan using a qualitative-quantitative scoring method based on actual estimations of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity with an emphasis on community engagement. Thirty-year temporal variability (1982-2012) analysis using Kendall test and Pearson correlation test for three climatic variables (maximum and minimum air temperature, and annual rainfall) indicates high significant exposure level of increasing air temperature trends by rates of 0.07 degrees C/year and 0.06 degrees C/year for maximum and minimum temperature, respectively, and insignificant annual rainfall reductions ranging spatially from 2.1 mm/year at Irbid governorate to 2.9 mm/year at Mafraq Governorate. Agriculture responses sensitivity assessment indicates goats' mortality followed by olive production are moderately correlated with climate variables (r ranges from 0.32 to 0.57). The adaptive capacity assessment highlights the presence of low to moderate financial, institutional, political enforcement, technology implementation, and awareness of the farmers to climate change impacts and potential adaptation measures that subjected the study area to be ranked as moderately to highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Multi-criteria decision analysis suggests that irrigation water-related adaptation measures are listed within top priorities. This paper addresses the qualitative-quantitative vulnerability assessment approach at the local rural level and through participatory engagements to be effective for improving the vulnerable adaptive capacities and suggesting further recommendations to be mainstreamed urgently with governmental strategies and action plans.

AB  - Conifers are dominant tree species in boreal forests, but are susceptible to attack by bark beetles. Upon bark beetle attack, conifers release substantial quantities of volatile organic compounds known as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Earlier studies of broadleaved plants have shown that HIPVs provide information to neighbouring plants, which may enhance their defences. However, the defence responses of HIPV-receiver plants have not been described for conifers. Here we advance knowledge of plant-plant communication in conifers by documenting a suite of receiver-plant responses to bark-feeding-induced volatiles. Scots pine seedlings exposed to HIPVs were more resistant to subsequent weevil feeding and received less damage. Receiver plants had both induced and primed volatile emissions and their resin ducts had an increased epithelial cell (EC) mean area and an increased number of cells located in the second EC layer. Importantly, HIPV exposure increased stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis rate of receiver plants. Receiver-plant responses were also examined under elevated ozone conditions and found to be significantly altered. However, the final defence outcome was not affected. These findings demonstrate that HIPVs modulate conifer metabolism through responses spanning photosynthesis and chemical defence. The responses are adjusted under ozone stress, but the defence benefits remain intact.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) develop strong mutualistic associations with roots of about 70% of all vascular plants. By modifying host plant nutrient uptake, growth and defense, AMF also indirectly influence the aboveground herbivorous insect community. Since plant response to AMF depends on the extent of mycorrhization, outcomes of the bottom-up effects of AMF on herbivores are extremely variable and not well understood. We thus tested whether the generalist phloem feeder Bemisia tabaci (tobacco whitefly) was affected by the colonization of habanero pepper seedlings (Capsicum chinense) by different densities of the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis. After AMF inoculation (with control, low and high doses of liquid inoculum), seedlings were grown in a greenhouse without (control) and with whiteflies (10 adults per seedling). We measured plant traits and growth and biomass allocations at 2, 16 and 30 days after transplantation of emerged seedlings. We estimated whitefly adult, egg and nymph densities 28 days after transplantation. B. tabaci abundance significantly increased after C. chinense inoculation with low AMF density (120% increase for adults, 97% for eggs) through an augmentation of seedling nutritional status. By enhancing plant tolerance and primary metabolism, the higher density of AMF did not affect B. tabaci fitness on seedlings. We highlight here that whitefly abundance on mycorrhizal C. chinense varies widely depending on AMF inoculum concentration.

AB  - Aerobic composting is an effective method of resource treatment for agricultural and forestry solid waste; however, while wheat straw is usually used as a conditioner and is not the main body as in aerobic composting, wheat straw is abundant in annual production, and fertilization is one of the main ways of resource utilization of wheat straw, how to use wheat straw as the main body of aerobic composting for efficient treatment is, therefore, a meaningful research direction. In this paper, to achieve the efficient and economic resource utilization of wheat straw and livestock manure, aerobic composting was carried out with wheat straw as the main body, and pig manure and cow manure were mixed with wheat straw crops at ratios of 20%, 30%, and 40%, respectively, for barrel suspension composting. The changes in pH, EC, NH4+-N, NO3--N, TN, TP, organic matter and seed germination index, and shoot length inhibition rate before and after composting were compared between treatment groups using different material ratios in the aerobic composting process. The changes in the physicochemical properties and nutrient elements of compost products were studied. The results show that the co-composting of livestock manure and wheat straw can promote the decomposition of the pile, and the addition of 40% cow manure and 30% pig manure has the best effect in promoting decay. In contrast, the addition of excessive pig manure inhibits the decomposition of the pile. Organic matter degradation in the treatment groups using cow manure was more effective than in those using pig manure, and the best results were obtained with 40% cow manure. The pile was alkaline at the end of each treatment, and the wheat straw compost treated with 40% cow manure had the best nitrogen and phosphorus retention. The wheat straw compost treated with 40% cow manure had the highest integrated degree of decomposition, which promoted the deterioration of the pile and provided a research basis for the use of wheat straw as an efficient resource.

AB  - Simple Summary: Livestock in different parts of the world consume drinking water containing variable levels of total dissolved solids (TDSs) that may influence their performance and health. Growing and mature Blackhead Ogaden sheep and Somali goats were used to evaluate the effect of salinity levels (up to 17 g/L of TDSs) of drinking water on water intake and loss, nutrient utilization, thermoregulation, and blood characteristics. Drinking water, total water intake, urine excretion, and total water loss were higher in both young and mature sheep and goats, while apparent dry matter digestibility decreased for high levels of TDSs compared with fresh water. There were no adverse effects of high salinity levels tested on feed intake, body weight change, different blood variables, and thermoregulatory mechanisms, reflecting considerable tolerance of relatively high levels of salinity in drinking water by these goat and sheep breeds. This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of drinking water salinity levels on water intake and loss, feed intake and digestion, body weight (BW), thermoregulation, and blood characteristics on growing and mature (18.8 +/- 0.39 and 21.8 +/- 0.40 kg BW, and 0.6-1 and 1.5-2 years of age, respectively) Blackhead Ogaden sheep and Somali goats. The animals were assigned to a 4 (water salinity) x 2 (sheep and goat species) x 2 (growing and mature animals) factorial arrangement for the 60-day experimental period and 10-day digestibility determination. Water treatments were fresh water (FRW) and low (SW-L), moderate (SW-M), and high (SW-H) levels of salinity (i.e., the addition of NaCl to obtain 10, 13.5, and 17 g of total dissolved salts (TDSs)/L, respectively). The salinity of drinking water did not affect feed intake, BW, thermoregulatory traits (respiration rate, rectal temperature, and heart rate), or blood parameters (p > 0.05); however, drinking water, total water intake, urine excretion, and total water loss increased (p < 0.01) while apparent dry matter digestibility decreased quadratically (p < 0.01) with increasing water salinity. Analysis of the interaction between water treatment and species showed that PCV (p = 0.059) and hemoglobin (p = 0.070) levels tended to be higher in sheep than in goats drinking FRW, and AST activities were greater (p = 0.036) in goats consuming SW-M than in sheep consuming water with the same salinity level. In conclusion, increasing the salinity level of drinking water by adding NaCl to up to 17 g/L of TDSs had no adverse effect on the water intake, feed intake, BW, and health status of growing and mature Blackhead Ogaden sheep and Somali goats.

AB  - In the context of structural and functional changes in the pelagic environment, and the oligotrophication and the temperature increase of the North Western Mediterranean, this study analyses a 17-year time series (2006-2022) of copepod temporal variability in the Bay of Marseille. Mesozooplankton was sampled bimonthly (0-55 m) together with biotic and abiotic parameters. This study focuses on the temporal dynamics and ecological niches of copepod taxa and trophic groups. In the Bay of Marseille, herbivorous copepods, Clausocalanus-Paracalanus-Ctenocalanus-Pseudocalanus, dominated the community in abundance. From taxa realized niches, we identified that temperature and trophic conditions drove the seasonal and interannual dynamics of copepods. During the summer months of recent years, the increasing oligotrophication and warming of the seawater favoured carnivorous copepods. A shift in the copepod community structure since the mid-2010s was demonstrated, with a decrease in total copepod abundance and reduced dominance of spring copepod taxa. The trophic group dynamics were mostly driven by a few dominant taxa in each group. Recent environmental conditions favoured increases in the abundance of two warm-water affinity species (Corycaeidae and Temora stylifera) and were unfavourable to a cold-water affinity species (Calanus helgolandicus).

AB  - Salmonellosis is one of the most important bacterial diseases in human and animals. Rapid diagnosis and sub sequence accurate treatment of Salmonella carriers help reduce the salmonellosis in human and livestock animals. In this study, 420 fecal samples were taken during year 2019 from buffalo in the Urmia, Khoy and Piranshahr regions in west Azerbaijan province, Iran. Samplings were carried out in different seasons. Presence of Salmonella invasion genes (FimA, Stn and InvA) were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction. The bacterial culture and biochemical tests were performed on feces samples for isolation of bacterium Salmonella; however, all samples were negative in culture method. PCR findings showed that, 50 (11.90%) fecal samples were positive to the genes. The analysis of results showed that frequency of salmonellosis outbreak in different parts of west Azerbaijan province followed a similar pattern and the incidence of salmonellosis according to forecast in the warm seasons (spring and summer) was more than in cold seasons (autumn and winter). The prevalence of Salmonella in buffalo's feces based on warm and cold seasons were 32 (64.00%) and 18 (36.00%), respectively. The results showed significant difference between cold and warm season in the prevalence of salmonellosis. Therefore, the application of molecular technics is essential for the prevention and treatment of salmonellosis. The results also showed that specificity of PCR method was better than culture method for detection of Salmonella in feces sample.(c) 2023 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nineteen red deer areas in a densely populated region with a huge network of fenced motorways and the division into administrative management units (AMUs) with restricted ecological connectivity were investigated. In the season 2018/2019, a total of 1291 red deer samples (on average 68 per area) were collected and genotyped using 16 microsatellite markers. The results show a clear genetic differentiation between most of the AMUs. Fourteen AMUs may be combined into four regions with a considerable internal genetic exchange. Five areas were largely isolated or showed only a limited gene flow with neighbouring areas. Ten of the 19 AMUs had an effective population size below 100. Effective population sizes greater than 500-1000, required to maintain the evolutionary potential and a long-term adaptation potential, were not achieved by any of the studied AMUs, even when AMUs with an appreciable genetic exchange were aggregated. Substantial genetic differentiation between areas can be associated with the presence of landscape barriers hindering gene flow, but also with the maintenance of 'red deer-free' areas. Efforts to sustainably preserve the genetic diversity of the entire region should therefore focus on measures ensuring genetic connectivity. Opportunities for this goal arise from the establishment of game bridges over motorways and from the protection of young male stags migrating through the statutory 'red deer-free' areas.

AB  - One of the most difficult challenges for wildlife managers is reliably estimating wildlife populations. Camera traps combined with spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models are a popular tool for population estimation. They have limitations, however, including long data processing times. Drones with thermal imagery are an emerging tool for estimating wildlife populations, but how they compare to other methods remain poorly studied. We compared the use of camera traps and SCR models to drone surveys for estimating population densities of Sitka black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis on Afognak Island, Alaska. We deployed 26 camera traps from 1 September until 6 October 2022 and individually identified males using antler characteristics, for the SCR model. At the same site we conducted three drone surveys between October and December 2022, identified sex composition and obtained deer counts. The estimated density from the SCR model was 3.7 males +/- 0.8 (SE) km-2, and 14.1 +/- 3.1 adults km-2 of clear-cut forest. Results from the drone survey produced similar estimates with 2.1 +/- 0.9 males km-2 and 13.4 +/- 1.6 adults km-2. The similarity in estimates suggests that both methods converged on an accurate representation of the population in this habitat, but these methods diverge in levels of sampling effort, duration, and financial cost. Camera traps offer further insights on behavior and home-range size but require longer data processing times, can be subject to malfunctions, and are difficult to deploy and maintain in remote areas. Drones are subject to legal restrictions, have difficulty in closed canopy habitat and can be initially costly, but they provide results faster and require less data analysis. Camera traps and drones are useful for determining population dynamics but are subject to their limitations. Wildlife managers should make survey decisions based on their specific goals, habitat type, focal species ecology and financial limitations.

AB  - Background and Research Aims: The Punan people of Sarawak, Borneo, possess rich traditional medicinal knowledge, but face threats to their cultural heritage and local biodiversity. This study aimed to document the diversity of medicinal plants used by the Punan, assess their conservation status, and propose evidence-based conservation strategies.Methods: Ethnobotanical surveys were conducted in two Punan longhouses in Tatau, Sarawak. Structured and semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from 13 knowledgeable individuals. Plant species were identified with the help of dendrologists and confirmed using online botanical databases. Quantitative ethnobotanical indices were calculated, and conservation statuses were assessed using the IUCN Red List.Results: The study documented 19 plant species from 17 families used for medicinal purposes. Senna alata, Elephantopus scaber, and Mimosa pudica had the highest use-reports. Respiratory, eye, and skin ailments were the most frequently treated conditions. Two species of conservation concern were identified: Cissus rostrata (regionally Critically Endangered) and Coscinium fenestratum (Vulnerable).Conclusion: This study revealed a rich traditional pharmacopoeia among the Punan people, while also highlighting critical conservation concerns for certain medicinal plant species. The findings underscore the urgent need for integrated conservation approaches that address both ecological and cultural dimension.Implications for Conservation: Conservation strategies should prioritize protection of vulnerable species through sustainable harvesting practices, habitat protection, and ex situ conservation measures. Community engagement is crucial, involving the establishment of community-managed medicinal plant reserves and sustainable livelihood opportunities. These efforts will contribute to both ecological sustainability and cultural resilience in the region.

AB  - Livestock depredation by brown bears is one of the main source of human-wildlife conflict in rural Eastern Europe. Thus, identifying environmental and anthropogenic drivers of human-bear conflict, and developing spatial predictions for predation intensity are critical to mitigate such conflicts. We used 756 records of bear-caused livestock predation collected between 2008 and 2016 in the Romanian Carpathians and evaluated predictors and spatial distribution of bear livestock predation events (BPEs) using separate binomial generalized linear mixed models for cows, sheep, and other livestock. Despite differences in the direction and magnitude of the effect, the prevalence of BPE for all livestock was driven by the interaction between environmental drivers along with relative bear abundance. Distance from forest was a strong negative predictor for cows and sheep, while distance to villages was a strong negative predictor for cows. Landscape heterogeneity was positively associated with cow and other livestock predation and negatively associated with sheep. Relative bear abundance data collected by wildlife managers was a positive predictor for predation on all livestock. Livestock damage was more prevalent near villages, showcasing plasticity of food resources sought by bears. Our work informs brown bear and livestock management strategies to develop awareness and implement damage prevention measures.

AB  - Background Habitat loss and fragmentation in the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMO) ecological corridor have negative impacts on the movement and distribution of mammalian species that are of great ecological and evolutionary importance. Part of the SMO ecological corridor that is located in the state of Hidalgo is less studied despite being a potential dispersal route for mammals. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the presence and activity of terrestrial mammals in the riparian and non-riparian zones of SMO. Results Camera traps detected 15 mammalian species (i.e., 14 native and 1 domestic) in the non-riparian zone, and 12 mammalian species in the riparian zone (i.e., 10 wild and 2 domestic). The riparian corridor was mainly used by opportunistic medium-sized carnivores, while large carnivores and their potential prey were more frequent in the non-riparian zone. Conclusions Our findings suggest terrestrial mammals avoid the use of natural corridors due to the presence of domestic dogs, cattle and humans and look for new dispersal routes to move through their habitat and find the resources they need to survive. Even though some species can use disturbed corridors to move and find resources, they will change their activity patterns to avoid contact with humans and potential threats like dogs. It is, therefore, crucial to identify not one, but several corridors that must be preserved to improve the connectivity of terrestrial mammals in disturbed landscapes.

AB  - Herbivorous animals tend to seek out plants at intermediate phenological states to improve energy intake while minimizing consumption of fibrous material. In some ecosystems, the timing of green-up is heterogeneous and propagates across space in a wave-like pattern, known as the green wave. Tracking the green wave allows individuals to prolong access to higher-quality forage. While there is a plethora of empirical support for such behavior in herbivorous taxa, the green wave hypothesis (GWH) is nuanced based on factors such as body morphometrics and digestive capacity. Furthermore, little is known about whether other taxa, such as omnivores, track the green wave. Our objective was to assess whether the GWH can be extended to explain the movements of omnivores. Using GPS collar data from seven populations (n = 127 individuals) of brown bears Ursus arctos across their entire North American range, we first tested whether bears tracked the green wave. Using conditional resource selection functions (RSFs), we found that variation in proxies of vegetative forage quality better explained movement and habitat selection than proxies of forage biomass in over half of the bears in our study, providing evidence of green wave tracking. Second, we assess factors that explained variation in green wave tracking using linear mixed effects models. Green wave tracking in brown bears was explained by the variation in availability of green-up within spring home ranges, and how green-up transitioned across those home ranges. Our results demonstrate that the GWH can partially explain movement of a non-migratory omnivorous species, extending the generality of the GWH as a broad predictor of animal space use. The green wave is another resource wave brown bears track, and our findings help predict brown bear space use, which can be used to guide conservation and habitat restoration efforts.

AB  - Over the last two millennia, and at an accelerating pace, the African elephant (Loxodonta spp. Lin.) has been threatened by human activities across its range.(1-7) We investigate the correlates of elephant home range sizes across diverse biomes. Annual and 16-day elliptical time density home ranges(8) were calculated by using GPS tracking data collected from 229 African savannah and forest elephants (L. africana and L. cyclotis, respectively) between 1998 and 2013 at 19 sites representing bushveld, savannah, Sahel, and forest biomes. Our analysis considered the relationship between home range area and sex, species, vegetation productivity, tree cover, surface temperature, rainfall, water, slope, aggregate human influence, and protected area use. Irrespective of these environmental conditions, long-term annual ranges were overwhelmingly affected by human influence and protected area use. Only over shorter, 16-day periods did environmental factors, particularly water availability and vegetation productivity, become important in explaining space use. Our work highlights the degree to which the human footprint and existing protected areas now constrain the distribution of the world's largest terrestrial mammal.(9,10) A habitat suitability model, created by evaluating every square kilometer of Africa, predicts that 18,169,219 km(2) would be suitable as elephant habitat-62% of the continent. The current elephant distribution covers just 17% of this potential range of which 57.4% falls outside protected areas. To stem the continued extirpation and to secure the elephants' future, effective and expanded protected areas and improved capacity for coexistence across unprotected range are essential.

AB  - The changing epidemiologic role of wildlife as reservoirs of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) is poorly understood. In this study, we characterize the phenotypic resistance of commensal Escherichia coli from fecal samples of 879 individual white-tailed (Odocoileus virginianus; WTD) over a ten-year period and analyze resistance patterns. Our results show commensal E. coli from WTD had significant linear increases in reduced susceptibility to 5 of 12 antimicrobials, including broad-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, from 2006 to 2016. In addition, the relative frequency distribution of minimal inhibitory concentrations of two additional antimicrobials shifted towards higher values from across the study period. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant commensal E. coli increased over the study period with a prevalence of 0%, 2.2%, and 3.7% in 2006, 2012, and 2016, respectively. WTD may be persistently and increasingly exposed to antibiotics or their residues, ARB, and/or antimicrobial resistance genes via contaminated environments like surface water receiving treated wastewater effluent.

AB  - A unique assemblage consisting of 113 pine samples collected from a submerged Mesolithic landscape in the Havang area, southern Sweden, was examined to assess the presence of large herbivores, as well as changes in wild-game population density and composition. Bark-stripping damages on prehistoric trees is an extremely underutilized source of information about past game-population dynamics, yet our analyzes of wood samples - dated to around 10 500 cal. yr. BP - shows that such material can be successfully used to study the presence and activities of large herbivores, most likely ungulates. To evaluate our results, comparisons have been made with subfossil peatland trees that grew around 6000 years ago, as well as trees from two present day clearcut logging sites in southern Sweden. Furthermore, studies in a wild-game reserve were performed to recognize and understand different types of damages on trees caused by ungulates. Bark-stripping indicate the presence of ungulates, and the rate of damage is commonly associated with the density of the wild game. Bark-stripping was most frequently observed in the submerged wood material from the early Holocene, where damages were detected in 15% of the trees. In comparisons, 11% of the mid-Holocene trees show bark-stripping damages, whereas marks could be detected in the range between 0% and 6% of the trees from the two present-day clearcut logging sites. Our results show that tree-ring analyzes of prehistoric wood can generate information about wild-game dynamics of the past, and thereby being a valuable complement to more commonly used paleoecological and zooarcheological records.

AB  - Genome-wide technologies open up new possibilities to clarify questions on genetic structure and phylogeographic history of taxa previously studied with microsatellite loci and mitochondrial sequences. Here, we used 736 individual red deer (Cervus elaphus) samples genotyped at 35,701 single nucleotide polymorphism loci (SNPs) to assess the population structure of the species throughout Europe. The results identified 28 populations, with higher degrees of genetic distinction in peripheral compared to mainland populations. Iberian red deer show high genetic differentiation, with lineages in Western and Central Iberia maintaining their distinctiveness, which supports separate refugial ranges within Iberia along with little recent connection between Iberian and the remaining Western European populations. The Norwegian population exhibited the lowest variability and the largest allele frequency differences from mainland European populations, compatible with a history of bottlenecks and drift during post-glacial colonization from southern refugia. Scottish populations showed high genetic distance from the mainland but high levels of diversity. Hybrid zones were found between Eastern and Western European lineages in Central Europe as well as in the Pyrenees, where red deer from France are in close contact with Iberian red deer. Anthropogenic restocking has promoted the Pyrenean contact zone, admixture events in populations on the Isle of Rum and in the Netherlands, and at least partly the admixture of the two main lineages in central-eastern Europe. Our analysis enabled detailed resolution of population structure of a large mammal widely distributed throughout Europe and contributes to resolving the evolutionary history, which can also inform conservation and management policies.

AB  - Rotational closures have potential fisheries benefits, yet their impact on coral cover is unknown. Research has shown that permanent closures can protect herbivorous fish, indirectly benefiting corals, but these observations may not apply when closed periods alternate with fishing. Here, we examine how rotational closures affect coral, focusing on systems with the potential to switch between alternative stable states, a context in which temporary closures may have persistent effects. We show that rotational closures can trigger coral recovery, and in some contexts lead to better coral recovery than fixed closures of similar size. Such benthic effects are only possible if closures last long enough for change to occur. We also note that very large fixed or rotating closures may concentrate fishing effort in areas where fishing remains permitted, leading to lower overall coral cover. Our findings offer crucial guidance to managers regarding rotational closures' potential advantages and drawbacks.

AB  - Climate change is expected to influence the geographic distribution of many taxa, including insects. Chrysomya albiceps is one of the most pervasive calliphorid fly with apparent ecological, forensic, and medical importance. However, the global habitat suitability is varied due to climate change. Models that forecast species spatial distribution are increasingly being used in wildlife management, highlighting the need for trustworthy techniques to assess their accuracy. So, we used the maximum entropy implemented in Maxent to predict the current and future potential global geographic distribution of C. albiceps and algorithms of DIVA-GIS to confirm the predicted current model. The Maxent model was calibrated using 2177 occurrence records. Based on the Jackknife test, four bioclimatic variables along with altitude were used to develop the final models. For future models, two representative concentration pathways (RCPs), 2.6 and 8.5, for 2050 and 2070 were used. The area under curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS) were used to evaluate the resulted models with values equal to 0.92 (+/- 0.001) and 0.7, respectively. Two-dimensional niche analysis illustrated that the insect can adapt to low and high temperatures (9 degrees C to 27 degrees C), and the precipitation range was 0 mm to 2500 mm. The resulted models illustrated the global distribution of C. albiceps with alteration to its distribution in the future, especially on the Mediterranean coasts of Europe and Africa, Florida in the USA, and the coasts of Australia. Such predicted shifts put decision makers against their responsibilities to prevent destruction in economic, medical, and ecological sectors.

AB  - Bioenergetic approaches are increasingly used to understand how marine mammal populations could be affected by a changing and disturbed aquatic environment. There remain considerable gaps in our knowledge of marine mammal bioenergetics, which hinder the application of bioenergetic studies to inform policy decisions. We conducted a priority-setting exercise to identify high-priority unanswered questions in marine mammal bioenergetics, with an emphasis on questions relevant to conservation and management. Electronic communication and a virtual workshop were used to solicit and collate potential research questions from the marine mammal bioenergetic community. From a final list of 39 questions, 11 were identified as 'key'questions because they received votes from at least 50% of survey participants. Key questions included those related to energy intake (prey landscapes, exposure to human activities) and expenditure (field metabolic rate, exposure to human activities, lactation, time-activity budgets), energy allocation priorities, metrics of body condition and relationships with survival and reproductive success and extrapolation of data from one species to another. Existing tools to address key questions include labelled water, animal-borne sensors, mark-resight data from long-term research programs, environmental DNA and unmanned vehicles. Further validation of existing approaches and development of new methodologies are needed to comprehensively address some key questions, particularly for cetaceans. The identification of these key questions can provide a guiding framework to set research priorities, which ultimately may yield more accurate information to inform policies and better conserve marine mammal populations.

AB  - Reproduction in flowering plants depends to a large degree on interactions with competitors, mutualists, and antagonists, but may also depend on the context within which interaction partners exist. Herbivory can reduce plant attractiveness to pollinators, but since many flowering plant species are visited by the same pollinators, the effects of herbivory on pollinator behavior may have consequences for undamaged neighboring plant species. We assessed how herbivory to a dominant plant species affects pollination services to neighboring flowering species in a community in which we simulated herbivory to milkweeds (Asclepias syriaca) by removing foliar tissue and applying jasmonic acid exogenously. We measured the quality of pollination services to undamaged neighboring plants by assessing the proportion of heterospecific pollen deposited on stigmas of four undamaged neighboring plant species, and measured seed production in one of these species. Our results indicate that simulated herbivory to a dominant plant species may have community-wide effects on pollination services. Simulated herbivory to milkweed increased the proportion of heterospecific pollen deposited on two neighboring plant species (Vicia cracca and Clinopodium vulgare), reduced it for one species (Lysimachia quadrifolia) and resulted in no change for another (Galium palustre). Additionally, simulated herbivory to milkweed resulted in a non-significant trend for lower seed production per fruit in V. cracca. These results support the hypothesis that herbivory on one flowering plant species can impact pollinator services for other flowering species at the patch level. These effects highlight the interconnectedness and interdependence of flowering plant species in plant-pollinator communities.

AB  - Many bird species use features of the physical environment to cue breeding activity. We show that for 2 species of Pacific auks (zooplanktivorous Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus and generalist rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata), spatio-temporal variation in marine production indicators surrounding a major breeding colony in the northeast Pacific Ocean can cue laying date. By utilizing a multi-year phenological time series and a spatio-temporal sliding-window analysis spanning November up until median lay dates in spring, chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations in the surface ocean around the colony strongly predicted lay date. However, the response to this cue differed between species by over 2 mo, as each species was exposed to different, sequential water-masses. We show that for Cassin's auklets, chl a levels at Triangle Island, British Columbia (Canada) in February, nearly 2 mo prior to actual laying, strongly correlated with lay date in April (average r = 0.83). At this time, the ocean environment around Triangle Island is dominated by water-masses from the south-southeast. However, for sympatric rhinoceros auklets, chl a along broad shelf-break areas in April prior to lay dates in May strongly correlated with lay date (average r = 0.76). Occurring after the spring transition, these water-masses flow primarily from the northwest. Consistent with other bird species, both auks appear to respond to information about food production, but at different spatio-temporal scales. We suggest that these different responses to environmental cues reflect species-specific differences in female migration behaviour, and an attempt by Cassin's auklets to bet-hedge against phenological mismatches.

AB  - In ruminants, diet composition has a positive correlation with heat production, which can influence thermoregulation, energy expenditure and, consequently, animal performance. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of climatic conditions and supplementation based on palm kernel cake, on the thermoregulation of crossbred buffaloes in the eastern Amazon. The research was carried out at Embrapa Amaz & ocirc;nia Oriental (01 degrees 26 ' S and 48 degrees 24 ' W), Bel & eacute;m, Par & aacute;, and lasted 12 months (representing the entire year). Twenty-four buffaloes, females, with initial age and an average weight of 54 +/- 7 months and 503.1 +/- 23 kg, respectively, non-pregnant, non-lactating and clinically healthy were used, divided into four treatments based on the supplementation content of the palm cake (%DM) in relation to their body weight (%): 0, 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0. The animals were kept in paddocks with Brachiaria brizantha (cv. Marandu), in a rotating system, with water to drink and mineral salt ad libitum. Equipment was installed to record environmental data (temperature and relative humidity, dew point temperature, wet bulb and black globe) and physiological data: rectal temperature (RT); respiratory rate (RR); and body surface temperature (BST), recorded twice a day, always in the morning (6:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.) and afternoon (12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m.) shifts, and were used to calculate the Globe Temperature and Humidity Index (GTHI). Supplementation did not influence the physiological variables of thermoregulation (p > 0.05). However, there were differences in the GTHI between the shifts, with higher means in the afternoon shift, especially in the less rainy period of the year, where the GTHI reached 92.06 +/- 2.74 (p < 0.05). In all periods of the year, the mean values of RT, RR and BST were higher in the afternoon shift (p > 0.05). The respiratory rate (RR) is associated with the annual seasonality of the thermal waters, with higher averages in the afternoons of the rainy season. The positive correlation for rectal temperature, respiratory rate and body surface temperature indicated that buffaloes respond to thermal elevations in the atmosphere (afternoon period) and, consequently, reflect on the GTHI. Supplementation does not influence thermoregulation; the changes observed occurred in response to the region's thermal and rainfall conditions (mainly in the afternoon shift), with higher GTHI values.

AB  - Measurement of bat guano deposition rate in caves can be an important research tool for estimation of colony size, for monitoring the record of long-term bat population trends, and for allied studies of guano invertebrate ecology, environmental contaminants, and paleoecology. However, previously published methodologies have lacked consistency. In the context of our recent studies of insectivorous bat guano deposition rates in Deer Cave, Sarawak, Borneo, we review some past studies and offer suggestions for best practises, along with proposed experimental design considerations for future studies (e.g., design of guano catchers, optimum deployment of catchers in relation to specific site characteristics, data reporting standards, and examples of mapping techniques). Consistent techniques will facilitate inter-site comparisons, and determination of intra-site changes over time. As a case study, and the first publication of detailed mapping of spatial variability in guano deposition rates, we present spatially explicit guano deposition rates for Deer Cave, ranging up to 88 g (dry weight)/m(2)/day in the main cave, and up to 540 g (dry weight)/m(2)/day in the northern extension.

AB  - Salt lick sites, where artificial salt blocks are placed at permanent locations, are common in summer grazing areas for free-ranging sheep in Norwegian mountains. These areas often overlap with areas used by wild reindeer, and reindeer are frequently observed at these salt lick sites. The first cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) were discovered among Norwegian wild reindeer in 2016, and salt lick sites were presumed to be hotspots for the transmission of CWD. In this study, we compare soil properties at salt lick and nearby control sites not affected by salt blocks and review how salt-induced changes may influence the persistence and transmission of CWD. Three wild reindeer areas were studied: one CWD-affected area, Nordfjella, and two areas without CWD, Knutsh & oslash; and Forollhogna. The soils at the salt lick sites were strongly influenced by dissolving salt blocks and increased animal activity. The salt lick sites had higher pH and ionic strength and increased levels of sodium (Na), chlorine (Cl), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and iodine (I), reflecting the composition of the salt blocks. The increased animal activity was reflected in eroded topsoil causing less soil organic matter (SOM), and there were higher amounts of elements related to defecation and urination, giving higher concentrations of inorganic nitrogen (Inorg-N), phosphate (PO4-P), sulfate (SO4-S), and potassium (K) as well as high gastrointestinal parasite frequency and diversity. The high salt content in the salt lick soils may stimulate geophagy, and as the soil is heavily contaminated by animal excretions, this may facilitate prion transmission. In addition, the high pH and ionic strength in the salt lick soils increase both the cation attraction and anion diffusion toward the soil particles, thereby facilitating both persistence and transmission of CWD. There was an increase in salinity at the salt lick sites in a gradient from west to east, most likely related to the coinciding decrease in precipitation. This suggests that if the use of permanent salt lick sites is discontinued, the salt lick sites in the east will maintain their attraction for congregating animals and geophagy longer than the western sites.

AB  - Maintaining water availability is crucial for sustaining wildlife populations in African savannah ecosystems, especially in semi-arid regions where natural surface water sources are limited. The establishment of Artificial Water Points (AWPs) has become a common management strategy in protected areas to mitigate the effects of water scarcity. This study investigated the spatio-temporal patterns of mammal visitation to AWPs in Majete Wildlife Reserve, Malawi, over an eight-year period using motion-triggered camera traps. The study documented a total of 34 medium- to large-sized mammal species, with warthog, waterbuck, impala and yellow baboon being the most frequently captured. Temporal analysis reveals diurnal visitation patterns, with peak activity during mid-day hours, and seasonal variations, with most species exhibiting increased visitation during the hot-dry season. Spatial analysis identifies preferences for AWPs proximate to perennial rivers and tourist infrastructure, emphasising the role of habitat features and human presence in AWP utilisation. Management implications include the need for tailored strategies addressing species-specific behaviours and habitat conditions, alongside ongoing monitoring efforts to ensure the sustainability of wildlife populations and ecological integrity. Despite the inherent limitations of camera trap methodology, this study provides valuable insights into AWP management strategies essential for conserving biodiversity in semi-arid environments.
