AB  - The maintenance of the functional integrity of the intestinal epithelium requires a tight coordination between cell production, migration, and shedding along the crypt-villus axis. Dysregulation of these processes may result in loss of the intestinal barrier and disease. With the aim of generating a more complete and integrated understanding of how the epithelium maintains homeostasis and recovers after injury, we have built a multi-scale agent-based model (ABM) of the mouse intestinal epithelium. We demonstrate that stable, self-organizing behaviour in the crypt emerges from the dynamic interaction of multiple signalling pathways, such as Wnt, Notch, BMP, ZNRF3/RNF43, and YAP-Hippo pathways, which regulate proliferation and differentiation, respond to environmental mechanical cues, form feedback mechanisms, and modulate the dynamics of the cell cycle protein network. The model recapitulates the crypt phenotype reported after persistent stem cell ablation and after the inhibition of the CDK1 cycle protein. Moreover, we simulated 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced toxicity at multiple scales starting from DNA and RNA damage, which disrupts the cell cycle, cell signalling, proliferation, differentiation, and migration and leads to loss of barrier integrity. During recovery, our in silico crypt regenerates its structure in a self-organizing, dynamic fashion driven by dedifferentiation and enhanced by negative feedback loops. Thus, the model enables the simulation of xenobiotic-, in particular chemotherapy-, induced mechanisms of intestinal toxicity and epithelial recovery. Overall, we present a systems model able to simulate the disruption of molecular events and its impact across multiple levels of epithelial organization and demonstrate its application to epithelial research and drug development.

AB  - Contact inhibition of cell proliferation regulates tissue size and prevents uncontrolled cell expansion. When cell density increases, contact inhibition can force proliferating cells into quiescence. Here we show that the variablememory of local cell density experienced by a mother cell controls the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activator cyclin D1and inhibitor p27 innewborn daughters, which direct cells to proliferation or quiescence. Much of this regulation can be explained by rapid suppression of ERK activity by high cell density in mothers, which leads to lower cyclin D1 and higher p27 levels in daughters. Strikingly, cell density and mitogen signals compete by shifting the ratio of cyclin D1/p27 levels below or above a single sharp threshold that controls the proliferation decision. Thus, the history of competing cell density and mitogen signals experienced by mothers is funneled into a precise activator-inhibitor balance that decides the fate of daughter cells.

AB  - UBE3A encodes ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, and in neurons its expression from the paternal allele is repressed by the UBE3A antisense transcript (UBE3A-ATS). This leaves neurons susceptible to loss-of-function of maternal UBE3A. Indeed, Angelman syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by maternal UBE3A deficiency. A promising therapeutic approach to treating Angelman syndrome is to reactivate the intact paternal UBE3A by suppressing UBE3A-ATS. Prior studies show that many neurological phenotypes of maternal Ube3a knockout mice can only be rescued by reinstating Ube3a expression in early development, indicating a restricted therapeutic window for Angelman syndrome. Here, we report that reducing Ube3a-ATS by antisense oligonucleotides in juvenile or adult maternal Ube3a knockout mice rescues the abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms and sleep disturbance, two prominent clinical features of Angelman syndrome. Importantly, the degree of phenotypic improvement correlates with the increase of Ube3a protein levels. These results indicate that the therapeutic window of genetic therapies for Angelman syndrome is broader than previously thought, and EEG power spectrum and sleep architecture should be used to evaluate the clinical efficacy of therapies.

AB  - Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder disrupting blood sugar regulation, has emerged as a prominent silent pandemic. Uncontrolled diabetes predisposes an individual to develop fatal complications like cardiovascular disorders, kidney damage, and neuropathies and aggravates the severity of treatable infections. Escalating cases of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes correlate with a global upswing in diabetes-linked mortality. As a growing global concern with limited preventive interventions, diabetes necessitates extensive research to mitigate its healthcare burden and assist ailing patients. An altered immune system exacerbated by chronic hyperinflammation heightens the susceptibility of diabetic individuals to microbial infections, including notable viruses like SARS-CoV-2, dengue, and influenza. Given such a scenario, we scrutinized the literature and compiled molecular pathways and signaling cascades related to immune compartments in diabetics that escalate the severity associated with the above-mentioned viral infections in them as compared to healthy individuals. The pathogenesis of these viral infections that trigger diabetes compromises both innate and adaptive immune functions and pre-existing diabetes also leads to heightened disease severity. Lastly, this review succinctly outlines available treatments for diabetics, which may hold promise as preventive or supportive measures to effectively combat these viral infections in the former.

AB  - Green tea leaves contain a wide range of active bio-compounds that are essential for sustainable quail intensification; however, its feed value is not known for the Jumbo quail. Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of different levels of green tea leaf powder (GTLP) on physiological and meat quality parameters of the Jumbo quail. One-week-old chicks (n = 350; 56.1 +/- 2.12 g live-weight) were evenly distributed to 35 replicate pens and reared on five experimental diets formulated as follows: a standard grower diet with zinc-bacitracin (PosCon), a standard grower diet without zinc-bacitracin (NegCon), and NegCon diet treated with 10 (GT10), 25 (GT25) and 50 g/kg (GT50) of GTLP. Weight gain linearly decreased in week 2 but increased in week 4, whereas feed conversion efficiency linearly declined in weeks 2 and 3 as GTLP levels increased. Overall feed intake, carcass yield, and caecum and colon weights showed a linear increase with GTLP levels. Hematological parameters fell within the normal ranges reported for healthy quail. The GT10 group showed larger liver weights than the PosCon and NegCon groups. It was concluded that dietary inclusion of GTLP enhances overall feed intake and carcass performance but not feed efficiency, hematological and meat quality parameters of Jumbo quail.

KW  - PATHOLOGY
AB  - Background: Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and it can aggravate depressive symptoms in non-AD patients. However, the impact of ApoE4 on AD-associated depression-like behaviors and its underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: This study developed a 5xFAD mouse model overexpressing human ApoE4 (E4FAD). Behavioral assessments and synaptic function tests were conducted to explore the effects of ApoE4 on cognition and depression in 5xFAD mice. Changes in peripheral and central lipid metabolism, as well as the levels of serotonin (5-HT) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortex, were examined. In addition, the protein levels of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase/glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta/mammalian target of rapamycin (DHCR24/GSK3 beta/mTOR) and postsynaptic density protein 95/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (PSD95/CaMK-II/BDNF) were measured to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of ApoE4 on AD mice. Results: Compared with 5xFAD mice, E4FAD mice exhibited more severe depression-like behaviors and cognitive impairments. These mice also exhibited increased amyloid-beta deposition in the hippocampus, increased astrocyte numbers, and decreased expression of depression-related neurotransmitters 5-HT and GABA in the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, lipid metabolism disorders were observed in E4FAD, manifesting as elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in peripheral blood, decreased cholesterol level in the prefrontal cortex, and reduced expression of key enzymes and proteins related to cholesterol synthesis and homeostasis. Abnormal expression of proteins related to the DHCR24/GSK3 beta/mTOR and PSD95/CaMK-II/BDNF pathways was also observed. Conclusion: This study found that ApoE4 overexpression exacerbates depression-like behaviors in 5xFAD mice and confirmed that ApoE4 reduces cognitive function in these mice. The mechanism may involve the induction of central and peripheral lipid metabolism disorders. Therefore, modulating ApoE expression or function to restore cellular lipid homeostasis may be a promising therapeutic target for AD comorbid with depression. This study also provided a better animal model for studying AD comorbid with depression.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal production is the main source of ammonia emission worldwide and all member countries of the European Union must reduce their national emissions. Among nutritional strategies, feeding low protein diets, using more nutritional phases, or using different feed additives can decrease the nitrogen excretion of animals and, in this way, lower the ammonia volatilisation from the manure. Pro- and prebiotics are widely used to improve gut health and to decrease the incidence of diseases. Numerous research findings have been published on the practical effects of pro- and prebiotics, but their impact on the urinary and faecal N excretion in chickens has not been completely clarified yet. In this research, the effects of using lactic acid and butyric acid producing bacterial strains, and wheat bran as a potential prebiotic, was tested with broiler chickens. Both probiotics increased the dry matter content and decreased the urinary N ratio of the excreta, which is positive from an ammonia emission point of view. Wheat bran and its xylan-oligosaccharides decreased both the ammonium -N content and the urinary N ratio. The results proved that beside the well-known nutritional techniques, the feed additives, which modify the gut microbiota and the fermentation in the caeca, can decrease the urinary-N excretion, and in this way lower the ammonia emission of broiler chickens. Ammonia emission is a concern for the poultry industry from both environmental and animal welfare points of view. The objective of this research was to determine whether probiotics or wheat bran supplementation of broiler diets can modify the N composition of the excreta and the dynamics of ammonia volatilisation emission from the manure. A total of 120-day-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were fed six different diets. The treatments included a corn and soybean meal-based control diet (C) and diets containing wheat bran (WB). Both diets were fed alone and with supplementation of a lactic acid (Lactobacillus farciminis, LAB) and a butyric acid (Clostridium butyricum, BAB) producing bacterial strain. Treatment BAB had a significant effect on the dry matter content of the excreta and both probiotics decreased the amount of excreted uric acid. Treatment WB resulted in a significantly lower NH4+-N concentration of excreta and a tendency toward reduced uric acid content. Treatment LAB reduced the urinary N ratio of excreta. Among dietary treatments, WB resulted in the highest urease producing cell numbers in the excreta, but this difference was not significant. Based on our results, similar to pigs, the soluble fibre fraction of poultry diets can also modify the urinary to faecal N ratio of the excreta.

AB  - Background: Listeria monocytogenes, , a zoonotic pathogen affecting humans and animals, exhibits a global distribution, including Iraq. This study focused on the rapid identification and phylogenetic analysis of L. monocytogenes in freshly collected ewe milk samples from various farms in Al-Qadisiyah province, Iraq. Methods: The study was conducted with care and precision, involving 150 milk samples. These samples were subjected to traditional bacterial isolation and identification using the enrichment culture method and biochemical tests, with the PCR technique confirming the results. The antibacterial activity of MgONPs was then assessed using the disc diffusion method, ensuring a comprehensive and reliable approach to the study. Result: The results show that 150 ewe milk samples underwent real-time PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the ssrA gene, followed by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing (PSGS) of purified conventional PCR products. Furthermore, the study entails the biosynthesis of magnesium oxide nanoparticles using Myrtus communis leaf extract, followed by a comprehensive characterization utilizing UV-spectra, FTIR, SEM, and TEM techniques. The Agar well diffusion method assessed the antibacterial efficacy of these Biosynthesized nanoparticles against L. monocytogenes. . The RT-PCR results revealed the presence of L. monocytogenes in 36 out of 150 samples (24%). Subsequent PCR analysis confirmed the presence of the pathogen in 30 out of these 36 positive samples (83.33%). Sequencing of two purified PCR products demonstrated 100% nucleotide identity with global isolates from Iraq and Turkey. . Furthermore, the study demonstrated that L. monocytogenes exhibited substantial sensitivity (24.66 +/- 0.3) to the biosynthesized magnesium oxide nanoparticles. These findings underscore the speed and precision of the RT-PCR method for detecting L. monocytogenes in fresh ewe milk samples. Conclusion: This comprehensive investigation enhances our understanding of L. monocytogenes prevalence in ewe milk and highlights the potential of Myrtus communis-derived nanoparticles for combating this pathogen.

AB  - Basic oxygen furnace slag (BOFS) is a high-volume waste resulting from the production of steel from pig iron. Due to its high free lime content, BOFS is difficult to recycle and/or include into conventional cement systems. Alkali-activation technology offers a pathway to transform industrial wastes such as BOFS into low-carbon cements. Alternative precursors for cement systems are needed as the reliance on commonly used materials like ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) is becoming unsustainable due to decreasing availability. This study investigates alkali-activated cements incorporating 20 and 30 wt.% of naturally weathered BOFS as a replacement for GGBFS, in both sodium silicate- and sodium carbonate-activated systems. A fraction of BOFS subject to mechanical activation is compared against the untreated BOFS in the 20 wt.% systems. It is observed that in naturally weathered BOFS, a significant portion of the free-lime is found to convert to portlandite, which accelerates alkali-activation kinetics. In sodium silicate-activated systems, the high pH of the activator results in incomplete reaction of the portlandite present in BOFS. The sodium carbonate-activated system shows near complete conversion of portlandite, causing an acceleration in the kinetics of reaction, setting, and hardening. These findings confirm the viability of sodium carbonate activated GGBFS-based systems with only a minor loss in strength properties. BOFS can be utilised as a valuable cement additive for the production of sustainable alkali-activated cements utilising sodium carbonate as a less carbon-intensive activator solution than the more commonly used sodium silicate. Mechanical activation of BOFS offers further optimisation potential for alkali-activation.

AB  - Prolonged neonatal febrile seizures (FSs) often lead to cognitive decline and increased risk of psychopathology in adulthood. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the long-term adverse effects of FSs remain unclear. In this study, we exposed rat pups to hyperthermia and induced FSs lasting at least 15 min. We investigated the short-term (one day) and delayed (11-13 and 41-45 days) effects of FSs on some parameters of morphological and functional maturation in the hippocampus. We noticed that FSs altered the developmental pattern of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity. In rats aged 21-23 days, GFAP-positive astrocytes covered a smaller area, and their morphological characteristics resembled those of rats at 11 days of age. In post-FS rats, the magnitude of long-term synaptic potentiation was reduced compared to control animals of the same age. Applying the gliotransmitter D-serine, an agonist of the glycine site of NMDA receptors, restored LTP to control values. A decrease in LTP amplitude was correlated with impaired spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze task in post-FS rats. Our data suggest that impaired neuron-glia interactions may be an essential mechanism of the adverse effects of FS on the developing brain.

AB  - Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which encompass pesticides and industrial chemicals widely utilized across the globe, pose a covert threat to human health. beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH) is an organochlorine pesticide with striking stability, still illegally dumped in many countries, and recognized as responsible for several pathogenetic mechanisms. This study represents a pioneering exploration into the neurotoxic effects induced by the exposure to beta-HCH specifically targeting neuronal cells (N2a), microglia (BV-2), and C57BL/6 mice. As shown by western blot and qPCR analyses, the administration of beta-HCH triggered a modulation of NF-kappa B, a key factor influencing both inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression. We demonstrated by proteomic and western blot techniques epigenetic modifications in H3 histone induced by beta-HCH. Histone acetylation of H3K9 and H3K27 increased in N2a, and in the prefrontal cortex of C57BL/6 mice administered with beta-HCH, whereas it decreased in BV-2 cells and in the hippocampus. We also observed a severe detrimental effect on recognition memory and spatial navigation by the Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT) and the Object Place Recognition Task (OPRT) behavioural tests. Cognitive impairment was linked to decreased expression of the genes BDNF and SNAP-25, which are mediators involved in synaptic function and activity. The obtained results expand our understanding of the harmful impact produced by beta-HCH exposure by highlighting its implication in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. These findings will support intervention programs to limit the risk induced by exposure to POPs. Regulatory agencies should block further illicit use, causing environmental hazards and endangering human and animal health.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic heavy metal and a significant public health concern. Epidemiological studies suggest that Cd is a potential neurotoxicant, and its exposure is associated with cognitive deficits in children, adults, and seniors. Our previous study has found that adulthood-only Cd exposure can impair cognition in mice. However, few studies have addressed the effects of Cd exposure during adolescence on cognitive behavior in animals later in life. In the present study, we exposed 4-week-old male C57BL/6 mice to 3 mg/L Cd via drinking water for 28 weeks and assessed their hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Cd did not affect anxiety or locomotor activity in the open field test. However, Cd exposure impaired short-term spatial memory and contextual fear memory in mice. A separate cohort of 4-week-old mice was similarly exposed to Cd for 13 weeks to investigate the potential mechanism of Cd neurotoxicity on cognition. We observed that Cd-treated mice had fewer adult-born cells, adult-born neurons, and a reduced proportion of adult-born cells that differentiated into mature neurons in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. These results suggest that Cd exposure from adolescence to adulthood is sufficient to cause cognitive deficits and impair key processes of hippocampal neurogenesis in mice.

AB  - Major features of living systems are the rates (power) and ratios (efficiency) of their energy uptake and use, whose relationships are not entirely predictable from those seen in nonliving physical systems. Although the energetic power and efficiency of production (growth and reproduction) are known to respond to differences in ration level, diet, and other intrinsic and extrinsic factors, why these responses vary considerably among animals is little understood and often ignored in theoretical models. In this exploratory study I show that a holistic analysis of how the different responses of the efficiencies of resource uptake and use systems to variation in food levels and associated rates of energy flow (power) helps one predict the ration-dependent efficiency of conversion of ingested energy into growth and reproduction. When the relative influence of the efficiency of assimilation (resource supply) predominates (as in many herbivores), the efficiency of converting ingested energy into production tends to vary negatively with ration level and production power, whereas when the relative influence of the efficiency of converting assimilated energy into biological tissues (resource use) predominates (as in carnivores), the ingestive production efficiency tends to vary positively with ration level and production power. I also extend this analysis by showing how studies at multiple hierarchical levels of biological organization, from cells to ecosystems, may improve our understanding of the covariation of production efficiency with ration level or overall rate of energy flow (power). A new comprehensive theory of the power and efficiency of living systems is advocated.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the primary causes of disability and dependency among aging populations worldwide. Neuroinflammation may be a potential therapeutic target in AD. Moreover, ionizing radiation may be a tool for modulating neuroinflammation. Here, we used three mouse lines-C57Bl/6 and the transgenic AD models 5xFAD and Tau P301S-to investigate the effects of combined ionizing radiation (gamma-rays and carbon-12 nuclei) on emotional state, cognitive abilities, and markers of microglial activation. The obtained data show that combined irradiation results in enhanced exploratory behavior and spatial learning in the C57Bl/6 mice. The same changes, as well as a decrease in anxiety, were found in the Tau P301S mice. Irradiation of the 5xFAD mice resulted in improved welfare and ability to discriminate odors. At the same time, irradiation led to an increase in the level of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the prefrontal cortex and, to a lesser extent, in the hippocampus of the C57Bl/6 and Tau P301S mice. An increase in macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha in the prefrontal cortex and a decrease in interleukin 2 beta in the hippocampus were found in the 5xFAD mice. Taken together, our data indicate that ionizing radiation exposure is an adequate tool to modulate microglial activity in the brain and may provide cognitive and non-cognitive behavioral benefits in neurodegenerative disease conditions.

AB  - Tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Ktze), a key economic crop in China, are severely impacted by diseases, significantly reducing tea production. Due to issues such as resistance and pesticide residues associated with traditional chemical control, developing green control methods is crucial. The Mildew Resistance Locus O (MLO) gene, a negative regulator of plant disease resistance, has been a focal point in plant disease resistance research for years. This study identified 28 CsMLO gene family members in the tea plant genome and selected the CsMLO1 gene, which exhibits significant expression changes under pathogen stress, for cloning and functional validation. The virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assay revealed that silencing CsMLO1 in tea plants significantly enhances their disease resistance. Further overexpression of the CsMLO1 gene in tobacco and subsequent infection with powdery mildew revealed a significant decrease in resistance upon overexpression. These results suggest that CsMLO1 negatively regulates plant disease resistance. Through database comparison analysis, we screened out the miRNA interacting with the CsMLO1 gene, namely novel-miRNA-76-5p. To investigate its function, we subjected the sprayed plants to pathogen stress experiments. The findings from the analysis indicated that the activities of various protective enzymes in tea leaves treated with novel miRNA-76-5p were significantly increased, the area of disease spots was significantly reduced, and the plant stress resistance was significantly enhanced. The experiments demonstrated that miRNA exhibits a significant control effect against fungal diseases in tea plants, offering a novel research direction for the eco-friendly management of tea plant diseases.

AB  - Microglia can help clear amyloid beta plaques in the Alzheimer's disease brain but may also become dysfunctional and can contribute to disease progression. March-Diaz et al. reveal that hypoxia, a potentially modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, disrupts the metabolism and function of microglia near plaques, which may contribute to neuropathology.
   Genetic Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors associate with reduced defensive amyloid beta plaque-associated microglia (A beta AM), but the contribution of modifiable AD risk factors to microglial dysfunction is unknown. In AD mouse models, we observe concomitant activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) pathway and transcription of mitochondrial-related genes in A beta AM, and elongation of mitochondria, a cellular response to maintain aerobic respiration under low nutrient and oxygen conditions. Overactivation of HIF1 induces microglial quiescence in cellulo, with lower mitochondrial respiration and proliferation. In vivo, overstabilization of HIF1, either genetically or by exposure to systemic hypoxia, reduces A beta AM clustering and proliferation and increases A beta neuropathology. In the human AD hippocampus, upregulation of HIF1 alpha and HIF1 target genes correlates with reduced A beta plaque microglial coverage and an increase of A beta plaque-associated neuropathology. Thus, hypoxia (a modifiable AD risk factor) hijacks microglial mitochondrial metabolism and converges with genetic susceptibility to cause AD microglial dysfunction.

AB  - Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are regarded as the root of tumor recurrence and distant metastasis, as well as the major cause of resistance to conventional cancer therapies. Elucidating the mechanism of regulating CSCs is of great significance for the development of CSCs-targeting therapy strategies. YAP/TAZ are identified as key regulators of CSCs-related traits on breast cancer cells; however, the upstream regulatory mechanism of Hippo kinases cascade involved in regulating YAP/TAZ remains elusive. In this study, we found that the low expression of RICH1 in breast cancer was associated with poor prognosis. Depletion of RICH1 promoted the stemness and disrupted the normal epithelial architecture of MCF10A cells. Besides, RICH1 inhibited the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and sensitized these cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Mechanistically, RICH1 activated the kinases cascade of Hippo signaling via displacing Amot-p80 from the complex with Merlin. Further studies revealed that the deletion of the BAR domain of RICH1 abolished the function of attenuating the binding of Amot-p80 and Merlin, illustrating that the competitive binding to Amot-p80 with Merlin was mediated by the BAR domain of RICH1. In conclusion, our work elucidated the role and molecular mechanism of RICH1 in stemness regulation of breast cancer, and might provide opportunities for CSCs-targeting therapy.

AB  - Stress impairs hippocampal neurogenesis. The traditional animal model of stress contains a mixture of physical and psychological stress factors. This leads to difficulty in the evaluation of the effect of pure psychological stress on neurogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effect of pure psychological stress on hippocampal neurogenesis. The pure psychological stress model and the mixed stress model were carried out by terrifying sound and restraint, respectively. The open field test showed that restraint treatment improved the general locomotor activity levels, while terrifying sound treatment had opposite effects. Compared with a normal condition, both terrifying sound stimulation and restraint treatment significantly decreased the number of BrdU and Ki-67 and reduced the positive rate of SOX2/GFAP in the hippocampus. These phenomena indicated that pure psychological stress could decrease the number of neural stem cells and inhibit cell proliferation in the hippocampus of a mouse. Furthermore, compared with the restraint treatment, the neurotransmitters including norepinephrine (NE), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) had not been affected drastically by terrifying sound stimulation. Our results suggest that the terrifying sound stimulation can be considered as a novel and effective pure psychological stress animal model for the further research on the hippocampus.

AB  - Introduction: Spermatozoa cryopreservation is an important technique to preserve fertility for males. This study aimed at exploring the stability of epigenetics information in human spermatozoa, manipulated by two different technologies, freezing and vitrification. Methods: Spermatozoa samples were distributed into three groups: 1. Fresh spermatozoa (control group), 2. Frozen spermatozoa, 3. Vitrified spermatozoa. Epigenetic differences of fresh and cryopreserved spermatozoa were evaluated using high-throughput RNA sequencing. Results: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in frozen (1103 genes) and vitrified (333 genes) spermatozoa were evaluated. The bioinformatical analysis identified 8 and 15 significant pathways in groups of frozen and vitrified spermatozoa, respectively. The majority of these pathways are most relevant to immune and infectious diseases. The DEGs of the fertilization process are not detected during vitrification. The freezing process induces more down-regulation of genes and is relevant to apoptosis changes and immune response. Conclusion: Cryopreservation of human spermatozoa is an epigenetically safe method for male fertility preservation. Cryoprotectant-free vitrification can induce more minor biological changes in human spermatozoa, in comparison with conventional freezing.

AB  - Swine are widely used in biomedical research, translational research, xenotransplantation, and agriculture. For these uses, physiologic reference intervals are extremely important for assessing the health status of the swine and diagnosing disease. However, few biochemical and hematologic reference intervals that comply with guidelines from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and the American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology are available for swine. These guidelines state that reference intervals should be determined by using 120 subjects or more. The aim of this study was to generate hematologic and biochemical reference intervals for female, juvenile Yorkshire swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) and to compare these values with those for humans and baboons (Papio hamadryas). Blood samples were collected from the femoral artery or vein of female, juvenile Yorkshire swine, and standard hematologic and biochemical parameters were analyzed in multiple studies. Hematologic and biochemical reference intervals were calculated for arterial blood samples from Yorkshire swine (n = 121 to 124); human and baboon reference intervals were obtained from the literature. Arterial reference intervals for Yorkshire swine differed significantly from those for humans and baboons in all commonly measured parameters except platelet count, which did not differ significantly from the human value, and glucose, which was not significantly different from the baboon value. These data provide valuable information for investigators using female, juvenile Yorkshire swine for biomedical research, as disease models, and in xenotransplantation studies as well as useful physiologic information for veterinarians and livestock producers. Our findings highlight the need for caution when comparing data and study outcomes between species.

AB  - Modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) has shown beneficial effects on motor function improvement after brain injury, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study, amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) metrics measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was obtained to investigate the efficacy and mechanism of mCIMT in a control cortical impact (CCI) rat model simulating traumatic brain injury. At 3 days after control cortical impact model establishment, we found that the mean ALFF (mALFF) signals were decreased in the left motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, insula cortex and the right motor cortex, and were increased in the right corpus callosum. After 3 weeks of an 8-hour daily mCIMT treatment, the mALFF values were significantly increased in the bilateral hemispheres compared with those at 3 days postoperatively. The mALFF signal values of left corpus callosum, left somatosensory cortex, right medial prefrontal cortex, right motor cortex, left postero dorsal hippocampus, left motor cortex, right corpus callosum, and right somatosensory cortex were increased in the mCIMT group compared with the control cortical impact group. Finally, we identified brain regions with significantly decreased mALFF values at 3 days postoperatively. Pearson correlation coefficients with the right forelimb sliding score indicated that the improvement in motor function of the affected upper limb was associated with an increase in mALFF values in these brain regions. Our findings suggest that functional cortical plasticity changes after brain injury, and that mCIMT is an effective method to improve affected upper limb motor function by promoting bilateral hemispheric cortical remodeling. mALFF values correlate with behavioral changes and can potentially be used as biomarkers to assess dynamic cortical plasticity after traumatic brain injury.

AB  - Snails are important agricultural pests difficult to control, but data regarding molluscicidal assays are scant. Stemona alkaloids are typical secondary metabolites for the taxa and have been broadly investigated for their pharmacological and toxicological effects. This makes it possible for us to further develop the toxicities of these compounds to snails. In this work, we tested the antifeedant properties of leaves from seven Chinese Stemona species against the land snail species Bradybaena ravida in choice and non-choice feeding assays. The tested leaves Stemona parviflora exhibited the most deterrent effects, and a further phytochemical investigation of aerial parts led to the identification of 16 alkaloids. Among them, three novel alkaloids could be identified. The alkaloidal fraction and single alkaloids were further assayed against this snail species, and the results suggest a cocktail effect because the impact of the alkaloidal fraction was higher than the effects caused by single alkaloids. The study can promote the search process of natural antimollusc products from plants to control snails.

AB  - Simple Summary Pelleting of animal feeds has been practiced for decades, to denature protein, increase starch gelatinization, decrease anti-nutrient factor content, and improve the nutritional value of feed ingredients. Long-term high-temperature stabilization after pelleting has been employed by feed manufacturers to control the spread of pathogenic microorganisms, especially African swine fever through feed. However, pelleting is an aggressive process against vitamins, and prolonged high temperatures may further damage the vitamins' structure. Our results showed that the recovery of vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B-2, and vitamin B-6 significantly decreased after pelleting and long-term high-temperature stabilization, and the high-temperature stabilization process has the most significant influence. The objective of this study was to study the effect of pelleting and long-term high-temperature stabilization on the retention of vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B-2, and vitamin B-6 in swine feed. Piglet diets (diet 1 and 3) were pelleted after conditioning at 83 degrees C for 120 s, and were high-temperature stabilized at 90 degrees C for 8.5 min after pelleting; the finishing pig diets (diet 2, 4, and 5) were pelleted after conditioning at 82 degrees C for 90 s, and were high-temperature stabilized at 85 degrees C for 9 min after pelleting; the samples were obtained before condition, after condition, after pelleting, and after cooling. The contents of vitamin A and vitamin E in diets 1-5 and vitamin B-2, and vitamin B-6 in diets 3-5 were detected. The results showed that: (1) the conditioning process had no significant effect on the retention of vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B-2, and vitamin B-6 in all experimental diets (p > 0.05); (2) the pelleting process and high-temperature stabilization process after pelleting had different degrees of influence on vitamins, among which the stabilization process had a more significant effect on the retention of vitamins. After pelleting and long-term high-temperature stabilization, the retention of vitamin A, vitamin E, and B-2, and vitamin B-6 were 68.8-77.3%, 56.9-90.1%, 63.8-70.3%, and 60.1-67.0%, respectively. In the process of pelleting and long-term high-temperature stabilization, the retention of vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B-2, and vitamin B-6 in the feed were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Therefore, vitamin loss during high temperature and over a long period of time is worth considering, and vitamins must be over-supplemented.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world is due to the enormous capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus to be transmitted between humans, causing a threat to global public health. It has been shown that the entry of this virus into cells is highly facilitated by the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the cell membrane. Currently, we have no precise knowledge of how this receptor expresses in the brain of human fetus and, as a consequence, we do not know how susceptible the neural cells in the developing brain are to being infected through the vertical transmission of this virus, from mother to fetus. In this work, we describe the expression of ACE2 in the human brain at 20 weeks of gestation. This stage corresponds to the period of neuronal generation, migration, and differentiation in the cerebral cortex. We describe the specific expression of ACE2 in neuronal precursors and migratory neuroblasts of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus. This finding implies that SARS-CoV-2 infection during the fetal period may affect neuronal progenitor cells and alter the normal development of the brain region where memory engrams are generated. Thus, although vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in few cases, the massive infection rate of young people in terms of the new variants leads to the possibility of increasing the ratio of congenital infections and originating cognitive alterations, as well as neuronal circuit anomalies that may represent vulnerability to mental problems throughout life.

AB  - Significant inroads have been achieved in our understanding of neuropathology with the discovery of the crosstalk between the nervous and immune systems. In the neuro-immune crosstalk, interleukin-15 (IL-15) and its receptors are essential mediators. The IL-15 system has been found to act on peripheral metabolism, including glucose, lipid and energy homeostasis. Nevertheless, whether it promotes neuropsychiatric disorders by affecting CNS metabolism remains unclear, warranting further exploration. Herein, we performed untargeted GC-MS metabolomics between Il-15r alpha mutant mice and wildtype mice. The results showed that Il-15r alpha mutation led to metabolic alternations in the cortex and hippocampus, some of which potentially exert detrimental effects on brain health. The identification of neurotransmitter (GABA and 5-hydroxytryptophan), energy (glycolysis and ketone bodies) and lipid (cholesterol and fatty acids) metabolism disorders corroborates the findings of previous studies on the IL-15 system. Moreover, anandamide and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate were novel potential candidates. These findings enhance our understanding of the IL-15 system and its interactions with neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Since decellularized tissues may offer the instructive niche for cell differentiation and function, their use as cell culture scaffolds is a promising approach for regenerative medicine. To repair osteochondral tissues, developing a scaffold with biomimetic structural, compositional, and functional characteristics is vital. As a result of their heterogeneous structure, decellularized articular cartilage matrix from allogeneic and xenogeneic sources are considered appropriate scaffolds for cartilage regeneration. We developed a scaffold for osteochondral tissue engineering by decellularizing sheep knee cartilage using a chemical technique. DNA content measurements and histological examinations revealed that this protocol completely removed cells from decellularized cartilage. Furthermore, SEM, MTS assay, and H&E staining revealed that human endometrial stem cells could readily adhere to the decellularized cartilage, and the scaffold was biocompatible for their proliferation. Besides, we discovered that decellularized scaffolds could promote EnSC osteogenic differentiation by increasing bone-specific gene expression. Further, it was found that decellularized scaffolds were inductive for chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells, evidenced by an up-regulation in the expression of the cartilage-specific gene. Also, in vivo study showed the high affinity of acellularized scaffolds for cell adhesion and proliferation led to an improved regeneration of articular lesions in rats after 4 weeks. Finally, a perfect scaffold with high fidelity is provided by the developed decellularized cartilage scaffold for the functional reconstruction of osteochondral tissues; these types of scaffolds are helpful in studying how the tissue microenvironment supports osteocytes and chondrocytes differentiation, growth, and function to have a good osteochondral repair effect.

AB  - Research has indicated a strong link between exposure to aluminum (Al) and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Given the rising use of Al nanoparticles, which are far more neurotoxic than Al, it is noteworthy to investigate the possible protective properties of natural substances. Curcumin, an important component of turmeric, has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in some animal studies. The main objective of this study was to examine the protective effects of curcumin on the memory deficit induced by subcutaneous aluminum oxide nanoparticles (Al-NP) administration in mice. Additionally, considering the roles of the hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Akt pathway in AD pathology, their levels were evaluated. Adult male Swiss mice (SWR/J) were administered Al-NP (10 mg/kg/s.c.) with or without curcumin (2.5, or 25 mg/kg/P.O) for 10 days. Memory and anxiety-like behavior were assessed using passive avoidance and elevated plus maze tasks, respectively. Western blot analysis was employed to measure hippocampal BDNF and Akt proteins in the hippocampus. The findings revealed that Al-NP induced memory impairment in mice, whereas curcumin at 25 mg/kg prevented this memory deficit. Additionally, Al-NP significantly reduced the hippocampal BDNF and phosphorylated Akt levels, while curcumin increased BDNF and phosphorylated Akt to a nonsignificant level compared to the control group. These results not only suggest the neuroprotective properties of curcumin but also suggest a possible association between hippocampal BDNF and Akt signaling in the neuroprotective mechanism of this compound against Al-NP toxicity.

AB  - The degradation of the environment due to numerous industrial practices has emerged as a major issue globally, particularly in a country like Bangladesh. The present study dispenses information about heavy metal (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) contamination in some frequently consumed vegetables, namely, ash pumpkin, potato, bitter gourd, buffalo spinach, snake gourd, and pointed gourd grown in an industrially prone location and their repercussion on consumers' health. Proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) technique was used as the major analytical tool to detect heavy metal concentrations. Mean concentration and the range of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb in vegetables were detected (4.81 +/- 2.79, 2.43-10.94), (497.57 +/- 258.08, 181.24-886.67), (644.49 +/- 298.40, 179.56-998.78), (38.88 +/- 14.31, 18.88-60.12), (58.11 +/- 12.58, 42.55-84.79), (137.24 +/- 48.37, 71.99-208.98), (123.31 +/- 63.62, 49.97-256.09), (8.09 +/- 2.69, 4.29-14.94), and (4.16 +/- 2.95, 1.22-9.98) mg/kg (dry weight basis), respectively. An extreme level of heavy metal contamination in vegetable samples was notified regarding the estimated metal pollution index (MPI) and Nemerow pollution index (P) value, which underpinned the health risk values. The estimated hazard index (HI) value stipulated high risk in all varieties of vegetables regardless of age group and cadmium (Cd) was found as the major contributor. Concerning the carcinogenic risk index (CR) for single elements, the value of Co, Ni, and Cr was approximated far above the USEPA threshold risk limit (CR>1E-04). Moreover, total carcinogenic risk (TCR) for all varieties of vegetables exceeded the safety threshold value for both the age group and children, in particular, were found most vulnerable. The outshot of the present study divulged associated health risks for the population group by the heavy metals via dietary intake of vegetables.

AB  - Transdermal drug delivery of lidocaine is a good choice for local anesthetic delivery. Microemulsions have shown great effectiveness for the transdermal transport of lidocaine. Oil-in-water nanoemulsions are particularly suitable for encapsulation of lipophilic molecules because of their ability to form stable and transparent delivery systems with good skin permeation. However, fabrication of nanoemulsions containing lidocaine to provide an extended local anesthetic effect is challenging. Hence, the aim of this study was to address this issue by employing alginate-based o/w nanocarriers using nanoemulsion template that is prepared by combined approaches of ultrasound and phase inversion temperature (PIT). In this study, the influence of system composition such as oil type, oil and surfactant concentration on the particle size, in vitro release and skin permeation of lidocaine nanoemulsions was investigated. Structural characterization of lidocaine nanoemulsions as a function of water dilution was done using DSC. Nanoemulsions with small droplet diameters (d < 150 nm) were obtained as demonstrated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and cryo-TEM. These nanoemulsions were also able to release 90% of their content within 24-h through PDMS and pig skin and able to the drug release over a 48-h. This extended-release profile is highly favorable in transdermal drug delivery and shows the great potential of this nanoemulsion as delivery system.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cascading changes in cognition and behavior. G-protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) has been used as a promising target for the treatment of diabetes, but its function in AD is unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of O-1602, a GPR55 agonist, on the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD mouse model. A single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of STZ into the brains of mice significantly induced cognitive impairment. In contrast, O-1602 (2.0 or 4.0 mu g/mouse, i.c.v.) can improve the cognitive dysfunction caused by STZ in the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Importantly, O-1602 treatment reversed STZ-induced GPR55 down-regulation, reduced the activity of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) and the level of A beta 1-42, and abolished the up-regulation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Besides, O-1602 markedly suppressed STZ-induced oxidative stress, characterized by decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and increased the levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutases (SOD), and catalase (CAT), as well as attenuated neuroinflammation as indicated by decreased series of pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglia activation. O-1602 treatment also ameliorated synaptic dysfunction by promoting the up-regulation of PSD-95 protein in the STZ-treated mice. Our results suggest that O-1602 has potent neuroprotective effects against STZ-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Background: Sleep deprivation (SD) is a common condition affecting many people in modern life. Edaravone (Eda) is a neuroprotective drug, but whether it can improve cognitive impairment caused by SD remains unclear. Methods: Animals received oral gavage doses of Eda (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) for 8 and 5 days before and during SD. Starting from the 6th day, a modified multiple platform model was used to produce SD in mice for 72 h. The Lashley III maze was used for evaluating spatial learning and memory. Malondialdehyde (MDA) in the hippocampus and serum corticosterone were assessed. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and the activity of the enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured. Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), synapsin 1 (SYN-1), post-synaptic density-95 (PSD-95), synaptophysin (SYP), and signs of inflammation were detected using Western blotting. Results: SD caused cognitive impairment, whereas Eda pretreatment warded off such an effect. While serum corticosterone levels rose with SD as well, they decreased in SD mice that received Eda (p < 0.05). Moreover, Eda normalized the SD-induced decline in hippocampal activity of SOD and GPx, lowered MDA levels, and elevated TAC (p < 0.01). Additionally, the hippocampal levels of GAP-34, SYP, SYN-I, and PSD-95 were elevated, while IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were lowered following Eda pretreatment (p < 0.05). Conclusions: SD caused memory impairment; however, pretreatment with Eda improved memory by upregulating synaptic proteins in the hippocampus and having anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.

AB  - The discovery of synaptic nanostructures revealed key insights into the molecular logic of synaptic function and plasticity. Yet, our understanding of how diverse synapses in the brain organize their nano-architecture remains elusive, largely due to the limitations of super-resolution imaging in complex brain tissue. Here, we characterized single-domain camelid nanobodies for the 3D quantitative multiplex imaging of synaptic nano-organization sing tau-STED nanoscopy in cryosections from the mouse primary somatosensory cortex. We focused on thalamocortical (TC) and corticocortical (CC) synapses along the apical-basal axis of layer five pyramidal neurons as models of functionally diverse glutamatergic synapses in the brain. Spines receiving TC input were larger than those receiving CC input in all layers examined. However, the nano-architecture of TC synapses varied with dendritic location. TC afferents on apical dendrites frequently contacted spines with multiple aligned PSD-95/Bassoon nanomodules of constant size. In contrast, TC spines on basal dendrites predominantly contained a single aligned nanomodule, with PSD-95 nanocluster sizes scaling proportionally with spine volume. The nano-organization of CC synapses did not change across cortical layers and resembled modular architecture defined in vitro. These findings highlight the nanoscale diversity of synaptic architecture in the brain, that is, shaped by both the source of afferent input and the subcellular localization of individual synaptic contacts.

AB  - Insect wing development is a fascinating and intricate process that involves the regulation of wing size through cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this study, we find that Ter94, an AAA-ATPase, is essential for proper wing size dependently on its ATPase activity. Loss of Ter94 enables the suppression of Hippo target genes. When Ter94 is depleted, it results in reduced wing size and increased apoptosis, which can be rescued by inhibiting the Hippo pathway. Biochemical experiments reveal that Ter94 reciprocally binds to Mer, a critical upstream component of the Hippo pathway, and disrupts its interaction with Ex and Kib. This disruption prevents the formation of the Ex-Mer-Kib complex, ultimately leading to the inactivation of the Hippo pathway and promoting proper wing development. Finally, we show that hVCP, the human homolog of Ter94, is able to substitute for Ter94 in modulating Drosophila wing size, underscoring their functional conservation. In conclusion, Ter94 plays a positive role in regulating wing size by interfering with the Ex-Mer-Kib complex, which results in the suppression of the Hippo pathway.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the combination of extracellular (nano) vesicles (EVs) from pig adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) and a thermoresponsive gel, Pluronic (R) F-127 (PF-127), to prevent stricture formation after endoscopic resection in a porcine model. ADSC EVs were produced at a liter scale by a high-yielding turbulence approach from ADSCs 3D cultured in bioreactors and characterized in terms of size, morphology and membrane markers. The thermoresponsive property of the PF-127 gel was assessed by rheology. The pro-regenerative potency of ADSC EVs was investigated ex vivo in esophageal biopsies under starvation. In vivo tests were performed in a porcine model after extended esophageal endoscopic mucosal dissection (ESD). Pigs were randomized into 3 groups: control (n = 6), gel (n = 6) or a combination of 1.45 x 10(12) EVs + gel (n = 6). Application of gel +/- EVs was performed just after ESD with a follow-up finalized on day 21 post-ESD. There was a trend towards less feeding disorder in the EV + gel group in comparison with the gel and the control groups (16.67% vs. 66.7% vs. 83.33%, respectively) but without reaching a statistically significant difference. A significant decrease in the esophageal stricture rate was confirmed by endoscopic, radiological and histological examination for the EV + gel group. A decrease in the mean fibrosis area and larger regenerated muscularis mucosae were observed for the EV + gel group. In summary, the application of EVs + gel after extended esophageal endoscopic resection succeeded in preventing stricture formation with an anti-fibrotic effect. This nano-therapy may be of interest to tackle an unmet medical need considering that esophageal stricture is the most challenging delayed complication after extended superficial cancer resection by endoscopy.

AB  - Introduction: Intermittent fasting enhances neural bioenergetics, is neuroprotective, and elicits antioxidant effects in various animal models. There are conflicting findings on seizure protection, where intermittent fasting regimens often cause severe weight loss resembling starvation which is unsustainable long-term. Therefore, we tested whether a less intensive intermittent fasting regimen such as time-restricted feeding (TRF) may confer seizure protection. Methods: Male CD1 mice were assigned to either ad libitum-fed control, continuous 8 h TRF, or 8 h TRF with weekend ad libitum food access (2:5 TRF) for one month. Body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels were measured. Seizure thresholds were determined at various time points using 6-Hz and maximal electroshock seizure threshold (MEST) tests. Protein levels and mRNA expression of genes, enzyme activity related to glucose metabolism, as well as mitochondrial dynamics were assessed in the cortex and hippocampus. Markers of antioxidant defence were evaluated in the plasma, cortex, and liver. Results: Body weight gain was similar in the ad libitum-fed and TRF mouse groups. In both TRF regimens, blood glucose levels did not change between the fed and fasted state and were higher during fasting than in the ad libitum-fed groups. Mice in the TRF group had increased seizure thresholds in the 6-Hz test on day 15 and on day 19 in a second cohort of 2:5 TRF mice, but similar seizure thresholds at other time points compared to ad libitumfed mice. Continuous TRF did not alter MEST seizure thresholds on day 28. Mice in the TRF group showed increased maximal activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the cortex, which was accompanied by increased protein levels of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 in the cortex and hippocampus. There were no other major changes in protein or mRNA levels associated with energy metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics in the brain, nor markers of antioxidant defence in the brain, liver, or plasma. Conclusions: Both continuous and 2:5 TRF regimens transiently increased seizure thresholds in the 6-Hz model at around 2 weeks, which coincided with stability of blood glucose levels during the fed and fasted periods. Our findings suggest that the lack of prolonged anticonvulsant effects in the acute electrical seizure models employed may be attributed to only modest metabolic and antioxidant adaptations found in the brain and liver. Our findings underscore the potential therapeutic value of TRF in managing seizure-related conditions.

AB  - Southern elephant seals (SES) experience a 'catastrophic molt', a costly event characterized by the renewal of both hair and epidermis that requires high peripheral vascular circulation. Molting animals are therefore constrained by high metabolic heat loss and are thought to fast and remain on land. To examine the ability of individuals to balance the energetic constraints of molting on land we investigate the stomach temperature and movement patterns of molting female SES. We find that 79% of females swam and 61% ingested water or prey items, despite the cost of cold-water exposure while molting. This behavior was related to periods of warm and low wind conditions, and females that dived and ingested more often, lost less body mass. We conclude that the paradigm of fasting during the molt in this species, and the fitness consequences of this behavior should be reconsidered, especially in the context of a changing climate.
   This study investigates the ability to balance the energetic constraints of molting on land in a diving mammal, the southern elephant seal, the only phocid to experiment a catastrophic molt in a cold and windy environment.

We imaged mouse CA1 (cornu ammonis 1) ensembles in two environments across three weeks to evaluate these coding hypotheses. While place fields "remap,"being more distinct between than within environ-ments, coactivity relationships generally change less. Decoding location and environment from 1-s ensemble location-specific activity is effective and improves with experience. Decoding environment from cell-pair co -activity relationships is also effective and improves with experience, even after removing place tuning. Discriminating environments from 1-s ensemble coactivity relies crucially on the cells with the most anti-coactive cell-pair relationships because activity is internally organized on a low-dimensional manifold of non-linear coactivity relationships that intermittently reregisters to environments according to the anti-cofiring subpopulation activity.

AB  - Epigenetics plays an important role in the malignant progression of tumors, in which DNA methylation can alter genetic performance without altering the DNA sequence. As a key regulator demethylation, thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) has been reported to participate in malignant progression of multiple tumors. In this study, we demonstrate that TDG is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its high expression is closely related to the poor prognosis of patients. Decreasing TDG expression can significantly inhibit the malignant biological behavior of HCC cells. ABL proto-oncogene 1(ABL1) was identified as a downstream gene regulated by TDG demethylation. In addition, TDG can affect the Hippo signaling pathway through ABL1 to regulate HCC cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration. Overall, our study demonstrated that TDG reduces DNA methylation of ABL1, increases ABL1 protein expression, and affects the Hippo signaling pathway to regulate the malignant progression of HCC.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental exposure to chlorpyrifos (CPF) could increase risks for neurological disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, cognitive impairment, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The potential involvement of microglia reactive to inflammatory stimuli in these neurological disorders has been generally reported. However, the concrete effects and potential mechanisms of microglia dysfunction triggered by developmental CPF exposure remain unclear. Therefore, we established mouse and human embryonic microglial cells (HMC3 cell) models of developmental CPF exposure to evaluate the effects of developmental CPF exposure on neuroinflammation and underlying mechanisms. The results showed that developmental exposure to CPF enhanced the expression of Iba1 in hippocampus. CPF treatment increased inflammatory cytokines levels and TSPO expression in hippocampus and HMC3 cells. The levels of necroptosis and necroptosis-related signaling RIPK/MLKL were increased in hippocampus and HMC3 cells following CPF exposure. Furthermore, the expression of TLR4/TRIF signaling was increased in hippocampus and HMC3 cells subjected to CPF exposure. Notably, the increased levels of TLR4/TRIF signaling, RIPK/MLKL signaling, necroptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by CPF treatment were remarkably inhibited by TAK-242 (a specific TLR4 inhibitor). Addi-tionally, the necroptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines production induced by CPF treatment were signifi-cantly relieved by Nec-1 (a specific RIPK1 inhibitor). In general, the above results suggested that activated microglia in hippocampus subjected to developmental CPF exposure underwent RIPK1/MLKL-mediated nec-roptosis regulated by TLR4/TRIF signaling.

AB  - Investigating and modelling the functionality of human neurons remains challenging due to the technical limitations, resulting in scarce and incomplete 3D anatomical reconstructions. Here we used a morphological modelling approach based on optimal wiring to repair the parts of a dendritic morphology that were lost due to incomplete tissue samples. In Drosophila, where dendritic regrowth has been studied experimentally using laser ablation, we found that modelling the regrowth reproduced a bimodal distribution between regeneration of cut branches and invasion by neighbouring branches. Interestingly, our repair model followed growth rules similar to those for the generation of a new dendritic tree. To generalise the repair algorithm from Drosophila to mammalian neurons, we artificially sectioned reconstructed dendrites from mouse and human hippocampal pyramidal cell morphologies, and showed that the regrown dendrites were morphologically similar to the original ones. Furthermore, we were able to restore their electrophysiological functionality, as evidenced by the recovery of their firing behaviour. Importantly, we show that such repairs also apply to other neuron types including hippocampal granule cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells. We then extrapolated the repair to incomplete human CA1 pyramidal neurons, where the anatomical boundaries of the particular brain areas innervated by the neurons in question were known. Interestingly, the repair of incomplete human dendrites helped to simulate the recently observed increased synaptic thresholds for dendritic NMDA spikes in human versus mouse dendrites. To make the repair tool available to the neuroscience community, we have developed an intuitive and simple graphical user interface (GUI), which is available in the TREES toolbox (www.treestoolbox.org).
   Reconstructing neuronal dendrites by drawing their 3D branching structures in the computer has proved to be crucial for interpreting the flow of electrical signals and therefore the computations that dendrites perform on their inputs. These reconstructions are tedious and prone to disruptive limitations imposed by experimental procedures. In recent years, complementary computational procedures have emerged that reproduce the fine details of morphology in theoretical models. These models allow, for example, to populate large-scale neural networks and to study structure-function relationships. In this work we use a morphological model based on optimised wiring for signal conduction and material cost to repair faulty reconstructions, in particular those of human hippocampal dendrites, which are rare and precious but often cut due to technical limitations. Interestingly, we find that our synthetic repair mechanism reproduces the two distinct modes of repair observed in real dendrites: regeneration from the severed branch and invasion from neighbouring branches. Our model therefore provides both a useful tool for single-cell electrophysiological simulations and a useful theoretical concept for studying the biology of dendrite repair.

AB  - Nanoplastics, as environmental contaminants, are thought to have irreversible impacts on the developing brains of infants and early children; however, the degree of the effects and the mechanisms of damage are unknown. In this study, spatial transcriptomics was used to investigate changes in the hippocampal region of rats descended from maternal exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs), and the transcriptomes of each spot were sequenced, allowing us to visualize the hippocampus's transcriptional landscape as well as clarify the gene expression profiles of each cell type. Spatial transcriptomics was used to explore changes in the hippocampus region of rats exposed to PS-NPs during brain formation and maturation.The study's findings showed that the offspring hippocampal region had fewer neurons, more astrocytes, and more excitatory neurons 1(ExN1). The pseudo-time study of astrocytes revealed a decrease in C3-type astrocytes and an increase in C2-type astrocytes. This finding raises the possibility that memory impairment in the offspring may result from the developmental obstruction of astrocytes following the intervention of PS-NPs. Moreover, the annotations of four hippocampus regions, CA1, CA2-3, DG, and HILUS, as well as the GO and GSVA of several cell types, revealed deficiencies that can contribute to learning memory impairment. The analysis suggested that decreased neuroglutamate (Glutamate) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) secretion in offspring after PS-NPs intervention was associated with depression. Lastly, intercellular communication revealed alterations in several ligand receptor pathways associated with an increase in astrocytes. In conclusion, spatial transcriptomics reveals that maternal exposure to nanoplastics influences the development of the offspring's hippocampal brain and causes neurotoxicity, which accounts for the offspring's reduction in learning memory function.

AB  - Protein palmitoylation regulates trafficking, mobilization, localization, interaction, and distribution of proteins through the palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) enzymes. Protein palmitoylation controls rapid and dynamic changes of the synaptic architecture that modifies the efficiency and strength of synaptic connections, a fundamental mechanism to generate stable and long-lasting memory traces. Although protein palmitoylation in functional synaptic plasticity has been widely described, its role in learning and memory processes is poorly understood. In this work, we found that PATs inhibition into the hippocampus before and after the training of Morris water maze (MWM) and object location memory (OLM) impaired spatial learning. However, we demonstrated that PATs inhibition during the retrieval does not affect the expression of spatial memory in both MWM and OLM. Accordingly, long-term potentiation induction is impaired by inhibiting PATs into the hippocampus before high-frequency electrical stimulation but not after. These findings suggest that PATs activity is necessary to modify neural plasticity, a mechanism required for memory acquisition and consolidation. Like phosphorylation, active palmitoylation is required to regulate the function of already existing proteins that change synaptic strength in the hippocampus to acquire and later consolidate spatial memories.

AB  - Mutations in the tumor-suppressor Hippo pathway lead to activation of the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki), which enhances cell proliferation autonomously and causes cell death non-autonomously. While Ykiinduced cell proliferation has extensively been studied, the mechanism by which Yki causes cell death in nearby wild-type cells, a phenomenon called supercompetition, and its role in tumorigenesis remained unknown. Here, we show that Yki-induced supercompetition is essential for tumorigenesis and is driven by non-autonomous induction of autophagy. Clones of cells mutant for a Hippo pathway component fat activate Yki and cause autonomous tumorigenesis and non-autonomous cell death in Drosophila eye-antennal discs. Through a genetic screen in Drosophila, we find that mutations in autophagy-related genes or NF-KB genes in surrounding wild-type cells block both fat-induced tumorigenesis and supercompetition. Mechanistically, fat mutant cells upregulate Yki-target microRNA bantam, which elevates protein synthesis levels via activation of TOR signaling. This induces elevation of autophagy in neighboring wild-type cells, which leads to down regulation of IKB Cactus and thus causes NF-KB-mediated induction of the cell death gene hid. Crucially, up regulation of bantam is sufficient to make cells to be supercompetitors and downregulation of endogenous bantam is sufficient for cells to become losers of cell competition. Our data indicate that cells with elevated Yki-bantam signaling cause tumorigenesis by non-autonomous induction of autophagy that kills neighboring wild-type cells.

AB  - Previous studies have reported a pattern of hyperactivation in the pre -dementia phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), followed by hypoactivation in later stages of the disease. This pattern was modeled as an inverse U -shape function between activation and markers of disease severity. In this study, we used quantile regression to model the association between task-related brain activation in AD signature regions and three markers of disease severity (hippocampal volume, cortical thickness, and associative memory). This approach offers distinct advantages over standard regression models as it analyzes the relationship between brain activation and disease severity across various levels of brain activation. Participants were 54 older adults with subjective cognitive decline+ (SCD+) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the CIMA-Q cohort. The analysis revealed an inverse Ushape quadratic function depicting the relationship between disease severity markers and the activation of the left superior parietal region, while a linear relationship was observed for activation of the hippocampal and temporal regions. Quantile differences were observed for temporal and parietal activation, with more pronounced effects observed in the higher quantiles of activation. When comparing quantiles, we found that higher quantile of activation featured a greater number of individuals with SCD+ compared to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Results are globally consistent with the presence of an inverse -U shape function of activation in relation to disease severity. They study also underscores the utility of employing quantile regression modeling as the modeling approach revealed the presence of non -homogeneous effects across various quantiles.

AB  - The genus Camellia consists of about 200 species, which include many economically important species widely used for making tea, ornamental flowers and edible oil. Here, we present an updated tea plant information archive for Camellia genomics (TPIA2; http://tpia.teaplants.cn) by integrating more novel large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, metabolic and genetic variation datasets as well as a variety of useful tools. Specifically, TPIA2 hosts all currently available and well assembled 10 Camellia genomes and their comprehensive annotations from three major sections of Camellia. A collection of 15 million SNPs and 950 950 small indels from large-scale genome resequencing of 350 diverse tea accessions were newly incorporated, followed by the implementation of a novel 'Variation' module to facilitate data retrieval and analysis of the functionally annotated variome. Moreover, 116 Camellia transcriptomes were newly assembled and added, leading to a significant extension of expression profiles of Camellia genes to 13 developmental stages and eight abiotic/biotic treatments. An updated 'Expression' function has also been implemented to provide a comprehensive gene expression atlas for Camellia. Two novel analytic tools (e.g. Gene ID Convert and Population Genetic Analysis) were specifically designed to facilitate the data exchange and population genomics in Camellia. Collectively, TPIA2 provides diverse updated valuable genomic resources and powerful functions, and will continue to be an important gateway for functional genomics and population genetic studies in Camellia.

AB  - Variation in body weight (BW) of piglets at weaning is a drawback for successful implementation of multi -suckling (MS) systems. The current study investigated the combination of two intervention strategies, i.e. the timing of grouping and split-weaning, aiming to improve the BW gain of low birthweight piglets in an MS system and thereby reduce the BW variation at weaning on day 48 postpartum (p.p.). Eight batches of 5 sows with their litters were divided into 4 control (CTRL) and 4 treatment (TREAT) batches. In each litter, the second lowest (LBW) and highest (HBW) birthweight piglets from both sexes were selected as focal piglets. CTRL piglets were grouped on day 8 p.p. and no split-weaning was applied; TREAT piglets were grouped on day 13 p.p. and the three heaviest non-focal piglets per litter were split-weaned on day 35 p.p. Behaviour and feed intake were measured in focal piglets, and BW and mortality were measured in all piglets. Results showed that: (1) Throughout lactation there were no differences in BW or BW gain between CTRL and TREAT, nor were birth -weight x treatment interactions found. (2) After grouping, there were no obvious differences between CTRL and TREAT in feeding and suckling behaviours on day 18, damage scores on snout, ear or tail and skin lesions on day 27, nor were birthweight x treatment interactions found. (3) After split-weaning, in week 6, piglets in TREAT tended to consume less feed than CTRL (P = 0.072). Low birthweight piglets in TREAT consumed numerically less feed and spent numerically less time contacting feed during the day than CTRL piglets. In week 6, there was a significant birthweight x treatment interaction in dry matter milk intake (P = 0.030), caused by a higher milk intake of TREAT-LBW piglets compared with CTRL-LBW piglets. In week 6, TREAT piglets tended to be present more at front and middle teats (P = 0.052) and tended to have lower snout damage scores (P = 0.084) than CTRL piglets. (4) Piglet crushing of all piglets in TREAT tended to be higher during the period when TREAT piglets were not yet grouped i.e. during days 9-14 than CTRL (P = 0.087). To conclude, split-weaning of the heavy piglets increased milk intake particularly of low birthweight piglets but this did not lead to a reduction in BW variation at weaning, as the increased milk intake was largely compensated for by a simultaneous decrease in feed intake.

AB  - Utilizing large-scale epigenomics data, deep learning tools can predict the regulatory activity of genomic sequences, annotate non-coding genetic variants, and uncover mechanisms behind complex traits. However, these tools primarily rely on human or mouse data for training, limiting their performance when applied to other species. Furthermore, the limited exploration of many species, particularly in the case of livestock, has led to a scarcity of comprehensive and high-quality epigenetic data, posing challenges in developing reliable deep learning models for decoding their non-coding genomes. The cross-species prediction of the regulatory genome can be achieved by leveraging publicly available data from extensively studied organisms and making use of the conserved DNA binding preferences of transcription factors within the same tissue. In this study, we introduced DeepSATA, a novel deep learning-based sequence analyzer that incorporates the transcription factor binding affinity for the cross-species prediction of chromatin accessibility. By applying DeepSATA to analyze the genomes of pigs, chickens, cattle, humans, and mice, we demonstrated its ability to improve the prediction accuracy of chromatin accessibility and achieve reliable cross-species predictions in animals. Additionally, we showcased its effectiveness in analyzing pig genetic variants associated with economic traits and in increasing the accuracy of genomic predictions. Overall, our study presents a valuable tool to explore the epigenomic landscape of various species and pinpoint regulatory deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) variants associated with complex traits.

AB  - Simple Summary Semiaquatic mammal roadkill, specifically the European beaver, Eurasian otter, American mink and muskrat was analyzed in Lithuania in the period 2002-2021. From almost 40,000 recorded roadkill cases for all species, these species were registered 60, 22, 26 and 3 times, respectively, thus being rare events. Registered beaver roadkill numbers correlated with an increased registration effort and traffic intensity, while otter roadkill correlated with a registration effort only, and mink roadkill correlated with an increased population (estimated through its proxy and the number of hunted individuals per year). The roadkill was not always in close proximity to waterbodies, with 38-54% of roadkill of these species occurring over 200 m from the nearest water source. With the American mink and muskrat being invasive species in the EU and the Eurasian otter protected in many countries, it could be considered valuable to enhance the registrations of their roadkill (using targeted efforts by drivers, hunters or other citizen scientists) in order to obtain the extrapolated amount of roadkill and to use this knowledge in species management. We previously showed that registration efforts and traffic intensity explain 90% of variation in mammal roadkill numbers, 70% of variation in the numbers of recorded species and 40% of diversity variation. Here we analyze semiaquatic mammal roadkill in Lithuania in 2002-2021, relating these to the monitoring effort. From 39,936 analyzed roadkill, the European beaver (Castor fiber) was registered 60 times, American mink (Neovison vison) 26 times, otter (Lutra lutra) 22 times and muskrat (Ondatra zibethica) 3 times. The average roadkill indexes were 0.000065, 0.00076, 0.00061 and 0.00010 ind./km/day, and the extrapolated annual roadkill for the country was 44-357, 36-456, 49-464 and 89-144 individuals, respectively. Beaver roadkill numbers correlated with the registration effort and traffic intensity, otter roadkill with registration effort only and mink with hunting bag (number of hunted individuals per year). Roadkill was not always related to proximity to water, with 38-54% of roadkill occurring over 200 m from the nearest water source. With American mink and muskrat being invasive species in the EU and otter protected in many countries, it is valuable to enhance the registrations of their roadkill (using targeted efforts by drivers, hunters or other citizen scientists) to obtain the extrapolated amount of roadkill and to use this knowledge in species management.

AB  - In suckling piglets, the third incisors and canines are already formed at birth. This can lead to bite injuries when suckling on the sow's teats and during hierarchy formation among littermates. For this reason, some farms routinely grind the teeth with a rotating grinding head. However, grinding can lead to tooth injuries, inflammation and pain. The aim of this study was to compare the common roller grinding head with a so-called teacup grinding head (a teacup-shaped attachment that is supposed to adapt better to the individual tooth) and with a control group that was not ground at all. Therefore, dental injuries, weight gain, skin lesions, mortality and behaviour of piglets were determined. The teacup method caused significantly fewer opened tooth pulps than the roller head method. Nonetheless, no difference was found with regard to growth, lesions, mortality and behaviour when comparing the two grinding methods and the control group. It can be concluded that the teacup method is a more animal-friendly option. Nevertheless, it must be considered individually for each farm whether there is a need for grinding at all. If grinding cannot be dispensed with, the use of the teacup method is recommended in the interest of animal welfare. Teeth grinding in suckling piglets is performed on many farms to protect the piglets' littermates and the sow's udder from injuries caused by the piglets' canines and third incisors. In this study, the effects of two teeth-grinding methods on the piglets' dental health and welfare were investigated. The piglets of a litter were evenly assigned to a treatment: one-third of littermates were ground with a roller grinding head (RG), one-third with a teacup grinding head (TCG), and one-third were not ground at all (CG). A random sample of 100 animals each from the RG and TCG treatment was examined for tooth injuries, i.e., dental pulp openings. Additionally, behavioural analysis was performed (n = 650 piglets), and skin lesions, growth and mortality were determined (n = 1565 piglets). TCG piglets had a lower risk (p < 0.001) of pulp opening than RG piglets (0.08 +/- 0.31 vs. 2.67 +/- 1.67 opened pulps per piglet). Mortality, growth, skin lesions and behaviour of piglets were not influenced by treatment (p > 0.05). This study showed that both teeth-grinding methods led to pulp openings. If teeth grinding cannot be avoided on a farm, using the teacup grinding head is recommended concerning animal health and welfare.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a brain illness that affects learning and memory capacities over time. In recent investigations, acupuncture has been shown to be an effective alternative treatment for AD. We investigated the effect of acupuncture on learning and memory abilities using a water maze in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The amounts of A beta and tau protein in mice's hippocampal tissue were determined using Western blot. The levels of IL-1 beta, IL-10, LPS and TNF-alpha in mice's serum were measured using ELISA. The variations of gut microbiota in mice's feces were determined using the 16SrDNA technique, and the metabolites were examined using a untargeted metabolomics methodology. The results showed that acupuncture treatment improved mice's learning and memory abilities substantially. Acupuncture therapy regulated the A beta and tau protein concentration as well as the levels of IL-10 and LPS. Acupuncture treatment influenced the mouse microbiota and metabolites and had been linked to six biochemical pathways. This study adds to our understanding of the effect of acupuncture on AD and opens the door to further research into the alterations of intestinal bacteria in the presence of AD.

AB  - The alpaca is the most important South American domestic camelid for Peru, a country that regionally has 87% of these animals. Since traditional forms of reproduction do not guarantee its genetic quality, in vitro reproduction is an alternative for its improvement. This study evaluated the influence of embryotrophic factors of epidermal development (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and oxygen tension on the in vitro development of alpaca oocytes up to the blastocyst stage. From ovaries of sacrificed animals, oocytes were obtained and placed in TCM-199 medium, supplemented with sodium pyruvate, glutamine, estradiol (E2), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), embryotrophic factor (EGF or IGF-1), 5% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (10 mu L/mL) for 32 hours, at 38.5 degrees C, with 5% CO2 and relative humidity greater than 95%, with O-2 tensions between 6 and 20%. Subsequently, the oocytes were fertilized with fresh semen and cultured in KSOMaa medium for 48 hours. Cultures were differentiated by growth factors (EGF and IGF-1) and O-2 tensions (6% and 20%), plus the control group without EGF or IGF-I supplementation, to assess oocyte and blastocyst division rates from oocytes. By cluster analysis, significant differences were established between treatments with alpha = 0.05 for each response variable, with the highest rate of oocyte divisions (24.8%) with EGF at 6% O-2 and the highest blastocyst/oocyte production (18.4%) with IGF-1 at 6% O-2. It is concluded that the addition of embryotrophic factors and low O-2 tension are favorable for in vitro embryo development in alpacas.

AB  - Hypertension is one of the most common illnesses worldwide. Accurate control of blood pressure can help reduce the incidence of complications. N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) is a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor that increases oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, activating the expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which thickens the vessel wall and ultimately contributes to hypertension. Studies have shown that seeds of Camellia oleifera Abel and Camellia sinensis (L). O. Kuntze (Oolong tea) possesses antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory functions. Therefore, this study aimed was to investigate the functional components in the seed pomace ethanol extracts of C. oleifera Abel (CPE) and Oolong tea (OPE) and to evaluate the ameliorative effects of CPE and OPE on oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular remodeling in L-NAME induced hypertensive C57BL/6J mice. After 8 weeks of treatment, all CPE and OPE dose groups significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, by over 30 mmHg and 15 mmHg, respectively. Additionally, CPE and OPE decreased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) expression in the thoracic aortic and thoracic aortic intima-media thickness. Moreover, CPE and OPE decreased the malondialdehyde concentration in the liver by over 33%, as well as levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 6, and interleukin-1 beta in the kidney and heart. Collectively, CPE and OPE can reduce oxidative stress and vascular remodeling, lowering blood pressure, and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Camellia oleifera shell (COS) is a prominent byproduct in woody oil processing, which is produced in a large quantity. This study delves into the impact of storage time and storage atmospheres (oxidative and anoxic) on physicochemical properties and pelletization behavior of COS during a five-month storage in an industrial scale. After five months storage, the hemicellulose content decreased (from 36.51 to 32.65%) and the lignin content increased (from 15.21 to 16.84%). The fuel value index (FVI) of COS showed an upward trend after storage, in which the oxidative area represented by S1 increased from 98.36 to 182.83, and the anoxic area represented by S4 increased from 98.36 to 153.15. This is mainly related to the continuous decline of moisture content during storage. Short-term storage can improve the combustion characteristics of COS, and anoxic storage demonstrated superior combustion characteristics and combustion stability compared to oxidative storage. The compaction energy consumption of COS initially increased and then decreased after storage. In S1 (top of the storage pile, oxidative atmosphere), it rose from 16.96 to 20.70 kJ/kg before declining to 15.44 kJ/kg. Similarly, S4 (bottom of the storage pile, anoxic atmosphere) increased from 20.78 to 22.59 kJ/kg before dropping to 15.58 kJ/kg. After storage, the lignin content of COS was relatively increased, thereby enhancing the plasticity of COS and reducing the compaction energy consumption. These findings suggest that oxidative storage may be preferable for enhancing the overall pellet quality of COS, while anoxic storage might have a detrimental effect. Therefore, during industrial storage, minimizing anoxic areas within storage piles may be beneficial.

AB  - This study evaluated the impact of a ground channel ventilation system on seasonal ammonia emissions in a swine-finishing barn over three distinct seasons: summer, late autumn, and winter. The ground channel system tempered inlet air, cooling it during summer and warming it during colder seasons, maintaining stable room temperatures despite external fluctuations. During summer, the ground channel reduced the incoming air temperature from 26.9 degrees C to 22.5 degrees C, contributing to steady barn temperatures (28.0 degrees C) and mitigating ammonia emissions, which reached 111.0 +/- 23.6 g day-1 AU-1. In late autumn and winter, it warmed the inlet air from 4.7 degrees C and -0.7 degrees C to 8.1 degrees C and 6.8 degrees C, respectively, maintaining stable room temperatures (25.1 degrees C and 24.3 degrees C). Ammonia emissions remained consistent across seasons, with 125.0 +/- 37.3 g day-1 AU-1 in late autumn and 107.1 +/- 20.5 g day-1 AU-1 in winter. Thus, ammonia emissions showed no seasonal differences, highlighting the system's effectiveness in balancing ventilation rates with emissions. During late autumn and winter, it improved air quality without compromising thermal comfort for the swine. In summer, the reduced ventilation demand lowered ammonia emissions, supporting the effective management of ammonia emissions year-round. Future research should investigate the system's effects on other gases and slurry pit temperatures.

AB  - The high energy demands of primates during pregnancy and lactation often limit their breeding success due to the availability of food resources. Until now, few studies have focused on the effects of continuous provisioning on primate reproduction. To assess the impact of continuous provisioning on breeding success, we collected data on female reproductive status (primiparous or multiparous), maternal age of births, births, deaths, and sex of infants in a free-ranging semi-provisioned band (FSB) of Rhinopithecus bieti in China from 2010 to 2023. Our results indicate that provisioning significantly increases infant survival. After 8 years of provisioning, 11 females began a pattern of giving birth to infants in two continuous years, skipping reproduction in the third year, and resuming in the fourth year. Continuous provisioning led to a year-by-year reduction in the interbirth interval (IBI) and a gradual decrease in the primiparous age. The percentage of consecutively breeding females (CBFs) and their offspring increased annually and with the mother's ages. Conversely, the percentage of offspring from non-consecutively breeding females (NBFs) decreased over time and with maternal age. Each CBF annually produced 9.4% more infants compared to NBFs. Compared to NBFs, CBFs had a higher maternal age at births, a higher fertility rate, a higher infant survival rate, and a 11.7% shorter IBI. Furthermore, compared to the non-provisioned wild band (NPB), females in the FSB gave birth 128 days earlier, had an 18.9% annual increase in the number of offspring per female, and showed 1.2 times higher infant survival beyond 12 months. Our study demonstrates that provisioning significantly enhances reproductive success and population size. However, before promoting provisioning as a conservation tool to stabilize and recover endangered wildlife populations, it is essential to thoroughly evaluate its potential risks, such as nutritional imbalances, increased stress, and the transmission of diseases.

AB  - We recently described two outbred mouse lines that were selected for large litter size at first delivery. However, lifetime fecundity appears to be economically more important for the husbandry of many polytocous species for which mouse lines might serve as bona fide animal models (e.g. for pigs). In the present study, we compared the lifetime fecundities of two highly fertile mouse lines (FL1 and FL2: >20 offspring/litter at first delivery) with those of an unselected control line (ctrl) and two lines that were selected for high body weight (DU6) and high protein mass (DU6P) without selection pressure on fertility. We tested the hypothesis that selection for large litter size at first parturition would also increase lifetime fecundity in mice, and we observed very large differences between lines. Whereas FL1 and ctrl delivered up to nine and ten litters, none of the DU6 and DU6P females gave birth to more than five litters. In line with this observation, FL1 delivered the most pups per lifetime (85.7/female). FL2 females produced the largest average litter sizes (20.4 pups/litter) in the first four litters; however, they displayed a reduced number of litters. With the exception of ctrl, litter sizes declined from litter to litter. Repeated delivery of litters with high offspring numbers did not affect the general health of FL females. The presented data demonstrate that two biodiverse, highly fertile mouse lines selected for large litter size at first delivery show different lifetime reproductive fitness levels. Thus, these mouse lines might serve as valuable mouse models for investigating lifetime productivity and longevity in farm animals.

AB  - The eight biological hallmarks of health that we initially postulated (Cell. 2021 Jan 7;184(1):33-63) include features of spatial compartmentalization (integrity of barriers, containment of local perturbations), maintenance of homeostasis over time (recycling & turnover, integration of circuitries, rhythmic oscillations) and an array of adequate responses to stress (homeostatic resilience, hormetic regulation, repair & regeneration). These hallmarks affect all eight somatic strata of the human body (molecules, organelles, cells, supracellular units, organs, organ systems, systemic circuitries and meta -organism). Here we postulate that mental and socioeconomic factors must be added to this 8x8 matrix as an additional hallmark of health ("psychosocial adaptation") and as an additional stratum ("psychosocial interactions"), hence building a 9x9 matrix. Potentially, perturbation of each of the somatic hallmarks and strata affects psychosocial factors and vice versa. Finally, we discuss the (patho)physiological bases of these interactions and their implications for mental health improvement.

AB  - Ambient particulate matter (PM) is a global public and environmental problem. PM is closely associated with several neurological disorders that typically involve neuroinflammation. There have been few studies on the effect of PM on neuroinflammation to date. In this study, we used a juvenile rat model (PM exposure was conducted at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight per day for 4 weeks) and a BV-2 cell model (PM exposure was conducted at concentrations of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mu g/ml for 24 h) to investigate PM-induced neuroinflammation mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the role of TREM2 in this process. Our findings revealed that PM exposure reduced TREM2 protein and mRNA levels in the rat hippocampus and BV-2 cells. TREM2 overexpression attenuated PM-induced spatial learning and memory deficits in rats. Moreover, we observed that TREM2 overexpression in vivo and in vitro effectively mitigated the increase in NLRP3 and pro-Caspase1 protein expression, as well as the secretion of IL-1 beta and IL-18. Exposure to PM increased the expression of NF-kappa B and decreased the phosphorylation of PI3k/Akt in vivo and in vitro, and this process was effectively reversed by overexpressing TREM2. Our results indicated that PM exposure could reduce TREM2 expression and induce NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation and that TREM2 could mitigate NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation by regulating the NF-kappa B and PI3k/Akt signaling pathways. These findings shed light on PM-induced neuroinflammation mechanisms and potential intervention targets.

AB  - During both sleep and awake immobility, hippocampal place cells reactivate time-compressed versions of sequences representing recently experienced trajectories in a phenomenon known as replay. Intriguingly, spontaneous sequences can also correspond to forthcoming trajectories in novel environments experienced later, in a phenomenon known as preplay. Here, we present a model showing that sequences of spikes correlated with the place fields underlying spatial trajectories in both previously experienced and future novel environments can arise spontaneously in neural circuits with random, clustered connectivity rather than pre-configured spatial maps. Moreover, the realistic place fields themselves arise in the circuit from minimal, landmark-based inputs. We find that preplay quality depends on the network's balance of cluster isolation and overlap, with optimal preplay occurring in small-world regimes of high clustering yet short path lengths. We validate the results of our model by applying the same place field and preplay analyses to previously published rat hippocampal place cell data. Our results show that clustered recurrent connectivity can generate spontaneous preplay and immediate replay of novel environments. These findings support a framework whereby novel sensory experiences become associated with preexisting "pluripotent" internal neural activity patterns.

AB  - In this study, a novel camellia oil composite oleogel (SX@G-CO) was prepared by a combination of direct dispersion and emulsion-templated methods using polysaccharides (sodium alginate and xanthan gum, ratio in 4:6) as oleogelators and glycerol monolaurate (GML, 7 wt%) as gel-enhancer. The comparative experiments revealed that the polysaccharides could effectively enhance the densification of the three-dimensional network structure of the oleogel through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, and significantly improve its thermal stability, rheological properties (adhesive strength 49,243.6 mPa center dot s, center dot s, viscosity recovery rate 94.6 %) and oil binding capacity (80.6 %). The introduction of GML further enriched the crystal diversity of the oleogel and imparted excellent antimicrobial ability (nearly 100 % inhibition effect on E.coli). ). Furthermore, the in vitro experiments demonstrated that the synergistic effect of polysaccharides and GML significantly enhanced the antiinflammatory, antioxidant, cell migration and proliferation abilities of SX@G-CO oleogel compared with GMLCO and SX-CO oleogels. In addition, SX@G-CO oleogel has also been demonstrated to effectively promote full-thickness burn healing in mice by reducing bacterial infection and inflammatory response, regulating free radical levels, and promoting neovascularization in vivo, with effects comparable to marketed ointment. SX@GCO oleogel as a bioactive molecule-polysaccharides composite has potential clinical application in burn wound repair.

AB  - The asynchrony of cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation in cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) due to prematurely declining concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) has been shown to result in reduced oocyte developmental competence. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of pre-IVM treatment with cAMP modulators for different durations on the developmental potential of equine oocytes used for cloned embryo production. Collected COCs were transferred to cryovials filled with transport medium at 20-22 degrees C. Within the cryovials, the COCs were either untreated (Control) for 18 h or treated with 50 mu M forskolin and 100 mu M 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for the first 4 h (Pre-IVM 4 h) or the entire 18 h (Pre-IVM 18 h). Oocytes were then transferred to maturation medium and incubated for a further 22-24 h at 38.5 degrees C in 5% CO2 in air. Somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos were then produced using the meiotically mature oocytes and donor cells from six different fibroblast cell lines. The rates of maturation and embryo development did not differ significantly between the groups, though blastocyst formation tended to be inferior in the Pre-IVM 4 h group compared with the Control group (p = 0.06). Of 67 blastocysts produced, 23 were transferred to recipient mares on Day 4 or 5 post-ovulation. Regarding the pregnancy outcomes, no significant differences were found between the groups, and four viable foals were born, each derived from a different donor cell line. The findings expand on those from previous evaluations of this biphasic IVM system, and indicate that the cAMP-modulating treatments exert limited effects under the pre-IVM conditions used here.

AB  - Weakness and fragility are the main aspects of damage to archaeological bones in excavation areas, museums and storage facilities caused by improper conditions. The objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of nano-terpolymers composed of methyl methacrylate, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, and acrylamide, which have been synthesized under environmentally friendly conditions, for the consolidation of bone artifacts. To achieve this study, samples of modern sheep animal bones were prepared and subjected to thermal aging. Subsequently, these samples were treated with the prepared terpolymer at different concentrations. The treated samples were then thermally aged to test the efficiency of the material. The characteristics of the prepared terpolymer were measured using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermo gravimetric analysis (TAG). The bone samples treated with different concentrations of the prepared terpolymer were analyzed before and after heat aging using modeling, different microscopes and measurement of color change. The findings from the majority of investigation conducted in this study suggest that the ideal concentration of the polymer for the treatment of fragile and weak bones is 4 % followed by 2 % being the next most effective concentration. The 6 % concentration should be disregarded, as it produced unfavorable outcomes from a conservation perspective. Moreover, the density functional theory (DFT) investigation of the synthesized terpolymer with bone structure showed the electrostatic intramolecular hydrogen bond interaction with amino acids of collagen and calcium hydroxyapatite which gave it stability.

AB  - Physical exercise has been shown to enhance memory and to increase neuroplasticity. Rodent studies have revealed modulating effects of signaling molecules of the immune system (cytokines) on hippocampal plasticity and memory. Acute and chronic exercise have been both found to alter the number and function of immune cells. Thus, physical exercise might enhance neuroplasticity via an altered immune response. In this study we tested whether multiple repetitions of a vocabulary learning task combined with a bout of cardiovascular exercise enhances learning in humans and whether memory improvements correlated with acute exercise-induced cytokine changes. Data of 52 participants (20-40 years of age) who were randomly assigned to a cardiovascular exercise group (cycling) or a control group (stretching) were analyzed. During the 10-week treatment, participants completed 18 learning-exercise sessions. In each of these sessions, the vocabulary learning task was always performed immediately before exercising started. To assess acute exercise-induced changes in cytokine levels, blood sampling was performed at rest and immediately after exercising in two of the sessions. Learning success measured as increase in learning across all sessions and vocabulary retention four weeks after the treatment had ended did not differ between groups. The cycling group showed a relatively larger acute increase in IL-6, IL-1ra, IL-4, and IFN-gamma compared to the stretching group. Exploratory analyses revealed significant positive associations between within-session learning and acute exercise-induced increases in IL-6 and IL-1ra in the cycling group only. These results suggest that the immune system may act as a mediator of exercise-induced cognitive benefits.

AB  - Since the human and porcine digestive systems have similar anatomical structures and physiological functions, pigs are a useful animal model for studying human digestive diseases. By investigating intestinal metabolites in piglets after weaning, this study attempted to identify the inherent connection between dietary protein levels and changes in the intestinal microbiota of piglets. Casein was employed as the only source of protein for the piglets in this study to avoid the influence of other protein sources. 14 weaning at 28-day-old piglets (6.9 +/- 0.19kg) formed into two dietary groups: 17% casein fed group (LP) and 30% casein fed group (HP). Piglets were allowed to free food and water during the 2-week experiment. Throughout the trial, the piglets' diarrhea index (1: no diarrhea and 3: watery diarrhea) and food intake were noted during the experiment. We discovered piglets fed a high-protein diet developed diarrhea throughout the duration of the research, whereas piglets fed a normal protein diet did not. In addition, the HP group had lower feed intake and body weight than the control group (P<0.05). The HP diet influenced the content of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids in the colon, including acetate and isovaleric acid. The ileal microbiota's 16S rRNA gene was sequenced, and it was discovered that the relative abundance of gastrointestinal bacteria differed between the HP and control groups. Dietary protein levels influenced bile acid biosynthesis, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, phospholipid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, retinol metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and glycine and serine metabolism, according to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Furthermore, a correlation analysis of the pooled information revealed a possible link between intestinal metabolites and specific bacteria species. These findings demonstrate that weaned piglets' microbiota composition and metabolites are modified by a high-protein diet and thus inducing severe postweaning diarrhea and inhibiting growth performance. However, the potential molecular mechanism of this regulation in the growth of piglets remains unclear.

We identified the associations of chemicals with obesity using linear regression models. Weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression, quantile g-computation (qgcomp), and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were conducted as secondary analyses. Of the 3,692 participants included in the analysis, 18.0% had obesity. In the logistic regression model, mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and 3PBA levels were associated with obesity, and significant trends were observed for these chemical tertiles (p < 0.001). Hg, Pb, and 3PBA levels were also associated with BMI. The WQS index was significantly associated with both obesity (OR= 2.15, 95% CI: 2.11-2.20) and BMI (beta =0.39, 95% CI: 0.37-0.51). The qgcomp index also found a significant association between chemicals and both obesity (OR= 1.70, 95% CI: 1.56-1.85) and BMI (beta= 0.40, 95% CI: 0.39-0.41). Hg, Pb, and 3PBA were the most heavily weighed chemicals in these models. In BKMR analysis, the overall effect of the mixture was significantly associated with obesity. Hg, Pb, and 3PBA showed positive trends and were observed as the most important factors associated with obesity. Given increasing exposure to chemicals, there is a need to investigate the associations between chemical exposures, either separately or together, and incident obesity risk factors in well-characterized cohorts of different populations, and to identify potential approaches to chemical exposure prevention.

AB  - The complex in which scribble planar cell polarity protein (SCRIB) is located is one of the three main polar protein complexes that play an important role in maintaining epithelial polarity and affecting tumour growth. However, the role of SCRIB in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains largely unknown. This study used date from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and clinical samples to determine the expression of SCRIB in CRC and explored its mechanism through bioinformatics analysis and in vivo and in vitro experiments. In this study, SCRIB was found to be highly expressed in CRC patients, and it was often associated with malignant characteristics, such as proliferation, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, we found that SCRIB may interact with the Hippo signalling pathway and affect the phosphorylation of YAP and its distribution inside and outside of the nucleus. We concluded that increased expression of SCRIB is likely to inhibit the Hippo signalling pathway by promoting YAP phosphorylation. This role of SCRIB in the progression of CRC provides an important information for the treatment of CRC.

TI  - Cryo-EM structure of the Hippo signaling integrator human STRIPAK
T2  - NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex is a large, multisubunit protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) assembly that integrates diverse cellular signals in the Hippo pathway to regulate cell proliferation and survival. The architecture and assembly mechanism of this critical complex are poorly understood. Using cryo-EM, we determine the structure of the human STRIPAK core comprising PP2AA, PP2AC, STRN3, STRIP1, and MOB4 at 3.2-angstrom resolution. Unlike the canonical trimeric PP2A holoenzyme, STRIPAK contains four copies of STRN3 and one copy of each the PP2AA-C heterodimer, STRIP1, and MOB4. The STRN3 coiled-coil domains form an elongated homotetrameric scaffold that links the complex together. An inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) is identified as a structural cofactor of STRIP1. Mutations of key residues at subunit interfaces disrupt the integrity of STRIPAK, causing aberrant Hippo pathway activation. Thus, STRIPAK is established as a noncanonical PP2A complex with four copies of regulatory STRN3 for enhanced signal integration.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd), a ubiquitous environmental contaminant, is deemed a possible aetiological cause of cognitive disor-ders in humans. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism by which chronic exposure to Cd causes neurotoxicity is not fully understood. In this study, mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a cells) and primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to low-dose (1, 2, and 4 mu M for Neuro-2a cells or 0.5,1, and 1.5 mu M for hippocampal neurons) cadmium chlo-ride (CdCl2) for 72 h (h), and male mice (C57BL/6J, 8 weeks) were orally administered CdCl2 (0.6 mg/L, approxi-mately equal to 2.58 mu g/kgmiddotbw/d) for 6 months to investigate the effects and mechanism of chronic Cd-induced neurotoxicity. Here, chronic exposure to Cd impaired mitochondrial function by promoting excess reactive oxygen spe-cies (ROS) production, altering mitochondrial membrane potential (bajim) and reducing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, contributing to neuronal cell death. Specifically, microarray analysis revealed that the long noncoding RNA Gm10532 (lnc-Gm10532) was most highly expressed in Neuro-2a cells exposed to 4 mu M CdCl2 for 72 h compared with controls, and inhibition of lnc-Gm10532 significantly antagonized CdCl2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotoxicity. Mechanistically, lnc-Gm10532 increased Fission 1 (FIS1) expression and mitochondrial fission by recruiting the m6A writer methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14) and enhancing m6A modification of Fis1 mRNA. Moreover, lnc-Gm10532 was also required for chronic Cd-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and memory deficits in a rodent model. Therefore, data of this study reveal a new epigenetic mechanism of chronic Cd neurotoxicity.

AB  - Scope: Hawk tea, a non-Camellia tea, is an ancient tea drink from southwest China and has been proven to exhibit significant hypoglycaemic and lipid-lowering effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Hawk tea extract (HTE) can improve obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in a mouse model and to determine whether its anti-obesity effects are related to improvements in lipid metabolism and the gut microbiota. Methods and results: We tested the ability of HTE to prevent obesity and regulate gut microbiota in C57BL/6J mice fed with a HFD. We found that HTE significantly reduced body weight, fat deposition, serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and significantly increased serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) induced by HFD. HTE also increased the levels of AMPK and ACC phosphorylation, up-regulated the expression of CPT-1, and downregulated the expression of SREBP1c and FAS. In addition, the administration of HTE significantly altered the composition of the gut microbiota, reduced the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, increased the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides-vulgatus, and Faecalibaculum_rodentium, and decreased the relative abundance of Desulfovibrionaceae and Lachnospiraceae. Conclusions: Collectively, our data demonstrate that HTE can prevent HFD-induced obesity by regulating the AMPK/ACC/SREBP1c signaling pathways and the gut microbiota.

AB  - Sex steroids are pervasive in mammals and evolutionarily conserved, but differences in the nuances of endocrine profiles characterize distinct species. Two sex steroids, testosterone and progesterone, feature prominently in the life history of mammalian taxa, but neither one has been analyzed from wild giraffes. Our study was designed to address this gap in knowledge by examining how these sex steroids are related to biological features and giraffe life history. We conducted the research at Rooipoort Nature Reserve a 44,000 ha private nature reserve in South Africa on a population of South African giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa). Eleven adult giraffe cows and seven adult bulls were immobilized and various biological samples and morphological measurements were ob tained. We analysed both testosterone and progesterone using Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromotography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). We found that non-pregnant females had lower progesterone concentrations than pregnant females and that those in the last trimester of pregnancy showed a slight drop in progesterone, as well as an increase in testosterone. Among males, chronological age was correlated with testicle size, testosterone concentrations, and ossicone volume. We propose that the progesterone decline functions partly to accelerate resumption of ovulation because giraffes become pregnant while lactating, and that the testosterone elevation provides an endocrine mileu for female defense of neonatal calves, given that lion pre- dation is a major threat to calf survival. We suggest that male reproductive strategies are mediated by the age- related impacts of testosterone on growth in both body mass and ossicone volume as a consequence of sexual selection. We conclude by noting that the robust and solid ossicones of male giraffes function in mate compe- tition as wedges that are used to topple opponents by raising their legs and placing them in an off-balanced position that can seriously injure them when falling to the ground.

AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) poses a significant risk to human health. The molecular mechanisms underlying lowlevel PM2.5-induced neurotoxicity in the central nervous system remain unclear. In addition, changes in lipids in response to PM2.5 exposure have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, 3xTg-Alzheimers disease (AD) mice experienced continuous whole-body exposure to non-concentrated PM2.5 for three consecutive months, while control mice inhaled particulate matter -filtered air over the same time span. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based lipidomic platform was used to determine the distinct lipid profiles of various brain regions. The average PM2.5 concentration during the exposure was 11.38 mu g/m(3), which was close to the regulation limits of USA and Taiwan. The partial least squares discriminant analysis model showed distinct lipid profiles in the cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb, but not the cerebellum, of mice in the exposure group. Increased levels of fatty acyls, glycerolipids, and sterol lipids, as well as the decreased levels of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids in PM2.5-exposed mouse brains may be responsible for the increased energy demand, membrane conformation, neuronal loss, antioxidation, myelin function, and cellular signaling pathways associated with AD development. Our research suggests that subchronic exposure to low levels of PM2.5 may cause neurotoxicity by changing the lipid profiles in a susceptible model. Lipidomics is a powerful tool to study the early effects of PM2.5-induced AD toxicity.

AB  - The establishment of the symmetry axis is crucial for the development of all organisms. In insects, this process begins early in oogenesis with the correct distribution of the mRNAs and proteins in the oocyte. One protein that plays a role in organizing this distribution is the transcription factor Capicua (Cic). Cic has been studied in the context of oogenesis and embryonic development in Drosophila melanogaster. It is maternally expressed, begins essential for establishing the dorsoventral axis, and functions as a transcriptional repressor. Although the Cic sequences are conserved across species, their function in other types of insect ovaries is still little known. We wondered whether the function of Cic in insects has been maintained through evolution despite the ovary type or if it has been modified in parallel to the ovary evolution. To address this, we studied the Cic function in a phylogenetically basal insect, the cockroach Blattella germanica, a species with panoistic ovaries. Our findings show that B. germanica Cic is essential for oocyte development and the maturation of ovarian follicles. A loss of Cic function leads to disrupted cytoskeletal organization, defects in anterior-posterior polarity, and compromised follicle integrity.

AB  - Simple Summary: In the face of a swine health crisis, emerging zoonotic diseases or environmental catastrophe, the mass depopulation of swine may be required to prevent the additional spread of disease and to minimize animal pain or suffering. Due to the increasing risk of global disease outbreaks, the U.S. swine industry needs feasible guidelines in place in preparation for such events. Current American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) approved swine depopulation methods can be difficult to implement under field conditions. Emergency depopulation using inhalants such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen gas (N-2) or the use of aspirated foam agents have been approved and conducted in poultry in the US, but are not approved for use in other livestock. Our findings, using cull sows, demonstrate that although CO2, N-2 and aspirated foam combinations successfully killed all the animals, CO2 and aspirated foam did so in the shortest timeframe. In addition, the use of aspirated foam was as effective as CO2 for sow depopulation while having potential operational advantages, such as no use of lethal gases and reduced risk of associated equipment failure.The U.S. swine industry is currently inadequately prepared to counteract the increasing threat of high-consequence diseases. Although approved and preferred depopulation guidelines exist, ventilation shutdown (VSD+) is currently the only method being deployed during a state of emergency to depopulate large swine populations. However, the permitted use of VSD+ during constrained circumstances has been criticized due to raised swine welfare concerns. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of carbon dioxide gas (CO2), nitrogen gas (N-2), compressed air foam (CAF), compressed nitrogen foam (CAF-N-2) and aspirated foam (AF) during a 15-min dwell time on adult swine in an emergency depopulation situation. A small-scale trial using 12 sows per depopulation method showed the highest efficiency to induce cessation of movement for AF and CO2 (186.0 & PLUSMN; 48 vs. 202.0 & PLUSMN; 41, s & PLUSMN; SD). The ease of implementation and safety favored AF for further investigation. A large-scale field study using AF to depopulate 134 sows in modified rendering trailers showed a mean fill time of 103.8 s (SD: 5.0 s) and cessation of movement of 128.0 s (SD: 18.6 s) post filling. All sows were confirmed dead post-treatment for both trials. The implementation of AF in modified rendering trailers may allow for a safe and reliable method that allows for the expedient and mobile depopulation of both small and large numbers of sows during an emergency.

AB  - Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a psychoactive element of Cannabis sativa and affects the human cannabinoid system through its receptors, CB1R and CB2R. CB1R was found in several brain areas, including the hippocampal formation (HF), and it is responsible for most THC side effects. We investigated THC's effects in the HF of female Wistar rats to assess changes in its neurotransmission. Female Wister rats (n = 20) were gonadectomized under anesthesia at 8 weeks old. Afterwards, they received estradiol benzoate (EB) and/or THC. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess the expression of the cholinergic receptor alpha 7 subunit (CHRNA7), the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT), the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABRA), the CB1 receptor, and estradiol receptor alpha (EB alpha). In the HF, the expression of CHRNA7 was increased by EB and by THC in the Oil groups but decreased by THC in the EB groups. The same is true for VGLUT expression in the DG and hilum and for GABRA expression in the hilum. The expression of VAChT and CB1 is reduced by EB, while the concomitant administration of THC increases it. GAD expression is reduced by EB administration in CA1, CA3, and DG. Our results may help with decision-making regarding the prescription of low doses of THC as a therapeutical approach.

AB  - Genetic selection has resulted in a considerable increase in litter size, paralleled by an increase in farrowing duration and perinatal mortality. This paper describes some of the physiological changes around farrowing, and how genetic trends and sow management interact with these. Compromised farrowing can be related to nutritional management, or to housing conditions and handling of periparturient sows. Transition diets, for example, can be formulated to support calcium homeostasis and alleviate constipation. The opportunity to express natural behaviours and minimize stress around farrowing can further optimize farrowing conditions and reduce piglet mortality. Loose farrowing systems are part of the answer to the challenges around farrowing; however, current systems do not perform consistently. In conclusion, increased farrowing duration and increased perinatal mortality may to some extent be inevitably related to trends in pig production; however, they can be improved by nutritional measures, housing conditions and farrowing management.

AB  - Intermediate frequency magnetic fields (IF-MFs) at similar to 85 kHz are one of the components of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. However, the available data needed for the assessment of the safety of organisms from IF-MF exposure are scarce. Thus, there is an imminent need to accumulate evidence-based assessment data. In particular, if humans are exposed to IF-MF due to an accident or trouble, they are at increased risk of being exposed to high-intensity IF-MF within a short period. The already existing exposure system was improved to a system that could intermittently expose animals at 3 s intervals. This system allows the exposure of a mouse to high-intensity IF-MF (frequency: 82.3 kHz; induced electric field: 87 V/m, which was 3.8 times the basic restriction level for occupational exposure in the ICNIRP guideline), while regulating the heat generated by the coil. In vivo genotoxicity after IF-MF exposure was assessed using micronucleus (MN) test, Pig-a assay, and gpt assay. The results of MN test and Pig-a assay in hematopoietic cells revealed that neither the reticulocytes nor the mature erythrocytes exhibited significant increases in the IF-MF-exposed group compared with that in the sham-exposed group. In germ cells, MN test and gpt assay outcomes showed that IF-MF exposure did not cause any genetic or chromosomal abnormality. Based on these data, there was no genotoxic effect of our set IF-MF exposure on somatic and germ cells. These findings can contribute to the widespread use of WPT systems as effective data of IF-MF safety assessment.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Complement regulation is related to fetal growth during early pregnancy in humans. The results show that C1q increased during early pregnancy, and C1r, C1s, C2, C3 and C5b enhanced at day 25 of gestation, and C4a and C9 increased on days 13 and 16 of pregnancy in the ovine maternal spleen. In summary, a complement pathway participates in maternal immune regulation during early gestation.<br>During early gestation in humans, complement regulation is essential for normal fetal growth. It is supposed that a complement pathway participates in maternal splenic immune regulation at the early stage of gestation in ewes. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of early pregnancy on the expression of complement components in the maternal spleen of ewes. In this study, ovine spleens were sampled on day 16 of nonpregnancy, and days 13, 16 and 25 of gestation. RT-qPCR, Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis were used to detect the changes in expression of complement components in the ovine maternal spleens. Our results reveal that C1q was upregulated during early gestation, C1r, C1s, C2, C3 and C5b increased at day 25 of gestation and C4a and C9 peaked at days 13 and 16 of gestation. In addition, C3 protein was located in the capsule, trabeculae and splenic cords. In conclusion, our results show for the first time that there was modification in the expression of complement components in the ovine spleen at the early stage of gestation, and complement pathways may participate in modulating splenic immune responses at the early stage of gestation.

AB  - Peruvian maca (Lepidium meyenii) is a plant known for its nutritional and medicinal properties whose use as a supplement in animal diets has attracted much interest. We studied the effects of powdered maca root extract on the growth potential of in vitro cultured porcine cells prior to its use as an additive in animal nutrition. Fibroblast cell viability (MTT), cell proliferation (BrdU), and apoptosis level (TUNEL) were measured for a range of extract doses (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 7.0, and 10 mg/mL). Transcript levels of CCND1, MCM2, and PCNA genes as molecular markers of cell proliferation were also determined. Next, the effects of maca extract at 2 and 5 mg/mL on in vitro induced adipogenesis were evaluated over eight days of differentiation. The transcript levels of three adipocyte marker genes (CEBPA, PPARG, and FABPB4) were measured at days 0, 4, and 8 of adipose differentiation, and lipid droplet accumulation (BODIPY staining) was also noted. No cytotoxic effect was detected on fibroblast cell viability, and the inhibitory concentration (IC50) value was determined to be IC50 > 10 mg/mL. Doses of maca extract above 3 mg/mL decreased cell proliferation. The transcript level decreased in concentrations above 5 for the MCM2 and PCNA genes. For the CCND1 gene, the transcript level decreased when the greatest maca dose was used. In the in vitro adipogenesis experiment, it was found that the rate of lipid droplet formation increased on day 4 of differentiation for both doses, while decreased lipid droplet formation was observed on day 8 for 5 mg/mL of maca extract. Significant changes were seen in the mRNA level for CEBPA and PPARG on days 4 and 8, while the transcript of FABP4 increased only on day 8 at 2 mg/mL dose. It can be concluded that the addition of Peruvian maca in small doses (<3 mg/mL) has no negative effect on porcine fibroblast growth or proliferation, while 2 mg/mL of maca extract enhances adipocyte differentiation.

AB  - Over the past few decades, VEGF-targeted antiangiogenic therapy for cancers has gained increasing attention. Nevertheless, there are still several limitations such as the potential resistance mechanisms arising in cancer cells against these therapies and their potential adverse effects. These limitations highlight the need for novel anti-angiogenesis molecules and better understanding of the mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the antiangiogenic properties of a novel 14-mer antiangiogenic peptide (14-MAP) derived from N-terminal 14 kDa buffalo prolactin and characterized its mode of action. 14-MAP at the picomolar concentration inhibited VEGF- and bradykinin (an autacoid peptide expressed in vascular tissues in pathophysiology, BK)-stimulated endothelial nitric oxide (eNO) production, cell migration, and proliferation in endothelial cells and vessel development in the chick embryo. Although this peptide inhibited both VEGF- and BK-dependent angiogenic processes, its action was more pronounced in the latter. Moreover, the interference of 14-MAP with the eNO synthase (eNOS)-cyclic GMP pathway was also identified. A combination of a low dose of Avastin, a widely used drug targeting VEGF-dependent angiogenesis, and 14-MAP significantly reduced tumor size in an in vivo model of human colon cancer. Taken together, our results suggest that 14-MAP, a BK- and eNOS-dependent antiangiogenic peptide, might be useful for overcoming the limitation of VEGF-targeted antiangiogenic therapy in cancer patients. However, further studies will be required to further characterize its mode of action and therapeutic potential.

AB  - Simple Summary Intercropping tropical grasses with legumes has the potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in livestock production systems. Here, we evaluate pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) intercropped with Urochloa spp. for feeding Nellore steers and compared it with a degraded and recovered pasture system during the rainy and dry seasons of the year. We found that including pigeon pea in grazing systems met the nutritional requirements of the animals to obtain higher gains, improving their performance while also reducing the intensity of enteric CH4 emissions, thus contributing to the sustainability of ruminant production based on pastures. In this study, we evaluate the effects of intercropping pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) with tropical pastures for feeding Nellore cattle and compared animal performance and enteric CH4 emissions with other pasture-based systems during the dry and rainy seasons of 2021. Thirty-six Nellore steers (with a body weight of 221 +/- 7 kg and an age of 15-16 months) were randomly distributed in three treatments with three replicates (in paddocks of 1.5 hectares each): (1) a degraded pasture of Urochloa spp. (DEG); (2) a recovered and fertilized pasture of Urochloa spp. (REC); and (3) pigeon pea intercropped with Urochloa spp. (MIX). Enteric CH4 emissions were estimated using the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer gas technique, and dry matter intake (DMI) was determined using internal (iNDF) and external (TiO2) markers. Forages were collected by hand plucking after observations of ingestive behavior, and feces was collected after voluntary defecation. The proportion of grass and legume intake was estimated by C stable isotopes, and the forage nutritional quality was determined, while animal performance was monitored monthly, and the stocking rate was adjusted by the "put and take" technique. The results indicated that intercropping pigeon pea with tropical grasses is an interesting strategy for sustainable livestock production based on pastures. The MIX treatment was able to meet the nutritional requirements of the animals, which presented higher performance. In addition, there was a reduction in CH4 emissions up to 70% when expressed per average daily weight gain in comparison to the DEG treatment.

AB  - Central nervous system diseases (CNSDs) refer to a range of disorders resulting from structural or functional impairments of the brain and spinal cord, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury (SCI), and brain tumors. As a leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide, CNSDs involve complex pathological mechanisms that profoundly affect patients' physical and mental health as well as their quality of life. Therefore, identifying potential therapeutic targets and developing targeted intervention strategies for the prevention and treatment of CNSDs is of great significance. Recent studies have revealed that lactate can transmit energy between cells via the "lactate shuttle" mechanism and act as an endogenous signaling molecule, exerting diverse biological functions in CNSDs. Lactylation, a novel type of post-translational modification that uses lactate and lysine residues as substrates, plays a critical role in regulating gene transcription, immune responses, and cellular metabolism under both physiological and pathological conditions. Studies have confirmed that lactate participates in the onset and progression of CNSDs through both lactate metabolism and lactylation. In AD, lactate promotes A(3 plaque formation and impairs synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. Lactylation contributes to AD pathogenesis by regulating A beta accumulation, Tau protein phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis. In ischemic stroke (IS), lactate suppresses neuroinflammation and alleviates ischemic injury. Lactylation is involved in the regulation of neuroinflammation, endothelial cell apoptosis, and neuronal ferroptosis, contributing to IS progression. In SCI, lactate promotes the phenotypic transition of astrocytes from the A1 to the A2 type, thereby mitigating neural injury. Lactylation alleviates neurological dysfunction by modulating neuroinflammation, axonal regeneration, mitochondrial function, and microglial proliferation. In glioblastoma (GBM), lactate promotes M2 polarization of microglia, facilitating tumor cell growth and dissemination. Lactylation further accelerates GBM progression by enhancing tumor cell migration, proliferation, immune evasion, and drug resistance. These findings suggest that lactate may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of CNSDs. However, its precise role in CNSDs remains unclear, and the specific mechanisms by which lactate metabolism and lactylation influence disease progression warrant further investigation. Moreover, studies have confirmed that exercise, as a key non-pharmacological intervention, holds great promise in the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of CNSDs. Specifically, exercise can regulate lactate metabolism and lactylation, which in turn suppresses neuroinflammation, enhances synaptic plasticity, promotes neurogenesis and angiogenesis, improves mitochondrial function in the hippocampus, and facilitates the release of neuroprotective factors, ultimately contributing to the improvement of CNSDs. This review summarizes the roles of lactate metabolism and lactylation in CNSDs, as well as the potential mechanisms by which exercise regulates lactate metabolism and lactylation to improve CNSDs, providing a theoretical basis for the benefits of exercise on brain health.

AB  - It is widely assumed that our actions shape our brains and that the resulting connections determine who we are. To test this idea in a reductionist setting, in which genes and environment are controlled, we investigated differences in neuroanatomy and structural covariance by ex vivo structural magnetic resonance imaging in mice whose behavioral activity was continuously tracked for 3 months in a large, enriched environment. We confirmed that environmental enrichment increases mouse hippocampal volumes. Stratifying the enriched group according to individual longitudinal behavioral trajectories, however, revealed striking differences in mouse brain structural covariance in continuously highly active mice compared to those whose trajectories showed signs of habituating activity. Network-based statistics identified distinct subnetworks of murine structural covariance underlying these differences in behavioral activity. Together, these results reveal that differentiated behavioral trajectories of mice in an enriched environment are associated with differences in brain connectivity.

AB  - Memory drove a critical process of feeding habit transformation in Chinese perch when they re-trained to eat dead prey fish. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway on the memory of Chinese perch during feeding habit transformation, the phosphorylation levels of upstream signal proteins of CREB between the control group (trained once) and the experimental group (trained twice) were measured. The results illustrated that the re-training was correlated to phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and dephosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) of Chinese perch. Inhibition of ERK1/2-CREB pathway decreased the mRNA levels of memory-related genes ((fos-related antigen 2 (fra2), CCAAT enhancer-binding protein delta (c/ebpb), immediate-early gene zif268 (zif268), proto-oncogenes c-fos (c-fox) and synaptotagmin-IV (sytIV)) and mRNA levels of appetite-related genes (agouti-related peptide (agrp) and ghrelin), and activation of PP1-CREB pathway increased the phosphorylated levels of CREB, the mRNA levels of memory-related genes (fra2, c/ebpb, zif268, and c-fox), and the mRNA levels of appetite-related genes (pro-opiomelanocortin (pomc) and leptin) in primary brain cells of Chinese perch. The memory in Chinese perch feeding habit transformation was associated with the ERK1/2-CREB and PP1-CREB pathways, which could regulate the transcription of memory-related genes and appetite-related genes.

AB  - Knowledge of the developmental ontogeny of the digestive system and nutritional requirements of marine fish larvae is a primary requisite for their successful rearing under an optimal feeding regime. In this context, we assessed the activity profile of key digestive enzymes viz., trypsin, chymotrypsin, leucine aminopeptidase, lipase, amylase, and alkaline phosphatase during the early ontogeny of milkfish, Chanos chanos (0 day, 3 days, 6 days, 9 days, 12 days, 15 days, 18 days, 21 days, 25 days, and 30 days post-hatch). Larvae for this study were obtained from the successful breeding of milkfish at ICAR-Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture, India. Growth curves (length and weight) of the larvae indicated a positive morphological development under a standardized feeding regime that comprised Chlorella salina, Brachionus plicatilis, Artemia salina nauplii, and commercial weaning feed for different larval stages. With respect to protein digestion, the specific activity of pancreatic enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin and intestinal brush border leucine aminopeptidase showed two peaks at 3 dph and 15 dph, following the introduction of rotifer and Artemia nauplii. Similar bimodal peaks were observed for alkaline phosphatase and amylase activities, with the first peak at 3 dph and the second peak at 18 dph and 21 dph, respectively. Whereas in the case of lipase, high activity levels were observed at 0 dph, 3 dph, and 18 dph, with subsequent decreases and fluctuations. Overall, as most of the enzymes were found to have peak activities at 15 to 21 dph, this period can be potentially considered as the developmental window for weaning larvae from live to formulated feeds in milkfish hatcheries.

AB  - This experiment aimed to study the effects of tannin supplementation on growth performance, rumen fermentation characteristics, apparent digestibility and serum biochemistry, and antioxidant and immune indexes in fattening lambs. A total of 36 male Hu sheep lambs (body weight = 15.83 +/- 0.48 kg and days of age = 55 +/- 2 d) were fed a high-concentrate diet and randomly divided into one of three groups of 12 animals each: control with no tannin (CON) and tannin treatments (TA1, 3 g/d per lamb; TA2, 6 g/d per lamb). The feeding experiment lasted for 60 d. The results showed that the average daily gain and ruminal propionate content of lambs in the TA1 group were higher (p < 0.05) than those in the CON group. Lambs fed tannin had significantly increased (p < 0.05) microbial protein and decreased (p < 0.05) ammonia nitrogen concentrations in the rumen. In addition, the crude protein and neutral detergent fiber digestibility of the TA2 group were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) as compared with the TA1 and CON groups, respectively. The serum concentrations of triglyceride, immunoglobulin A, and catalase and the total antioxidant capacity were higher (p < 0.05) in the TA1 group that those in the CON group, whereas an opposite trend of urea nitrogen, interleukin-1 beta, and malondialdehyde was found between the two groups. Also, tannin supplementation increased (p < 0.05) Lactobacillus and decreased (p < 0.05) Salmonella counts in the feces of lambs. Taken together, tannin supplementation can improve the growth performance, immunity, and antioxidant ability of fattening lambs fed a high-concentrate diet.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Fatsia japonica is a traditional medicine used to treat various diseases, including inflammation-related disorders. However, its antineuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects remain unclear. Aim of the study: We aimed to evaluate the anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects of F. japonica extract to identify the underlying mechanisms. Materials and methods: The components of F. japonica extract were profiled using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The effects of F. japonica extract were investigated in BV2 microglia and HT22 hippocampal cells. Furthermore, in vivo effects of F. japonica extract were assessed using zebrafish models treated with H2O2 and LPS to evaluate the effects of in vivo. Results: We identified 27 compounds in the F. japonica extract. F. japonica extract demonstrated antiinflammatory properties by suppressing LPS-induced inflammatory responses in both BV2 cells and zebrafish, along with inhibiting the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-xB (p65) pathway. The protective effects of this extract were also observed on glutamate-treated HT22 cells and in H2O2-induced zebrafish. Furthermore, F. japonica extract upregulated nuclear factor E2-related (Nrf) 2/heme oxygenase (HO) -1 expression in BV2 and HT22 cells. Conclusions: F. japonica extract exerted anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects through Nrf2/HO-1 and the NF-xB pathway.

AB  - Multiple mitogenic pathways capable of promoting mammalian cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation have been identified as potential candidates for functional heart repair following myocardial infarction. However, it is unclear whether the effects of these mitogens are species-specific and how they directly compare in the same cardiac setting. Here, we examined how CM-specific lentiviral expression of various candidate mitogens affects human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs (hiPSC-CMs) and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) in vitro. In 2D-cultured CMs from both species, and in highly mature 3D-engineered cardiac tissues generated from NRVMs, a constitutively active mutant form of the human gene Erbb2 (cahErbb2) was the most potent tested mitogen. Persistent expression of cahErbb2 induced CM proliferation, sarcomere loss, and remodeling of tissue structure and function, which were attenuated by small molecule inhibitors of Erk signaling. These results suggest transient activation of Erbb2/Erk axis in CMs as a potential strategy for regenerative heart repair.

AB  - This paper concerns the management of natural waste fibres. The aim of this research was the production of multifunctional acoustic and thermal insulation materials from natural protein and lignocellulosic fibre wastes, according to a circular bioeconomy. For the manufacture of the materials, local mountain sheep wool and a mixture of bast fibre waste generated by string production were used. Insulating materials in the form of mats produced by the needle-punching technique with different fibre contents were obtained. The basic parameters of the mats, i.e., the thickness, surface weight and air permeability were determined. To assess barrier properties, sound absorption and noise reduction coefficients, as well as thermal resistance and thermal conductivity, were measured. It was shown that the mats exhibit barrier properties in terms of thermal and acoustic insulation related to the composition of the mat. It was found that mats with a higher content of the bast fibres possess a greater ability to absorb sounds, while mats with higher wool contents exhibit better thermal insulation properties. The produced mats can serve as a good alternative to commonly used acoustic and thermal insulating materials. The production of the described materials allows for a reduction in the amount of natural fibre waste and achieves the goal of "zero waste" according to the European Green Deal strategy.

AB  - The cannabinoid system is independently affected by stress and chronic ethanol exposure. However, the extent to which co-occurrence of traumatic stress and chronic ethanol exposure modulates the cannabinoid system remains unclear. We examined levels of cannabinoid system components, anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, fatty acid amide hydrolase, and monoacylglycerol lipase after mouse single-prolonged stress (mSPS) or non-mSPS (Control) exposure, with chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor or without CIE vapor (Air) across several brain regions using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry or immunoblotting. Compared to mSPS-Air mice, anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels in the anterior striatum were increased in mSPS-CIE mice. In the dorsal hippocampus, anandamide content was increased in Control-CIE mice compared to Control-Air, mSPS-Air, or mSPS-CIE mice. Finally, amygdalar anandamide content was increased in Control-CIE mice compared to Control-Air, or mSPS-CIE mice, but the anandamide content was decreased in mSPS-CIE compared to mSPS-Air mice. Based on these data we conclude that the effects of combined traumatic stress and chronic ethanol exposure on the cannabinoid system in reward pathway regions are driven by CIE exposure and that traumatic stress affects the cannabinoid components in limbic regions, warranting future investigation of neurotherapeutic treatment to attenuate these effects.

AB  - To investigate the mechanisms through which ferrous ion (Fe2+) addition improves the utilization of a cottonseed meal (CSM) diet, two experimental diets with equal nitrogen and energy content (low-cottonseed meal (LCM) and high-cottonseed meal (HCM) diets, respectively) containing 16.31% and 38.46% CSM were prepared. Additionally, the HCM diet was supplemented with graded levels of FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O to establish two different Fe2+ supplementation groups (HCM + 0.2%Fe(2+ )and HCM + 0.4%Fe2+). Juvenile Ctenopharyngodon idellus (grass carps) (5.0 +/- 0.5 g) were fed one of these four diets (HCM, LCM, HCM + 0.2%Fe2+ and HCM + 0.4%Fe2+ diets) for eight weeks. Our findings revealed that the HCM diet significantly increased lipid peroxide (LPO) concentration and the expression of lipogenic genes, e.g., sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (srebp1) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (scd), leading to excessive lipid droplet deposition in the liver (p < 0.05). However, these effects were significantly reduced in the HCM + 0.2%Fe2+ and HCM + 0.4%Fe2+ groups (p < 0.05). Plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration was also significantly lower in the HCM and HCM + 0.2%Fe2+ groups compared to the LCM group (p < 0.05), whereas low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration was significantly higher in the HCM + 0.2%Fe2+ and HCM + 0.4%Fe(2+ )groups than in the LCM group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the plasma levels of liver functional indices, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and glucose (GLU), were significantly lower in the HCM + 0.4%Fe2+ group (p < 0.05). Regarding the expression of genes related to iron transport regulation, transferrin 2 (tfr2) expression in the HCM group and Fe2+ supplementation groups were significantly suppressed compared to the LCM group (p < 0.05). The addition of 0.4% Fe2+ in the HCM diet activated hepcidin expression and suppressed ferroportin-1 (fpn1) expression (p < 0.05). Compared to the LCM group, the expression of genes associated with ferroptosis and inflammation, including acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4b (acsl4b), lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (lpcat3), cyclooxygenase (cox), interleukin 1 beta (il-1 beta), and nuclear factor kappa b (nf kappa b), were significantly increased in the HCM group (p < 0.05), whereas Fe2+ supplementation in the HCM diet significantly inhibited their expression (p < 0.05) and significantly suppressed lipoxygenase (lox) expression (p < 0.05). Compared with the HCM group without Fe2+ supplementation, Fe2+ supplementation in the HCM diet significantly upregulated the expression of genes associated with ferroptosis, such as heat shock protein beta-associated protein1 (hspbap1), glutamate cysteine ligase (gcl), and glutathione peroxidase 4a (gpx4a) (p < 0.05), and significantly decreased the expression of the inflammation-related genes interleukin 15/10 (il-15/il-10) (p < 0.05). In conclusion, FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O supplementation in the HCM diet maintained iron transport and homeostasis in the liver of juvenile grass carps, thus reducing the occurrence of ferroptosis and alleviating hepatic lipid deposition and inflammatory responses caused by high dietary CSM contents.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by aberrant accumulation of extracellular beta-amyloid (A beta) peptides in the brain. Soluble A beta oligomers are thought to be the most neurotoxic species and are correlated with cognitive dysfunction in early AD. However, there is still no effective treatment so far. We determined that Pep63, a small peptide, had a neuroprotective effect on synaptic plasticity and memory in our previous study. Here, we developed novel and multifunctional liposomes targeting both A beta oligomers and fibrils based on a liposome delivery system. Transferrin-Pep63-liposomes (Tf-Pep63-Lip), possessing the ability for blood-brain barrier targeting, were also incorporated with phosphatidic acid (PA) and loaded with neuroprotective Pep63. We discovered that administration of Tf-Pep63-Lip could significantly reduce the A beta burden in the hippocampus, and improve cognitive deficits in 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice in the Morris-Water maze task and fear-conditioning test with the combined effects of PA and Pep63. Tf-Pep63-Lip could capture A beta oligomers or fibrils and then facilitated microglial chemotaxis nearby for clearance. Simultaneously, Tf-Pep63-Lip hindered A beta 1-42 aggregation and disaggregated A beta 1-42 assembly due to multivalent PA-A beta. Pep63 effectively inhibited the binding between EphB2 and A beta oligomers after release from liposomes and rescued NMDA receptors trafficking, the basis of synaptic plasticity. No side effects were observed in either APP/PS1 or wild-type mice, indicating that Tf-Pep63-Lip might be safe under the dosing regimen used in our experiment. Taken together, our results suggested that Tf-Pep63-Lip may serve as a safe and efficient agent for AD combination therapy.

AB  - Simple Summary We studied the nitrogen excretion patterns of cows selected for divergent nitrogen excretion consuming either ryegrass or plantain. Both the use of a plantain diet as well as the use of low milk urea nitrogen breeding values were found to reduce the concentration of urinary urea nitrogen per urination event compared to cows with a high milk urea nitrogen breeding value and cows consuming a ryegrass-based diet. These results indicate that both the use of cows with low milk urea nitrogen breeding values and the use of a plantain diet are tools that temperate pastoral dairy production systems can use to reduce nitrogen loses. Inefficient nitrogen (N) use from pastoral dairy production systems has resulted in environmental degradation, as a result of excessive concentrations of urinary N excretion leaching into waterways and N2O emissions from urination events into the atmosphere. The objectives of this study were to measure and evaluate the total N balance of lactating dairy cows selected for milk urea N concentration breeding values (MUNBVs) consuming either a 100% perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) or 100% plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.) diet. Sixteen multiparous lactating Holstein-Friesian x Jersey cows divergent for MUNBV were housed in metabolism crates for 72 h, where intake and excretions were collected and measured. No effect of MUNBV was detected for total N excretion; however, different excretion characteristics were detected, per urination event. Low MUNBV cows had a 28% reduction in the concentration of urinary urea nitrogen (g/event) compared to high MUNBV cows when consuming a ryegrass diet. Cows consuming plantain regardless of their MUNBV value had a 62% and 48% reduction in urinary urea nitrogen (g/event) compared to high and low MUNBV cows consuming ryegrass, respectively. Cows consuming plantain also partitioned more N into faeces. These results suggest that breeding for low MUNBV cows on ryegrass diets and the use of a plantain diet will reduce urinary urea nitrogen loading rates and therefore estimated nitrate leaching values, thus reducing the environmental impact of pastoral dairy production systems.

AB  - The hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex and anterior thalamus are key components of a neural circuit known to be involved in a variety of memory functions, including spatial, contextual and episodic memory. In this review, we focus on the role of this circuit in contextual memory processes. The background environment, or context, is a powerful cue for memory retrieval, and neural representations of the context provide a mechanism for efficiently retrieving relevant memories while avoiding interference from memories that belong to other contexts. Data from experimental lesions and neural manipulation techniques indicate that each of these regions is critical for contextual memory. Neurophysiological evidence from the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex suggest that contextual information is represented within this circuit by population-level neural firing patterns that reliably differentiate each context a subject encounters. These findings indicate that encoding contextual information to support context-dependent memory retrieval is a key function of this circuit.

AB  - Olfaction is involved in detecting, identifying, and discriminating dietary fat within foods, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain uncharted. Our functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated the neural correlates of olfactory fat perception and their association with discrimination ability in a complex food matrix. We measured brain activation resulting from orthonasal exposure to an ecologically relevant fat-related odor source-dairy milk, manipulated to contain 0%, 3.5%, or 14% fat. Twenty-six healthy, normosmic adults underwent olfactory fat content discrimination testing, followed by an fMRI task during which the 3 odor stimuli were delivered via an olfactometer (25 times/fat level) and rated on perceived intensity and liking. Participants discriminated between all fat levels, with fat level influencing perceived odor intensity and liking. These perceptual differences, however, were not reflected in differential brain activation. Brain activation differences were observed only when comparing odor exposure with no exposure. Specifically, in response to any odor, activation occurred in the anterior part of the supplementary motor area (SMA) while deactivating parts of the hippocampus, putamen, superior temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and posterior part of the SMA. Exposure to the 0% fat odor also activated the thalamus. No associations were found between perceived intensity and liking and neural responses. Results reaffirm the human ability to distinguish food fat content using solely olfactory cues and reveal a divergence between sensory perception and neural processing. Subsequent research should replicate and extend these findings onto retronasal fat perception while also examining potential effects of hunger, genetics, and dietary habits.

AB  - Objective: Sepsis is a major challenge in intensive care unit worldwide and the septic survivors are left with long-term cognitive deficits. This work aims to explore the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on long-term cognitive function and its underlying mechanism in sepsis-survivor mice.
   Methods: Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture in C57BL/6 male mice. Seven days post-surgery, sepsis-survivor mice were treated with EA or nonacupoint EA for 17 days twice daily. Then, cognitive func-tion was evaluated by Morris water maze task. The hippocampus tissue were collected from the mice at 30 days post-surgery. The level of nitric oxide and the expression of endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS), phospho-eNOS (p-eNOS), and amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) were measured.
   Results: Compared with the sham-operated control, sepsis-survivors had significant cognitive deficits evidenced by the increased time of escape latency and reduced crossing number in Morris water maze task, as well as lower NO and p-eNOS level and higher A beta level. EA treatment at GV20 and ST36 acupoints but not at a nonacupoint improved the cognitive function, increased the NO and p-eNOS level, and decreased A beta generation; while eNOS inhibitor (L-NAME) undermined the efficacy of EA treatment.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, repeated EA treatment could ameliorate the long-term cognitive impairment via manipulating the expression of p-eNOS and related A beta in sepsis-survivor mice.

AB  - One of the major challenges in emergency medicine is out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Every year, about 53-62/100 000 people worldwide suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with serious consequences, whereas persistent brain injury is a major cause of morbidity and mortality of those surviving a cardiac arrest. Today, only few and insufficient strategies are known to limit neurological damage of ischemia and reperfusion injury. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether teriflunomide, an approved drug for treatment of relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis, exerts a protective effect on brain cells in an in vitro model of ischemia. Therefore, organotypic slice cultures from rat hippocampus and cerebellum were exposed to oxygen-glucose-deprivation and subsequently treated with teriflunomide. The administration of teriflunomide in the reperfusion time on both hippocampal and cerebellar slice cultures significantly decreased the amount of detectable propidium iodide signal compared with an untreated culture, indicating that more cells survive after oxygen-glucose-deprivation. However, hippocampal slice cultures showed a higher vulnerability to ischemic conditions and a more sensitive response to teriflunomide compared with cerebellar slice cultures. Our study suggests that teriflunomide, applied as a post-treatment after an oxygen-glucose-deprivation, has a protective effect on hippocampal and cerebellar cells in organotypic slice cultures of rats. All procedures were conducted under established standards of the German federal state of North Rhine Westphalia, in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.

AB  - Biomolecular condensates have emerged as a major organizational principle in the cell. However, the formation, maintenance, and dissolution of condensates are still poorly understood. Transcriptional machinery partitions into biomolecular condensates at key cell identity genes to activate these. Here, we report a specific perturbation of WNT-activated 0-catenin condensates that disrupts oncogenic signaling. We use a live cell condensate imaging method in human cancer cells to discover FOXO and TCF-derived peptides that specifically inhibit 0-catenin condensate formation on DNA, perturb nuclear 0-catenin condensates in cells, and inhibit 0-catenin-driven transcriptional activation and colorectal cancer cell growth. We show that these peptides compete with homotypic intermolecular interactions that normally drive condensate formation. Using this framework, we derive short peptides that specifically perturb condensates and transcriptional activation of YAP and TAZ in the Hippo pathway. We propose a "monomer saturation"model in which short interacting peptides can be used to specifically inhibit condensate-associated transcription in disease.

AB  - ProAKAP4 is identified within the flagellum of spermatozoa in various mammalian species, serving as a structural protein associated with motility parameters. This investigation focuses on the presence of proAKAP4 in donkey sperm, elucidating its localization, molecular characteristics, and its correlation with motility descriptors and mitochondrial membrane potential. Twelve ejaculates from Catalan donkeys were analyzed in this study. The initial steps involved proAKAP4 sequencing and detection through Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Post-thaw assessments were conducted at 0, 1, and 3 h, encompassing proAKAP4 levels, sperm motility analyzed via Computer-Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA), and mitochondrial membrane potential determined by flow cytometry using the JC-1 stain. The findings reveal that proAKAP4 in donkeys exhibits a characteristic localization at the principal piece of the flagellum, consistent with observations in other mammals. The molecular weight of proAKAP4 is determined to be 100 kDa. Significantly, a positive correlation (p <= 0.05) is established between proAKAP4 concentration and both total and progressive motility. The presence of cryoprotectant is associated with a lower proAKAP4 concentration. Notably, proAKAP4 experiences a substantial decrease (p <= 0.05) during the initial hour post-thawing. In conclusion, proAKAP4 is identified in donkey sperm, akin to its presence in other mammals. It exhibits a positive correlation with total and progressive motility, its concentration is notably affected by the presence of cryoprotectant with significant consumption observed during the initial hour following thawing. These findings contribute to our understanding of proAKAP4 dynamics in donkey sperm, providing insights that may have implications for semen preservation and reproductive technologies in equids.

AB  - The proper development and function of neuronal circuits rely on a tightly regulated balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) synaptic transmission, and disrupting this balance can cause neurodevelopmental disorders, for example, schizophrenia. MicroRNA-dependent gene regulation in pyramidal neurons is important for excitatory synaptic function and cognition, but its role in inhibitory interneurons is poorly understood. Here, we identify miR138-5p as a regulator of short-term memory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the mouse hippocampus. Sponge-mediated miR138-5p inactivation specifically in mouse parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons impairs spatial recognition memory and enhances GABAergic synaptic input onto pyramidal neurons. Cellular and behavioral phenotypes associated with miR138-5p inactivation are paralleled by an upregulation of the schizophrenia (SCZ)-associated Erbb4, which we validated as a direct miR138-5p target gene. Our findings suggest that miR138-5p is a critical regulator of PV interneuron function in mice, with implications for cognition and SCZ. More generally, they provide evidence that microRNAs orchestrate neural circuit development by fine-tuning both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission.

AB  - Individuals across six major psychiatric conditions from the ENIGMA consortium reveals a shared morphological effect, following a sensory-fugal axis, which is related to microstructural gradient and neurotransmitter axes.
   It is increasingly recognized that multiple psychiatric conditions are underpinned by shared neural pathways, affecting similar brain systems. Here, we carried out a multiscale neural contextualization of shared alterations of cortical morphology across six major psychiatric conditions (autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, major depression disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia). Our framework cross-referenced shared morphological anomalies with respect to cortical myeloarchitecture and cytoarchitecture, as well as connectome and neurotransmitter organization. Pooling disease-related effects on MRI-based cortical thickness measures across six ENIGMA working groups, including a total of 28,546 participants (12,876 patients and 15,670 controls), we identified a cortex-wide dimension of morphological changes that described a sensory-fugal pattern, with paralimbic regions showing the most consistent alterations across conditions. The shared disease dimension was closely related to cortical gradients of microstructure as well as neurotransmitter axes, specifically cortex-wide variations in serotonin and dopamine. Multiple sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness with respect to slight variations in analytical choices. Our findings embed shared effects of common psychiatric conditions on brain structure in multiple scales of brain organization, and may provide insights into neural mechanisms of transdiagnostic vulnerability.

AB  - Mammalian hibernation in ground squirrels is characterized by periods of torpor wherein body temperature approaches ambient temperature and metabolism is reduced to as low as 1/100th of active rates. It is unclear how hibernation affects long-term spatial memory, as tremendous remodeling of neurons is associated with torpor use. Given the suspected links between remodeling and memory formation and retention, we examined long-term spatial memory retention throughout a hibernation season. Animals were trained on a Barnes maze before entering torpor. Animals were tested for memory retention once a month throughout a hibernation season. Results indicate marked variation between individuals. Some squirrels retained memory across multiple torpor bouts, while other squirrels did not. No relationship was found between the number of torpor bouts, duration of bouts, or time spent torpid on long-term memory retention. However, that some squirrels successfully retain memory suggests that the profound remodeling of dendritic spines during torpor does not always lead to memory loss.

AB  - Chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) is one of the critical factors in the occurrence and development of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Apoptosis of nerve cells and changes in synaptic activity after CCI are the key factors to induce VCI. Synaptic stimulation up-regulates intraneuronal Ca2+ level through N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) via induction of the activity-regulated inhibitor of death (AID) expression to produce active-dependent neuroprotection. Moreover, the regulation of synaptic plasticity could improve cognition and learning ability. Activin A (ActA), an exocrine protein of AID, can promote NMDAR phosphorylation and participate in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. We previously found that exogenous ActA can improve the cognitive function of rats with chronic cerebral ischemia and enhance the oxygenated glucose deprivation of intracellular Ca2+ level. In addition to NMDAR, the Wnt pathway is critical in the positive regulation of LTP through activation or inhibition. It plays an essential role in synaptic transmission and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. The enriched environment can increase ActA expression during CCI injury. We speculated that the NMDAR-Ca2+-ActA signal pathway has a loop-acting mode, and the environmental enrichment could improve chronic cerebral ischemia cognitive impairment via NMDAR-Ca2+-ActA, Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is involved in this process. For the hypothesis verification, this study intends to establish chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) rat model, explore the improvement effect of enriched environment on VCI, detect the changes in plasticity of synaptic morphology and investigate the regulatory mechanism NMDAR-Ca2+-ActA-Wnt/beta-catenin signaling loop, providing a therapeutic method for the treatment of CCH.

AB  - Although the menopausal transition causes a panoply of unpleasant and disruptive symptoms, many women are reluctant to use estrogen-based treatments due to risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. As we learn more about how estrogens regulate the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and brain fog, drug development that specifically targets these mechanisms could provide the therapeutic benefits of estrogens without adverse health effects. This review discusses the rationale for targeting estrogen receptor beta (ERB) with highly selective synthetic agonists to alleviate two common menopausal symptoms: memory dysfunction and hot flashes. We begin by reviewing the history of estrogen-based menopausal hormone therapy, including conjugated equine estrogens and related products. We then describe the neurobiological mechanisms underlying estrogenic regulation of memory and hot flashes, with a particular focus on the role of ERB. Finally, we discuss past and current clinical trials of ERB agonists and highlight pre-clinical data showing that a highly potent and selective synthetic ERB agonist can enhance object recognition and spatial memory, and reduce a drug-induced hot flash, in mouse models of ovarian hormone loss and Alzheimer's disease. Collectively, this work supports the targeted development of highly selective ERB agonists to relieve memory and vasomotor symptoms of menopause.

AB  - Preeclampsia (PE), a pregnancy disorder that affects 5-7% of pregnant women, is among the primary causes for maternal and perinatal mortality. PE is believed to be associated with insufficient invasion of villous and extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), which hampers uterine spiral artery remodeling and finally induces PE. But the mechanism responsible for reduction of trophoblast invasion remains unclear. In this study, placental tissues taken from healthy donors and PE patients were used to evaluate the miR-326 expression; CCK8 and colony formation assays were used to confirm the effect of miR-326 on cell proliferation; transwell assay was used to demonstrate the effect of miR-326 on cell invasion capability; western blot was used to investigate the underlying mechanism; and luciferase assay was used to detect the effect of miR-326 on YAP/TAZ-mediated transcription activity. It was revealed the miR-326 expression was higher in placentas from PE patients than from healthy donors. After transfection of miR-326 mimics, trophoblast proliferation and invasion were impaired. Using TargetScan, we speculated that PAX8 was a target of miR-326, which was later confirmed by western blot. The YAP/TAZ expression was also downregulated after transfection with miR-326. Luciferase assay demonstrated that overexpression of miR-326 suppressed YAP/TAZ-mediated transcription activity by targeting PAX8. Overexpression of PAX8 could partly rescue miR-326-induced suppression of trophoblast proliferation and invasion. Taken together, our result indicated that miR-326 suppresses trophoblast growth, invasion, and migration by means of targeting PAX8 via the Hippo pathway.

AB  - Objectives The preventative effects of a hydroalcoholic extract of Zataria multiflora (ZM) on hippocampal oxidative stress and memory alterations caused by inhaled paraquat (PQ) in rats were investigated. Method The study included a control group of male Wistar rats administered saline (Ctrl) and PQ groups (54 mg/m(3)) aerosol eight times in alternate days. PQ groups were treated with two ZM extract doses (ZM-L and ZM-H), pioglitazone (Pio), combination of ZM-L + Pio and dexamethasone (Dexa) during PQ exposure (for 16 days). The doses and procedures were selected based on previous studies. Morris Water Maze (MWM) and shuttle box tests, as well as measurements of oxidative stress markers in the hippocampus, total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts were performed. Results PQ significantly increased total and differential WBC, MDA levels, escape latency and travelled distance in MWM test, but it reduced CAT, SOD, thiol levels, and time latency 24-72 h post-electric shock. Compared to the PQ group, ZM-L, ZM-H, Pio + ZM-L, and Dexa treatments significantly reverse the alterations of total and differential WBC, MDA, CAT, SOD, and thiol levels. ZM-H, Pio + ZM-L, and Dexa treatments decreased the escape latency on days 2-5, travelled distance on day 3, and time latency at 24-72 h post-electric shock. ZM-H had more preventive effects on most measured variables than ZM-L. The Pio + ZM-L group showed significantly greater effect than Pio on some measured variable than ZM-L (from p < 0.05 to p < 0.001 for all). Conclusion The study found that ZM similar to Dexa reduced PQ-induced hippocampal oxidative injury and memory alterations in a preventative manner. Additionally, Pio + ZM-L showed a synergistic effect, indicating that PPAR gamma-mediated processes play a role in preventive advantages of ZM.

AB  - Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a manifestation of ischemic heart disease where the immune system plays an important role in the re-establishment of homeostasis. We hypothesize that the anti-inflammatory activity of secretomes from menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (S-MenSCs) and IFN gamma/TNF alpha-primed MenSCs (S-MenSCs*) may be considered a therapeutic option for the treatment of AMI. To assess this hypothesis, we have evaluated the effect of S-MenSCs and S-MenSCs* on cardiac function parameters and the involvement of immune-related genes using a porcine model of AMI. Twelve pigs were randomly divided into three biogroups: AMI/Placebo, AMI/S-MenSCs, and AMI/S-MenSCs*. AMI models were generated using a closed chest coronary occlusion-reperfusion procedure and, after 72 h, the different treatments were intrapericardially administered. Cardiac function parameters were monitored by magnetic resonance imaging before and 7 days post-therapy. Transcriptomic analyses in the infarcted tissue identified 571 transcripts associated with the Gene Ontology term Immune response, of which 57 were differentially expressed when different biogroups were compared. Moreover, a prediction of the interactions between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs from secretomes revealed that some DEGs in the infarction area, such as STAT3, IGFR1, or BCL6 could be targeted by previously identified miRNAs in secretomes from MenSCs. In conclusion, the intrapericardial administration of secretome early after infarction has a significant impact on the expression of immune-related genes in the infarcted myocardium. This confirms the immunomodulatory potential of intrapericardially delivered secretomes and opens new therapeutic perspectives in myocardial infarction treatment.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Supplementation of ovariectomized rats with Camelina sativa oil, which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially n-3 family fatty acids, can be an effective way to improve bone parameters. Administration of 5 g/kg body weight and 9 g/kg body weight of camelina oil to rats suppressed a decrease in densitometric, tomographic, and strength parameters of femurs and an increase in the serum level of the C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen caused by estrogen deficiency. Furthermore, ovariectomized rats receiving camelina oil were characterized by a high level of osteocalcin.
   The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of administration of Camelina sativa oil (CO) as a source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on bone parameters in ovariectomized rats (OVX). Overall, 40 10-week-old healthy female Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups with 10 animals in each. Rats in the control group (SHO) were subjected to a sham operation, whereas experimental rats (OVX) were ovariectomized. After a 7-day recovery period, the SHO the rats received orally 1 mL of physiological saline for the next 6 weeks. The OVX rats received orally 1 mL of physiological saline (OVX-PhS), 5 g/kg BW (OVX-CO5), or 9 g/kg BW (OVX-CO9) of camelina oil. The use of camelina oil had a significant effect on body weight, lean mass, and fat mass. The camelina oil administration suppressed the decrease in the values of some densitometric, tomographic, and mechanical parameters of femur caused by estrogen deficiency. The CO treatment increased significantly the serum level of osteocalcin and decreased the serum level of C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen in the OVX rats. In conclusion, camelina oil exerts a positive osteotropic effect by inhibiting ovariectomy-induced adverse changes in bones. Camelina oil supplementation can be used as an efficient method for improving bone health in a disturbed state. However, further research must be carried out on other animal species supplemented with the oil.

AB  - Recent studies have highlighted the potential involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and microglia, a major source of ROS, in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In our study, we explored how the second-generation antipsychotic risperidone (RIS) affects ROS regulation and microglial activation in the hippocampus using a mouse ketamine (KET) model of schizophrenia. KET administration resulted in schizophrenia-like behaviors in male C57BL/6J mice, such as impaired prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response and hyper-locomotion. These behaviors were mitigated by RIS. We found that the gene expression level of an enzyme responsible for ROS production (Nox2), which is primarily associated with activated microglia, was lower in KET/RIS-treated mice than in KET-treated mice. Conversely, the levels of antioxidant enzymes (Ho-1 and Gclc) were higher in KET/RIS-treated mice. The microglial density in the hippocampus was increased in KET-treated mice, which was counteracted by RIS. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed three morphological subtypes of microglia. In control mice, most microglia were resting-ramified (type I, 89.7%). KET administration shifted the microglial composition to moderately ramified (type II, 44.4%) and hyper-ramified (type III, 25.0%). In KET/RIS-treated mice, type II decreased to 32.0%, while type III increased to 34.0%. An in vitro ROS assay showed that KET increased ROS production in dissociated hippocampal microglia, and this effect was mitigated by RIS. Furthermore, we discovered that a NOX2 inhibitor could counteract KET-induced behavioral deficits. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of ROS production by RIS may play a crucial role in ameliorating schizophrenia-related symptoms. Moreover, modulating microglial activation to regulate ROS production has emerged as a novel avenue for developing innovative treatments for schizophrenia. image
   The effects of the second-generation antipsychotic risperidone (RIS) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and microglia were analyzed using a mouse ketamine (KET) model of schizophrenia. Compared to KET-treated mice, KET/RIS-treated mice exhibited lower gene expression of the ROS-generating enzyme (Nox2), and higher expression of antioxidant enzymes (Ho-1 and Gclc). Three types of microglia were defined by hierarchical cluster analysis: resting-ramified (type I) in control mice, moderately ramified (type II) in KET-treated mice, and hyper-ramified (type III) in KET/RIS-treated mice. In vitro ROS assay showed that RIS reduced the production of microglial ROS induced by KET. Notably, antioxidant compounds (N-Acetyl-L-cysteine [NAC] and GSK 2795039 [GSK]) alleviated schizophrenia-like behaviors induced by KET, suggesting a promising direction for the development of novel treatments for schizophrenia.image

AB  - Methamphetamine (METH) is a highly addictive psychoactive drug that is used worldwide. Various approaches have been used to address METH dependence, but many of them have little effect. Previous studies have shown that exercise on a treadmill could reduce METH dependence in mice, but the intensity and duration of exercise that was needed to be effective was unknown. This study investigated the effects of low-and medium-intensity treadmill exercise on methamphetamine reward in male mice via conditioned place preference (CPP) training, and the levels of the inflammatory factors IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a in three brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum) were determined. The results showed that long-term medium-intensity exercise reduced the effects of methamphetamine on inflammation markers in the brain and CPP scores. In addition, long-term medium-intensity exercise decreased IL-1b concentrations in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, reduced IL-6 concentrations in the striatum, and reduced TNF-a concentrations in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum in methamphetamine-treated mice; low-intensity exercise was less effective. The results indicated that long-term medium-intensity exercise could reduce concentrations of methamphetamine-induced encephalitis factors in male mice, while low-intensity exercise was less effective in alleviating dependence and inflammatory responses. It is suggested that exercise intensity is an important factor affecting the dependence level and inflammatory responses in the brain in mice administered methamphetamine.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - An antidiabetic agent sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor ertugliflozin has been revealed to bind to catalytic anionic site of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is considered to be associated with the cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the present study was thus to probe the effect of ertugliflozin on AD. Intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ/i.c.v) (3 mg/kg) was done bilaterally in male Wistar rats at 7-8 weeks of age. Two treatment doses (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) of ertugliflozin were given intragastrically to STZ/i.c.v-induced rats for 20 days daily for behavioral assessment. Biochemical estimations of cholinergic activity, neuronal apoptosis, mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity were performed. Behavioral results with ertugliflozin treatment revealed attenuation of cognitive deficit. Ertugliflozin also inhibited hippocampal AChE activity, downregulated pro-apoptotic marker expression, as well as mitigated mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic damage in STZ/i.c.v rats. Importantly, we found that the hyperphosphorylation of tau in the hippocampus of STZ/i.c.v rats was decreased after oral administration of ertugliflozin, which was accompanied by decreased Phospho.IRS-1Ser307/Total.IRS-1 ratio and increased Phospho.AktSer473/Total.Akt and Phospho.GSK3 & beta;Ser9/Total.GSK3 & beta; ratios. Our results indicated that treatment with ertugliflozin reversed AD pathology, which may be associated with inhibition of insulin signaling disruptioninduced tau hyperphosphorylation.

AB  - Simple Summary The bactericidal mechanisms and immunomodulatory effects of Microcin C7 (C7) have been confirmed by many studies. However, most studies were performed in vitro and need to be substantiated with in vivo data. We showed that C7 supplementation can improve growth performance, reduce diarrhea rate, and that the diarrhea-alleviating effect of C7 may be related to its selective regulation of specific microbial taxa. C7 improved the intestinal morphology of the duodenum and ileum and enhanced diet digestibility. The recommended C7 dosage is 250-500 mg/kg. Supplementation with 5000 mg/kg had no adverse effect on all indices; thus, this is a safe threshold for C7 usage in clinical practice. Overall, these data indicate that C7 is safe and effective for use as a potential alternative to antibiotic growth promoters in weaned piglets. The effects and safety of dietary supplementation with Microcin C7 (C7) were evaluated in 216 weaned piglets. The pigs were given a control corn-soybean meal basal diet or C7 diet (control diet supplemented with 250, 500, 750, 1000, or 5000 mg C7/kg diets). Compared with the control group, the 500 mg/kg C7 supplementation group had better intestinal morphological indicators (p < 0.05), which may help maintain intestinal epithelial function and increase the growth performance (p < 0.05) and apparent total tract digestibility (p < 0.05). The diarrhea indexes of the 250, 500, and 750 mg/kg groups were significantly lower than that of the control group at 0-28 d (p < 0.05), and the 500 mg/kg group had the lowest diarrhea indexes (linear and quadratic, p < 0.05). A comprehensive analysis showed that microbial structure was significantly correlated with the degree of diarrhea, and the diarrhea-alleviating effect of C7 may be related to its selective regulation of specific microbial taxa. The 250 and 500 mg/kg C7 supplementation also significantly improved several immune indices of piglets (p < 0.05). Compared with the control diet, 5000 mg/kg C7 supplementation had no significant adverse effect on all parameters. Overall, the 250-500 mg/kg dose had the best effect, and the highest dose (5000 mg/kg) posed no toxicity risk. Therefore, C7 appears safe for use as an alternative to antibiotic growth promoters in weaned piglets.

AB  - Opening or closing of K-ATP channels affects some signaling pathways in the brain. These signaling pathways are thought to be associated with epilepsy. Here, we investigated the effect of K-ATP channel opener and blocker on the AKT mTOR mRNA expressions in the hippocampus and cortex regions in the penicillin model of epilepsy in rats. Four groups were created viz. Control (C), Epilepsy (E), Epilepsy-Opener (E-O) and Epilepsy-Blocker (E-B). Epileptic focus was created by administering penicillin into the brain, and the seizure-related AKT, mTOR mRNA levels were determined by qPCR on days 1(st), 4(th), and 8(th) after the seizure. The AKT mRNA expression levels in the hippocampus were statistically significant (P <0.05) in the E 1(st) day group. mTOR mRNA expression levels were observed to be significantly higher in the E 1(st) day and 8(th) day groups than in control and all opener groups. (P <0.05). mTOR mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in the E-B 1(st) day and 8(th) day group compared to the control and opener groups (P <0.05). AKT mRNA expression levels in the cortex were found to be statistically significantly higher in the E 1(st) day group than in the other groups. mTOR mRNA expression was significantly higher in the E 4(th) day group than in the control group. The results suggest that activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is effective in the development of epilepsy and that the effect of KATP channels on epilepsy may be via the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

AB  - The Chaetognatha are a marine invertebrate phylum including 132 extant, carnivorous species in nine families and two orders, but with unclear protostomian affinities in the animal kingdom. We document the gradual recognition of the distinctiveness of chaetognaths by early taxonomists, with some emphasis on the often-overlooked studies by Chinese marine biologists. The carnivorous arrow worms are understudied relative to their importance in the marine zooplankton, where they rank second in abundance after the herbivorous copepods. Although arrow worms lack gills or other dedicated respiratory organs, we show that the Gill-Oxygen Limitation Theory (GOLT) can be used to explain how temperature and respiration affect their growth and related life-history traits. Notably, we present a reappraisal of evidence for size-temperature relationships between and within chaetognath species, and for the relationship between their temperature-mediated oxygen demand and their growth patterns. Von Bertalanffy weight growth curves of Ferosagitta hispida (family: Sagittidae) based on earlier aquarium experiments by various authors are presented, which suggest (a) a good fit and (b) that the life span of chaetognaths is much lower than suggested by the authors of several published growth curves drawn onto length-frequency samples from the wild. In addition, we show that chaetognaths attain first maturity at a fraction of the maximum length they can attain that is similar to the corresponding fraction in fishes. Overall, we suggest that the manner in which the oxygen they require enters the body of small marine invertebrates, although often neglected, is a crucial aspect of their biology. In addition, based on our result that arrow worms conform to the GOLT, we suggest that this theory may provide the theoretical framework for the study of growth in the other water-breathing ectotherms lacking gills.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the effect of carbetocin administration (a long -acting analog of oxytocin) 20 or 10 min before electroejaculation (EE) on the duration of semen collection procedure, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the ejaculate, and stress biomarkers in rams. Semen was collected from 12 Corriedale rams (age, 2.5 -5.5 years old) with EE, in a Latin -square design, administrating carbetocin (0.2 mg/ 100 kg of body weight i.v.) 20 or 10 min before EE, or without carbetocin administration (CB -20, CB -10, and CON treatments, respectively). Each treatment was applied to different rams every 3 -4 days, allowing all the rams to receive all three treatments. Carbetocin administered 20 or 10 min before EE increased the number of sperm ejaculated (P = 0.01), the semen concentration (P = 0.02), the number of insemination doses collected in a single collection (P = 0.01), and the number of insemination doses collected/electrical pulses administered (P = 0.05) compared to control rams. Carbetocin administered 20 or 10 min before semen collection prolonged the time required for EE and the number of pulses administered during EE compared to CON rams (P < 0.03 for both). The CB -10 rams required the administration of more electrical pulses during ejaculation than CON rams (P = 0.001), and CB -20 treatment tended to require more electrical pulses than CON rams (P = 0.06). The volume of the ejaculate was greater in CB -10 than in CON rams (P = 0.01), and that of CB -20 treatment tended to be greater than CON rams (P = 0.08). The percentage of sperm with intact membrane was greater in CB -20 than in CON rams (P = 0.01). Total protein, albumin, and globulin concentrations were lower immediately after carbetocin administration 20 or 10 min before EE. The treatments did not affect cortisol concentration, glycemia, rectal and surface temperatures, heart rate, and facial expressions. Carbetocin administration before EE of rams improved the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the ejaculate, duplicating the number of insemination doses collected. It can be a promising treatment to obtain a greater quantity of doses to inseminate with a lower frequency of semen collections, reducing the negative impacts of EE on animal welfare.

AB  - Most memories that are formed are forgotten, while others are retained longer and are subject to memory stabilization. We show that non-invasive transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the greater occipital nerve (NITESGON) using direct current during learning elicited a long-term memory effect. However, it did not trigger an immediate effect on learning. A neurobiological model of long-term memory proposes a mechanism by which memories that are initially unstable can be strengthened through subsequent novel experiences. In a series of studies, we demonstrate NITESGON's capability to boost the retention of memories when applied shortly before, during, or shortly after the time of learning by enhancing memory consolidation via activation and communication in and between the locus coeruleus pathway and hippocampus by plausibly modulating dopaminergic input. These findings may have a significant impact for neurocognitive disorders that inhibit memory consolidation such as Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - It is widely recognized that sleep loss harms healthy adults. Microglia-mediated synaptic pruning is active during sleep and contributes to memory consolidation. Here, we established a mouse model of sleep deprivation (SD) using a modified multiple-platform method (MMPM). Using western blotting, immunofluorescence, and Golgi-Cox staining, we found that SD increased microglial capacity for phagocytizing mature synapses and decreased the number of mature synapses, which affected long-term memory consolidation but did not affect working memory after SD. Further, we discovered that pretreatment with the APOE mimic peptide COG1410 could partially rescue SD-induced long-term memory consolidation. Regarding the mechanism, COG1410 alleviated SD-induced abnormal microglial phagocytosis and increased the number of mature synapses. Also, COG1410 promoted M2 polarization of microglia and reduced hippocampal inflammation caused by SD. However, whether the anti-inflammatory effect of COG1410 is related to the regulation of microglial phagocytosis still needs further study. Finally, we downregulated the expression of TREM2 in the hippocampus using small interfering RNA (siRNA), which reduced the protective effect of COG1410 in SD mice. In summary, COG1410 has the potential to prevent SD-induced memory consolidation impairment by maintaining microglial phagocytosis and anti-inflammation in the mouse hippocampus.

AB  - In India, the genus Hippophae is represented by three species viz., H. rhamnoides subsp. turkestanica, H. tibetana and H. salicifolia. These are distributed in Himachal Pradesh (HP), Uttarakhand (UK) and Sikkim (SK). In vegetative or fragmented state, these species are difficult to identify. In an earlier investigation, based on the analyses of accessions of Hippophae collected from the three states of India and some procured from abroad, an unexpected result was obtained about the taxonomic status of some accessions of a species collected from Uttarakhand. To verify this, four DNA barcode markers (ITS, matK, rbcL and rpoC1) were applied to the same 80 accessions. The initial analyses based on Neighbour joining (NJ) trees, raised doubts about the identification of some accessions of H. salicifolia and H. tibetana from HP, and H. rhamnoides subsp. turkestanica from UK. Therefore, matK sequences of all these accessions were BLAST searched on NCBI and BOLD, and ITS sequences only on NCBI. This revealed that the accessions collected as H. rhamnoides subsp. turkestanica from UK were, in fact, H. salicifolia. Likewise, H. salicifolia collected from HP turned out to be H. rhamnoides. The correct identity of four accessions collected from HP as H. tibetana was H. salicifolia. In ITS and matK trees, constructed with corrected identities, all the three species segregated in different clades, while some subspecies of H. rhamnoides too occupied different branches. The three species could be easily distinguished on the basis rpoC1 sequences also, though sub-species of H. rhamnoides could not be distinguished. Among the loci tested, rbcL sequences could not distinguish even the species. Thus, DNA barcoding, with ITS and matK as the markers, proved to be effective for the authentication of Hippophae species, in the absence of their voucher specimens. The apparent distinctive nature of H. rhamnoides subsp. turkestanica suggests the possibility of raising it to species level.

AB  - Simple Summary Each year, millions of monarch butterflies in eastern North America undergo a spectacular fall migration to overwintering sites in central Mexico, where they remain until returning northward in the spring. In addition to the navigational challenges faced during the southward flight, migratory individuals are also challenged with the foraging task of locating high-quality nectar sources for overwinter survival in the face of unfamiliar floral landscapes that change in complex and unpredictable ways. In the research reported here, a proboscis extension paradigm is used to investigate learning and long-term memory abilities that might help fall migrants meet these unique foraging demands. Male and female migratory and captive-reared individuals were consecutively trained to perform color and odor cue discriminations and then tested for their ability to simultaneously retain reward information associated with each cue in memory without reinforcement over a period of 7 days. Results showed that male and female fall migrants can learn the reward properties of color and odor cues with over 75% accuracy after less than 40 s of exposure and can simultaneously retain visual and olfactory information predicting the availability of floral rewards in memory without reinforcement for at least 7 days. Captive-reared male butterflies also showed the ability to retain visual and olfactory information in long-term memory for 7 days; however, 80% of captive-reared females could not retain color cues in long-term memory for more than 24 h. These novel findings are consistent with the view that monarch butterflies have enhancements to long-term memory that enable them to minimize the amount of time and energy wasted searching for suitable nectar sources during their annual fall migration, thereby optimizing migratory performance and increasing the chance of overwinter survival. The possibility that female monarchs undergo a seasonal change in visual long-term memory warrants further empirical investigation. Each fall, monarch butterflies in eastern North America undergo an extraordinary long-distance migration to wintering areas in central Mexico, where they remain until returning northward in the spring. Migrants survive the overwintering period by metabolizing lipid reserves accumulated exclusively though floral nectar; however, there is little known about how individuals maximize foraging efficiency in the face of floral environments that constantly change in complex and unpredictable ways along their migratory route. Here, a proboscis extension paradigm is used to investigate the role of cognition during the foraging phase of monarch migration. Male and female migratory butterflies were consecutively trained to discriminate between two color and odor cues and then tested for their ability to simultaneously retain the information on the reward value of each cue in memory without reinforcement over a period of 7 days. To gain further insight into cognitive abilities of monarchs as a migratory species, a second set of captive-reared males and females were tested under harnessed conditions at the same time as wild-caught fall migrants. Results showed that male and female migrants can learn the reward properties of color and odor cues with over 75% accuracy after less than 40 s of exposure and can simultaneously retain visual and olfactory information predicting the availability of floral rewards in memory without reinforcement for at least 7 days.
   Captive-reared male butterflies also showed the ability to retain visual and olfactory information in long-term memory for 7 days; however, 80% of captive-reared females could not retain color cues in long-term memory for more than 24 h. These novel findings are consistent with the view that monarch butterflies, as a migratory species, have enhancements to long-term memory that enable them to minimize the amount of time and energy wasted searching for suitable nectar sources during their annual fall migration, thereby optimizing migratory performance and increasing the chance of overwinter survival. The possibility that female monarchs undergo a seasonal change in visual long-term memory warrants further empirical investigation.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: In elderly people, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It has been shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) based on phytomedicines enhances the therapeutic effects of modern medicine when taken in conjunction with them. Modern medicine N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) antagonist memantine (Mm) are mainly used in the clinical treatment of AD. TCM Cerebralcare Granule (R) (CG) has long been an effective treatment for headaches, dizziness, and other symptoms. In this study, we employ a blend of CG and Mm to address Alzheimer's disease-like symptoms and explore their impacts and underlying mechanisms. Aim of the study: The objective of our study was to observe the effects of CG combined with Memantine (Mm) on learning and memory impairment of AD mice induced by D-galactose and to explore the mechanism at work. Materials and methods: CG and Mm were combined to target multiple pathological processes involved in AD. For a thorough analysis, we performed various experiments such as behavioral detection, pathological detection, proteomic detection, and other experimental methods of detection. Results: It was found that the combination of CG and Mm was significantly effective for improving learning and memory in AD mice as well as brain pathology. The serum and hippocampal tissue of AD mice were significantly enhanced with catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were decreased with this treatment. In AD mice, a combination of Mm and CG (CG + Mm) significantly increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-10, decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), improved synaptic plasticity by restoring synaptophysin (SYP) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) expression in the hippocampus, enhanced A beta phagocytosis of microglia in AD mice, and increased mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complexes I, II, III, and IV, lead to an increase in the number of functionally active NMDA receptors in the hippocampus. Proteomic analysis GO analysis showed that the positive regulation gene H3BIV5 of G protein coupled receptor signal pathway and synaptic transmission was up-regulated, while the transsynaptic signal of postsynaptic membrane potential and regulation-related gene Q5NCT9 were down-regulated. Most proteins showed significant enriched signal transduction pathway profiles after CG + Mm treatment, based on the KEGG pathway database. Conclusion: The data supported the idea that CG and Mm could be more effective in treating AD mice induced by D-galactose than Mm alone. We provided a basis for the clinical use of CG with Mm.

AB  - At postsynaptic sites of neurons, a prominent clathrin-coated structure, the endocytic zone (EZ), controls the trafficking of glutamate receptors and is essential for synaptic plasticity. Despite its importance, little is known about how this clathrin structure is organized to mediate endocytosis. We used live-cell and super-resolution microscopy to reveal the dynamic organization of this poorly understood clathrin structure in rat hippocampal neurons. We found that a subset of endocytic proteins only transiently appeared at postsynaptic sites. In contrast, other proteins were persistently enriched and partitioned at the edge of the EZ. We found that uncoupling the EZ from the synapse led to the loss of most of these components, while disrupting interactions with the actin cytoskeleton or membrane did not alter EZ positioning. Finally, we found that plasticity-inducing stimuli promoted the reorganization of the EZ. We conclude that the EZ is a stable, highly organized molecular platform where components are differentially recruited and positioned to orchestrate the endocytosis of synaptic receptors.

AB  - Recurrent damage by lepidopteran folivores triggers repeated leaf-to-leaf electrical signaling. We found that the ability to propagate electrical signals-called slow wave potentials-was unexpectedly robust and was maintained in plants that had experienced severe damage. We sought genes that maintain tissue excitability during group insect attack. When Arabidopsis thaliana P-Type II Ca2+-ATPase mutants were mechanically wounded, all mutants tested displayed leaf-to-leaf electrical signals. However, when the auto-inhibited Ca2+-ATPase double-mutant aca10 aca12 was attacked by Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars, electrical signaling failed catastrophically, and the insects consumed these plants rapidly. The attacked double mutant displayed petiole base deformation and chlorosis, which spread acropetally into laminas and led to senescence. A phloem-feeding aphid recapitulated these effects, implicating the vasculature in electrical signaling failure. Consistent with this, ACA10 expressed in phloem companion cells in an aca10 aca12 background rescued electrical signaling and defense during protracted S. littoralis attack. When expressed in xylem contact cells, ACA10 partially rescued these phenotypes. Extending our analyses, we found that prolonged darkness also caused wound-response electrical signaling failure in aca10 aca12 mutants. Our results lead to a model in which the plant vasculature acts as a capacitor that discharges temporarily when leaves are subjected to energy-depleting stresses. Under these conditions, ACA10 and ACA12 function allows the restoration of vein cell membrane potentials. In the absence of these gene functions, vascular cell excitability can no longer be restored efficiently. Additionally, this work demonstrates that non-invasive electrophysiology is a powerful tool for probing early events underlying senescence.

AB  - Marine central-place foragers are increasingly faced with altered prey landscapes, necessitating predictions of the impact of such changes on behavior, reproductive success, and population dynamics. We used state-dependent behavioral life history theory implemented via Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) to explore the influence of changes in prey distribution and energy gain from foraging on the behavior and reproductive success of a central place forager during lactation. Our work is motivated by northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) because of the ongoing population decline of the Eastern Pacific stock and projected declines in biomass of walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), a key fur seal prey species in the eastern Bering Sea. We also explored how changes in female and pup metabolic rates, body size, and lactation duration affected model output to provide insight into traits that might experience selective pressure in response to reductions in prey availability. Simulated females adopted a central-place foraging strategy after an initial extended period spent on land (4.7-8.3 days). Trip durations increased as the high energy prey patch moved farther from land or when the energy gain from foraging decreased. Increases in trip duration adversely affected pup growth rates and wean mass despite attempts to compensate by increasing land durations. Metabolic rate changes had the largest impacts on pup wean mass, with reductions in a pup's metabolic rate allowing females to successfully forage at distances of 600+ km from land for up to 15+ days. Our results indicate that without physiological adaptations, a rookery is unlikely to be viable if the primary foraging grounds are 400 km or farther from the rookery. To achieve pup growth rates characteristic of a population experiencing rapid growth, model results indicate the primary foraging grounds need to be <150 km from the rookery.

AB  - Adolescent depression represents a risk for chronic' illness when current treatments fail. Given the modest effectiveness of extant therapies, there is a keen need to develop treatments for depression. We used neurofeedback training and positive autobiographical memory retrieval to modulate neural networks that enable emotion regulation and autobiographical memories (amygdala and hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex) in youth. Our goal was to understand how depressed and control youth engage those regions during emotion regulation and memory recall. Our results showed engagement of the targeted areas as well as differences between diagnostic groups. Future work ought to examine neurofeedback training's dosage in depressed youth and target cortico-limbic connectivity involved in positive memory recall.
   Neurodevelopmental psychopathology seeks to understand higher-order emotion regulation circuitry to develop new therapies for adolescents with depression. Depressed (N = 34) and healthy youth (N = 19) completed neurofeedback (NF) training and exhibited increased bilateral amygdala and hippocampus activity in the region of interest (ROI) analyses by recalling positive autobiographical memories. We tested factors supportive of the engagement of emotion regulation's neural areas during NF (i.e., parental support, medication, and gender effects upon anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) engagement). Whole-brain analyses yielded effects of NF vs. control condition and effects of diagnosis. Youth showed higher amygdala and hippocampus (AMYHIPPO) activity during the NF vs. control condition, particularly in the left hippocampus. ACC's activity was also higher during NF vs. control. Higher average ACC activity was linked to better parental support, absent depression, female gender, and absent medication. Control youth showed higher average AMYHIPPO and ACC activity throughout the task and a faster decline in activity vs. depressed youths. Whole-brain level analyses showed higher activity in the frontotemporal network during the NF vs. control conditions, suggesting targeting their connectivity in future neurofeedback trials.

AB  - The cell sheet technique is a promising approach for tissue engineering, and the present study is aimed to determine a better configuration of cell sheets for cartilage repair. For stratified chondrocyte sheets (S-CS), articular chondrocytes isolated from superficial, middle, and deep zones were stacked accordingly. Heterogeneous chondrocyte sheets (H-CS) were obtained by mixing zonal chondrocytes. The expressions of chondrocytes, cytokine markers, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production were assessed in an in vitro assay. The curative effect was investigated in an in vivo porcine osteochondral defect model. The S-CS showed a higher cell viability, proliferation rate, expression of chondrogenic markers, secretion of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, and GAG production level than the H-CS group. The expressions of ECM destruction enzyme and proinflammatory cytokines were lower in the S-CS group. In the mini-pigs articular cartilage defect model, the S-CS group had a higher International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) macroscopic score and displayed a zonal structure that more closely resembled the native cartilage than those implanted with the H-CS. Our study demonstrated that the application of the S-CS increased the hyaline cartilage formation and improved the surgical outcome of chondrocyte implication, offering a better tissue engineering strategy for treating articular cartilage defects.

AB  - Neural adaptation associated with formation of morphine conditioned place preference remained largely unexplored. This study monitored longitudinal changes in neural signaling during pre-conditioning, conditioning and post-conditioning periods of morphine conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm for investigation of adaptive mechanisms of opiate addiction. Male Swiss albino mice implanted with intracranial electrodes into the nucleus accumbens (NAc), striatum (STr) and hippocampus (HC) were used for recording of local field potentials (LFPs). Animals received a 10-day schedule for associative learning to pair the specific compartment of the chamber with morphine effects. Exploratory behavior and LFP signals were recorded during pre-conditioning (baseline level), conditioning (day 1, 5 and 10) and post-conditioning (day 1, 4 and 7) periods. Repeated measures one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test revealed significant increases in number of visit and time spent in morphine compartment during post-conditioning days. Frequency analysis of LFP highlighted the increases in alpha activity (12 - 18 Hz) in the NAc from post-conditioning day 1 until day 7. Moreover, significantly increased coherent activities between the pair of NAc-HC were developed within gamma frequency range (35 - 42 Hz) on morphine conditioning day 10 and disappeared during post-conditioning days. Taken together, these findings emphasized NAc LFP signaling and neural connectivities between the NAc and HC associated with morphine CPP. These adaptive changes might underlie the formation of morphine conditioned place preference and behavioral consequences such as craving and relapse.

AB  - Background/purpose: Obesity in midlife is an established risk factor for dementia. In middle-aged adults, elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with lower neurocognition and smaller hippocampal volumes. It is unclear whether behavioral weight loss (BWL) can improve neurocognition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether BWL, compared to wait list control (WLC), improved hippocampal volume and neurocognition. We also examined if baseline hippocampal volume and neurocognition were associated with weight loss.
   Methods: We randomly assigned women with obesity (N = 61; mean +/- SD age=41.1 +/- 9.9 years; BMI=38.6 +/- 6.2 kg/m(2); and 50.8% Black) to BWL or WLC. Participants completed assessments at baseline and follow-up including T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition Battery.
   Results: The BWL group lost 4.7 +/- 4.9% of initial body weight at 16-25 weeks, which was significantly more than the WLC group which gained 0.2 +/- 3.5% (p < 0.001). The BWL and WLC groups did not differ significantly in changes in hippocampal volume or neurocognition (ps>0.05). Baseline hippocampal volume and neurocognition scores were not significantly associated with weight loss (ps>0.05).
   Conclusions and implications: Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no overall benefit of BWL relative to WLC on hippocampal volumes or cognition in young- and middle-aged women. Baseline hippocampal volume and neurocognition were not associated with weight loss.

AB  - With the development of modern animal husbandry, especially pig farming, large-scale, intensive, and automated farming has become the trend in the industry. The realization of accurate recognition and warning of dangerous actions in feeding scenarios for sows and piglets holds high research and practical value in this field. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a Transformer -based Neural Network (TNN) model. This model emphasizes the extraction of global features and handling of long-distance dependencies, significantly improving the accuracy of behavior recognition. Compared with traditional neural network models, TNN demonstrates superiority in dealing with animal behavior recognition in farming scenarios. Furthermore, an in-depth study of the attention mechanism in the TNN model was conducted in this paper. By visualizing the attention heat map of the TNN model, it was found that TNN could effectively focus on key areas in the image, thereby accurately identifying the behavior of piglets. Finally, this paper proposes a unique model lightweighting strategy that allows the TNN model to run efficiently on edge devices. In the experimental part, the performance of the TNN model on five behavior recognition tasks was evaluated first. The results showed that the TNN model achieved high scores in both Precision and Recall, far exceeding traditional neural network models. Then, by visualizing the attention heat map of the TNN model, the superiority of the TNN model in focusing on key image areas was further confirmed. In the end, the effect of the model lightweighting strategy was demonstrated, and even with a significant reduction in parameters and computational complexity, the performance of the TNN model remained excellent. This research not only promotes the development of animal behavior recognition technology but also provides new insights and tools for the precise management and efficient operation of the animal husbandry industry.

AB  - Background: Bungarus multicinctus is one of the most dangerous venomous snakes prone to cardiopulmonary damage with extremely high mortality. In our previous work, we found that glutamine (Gln) and glutamine synthetase (GS) in pig serum were significantly reduced after Bungarus multicinctus bite. In the present study, to explore whether there is a link between the pathogenesis of cardiopulmonary injury and Gln metabolic changes induced by Bungarus multicinctus venom. We investigated the effect of Gln supplementation on the lung and heart function after snakebite.Methods: We supplemented different concentrations of Gln to mice that were envenomated by Bungarus multicinctus to observe the biological behavior, survival rate, hematological and pathological changes. Gln was supplemented immediately or one hour after the venom injection, and then changes in Gln metabolism were analyzed. Subsequently, to further explore the protective mechanism of glutamine on tissue damage, we measured the expression of heat-shock protein70 (HSP70), NF-?B P65, P53/PUMA by western blotting and real-time polymerase in the lung and heart.Results: Gln supplementation delayed the envenoming symptoms, reduced mortality, and alleviated the histopathological changes in the heart and lung of mice bitten by Bungarus multicinctus. Additionally, Gln increased the activity of glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and glutaminase (GLS) in serum. It also balanced the transporter SLC7A11 expression in heart and lung tissues. Bungarus multicinctus venom induced the NF-?B nuclear translocation in the lung, while the HO-1 expression was suppressed. At the same time, venom activated the P53/PUMA signaling pathway and the BAX expression in the heart. Gln treatment reversed the above phenomenon and increased HSP70 expression.

AB  - Dendroctonus bark beetles are the most destructive agents in coniferous forests. These beetles come into contact with the toxic compounds of their host's chemical defenses throughout their life cycle, some of which are also used by the insects as kairomones to select their host trees during the colonization process. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which the insects counteract the toxicity of these compounds. Here, two sibling species of bark beetles, D. valens and D. rhizophagus, were stimulated with vapors of a blend of their main kairomones (a-pinene, b-pinene and 3-carene), in order to compare the transcriptional response of their gut. A total of 48 180 unigenes were identified in D. valens and 43 704 in D. rhizophagus, in response to kairomones blend. The analysis of differential gene expression showed a transcriptional response in D. valens (739 unigenes, 0.58-10.36 Log2FC) related to digestive process and in D. rhizophagus (322 unigenes 0.87-13.08 Log2FC) related to xenobiotics metabolism. The expression profiles of detoxification genes mainly evidenced the up-regulation of COEs and GSTs in D. valens, and the up-regulation of P450s in D. rhizophagus. Results suggest that terpenes metabolism comes accompanied by an integral hormetic response, result of compensatory mechanisms, including the activation of other metabolic pathways, to ensure the supply of energy and the survival of organisms which is specific for each species, according to its life history and ecological strategy.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Selenium-enriched Cardamine violifolia (SEC), a cruciferous plant, exerts excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity, but its effect on hepatic function is unclear. This study investigated the effect and potential mechanism of SEC on hepatic injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Twenty-four weaned piglets were randomly allotted to treatment with SEC (0.3 mg/kg Se) and/or LPS (100 mu g/kg). After 28 days of the trial, pigs were injected with LPS to induce hepatic injury. These results indicated that SEC supplementation attenuated LPS-induced hepatic morphological injury and reduced aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities in plasma. SEC also inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) after the LPS challenge. In addition, SEC improved hepatic antioxidant capacity via enhancing glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity and decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. Moreover, SEC downregulated the mRNA expression of hepatic myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain proteins 1 (NOD1) and its adaptor molecule receptor interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2). SEC also alleviated LPS-induced hepatic necroptosis by inhibiting RIPK1, RIPK3, and mixed-lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) expression. These data suggest that SEC potentially mitigates LPS-induced hepatic injury via inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/NOD2 and necroptosis signaling pathways in weaned piglets.

AB  - Bovidae from the Messinian localities of Italian Peninsula are poorly known and documented except in the Monticino Quarry record (Brisighella, central Italy), which represents, therefore, a key locality for the understanding of Bovidae diversity and biogeography during the Messinian in Italy. In the present paper, the material published in the 1989 along with new, unpublished bovid material from Monticino Quarry are revised in order to clarify the taxonomic attribution of the Monticino' bovids and to better understand their geographic and chronological distribution, as well as the Bovidae diversity in Italy during the Messinian. The updated and revised data on the Italian small, spiral-horned antelope from Monticino Quarry, and the additional specimens from Borro Strolla (Tuscany) and Verduno (Piedmont), suggests it has to be referred to the genus Oioceros, i.e., Oioceros occidentalis nov. comb. In addition, the presence of four other bovids at Monticino is attested here: Bovidae indet. (small-size), Bovinae indet. (medium-large size cf. Boselaphini), Bovinae indet. cf. Parabos, and Antilopinae indet. (medium size). The biochronological correlations and paleobiogeographic implications of these findings are discussed, suggesting a close affinity in faunal assemblage among the northern and central Italian latest Messinian localities and supporting the dispersal of bovids from East to West during the Messinian (before and during the Messinian Salinity Crisis).

AB  - Paraquat (PQ), an environmental neurotoxicant, causes acute fatal poisoning upon accidental or intentional ingestion (suicidal cases) worldwide. To date, an effective remedy for PQ toxicity is not available. In this study, we have evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of Bacopaside-I (BS-I), an active compound found in the plant extract of Bacopa monnieri (Brahmi), against acute PQ intoxication using zebrafish as a model organism. Adult zebrafish were injected with a dose of either 30 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg PQ. PQ-intoxicated zebrafish showed an increased rate of mortality and oxidative imbalance in their brain. Also, the proliferation of neural cells in the adult zebrafish brain was inhibited. However, when BS-I pretreated zebrafish were intoxicated with PQ, the toxic effects of PQ were ameliorated. PQ treatment also affected the expression of particular genes concerned with the apoptosis and dopamine signaling, which was not altered by BS-I administration. Our results highlight the efficiency of BS-I as a novel therapeutic agent for PQ intoxication. It further compels us to search and evaluate the molecular mechanisms targeted by BS-I to develop a potent therapy for acute PQ intoxication.

AB  - Simple Summary The diversity of membrane and nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) expression in the brain suggests numerous roles for estrogens throughout life. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of selective expression of membrane-only ER alpha (MOER) or nuclear-only ER alpha (NOER) on the distributions of proteins known to be involved in paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) function and estrogen-mediated plasticity in the hippocampus. We found that, although the PVN has both membrane and nuclear ER alpha, only loss of nuclear ER alpha impacted ER beta expression. In hippocampal CA1, an area with primarily extranuclear ER alpha, and the dentate gyrus, which contains nuclear and extranuclear ER alpha and ER beta, a marker of plasticity (phosphorylated Trkb) changed with both membrane and nuclear receptor loss, but the direction of the change was region-specific. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus and CA3 regions, where there is less ER alpha expression overall, loss of nuclear or membrane ER alpha appeared to have less impact on plasticity markers. Altogether, this work generates new questions about the functions of membrane and nuclear ERs in the development of the brain and actions in adulthood. Estrogens via estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) genomic and nongenomic signaling can influence plasticity processes in numerous brain regions. Using mice that express nuclear only ER alpha (NOER) or membrane only ER alpha (MOER), this study examined the effect of receptor compartmentalization on the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and the hippocampus. The absence of nuclear and membrane ER alpha expression impacted females but not males in these two brain areas. In the PVN, quantitative immunohistochemistry showed that the absence of nuclear ER alpha increased nuclear ER beta. Moreover, in the hippocampus CA1, immuno-electron microscopy revealed that the absence of either nuclear or membrane ER alpha decreased extranuclear ER alpha and pTrkB in synapses. In contrast, in the dentate gyrus, the absence of nuclear ER alpha increased pTrkB in synapses, whereas the absence of membrane ER alpha decreased pTrkB in axons. However, the absence of membrane only ER alpha decreased the sprouting of mossy fibers in CA3 as reflected by changes in zinc transporter immunolabeling. Altogether these findings support the idea that both membrane and nuclear ER alpha contribute overlapping and unique actions of estrogen that are tissue- and cellular-specific.

AB  - Pine Island Glacier (PIG) is one of the largest contributors to sea level rise in Antarctica. Continuous thinning and frequent calving imply significant destabilization of Pine Island Glacier Ice Shelf (PIGIS). To understand the mechanism of its accelerated disintegration and its future development, we conducted a long-term monitoring and comprehensive analysis of PIGIS, including ice flow velocity, ice shelf fronts, ocean water temperature, rifts, and surface strain rates, based on multi-source satellite observations during 1973-2020. The results reveal that: (1) ice flow velocities of PIGIS increased from 2.3 km/yr in 1973 to 4.5 km/yr in 2020, with two rapid acceleration periods of 1995-2009 and 2017-2020, and its change was highly correlated to the ocean water temperature variation. (2) At least 13 calving events occurred during 1973-2020, with four unprecedented successive retreats in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2020. (3) The acceleration of ice shelf rifting and calving may correlate to the destruction of shear margins, while this damage was likely a response to the warming of bottom seawater. The weakening southern shear margin may continue to recede, indicating that the instability of PIGIS will continue.

AB  - The hemodynamic stabilization of patients after complex cardiac surgery is a daily challenge. The use of high doses of catecholamines is common but has potential adverse effects. Glibenclamide, a KATP blocker, seems to attenuate vasoplegia in different animal models of septic shock. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Glibenclamide on the vasoplegic syndrome after cardiopulmonary bypass in a porcine model. In this experimental study, 20 landrace pigs were randomized into two groups and examined: In the control group, standard medical therapy, including norepinephrine, was used, and in the study group standard medical therapy plus additional Glibenclamide was administered. Following general anesthesia, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping was performed. In the study group, Glibenclamide was administered 45 min after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. The dosage used was 10 mg/kg as a bolus, followed by a continuous infusion of 10 mg/kg/h. Hemodynamic and laboratory measurements were performed. Glibenclamide had a relevant effect on circulatory parameters. With increasing vascular resistance and blood pressure, norepinephrine was able to be reduced. While the heart rate dropped to physiological levels, the cardiac index decreased as well. The results lead to the conclusion that Glibenclamide was able to break through vasoplegic syndrome and could therefore serve as a potent drug to stabilize patients after cardiac surgery.

AB  - Plants are composed of diverse secondary metabolites (PSMs), which are widely associated with human health. Whether and how the gut microbiome mediates such impacts of PSMs is poorly understood. Here, we show that discrete dietary and medicinal phenolic glycosides, abundant health-associated PSMs, are utilized by distinct members of the human gut microbiome. Within the Bacteroides, the predominant gram-negative bacteria of the Western human gut, we reveal a specialized multi-enzyme system dedicated to the processing of distinct glycosides based on structural differences in phenolic moieties. This Bacteroides metabolic system liberates chemically distinct aglycones with diverse biological functions, such as colonization resistance against the gut pathogen Clostridioides difficile via anti-microbial activation of polydatin to the stilbene resveratrol and intestinal homeostasis via activation of salicin to the immunoregulatory aglycone saligenin. Together, our results demonstrate generation of biological diversity of phenolic aglycone "effector"functions by a distinct gut-microbiome-encoded PSM-processing system.

AB  - There are marked decreases in plasma concentrations of cortisol and arginine (an essential amino acid for neonates) as well as intestinal citrulline synthesis in piglets during the first 14 days of life. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that increasing plasma cortisol concentrations by cortisol administration may prevent the decline in intestinal citrulline and arginine synthesis from proline, thereby possibly increasing plasma arginine concentration in suckling piglets and their growth. Seven-day-old pigs reared by sows received daily intramuscular injections of hydrocortisone 21-acetate (25 mg/kg) or vehicle solution (saline) (n = 10/group). At 14 days of age, piglets were used to prepare jejunal enterocytes. Cells were incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 min in oxygenated Krebs buffer containing 5 mM glucose, 2 mM [U-C-14]proline, and 2 mM glutamine. Cortisol treatment increased plasma cortisol concentration, mitochondrial proline oxidase and N-acetylglutamate synthase activities, cytosolic argininosuccinate lyase activity, and the intracellular concentrations of N-acetylglutamate and carbamoyl phosphate for citrulline and arginine synthesis. However, cortisol treatment induced the expression of intestinal arginase-II for arginine hydrolysis, resulting in no change in plasma arginine concentration. Administration of cortisol had no effect on milk consumption or the whole-body growth rate of piglets, but increased villus height in the jejunum and ileum. Collectively, these results suggest an important role for proline oxidase and N-acetylglutamate in regulating citrulline and arginine synthesis from proline in pig enterocytes. Because proline catabolism plays an important role in modulating protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and arginine production, our findings may have important implications for understanding the role of proline oxidase in the growth and health of the mammalian small intestine.

AB  - The anatomical structures forming the eyeball differ among dog breeds, both morphologically and morphometrically. This study was aimed at determining the morphometric values of the eyeball layers of different dog breeds and the morphological structures of these layers using scanning electron microscopy. Thirty-two eyeballs of 17 dogs belonging to 9 different breeds that died from traffic accidents, falling from a height, and naturally were used. These dog breeds were grouped according to their brachycephalic and mesocephalic skull structures, and morphometric measurements of the eyeballs of each group were obtained. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the morphological structure of the eyeball layers. The studied dogs' eyeballs comprised three layers: outer, middle, and inner. Thickness measurements obtained from three different regions of the eyeball indicated that the equatorial region was the thinnest among all dog breeds. Moreover, the cornea, which is covered by the sclera along its edges, was thicker at the corneal limbus than at the corneal vertex. A positive correlation was observed between lens thickness and the number of ciliary processes, which varied according to the dogs' head structures. Notably, depression was observed in the posterior surface of the lens in brachycephalic dogs. The morphometric values of the eyeball layers in the brachycephalic and mesocephalic dog breeds were also determined. These values will help researchers study this subject, and the determined morphometric and morphological values will contribute to the anatomy literature.Research Highlights This comprehensive study investigates the morphometric and morphological variations in the eyeball layers of different dog breeds, utilizing scanning electron microscopy to analyze eyeballs. It reveals significant breed-specific differences, particularly between brachycephalic and mesocephalic dogs, regarding eyeball layer thickness, corneal structure, lens thickness, and the number of ciliary processes.

AB  - The present study sought to determine the characteristics of porcine oocyte-cumulus complexes (OCCs) derived from very small and small antral follicles (with less than 1 mm and 1-3 mm in diameter, respectively; VSF and SF) in comparison with controls from medium ones (with 3-6 mm in diameter; MF). Additionally, the present study examined the utility of brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) staining for assessing these OCCs. The incidence of BCB- oocytes in VSF- and SF-derived OCCs was higher than that in MF-derived OCCs. Although the meiotic and developmental competences of BCB+ oocytes from MF were superior to those from VSF and SF, blastocysts were successfully obtained from BCB+ oocytes even derived from VSF. The mean numbers of both total and viable cumulus cells surrounding an oocyte were significantly affected not only by the origin of the OCCs, but also by the BCB status of the oocytes (largest in MF-derived OCCs containing BCB+ oocytes). Although the outer and inner diameters of zona pellucida were affected by the origin of OCCs and the BCB status of oocytes (largest in MF-derived oocytes), the ooplasmic diameter of BCB+ oocytes did not differ among those derived from VSF, SF, and MF. Regardless of the BCB status, the transcriptional levels of G6PD and TKT in cumulus cells decreased during follicular development from VSF to MF, whereas the RPIA mRNA level in cumulus cells of MF-derived BCB+ OCCs was lower than in the others. These results underscore the utility of BCB staining for selecting MF-, SF-, and even VSF-derived OCCs containing oocytes with relatively higher meiotic and developmental competences, as well as the importance of having a sufficient number of healthy cumulus cells expressing genes related to the pentose phosphate pathway at lower levels.

AB  - Background: Dementia, a major symptom of several neurodegenerative diseases, can be improved by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE); however, due to the complex etiology and long course of dementia, the efficacy of these drugs remains limited. Significant empirical evidence shows that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) markedly ameliorates intractable disease; nevertheless, a suitable regimen has yet to be widely accepted, which is likely the result of gaps in the understanding of its causality. We propose that taking advantage of the TCM theory of collateral activation and prevention of accumulation by purgation may improve dementia treatment; thus, we designed the Xiaxue Kaiqiao formula (XKF) accordingly. Purpose: To explore the ameliorative effect and underlying mechanism of XKF on dementia in a Samp8 mouse model. Methods: Samp8 mice were treated with XKF for eight weeks, and the amelioration of dementia was subsequently assessed using the novel object recognition, Barnes maze, and open-field behavioral tests. Neuropathological alterations were observed by immunofluorescence (IF) and Golgi staining of brain tissue. Drug safety was evaluated by blood biochemical tests, organ coefficients, and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Proteomics analysis was performed on frozen brain tissue using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/ Results: Behavioral testing revealed that the administration of XKF had significant ameliorative effects on memory discrimination, spatial learning memory, and anxiety in Samp8 mice. IF staining showed that XKF reduced the loss of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), myelin, neurons, and axons, as well as decreased the proliferation of astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampal and temporal lobe regions. Evaluation of drug safety demonstrated no abnormal organ morphology following XKF treatment. Conclusion: XKF treatment improved the symptoms of dementia in Samp8 mice, indicating the potential for clinical application. The mechanism underlying the ameliorative effect of XKF on dementia is likely increased synaptic transmission between neurons. Our data provide reliable evidence for the TCM theory of collateral activation and prevention of accumulation by purgation.

AB  - The homoterpenes (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) and (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene (TMTT) are the major herbivore-induced plant volatiles that help in defense directly by acting as repellants and indirectly by recruiting insects' natural enemies. In this study, DMNT and TMTT were confirmed to be emitted from citrus (Citrus sinensis) leaves infested with Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama; ACP), and two cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes (CsCYP82L1 and CsCYP82L2) were newly identified and characterized. Understanding the functions of these genes in citrus defense will help plan strategies to manage huanglongbing caused by Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) and spread by ACP. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that CsCYP82L1 and CsCYP82L2 were significantly upregulated in citrus leaves after ACP infestation. Yeast recombinant expression and enzyme assays indicated that CsCYP82L1 and CsCYP82L2 convert (E)-nerolidol to DMNT and (E,E)-geranyllinalool to TMTT. However, citrus calluses stably overexpressing CsCYP82L1 generated only DMNT, whereas those overexpressing CsCYP82L2 produced DMNT and TMTT. Furthermore, ACPs preferred wild-type lemon (Citrus limon) over the CsCYP82L1-overexpressing line in dual-choice feeding assays and mineral oil over TMTT or DMNT in behavioral bioassays. Finally, yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift, and dual luciferase assays demonstrated that CsERF017, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, directly bound to the CCGAC motif and activated CsCYP82L1. Moreover, the transient overexpression of CsERF017 in lemon leaves upregulated CsCYP82L1 in the absence and presence of ACP infestation. These results provide novel insights into homoterpene biosynthesis in C. sinensis and demonstrate the effect of homoterpenes on ACP behavior, laying a foundation to genetically manipulate homoterpene biosynthesis for application in huanglongbing and ACP control.

AB  - Acetylated diacylglycerol 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-3-acetyl-rac-glycerol (PLAG) is a lipid molecule from the antlers of sika deer that might reduce inflammation by effectively controlling neutrophil infiltration, endothelial permeability and inflammatory chemokine production. Therefore, we evaluated the modulatory effect of PLAG on arthritis and interstitial lung disease (ILD) in an autoimmune arthritis model. We injected curdlan into SKG mice and PLAG was orally administered every day from 3 weeks to 20 weeks after the curdlan injection. The arthritis score was measured every week after the curdlan injection. At 20 weeks post-injection, the lung specimens were evaluated with H&E, Masson's trichrome and multiplexed immunofluorescent staining. Serum cytokines were also analyzed using a Luminex multiple cytokine assay. PLAG administration decreased the arthritis score until 8 weeks after the curdlan injection. However, the effect was not sustained thereafter. A lung histology revealed severe inflammation and fibrosis in the curdlan-induced SKG mice, which was attenuated in the PLAG-treated mice. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining of the lung tissue showed a GM-CSF+ neutrophil accumulation and a decreased citrullinated histone 3 expression after PLAG treatment. PLAG also downregulated the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha and upregulated the level of sIL-7R alpha, an anti-fibrotic molecule. Our results indicate that PLAG might have a preventative effect on ILD development through the resolution of NETosis in the lung.

AB  - In the modern scientific community, considerable attention is given to studying the pharmacological activity of catechin and anthocyanin derivatives. However, a comparative analysis of the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of extracts rich in anthocyanins and catechins has not been previously conducted. So, the purpose of this work was to study and compare phytochemical composition, antimicrobial and antioxidant potential of Vaccinium macrocarpon L., Ericaceae fruit thick and Camellia sinensis L., Theaceae leaf liquid extracts. The quantification of biologically active substances (BAS) was accomplished with spectrophotometric, titrimetric and HPLC methods of analysis; antioxidant activity was determined by the potentiometric method; antimicrobial and anti-fungi effects was evaluated by the well method and minimum inhibition concentration. The total content of phenolic compounds was 0.47% and 10.10%, organic acids - 4.27% and 1.60% for V. macrocarpon fruit thick and C. sinensis leaf extract. The total content of catechins in the C. sinensis leaf extract was 105,000 mg/kg, where epicatechin-3-O-gallate dominated (37300 mg/kg). The total content of anthocyanins in the V. macrocarpon fruit thick extract was 1280 mg/kg, where peonidin-3-Ogalactoside dominated (408 mg/kg). Both extracts possessed a high antioxidant potential, and effective antimicrobial and anti-fungi effects. The antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-fungi activity of V. macrocarpon fruit extract was higher than C. sinensis leaf extract. In addition, we assumed that anthocyanins had higher antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-fungi properties than catechins. These findings would promote application of V. macrocarpon fruits extract as pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals.

AB  - Epidemiological studies indicate that the consumption of caffeine, the most commonly ingested psychoactive substance found in coffee, tea or soft drinks, reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous treatment studies with transgenic AD mouse models reported a reduced amyloid plaque load and an amelioration of behavioral deficits. It has been further shown that moderate doses of caffeine have the potential to attenuate the health burden in preclinical mouse models of a variety of brain disorders (reviewed in Cunha in J Neurochem 139:1019-1055, 2016). In the current study, we assessed whether long-term caffeine consumption affected hippocampal neuron loss and associated behavioral deficits in the Tg4-42 mouse model of AD. Treatment over a 4-month period reduced hippocampal neuron loss, rescued learning and memory deficits, and ameliorated impaired neurogenesis. Neuron-specific RNA sequencing analysis in the hippocampus revealed an altered expression profile distinguished by the up-regulation of genes linked to synaptic function and processes, and to neural progenitor proliferation. Treatment of 5xFAD mice, which develop prominent amyloid pathology, with the same paradigm also rescued behavioral deficits but did not affect extracellular amyloid-beta (A beta) levels or amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. These findings challenge previous assumptions that caffeine is anti-amyloidogenic and indicate that the promotion of neurogenesis might play a role in its beneficial effects.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of collagenase and two final dimethylformamide (DMF) concentrations (4% and 7%) on alpaca frozen-thawed sperm quality. A total of 25 ejaculates from 5 alpaca were obtained using electroejaculation. Each individual ejaculate was evaluated and then diluted 4:1 in a solution of 1 mg/ml collagenase in HEPES-TALP medium and incubated for 4 min at 37 degrees C. Subsequently, samples were diluted in TRIS-fructose-citric acid-egg yolk and cooled to 5 degrees C. Then, each sample was divided in two aliquots and DMF at final concentration of 4% or 7% was added, equilibrated for 1 hr at 5 degrees C and frozen over liquid nitrogen vapours. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to evaluate the sperm morphometry, and Completely Random Block designs were used to analyse sperm motility, viability, membrane function and acrosome status. After collagenase incubation, none of the samples showed thread formation, and sperm parameters were preserved. Non-progressive motile sperm were higher (p < .05) in equilibrated samples (4% DMF: 31.8 +/- 8.3% and 7% DMF: 36.3 +/- 11.8%) compared to raw (10.1 +/- 4.3%) and frozen-thawed semen (4% DMF: 9.7 +/- 1.8% and 7% DMF: 7.5 +/- 3.2%). Sperm membrane function, membrane integrity and intact acrosomes were higher (p < .05) in raw semen (40.1 +/- 12.2%, 94.6 +/- 3.2% and 91.3 +/- 8.1%) compared to frozen-thawed samples (4% DMF: 19.8 +/- 4.7%, 53.2 +/- 2.7%, 65.7 +/- 8.7% and 7% DMF: 20.4 +/- 4.5%, 54.1 +/- 1.4%, 64.6 +/- 9.1%). Length of the sperm head was lower in frozen-thawed samples, being statistically different with 4% DMF compared to pre-freezing samples. The ratio between acrosome and head areas was greater (p < .05) in frozen-thawed samples. Incubation of raw alpaca semen with collagenase decreased the thread formation without affecting sperm quality. Frozen of collagenase treated alpaca semen with 4% or 7% DMF did not preserve the sperm parameters in thawed samples.

AB  - Enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains crucial. Understanding the genes involved in cancer progression and targeted therapies may be beneficial for TNBC chemotherapy. Here, bioinformatics analysis revealed that AKT1 and the key gene of homologous recombination (HR), RAD51, were significantly upregulated in breast cancer. Meanwhile, we discovered that epirubicin (Epi) could activate AKT and HR pathways in MDA-MB-231 cells. Pharmacological inhibition of AKT or siAKT could reverse the activation of AKT and HR pathways and sensitize Epi. Hence, we sought natural products that could inhibit both AKT and HR pathways to enhance the sensitivity of Epi and expanded its therapeutic effects in TNBC. 2(3-methoxy-2-deethoxyphantomolin (EM2) is a natural sesquiterpene lactone extracted from Elephantopus mollis with strong anticancer activity. We found that EM2 induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells by inhibiting AKT and HR pathways. Mechanistically, EM2 impaired transcription of AKT, directly bound to RAD51 protein, and facilitated the degradation of AKT and RAD51 in a caspase-dependent manner. Importantly, we determined that EM2 in combination with Epi treatment exhibited a synergistic anti-tumor effect in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, overexpression of AKT could prevent EM2 from sensitizing Epi. The results of MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor model confirmed that EM2 could reduce the dose of Epi and achieve anti-TNBC effect in vivo without toxicity to mice tissues. Overall, our work indicates EM2 in combination with Epi can greatly expand the therapeutic effect of Epi in TNBC, underscoring targeting AKT and RAD51 as a promising approach for TNBC chemotherapy sensitization.

AB  - Human umbilical cord lining epithelial cells [CLECs) are naive in nature and can be ethically recovered from cords that are routinely discarded. The success of using oral mucosal epithelial cells for cornea defects hints at the feasibility of treating cutaneous wounds using non-native CLECs. Herein, we characterized CLECs using flow cytometry (FC) and skin organotypic cultures in direct comparison with skin keratinocytes (KCs). This was followed by wound healing study to compare the effects of CLEC application and the traditional use of human skin allografts (HSGs) in a porcine wound model. While CLECs were found to express all the epidermal cell markers probed, the major difference between CLECs and KCs lies in the level of expression (in FC analysis) as well as in the location of expression (of the epithelium in organotypic cultures) of some of the basal cell markers probed. On the pig wounds, CLEC application promoted accelerated healing with no adverse reaction compared to HSG use. Though CLECs, like HSGs, elicited high levels of local and systemic immune responses in the animals during the first week, these effects were tapered off more quickly in the CLEC-treated group. Overall, the in vivo porcine data point to the potential of CLECs as a non-native and safe source of cells to treat cutaneous wounds.

AB  - We introduce DHARANI, the first online platform with three-dimensional (3D) histological reconstructions of the developing human brain from 14 to 24 gestational weeks (GW) across the five fetal brains. DHARANI features 5132 Nissl, hematoxylin and eosin stained, 20 mu m coronal and sagittal sections, postmortem MRI, and a neuroanatomical atlas with 466 annotated sections covering similar to 500 brain structures. It is accessible online at . The 3D reconstruction enables a volumetric view of the fetal brain, allowing visualization in all three planes akin to MRI, previously unachievable with histological datasets from the fetal brain. This allowed qualitative assessment of the growth of brain regions and layers throughout the second trimester. "DHARANI" documents the initiation of sulci, with the lateral fissure, calcarine, parieto-occipital, and cingulate sulci, at 14 GW. The central and postcentral sulci appear by 24 GW; however, cytoarchitectonic boundaries become visible before sulcal patterns. Cortical plate (CP) lamination begins at 24 GW in the parietal and occipital cortices. The frontal cortex lacks lamination at 24 GW, although putative Betz cells are already visible and show early patterning in the intermediate zone. The cell-sparse layer between the CP and subplate, containing late migratory neurons, begins in the orbital cortex at 14 GW and reaches the frontal cortex by 17 GW. The appearance of the honeycomb pattern in the occipital and parietal cortex occurs after 14 GW. Additionally, we describe the development of the thalamic pregeniculate with the rotation of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Cerebellar nuclei and an early Purkinje cell layer appear by 21 GW in the already foliated cerebellar cortex.

AB  - Background: Disease-modifying treatments with anti-epileptic effects are currently unavailable and urgently required for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Combined therapy targeting multiple mechanisms may offer a promising anti-epileptic strategy, given the complex processes underlying epileptogenesis. Purpose: This study evaluates the effects of Edaravone Dexbroneol, a combination of Edaravone and Dexborneol in 4:1, on rat and mouse TLE models and an in vitro epileptiform activity model. Methods: The Pilocarpine-induced rat TLE model and the Kainic acid-induced mouse TLE model were used to assess the in vivo effect of Edaravone and/or Dexbornel. Primary neurons were utilized to evaluate the in vitro effect of drugs using calcium imaging, electrophysiological and biochemical analyses, as well as RNA sequencing. Results: Treatment of Edaravone Dexbornel during the latent period significantly alleviated epileptic seizures in rodents, mitigated cognitive impairment, and inhibited neuronal loss and astrocytic activation. In vitro, Edaravone Dexborneol inhibited the action potentials and protected primary hippocampal neurons from Mg2+-freeinduced neurite injury. All these effects were significantly more pronounced in the group treated with the Edaravone Dexborneol mixture compared to either drug used individually. Furthermore, Edaravone can significantly inhibit Mg2+-free-induced calcium oscillations in primary neurons, probably by promoting the deactivation of NMDA receptors. RNA sequencing and RT-PCR analysis revealed that synergetic regulation of lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and calcium signaling probably underlay the neuroprotective effect of Edaravone Dexbornel on epileptic neurons. Conclusion: Edaravone Dexborneol exhibits antiepileptic effects and may fill the gap in disease-modifying treatments for TLE.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the combination effects of alpha-glycerol monolaurate (GML) and glyceryl tributyrate (TB) on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, gut microbiota, and immune function in weaned piglets. A total of 120 weaned piglets with an average body weight (BW) of 6.88 kg were randomly allocated to one of the three dietary treatments: (1) CON: a basal diet; (2) 0.1%: a basal diet with 0.1% MSCFA (GML/TB = 1:1); (3) 0.2%: a basal diet with 0.2% MSCFA (GML/TB = 1:1). The experiment lasted 28 days. There were no differences on average daily growth (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Supplementation with 0.1% MSCFA increased apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of crude protein (CP) and gross energy (GE, p < 0.05) on d 14 and increased GE (p < 0.05) on d 28 compared with the CON group. The ATTD of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP) of piglets supplemented with 0.1% MSCFA was higher (p < 0.05). Compared with the CON group, supplementation with 0.1% MSCFA increased immunoglobulin M (IgM) concentration, decreased interleukin-6 (IL-6) content (p < 0.05) on d 14 and decreased malonaldehyde (MDA), interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6 concentrations (p < 0.05) on d 28. Supplementation with 0.1% MSCFA increased total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) concentration (p < 0.05), decreased GSH-Px, MDA content (p < 0.05) in jejunum compared with the CON group. Moreover, supplementation with MSCFA increased the activity of duodenal lipase (p < 0.05) and the abundance of firmicutes and decreased the abundance of proteobacteria compared with the CON group. Overall, supplementation with MSCFA can improve nutrient digestibility, enhance immunity and antioxidant capacity, and improve the intestinal health of piglets. The combined use of MSCFA is a nutrition regulation strategy worthy of further exploration in modern animal husbandry.

AB  - The bat coronaviruses (CoV) BANAL-20-52 and BANAL-20-236 are two newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) closely related coronaviruses (SC2r-CoV) and the genome of BANAL-20-52 shares the highest homology with SARS-CoV-2. However, the risk of their potential zoonotic transmission has not been fully evaluated. Here, we determined their potential host susceptibility among 13 different bat species and 26 different animal species, and found that both might have extensive host ranges, indicating high zoonotic transmission potential. We also determined the cryo-EM structures of BANAL-20-52 and BANAL-20-236 S proteins at pH 5.5 and the complex of BANAL-20-236 S1 and Rhinolophus affinis ACE2, and found that both trimeric S proteins adopt all three receptor binding domains (RBDs) in "closed" conformation and are more compact than SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, the unique sugar moiety at N370 of bat SC2r-CoVs acts like a "bolt" and crosses over two neighboring subunits, facilitating the S proteins in the locked conformation and underpinning the architecture stability. Removal of the glycosylation at N370 by a T372A substitution substantially enhances virus infectivity but becomes highly sensitive to trypsin digestion at pH 5.5, a condition roughly mimicking the insectivorous bat's stomach digestion. In contrast, WT S proteins of SC2r-CoVs showed considerable resistance to trypsin digestion at pH 5.5, indicating that the highly conserved T372 in bat CoVs might result from the selective advantages in stability during the fecal-oral transmission over A372. Moreover, the results of cross-immunogenicity among S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, BANAL-20-52, and BANAL-20-236 showed that A372 pseudoviruses are more sensitive to anti-S sera than T372, indicating that immune evasion might also play a role in the natural selection of T372 over A372 during evolution. Finally, residues 493 and 498 of the S protein affect host susceptibility, and residue 498 also influences the immunogenicity of the S protein. Together, our findings aid a better understanding of the molecular basis of CoV entry, selective evolution, and immunogenicity and highlight the importance of surveillance of susceptible hosts of these viruses to prevent potential outbreaks.

AB  - Invasive inflammation and excessive scar formation are the main reasons for the difficulty in repairing nervous tissue after spinal cord injury. Microglia and astrocytes play key roles in the spinal cord injury micro-environment and share a close interaction. However, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. In this study, we found that after spinal cord injury, resting microglia (M0) were polarized into pro-inflammatory phenotypes (MG1 and MG3), while resting astrocytes were polarized into reactive and scar-forming phenotypes. The expression of growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) and its receptor Axl were significantly down-regulated in microglia and astrocytes after spinal cord injury. In vitro experiments showed that Gas6 had negative effects on the polarization of reactive astrocytes and pro-inflammatory microglia, and even inhibited the cross-regulation between them. We further demonstrated that Gas6 can inhibit the polarization of reactive astrocytes by suppressing the activation of the Yes-associated protein signaling pathway. This, in turn, inhibited the polarization of pro-inflammatory microglia by suppressing the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B/p65 and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathways. In vivo experiments showed that Gas6 inhibited the polarization of pro-inflammatory microglia and reactive astrocytes in the injured spinal cord, thereby promoting tissue repair and motor function recovery. Overall, Gas6 may play a role in the treatment of spinal cord injury. It can inhibit the inflammatory pathway of microglia and polarization of astrocytes, attenuate the interaction between microglia and astrocytes in the inflammatory microenvironment, and thereby alleviate local inflammation and reduce scar formation in the spinal cord.

AB  - Ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF-MRI) is capable of unraveling anatomical structures in a sub millimeter range. In addition, its high resonance regime allows the quantification of constitutive molecules in a spatially sensitive manner, a crucial capability for determining the extent and localization of a probable epileptogenic region or the severity of the epilepsy. The main technical challenges for data acquisition under UHF are to produce a strong, homogeneous transverse field, while keeping the tissue power deposition within the safe regulatory guidelines. The nonuniformities caused by destructive and constructive interferences at UHFs required new technologies to accelerate and increase yield regarding time spent and quality achieved. Image quality is the paramount contribution of UHF high-resolution imaging, which is capable to disclose fine details of the hippocampal formation and its surroundings and their changes in the course of epilepsy. Other sequences like diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and multiecho susceptibility imaging at 7 Tin vivo can assist the creation of normative atlases of the hippocampal subfields or the reconstruction of the highly arborized cerebral blood vessels. In our review, we specify the impact of these advanced relevant techniques onto the study of epilepsy. In this context, we focused onto high field high-resolution scanners and clinically-enriched decision-making. Studies on focal dysplasias correlating ex vivo high-resolution imaging with specific histological and ultrastructural patterns showed that white matter hyperintensities were related to a demyelination process and other alterations. Preliminary results correlating thick serial sections through bioptic epileptogenic tissue could extend the strategy to localize degenerated tissue sectors, correlate nature and extent of tissue loss with preoperative diagnosis and postoperative outcome. Finally, this protocol will provide the neurosurgeon with a detailed depiction of the removed pathologic tissue and possible adverse effects by the pathologic tissue left in situ. .

AB  - Background Conidiobolomycosis is a rare tropical rhinofacial fungal infection which has not been well characterised. The available evidence in its management is sparse due to lack of clinical studies and the limited data on antifungal susceptibility patterns.
   Objective To analyse the clinical manifestations, antifungal treatment and outcomes of patients with conidiobolomycosis and to determine antifungal susceptibility profiles of the isolates.
   Patients/methods Retrospective analysis of data of all patients with a diagnosis of conidiobolomycosis confirmed by histopathology and culture at a tertiary care hospital from 2012 to 2019 was done.
   Results There were 22 patients, 21 males and one female, with a mean age of 37.1 years. Most common presenting symptom was nasal obstruction, found in 20 (90.90%) patients. Patients who presented within 12 months had a better cure rate (85%) compared to those who presented late (67%). Among the 19 patients who had a follow-up, good outcome was seen in 15 of the 17 (88.24%) patients who were on itraconazole or potassium iodide containing regimen. Of the six patients who received additional trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole), 67% showed good outcome with two patients showing complete cure and two patients still on treatment with significant improvement. High minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were noted for azoles and amphotericin B, whereas co-trimoxazole showed lowest MIC ranges.
   Conclusion Itraconazole and potassium iodide are reasonable first-line options for the treatment of conidiobolomycosis. Good clinical response to KI and comparatively lower MIC of co-trimoxazole are promising. Further studies are required for developing clinical breakpoints that can predict therapeutic outcomes.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is common among stroke survivors and negatively impacts recovery. Chaihu-Shugan-San (CSS), a traditional Chinese medicine, has shown therapeutic potential for mood disorders, particularly PSD. Recent studies suggest that CSS's effects may be mediated by exosomes, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Aim of study: This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of CSS on PSD in mice and investigate the underlying mechanisms, particularly the role of exosomes. Materials and methods: Active compounds in CSS were identified from rat serum using liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LC-MS) and analyzed through network pharmacology. In vitro, an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) BV2 microglia model was used to assess the effects of CSS-containing serum (CSS-S). Exosomes from OGD/R-treated BV2 microglia were isolated, labeled with PKH26, and analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). In vivo, a photothrombotic stroke (PT) model combined with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was used to induce PSD in mice. Behavioral assessments and histological analysis were performed, along with immunofluorescence (IF), ELISA and q-PCR to measure key protein and miR-146 expression in the hippocampus. Results: CSS treatment significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors in the PSD mouse model. Mice treated with high-dose CSS (4.2 g/kg) exhibited increased sucrose preference, reduced immobility in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST), and enhanced exploratory activity in the open field test (OFT). Histological analysis demonstrated that CSS treatment improved brain tissue integrity, alleviating neuronal damage and reducing neuroinflammation. Exosome analysis revealed that CSS increased the expression of microglia-derived exosomes in the hippocampus, which were shown to carry miR-146. Further examination of miR-146 isoforms in the hippocampal tissue revealed significant changes: miR-146b-3p and miR-146a-5p were upregulated, while miR-146a-3p and miR-146b-5p were downregulated in PSD mice. Treatment with CSS reversed the altered miRNA expression, indicating a potential mechanism for its neuroprotective effects. Additionally, CSS treatment reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as S100A8, IL1 beta , IL6, and TNF-alpha, while restoring the levels of angiogenic factors VEGFC and VEGFR3. ELISA measurements showed significant decreases in cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 5hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and noradrenaline (NE) in PSD mice; high-dose CSS notably elevated CREB and BDNF levels and showed comparable effects to fluoxetine in restoring 5-HT and DA levels. Additionally, the calcium signaling pathway was implicated, with altered mRNA expressions of CaMKII alpha, CREB, phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB), PDE4D, and BDNF, although fluoxetine demonstrated stronger modulatory effects than CSS. Conclusions: CSS alleviates PSD in mice by modulating exosome-mediated signaling, particularly through the regulation of miR-146. The treatment reversed abnormal miRNA expression, reduced neuroinflammation, and improved synaptic function. These findings highlight CSS's potential as an effective therapeutic strategy for PSD by targeting exosome-mediated neuroprotection and miR-146 regulation.

AB  - The current treatment for symptomatic gallstones is primarily surgical, where one of the most general surgeries, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, is the excision of the gallbladder to remove gallstones. However, postoperative site infections are a common health risk. As a result, scientists are investigating non-invasive methods to crush gallstones, but to date there are limited reports on such approaches. Herein, we propose a non-invasive lithotripsy method that uses ferromagnetic, spiny, flexible, and wireless medical robots, that can be taken orally into the human body bio-safely, to achieve efficient crushing of human gallstones. After operating for 30 minutes, a human gallstone of about 1 cm in diameter had been crushed into a pile of powdered gallstone residue by three soft gallstone-crushing robots in a pig gallbladder. The work highlights that our designed soft robot provides a promising pathway for non-invasive treatment of human gallstones disease, which brings new insights for future advancement of soft medical robots.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as a new class of important regulators of signal transduction in tissue homeostasis and cancer development. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) occurs in a wide range of biological processes, while its role in signal transduction remains largely undeciphered. In this study, we uncovered a lipid-associated lncRNA, small nucleolar RNA host gene 9 (SNHG9) as a tumor-promoting lncRNA driving liquid droplet formation of Large Tumor Suppressor Kinase 1 (LATS1) and inhibiting the Hippo pathway. Mechanistically, SNHG9 and its associated phosphatidic acids (PA) interact with the C-terminal domain of LATS1, promoting LATS1 phase separation and inhibiting LATS1-mediated YAP phosphorylation. Loss of SNHG9 suppresses xenograft breast tumor growth. Clinically, expression of SNHG9 positively correlates with YAP activity and breast cancer progression. Taken together, our results uncover a novel regulatory role of a tumor-promoting lncRNA (i.e., SNHG9) in signal transduction and cancer development by facilitating the LLPS of a signaling kinase (i.e., LATS1).

AB  - The members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family of cell signaling polypeptides have garnered a great deal of interest due to its capacity from nematodes to mammals to regulate cell-based activities which control the growth of embryos and sustain tissue homeostasis. The current study designed a computational analysis of the TGF-beta protein family for understanding these proteins at the molecular level. This study determined the genomic structure of TGF-beta gene family in Nile tilapia for the first time. We chose 33 TGF-beta genes for identification and divided them into two subgroups, TGF-like and BMP-like. Moreover, the subcellular localization of the Nile tilapia TGF-beta proteins have showed that majority of the members of TGF-beta proteins family are present into extracellular matrix and plasma except BMP6, BMP7, and INHAC. All TGF-beta proteins were thermostable excluding BMP1. Each protein exhibited basic nature, excluding of BMP1, BMP2, BMP7, BMP10, GDF2, GDF8, GDF11, AMH, INHA, INHBB, and NODAL M. All proteins gave impression of being unstable depending on the instability index, having values exceeding 40 excluding BMP1 and BMP2. Each TGF-beta protein was found to be hydrophobic with lowered values of GRAVY. Moreover, every single one of the discovered TGF-beta genes had a consistent evolutionary pattern. The TGF-beta gene family had eight segmental duplications, and the Ka/Ks ratio demonstrated that purifying selection had an impact on the duplicated gene pairs which have experienced selection pressure. This study highlights important functionality of TGF-beta and depicts the demand for further investigation to better understand the role and mechanism of transforming growth factor beta in fishes and other species.

AB  - Background: Lead contamination is a major public health concern. Previous studies have demonstrated that lead exposure could affect the hippocampus, which is a complex and heterogeneous structure composed of 12 subregions. Here, we explored volumetric and functional changes in hippocampal subfields and neuropsychological alterations after lead exposure. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study at a smelting company between September 2020 and December 2021. Blood lead level was recorded, and neuropsychological functions were assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). The hippocampus was segmented into 12 subfields in each hemisphere in magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Then, the effect of altered hippocampal subfield volumes on brain functions were studied by seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis. Finally, the relationships between the lead level with hippocampal subfield volumes and neuropsychological functions were investigated. Baseline characteristics, hippocampal subfield volumes, and FC analysis were compared between lead-exposed (>= 300 mu g/L) and the control group (<= 100 mu g/L). Results: In 76 participants, lead level positively correlated with SDS(r = 0.422) and negatively correlated with MoCA(r = - 0.414), MMSE(r = - 0.251), Concentration(r = - 0.331), Recall(r = - 0.319), Orientation(r = -0.298) and Executive Function/Visuospatial abilities(r = - 0.231). Lead group (26 participants) had lower MoCA and MMSE and higher SDS than control group (23 participants). A significantly decreased volume in the left CA4 and GC-ML-DG subfields was found in the lead group compared with the control group. The left GC-MLDG of the lead group showed a decreased FC with the bilateral postcentral gyrus. The left CA4(r = - 0.409) and left GC-ML-DG (r = - 0.383) volumes negatively correlated with lead level. The FC between left GC-ML-DG and left postcentral gyrus positively correlated with MoCA(r = 0.318), MMSE(r = 0.379) and Recall(r = 0.311). The FC between left GC-ML-DG and right postcentral gyrus positively correlated with MoCA(r = 0.326), Executive Function/Visuospatial abilities(r = 0.307) and Concentration(r = 0.297). Conclusion: High blood lead level was associated with neuropsychological alterations, hippocampal structural and functional changes. The left GC-ML-DG and CA4 atrophy might serve as predictive imaging markers for neurological damage associated with high lead exposure.

AB  - This study aimed to synthesize phenytoin (PHT)-loaded water chestnut starch-based biomaterials and evaluate their drug release kinetics for use in transdermal drug delivery systems for antiepileptic therapy. Hierarchical microparticles (HMPs) extracted from human hair were also used to improve the PHT release efficiency. The physicochemical characteristics of PHT, HMPs, and the prepared biomaterials were evaluated by physical properties, antimicrobial activities, FE-SEM, FT-IR, XRD, 1H NMR, and 13C CPMAS solid-state NMR. The photothermal effect and the PHT release profile were confirmed through 808 nm NIR laser irradiation. After 30 min of the laser exposure, the temperature of the HMP-added biomaterials increased by 1.50-1.59 times compared to that of without the HMPs. PHT release in buffers and artificial skin test under NIR laser irradiation enhanced by 1.20-1.85 times owing to the photothermal effect. The release kinetics in pH buffer and artificial skin were determined using the Fickian diffusion and Korsmeyer-Peppas models. Additionally, to verify the transdermal penetration of PHT, drug-release simulations were conducted using rhodamine B in agar blocks and pig ears. The results implied that the photothermal effect of the HMPs enhanced the penetration of the drug.

AB  - Background The sudden surge of mucormycosis cases which happened during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic was a significant public health problem in India. Objectives The aim of this study was to analyse the clinico-epidemicological characteristics of the mucormycosis cases to determine the changes that had occurred due to COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India. Patients diagnosed with rhino-orbital mucormycosis were categorised into the following groups: Pre-pandemic(May 2019 to April 2020), Pandemic Pre-epidemic (May 2020 to April 2021) and Epidemic (1 May 2021 to 12 July 2021). The epidemiological, clinical and surgical data of all the patients were retrieved from the hospital records and analysed. Results The epidemic period had 370 cases, compared with 65 during pandemic period and 42 in the pre-pandemic period. Diabetes mellitus was seen in 87% of cases during epidemic period, 92.9% in the pre-pandemic period and 90.8% in the pre-pandemic pre-epidemic period. The proportion of patients suffering from vision loss, restricted extra-ocular movements, palatal ulcer and nasal obstruction was higher in the pre-epidemic groups, and the difference was significant (p, <.01). There was no history of oxygen use in 85.9% of patients and no steroid use in 76.5%. The death rates were the lowest during epidemic (10%). Conclusion COVID-19 has caused a statistically significant increase in the number of mucormycosis infections. The mortality and morbidity which showed an increase during the first wave of COVID-19 decreased significantly during the epidemic period.

AB  - The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-37 (IL-37) belongs to the IL-1 family but is not expressed in mice. We used a human IL-37 (hIL-37tg) expressing mouse, which has been subjected to various models of local and systemic inflammation as well as immunological challenges. Previous studies reveal an immunomodulatory role of IL-37, which can be characterized as an important suppressor of innate immunity. Here, we examined the functions of IL-37 in the central nervous system and explored the effects of IL-37 on neuronal architecture and function, microglial phenotype, cytokine production and behavior after inflammatory challenge by intraperitoneal LPS-injection. In wild-type mice, decreased spine density, activated microglial phenotype and impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) were observed after LPS injection, whereas hIL-37tg mice showed no impairment. In addition, we crossed the hIL-37tg mouse with an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (APP/PS1) to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-37 under chronic neuroinflammatory conditions. Our results show that expression of IL-37 is able to limit inflammation in the brain after acute inflammatory events and prevent loss of cognitive abilities in a mouse model of AD.

AB  - Arsenic pollution in groundwater remains a serious public health concern around the world. Recent years, arsenic-related neurological and psychiatric disorders have been reported increasingly. However, the exact mechanisms of it remains elusive. In this study, arsenic exposure through drinking water resulted in depression-/ anxiety-like behaviors in mice accompanied by oxidative stress and NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, two main affected areas found in neurobehavioral disorders. Intervention by NAC, a ROS scavenger, diminished the social behavior impairments in mice as well as ROS generation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Further study revealed that it was p38 MAPK signaling pathway that mediated ROS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Overall, our findings suggested that ROS/p38 MAPK/NLRP3 inflammasome cascade was involved in arsenicinduced depression-/anxiety-disorders. Furthermore, NAC might be a potential therapeutic agent for arsenicinduced depression-/anxiety-disorders by inhibiting both ROS generation and ROS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are intensively investigated for their therapeutic potential and application as drug delivery vehicle. A broad perception of favourable safety profiles and low immunogenicity make EVs an attractive alternative to synthetic nanoparticles. We recently showed that repeated intravenous administration of human cell-derived EVs into pig-tailed macaques unexpectedly elicited antibody responses after three or more injections. This coincided with decreasing EV circulation time, and may thus hamper successful EV-mediated cargo delivery into tissues. Here, we share the custom ELISA protocol that we used to measure such antibody responses. This protocol may help other researchers evaluate immune responses to EV-based therapies in preclinical studies.

AB  - Simple Summary The agouti (Dasyprocta leporina) is a neo-tropical rodent that has the potential to be domesticated. These animals are considered to be omnivores from studies conducted in the wild and in captivity. However, an in-depth morphometric and histometric analysis of the gastrointestinal tract of this animal was never conducted. Thus, the objective of this paper was to give a quantitative analysis of the gastrointestinal tract of the agouti and relate it to the feeding habits of the animals. This study showed that the agouti had an esophagus which was lined with keratinized epithelium and esophageal glands. The stomach was simple, with well-developed gastric glands, and the small intestines accounted for the majority of the animal's digestive tract in length. The long cecum and well-developed colon indicated that this animal had the ability to digest fibrous material in the diet. Based on the analysis of the gastrointestinal tract, these animals can be fed a dry omnivorous diet, with protein sources from either vegetation or animal matter. The morphology of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) is a strong indicator of a species' dietary habits. The objective of this study was to describe and quantitatively analyze the gross and microanatomy of the digestive tract of the orange/red-rumped agouti (Dasyprocta leporina) and relate it to the feeding habits of this animal. The digestive tracts of six adult males were used for this study. The results showed that the esophagus was thick (mean thickness of 1023.78 +/- 28.97 mu m) and lined by keratinized epithelium with scant esophageal glands. Mucosa-associated lymphocytic infiltration was robust throughout the GI tract. These findings suggest that the esophagus was well adapted to a coarse diet. The simple stomach with well-developed gastric glands in the fundus region (mean thickness of 605.39 +/- 28.68 mu m) was indicative of an adaptation to a carnivorous diet. The small intestine constituted approximately 80% of the length of the GI tract. The remarkable development of the jejunum with a greater villus length (mean thickness of 182.50 +/- 27.38 mu m) indicated a greater absorptive capacity in frugivorous and carnivorous diets. The long cecum and well-developed colon clearly indicated that the GI tract was well adapted to frugivorous and herbivorous diets. Overall, D. leporina showed that it is well adapted to an omnivorous diet. These results suggest that D. leporina can be fed a balanced omnivorous dry diet with a high protein content of plant or animal origin that is well suited to the architecture of the GI tract in captivity.

AB  - Chronic alcoholism is known to have detrimental effects on the brain, including cognitive impairment, neurotransmitter imbalances, and brain atrophy. The hippocampus, crucial for spatial memory and cognitive functions, is particularly susceptible to alcohol-induced changes. Photobiomodulation (PBM), a non-invasive therapeutic method that utilizes red or near-infrared light, has shown promising applications in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Near-infrared (NIR) light, in particular, has been shown to prevent apoptosis, and neuroinflammation, as well as to improve cognitive functions. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether 830-nm laser irradiation could mitigate cognitive deficits in a chronic alcohol mouse model. Chronic alcoholism was induced in C57BL/6 mice through continuous ethanol gavage for 4 weeks at a dosage of 5 g/kg/day. Gavaging was performed 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Mice were transcranial irradiated by 830-nm laser, following making a chronic alcohol mouse model. Laser irradiation (50 mW/cm2) was performed 5 times per week for 3 weeks. To verify memory and cognitive defeats of a chronic alcohol mouse model, we performed animal behavior tasks such as Morris water maze, Y maze, and novel objective recognition. Our results confirmed the cognitive impairment in the chronic alcohol mouse model compared to the control group in conducted tasks. However, cognitive and spatial memory significantly improved following 830-nm laser irradiation. Additionally, we confirmed whether the behavior tasks result from histological changes. We performed immunofluorescence staining in the hippocampus region (CA3, CA1 and hilus) using astrocyte (GFAP) and microglia (Iba1) markers. As a result, reactive astrocyte was significantly increased in the chronic alcohol mouse model compared to control mice, whereas the number of GFAP-positive cells was significantly reduced by 830-nm laser irradiation. These findings indicate that chronic alcohol exposure induces spatial memory and cognitive impairment, which can be effectively rescued through near-infrared laser irradiation.

AB  - (1) Background: The wheat curl mite (Aceria tosichella Keifer) is a key pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. While a number of wheat cultivars resistant to the mites have been employed to minimize the impact on the yield and quality of grain, little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying host plant resistance. Therefore, the goal of this study was to explore changes in transcriptome of resistant and susceptible wheat in order to quantify the molecular changes that drive host plant resistance. (2) Methods: Two varieties, wheat curl mite-susceptible (Karl 92) and wheat curl mite-resistant (TAM112) wheat, both at 2-week postemergence, were used in this study. Half of the plants were exposed to wheat curl mite herbivory and half remained mite-free and served as controls. Transcriptome changes were quantified using RNA-seq and compared among treatments to identify genes and pathways affected by herbivores. (3) Results: We identified a number of genes and pathways involved in plant defenses against pathogens, herbivores, and abiotic stress that were differentially expressed in the resistant wheat exposed to wheat curl mite herbivory but were unaffected in the susceptible wheat. (4) Conclusions: Our outcomes indicated that resistant wheat counteracts wheat curl mite exposure through effective induction of genes and pathways that enhance its defense responses.

AB  - The granular retrosplenial cortex (gRSC) exhibits high -frequency oscillations (HFOs; - 150 Hz), which can be driven by a hippocampus-subiculum pathway. How the cellular -synaptic and laminar organization of gRSC facilitates HFOs is unknown. Here, we probe gRSC HFO generation and coupling with hippocampal rhythms using focal optogenetics and silicon -probe recordings in behaving mice. ChR2-mediated excitation of CaMKII-expressing cells in L2/3 or L5 induces HFOs, but spontaneous HFOs are found only in L2/3, where HFO power is highest. HFOs couple to CA1 sharp wave -ripples (SPW-Rs) during rest and the descending phase of theta. gRSC HFO current sources and sinks are the same for events during both SPW-Rs and theta oscillations. Independent component analysis shows that high gamma (50-100 Hz) in CA1 stratum lacunosum moleculare is comodulated with HFO power. HFOs may thus facilitate interregional communication of a multisynaptic loop between the gRSC, hippocampus, and medial entorhinal cortex during distinct brain and behavioral states.

AB  - Gaucher disease (GD) has been increasingly recognized as a continuum of phenotypes with variable neurological and sensory involvement. No study has yet specifically explored the spectrum of neuropsychiatric and sensory abnormalities in GD patients through a multidisciplinary approach. Abnormalities involving the nervous system, including sensory abnormalities, cognitive disturbances, and psychiatric comorbidities, have been identified in GD1 and GD3 patients. In this prospective study, named SENOPRO, we performed neurological, neuroradiological, neuropsychological, ophthalmological, and hearing assessments in 22 GD patients: 19 GD1 and 3 GD3. First, we highlighted a high rate of parkinsonian motor and non-motor symptoms (including high rates of excessive daytime sleepiness), especially in GD1 patients harboring severe glucocerebrosidase variants. Secondly, neuropsychological evaluations revealed a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and psychiatric disturbances, both in patients initially classified as GD1 and GD3. Thirdly, hippocampal brain volume reduction was associated with impaired short- and long-term performance in an episodic memory test. Fourthly, audiometric assessment showed an impaired speech perception in noise in the majority of patients, indicative of an impaired central processing of hearing, associated with high rates of slight hearing loss both in GD1 and GD3 patients. Finally, relevant structural and functional abnormalities along the visual system were found both in GD1 and GD3 patients by means of visual evoked potentials and optical coherence tomography. Overall, our findings support the concept of GD as a spectrum of disease subtypes,and support the importance of in-depth periodic monitoring of cognitive and motor performances, mood, sleep patterns, and sensory abnormalities in all patients with GD, independently from the patient's initial classification.

AB  - Simple Summary Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are considered endangered and their population is in continuous decline. Understanding their social interactions, health, and welfare status has been a topic of intense research in recent decades. Coagulation assessments have been underutilized in wildlife but can give valuable information on individual health. This study aims to increase the knowledge of the coagulation status in healthy Asian elephants from different backgrounds and age groups, using a fast point-of-care analyzer. This tool can be further used in either routine health check-ups performed by caretakers or in a clinical emergency, such as in cases of elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus hemorrhagic disease outbreaks. We have also investigated the presence of genomic mutations in one coagulation factor-factor VII-where a disorder was previously reported in an Asian elephant. Hereby, we report new reference values for coagulation parameters, such as coagulation times and fibrinogen concentration of Asian elephants assessed in Thailand and in Europe, as well as several single point mutations found in the exons of Elephas maximus coagulation F7 gene. We found the point-of-care analyzer used in this study to be very practical and user friendly for a zoo and field environment and hope that this project will incentivize further coagulation studies in Asian elephants and in other wildlife species. The Asian elephant population is continuously declining due to several extrinsic reasons in their range countries, but also due to diseases in captive populations worldwide. One of these diseases, the elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV) hemorrhagic disease, is very impactful because it particularly affects Asian elephant calves. It is commonly fatal and presents as an acute and generalized hemorrhagic syndrome. Therefore, having reference values of coagulation parameters, and obtaining such values for diseased animals in a very short time, is of great importance. We analyzed prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and fibrinogen concentrations using a portable and fast point-of-care analyzer (VetScan Pro) in 127 Asian elephants from Thai camps and European captive herds. We found significantly different PT and aPTT coagulation times between elephants from the two regions, as well as clear differences in fibrinogen concentration. Nevertheless, these alterations were not expected to have biological or clinical implications. We have also sequenced the coagulation factor VII gene of 141 animals to assess the presence of a previously reported hereditary coagulation disorder in Asian elephants and to investigate the presence of other mutations. We did not find the previously reported mutation in our study population. Instead, we discovered the presence of several new single nucleotide polymorphisms, two of them being considered as deleterious by effect prediction software.

AB  - Contrasting with their current ranges in the Antarctic and subantarctic zones, the fossil record reveals that phocids (true and elephant seals) inhabited widespread subtropical regions across the Southern Hemisphere in the geologic past. At least four extinct phocid taxa have been described from Miocene and Pliocene fossiliferous levels in Chile and Peru, constituting two of the taxonomically richest phocid assemblages known. Still, some Chilean remains morphologically differ from those recovered from Peru, suggesting an unprecedented phocid diversity. We examined phocid mandibular remains from the Bahia Inglesa Formation in northern Chile. We identified the occurrence of the long-snouted seal Acrophoca longirostris, a morphologically distinguishable and undescribed form of Acrophoca, and Hadrokirus martini, an extinct phocid with a robust feeding morphology, constituting the first record of this taxon outside Peru. We also recognised four other indeterminate phocids with considerable morphological differences from contemporaneous taxa. Moreover, one of these specimens uniquely combines morphological attributes distinct from all known extant and extinct phocids, likely corresponding to a new taxon. These reports significantly increase the taxonomic and morphological diversities of fossil seals from the eastern South Pacific and emphasise the substantial transformations of phocid assemblages over geologic time.

AB  - In the current study, we aimed to investigate the neurotoxic effect of oral titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) as well as the possible neuroprotective effect of carboxymethyl chitosan in adult rats for 14 days. The results revealed that TiO2 NPs inhibited the activity of the acetylcholine esterase enzyme and the levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine neurotransmitters. Additionally, it induced neuro-oxidative stress and neuroinflammation via an elevation in MDA levels and IL-6, while GSH concentration, as well as GPx and GST activities, were decreased. TiO2 NPs induced neuronal apoptosis through upregulation of the expression of caspase-8 and -9 that was further confirmed by increasing caspases-3 and -8 proteins in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. The expression of the immediate-early gene BDNF was increased in response to TiO2 NPs, while that of Arc was reduced. Chitosan significantly attenuated the TiO2 NPs-induced neurotoxicity regarding AChE, serotonin, MDA, GSH, GPx, GST, IL-6, caspases-8, -9, and -3. Chitosan inhibited the expression of Arc and alleviated the effect of TiO2 NPs on BDNF expression. Collectively, TiO2 NPs induced neurotoxicity via their action on vital neuronal biomarkers that might in turn cause brain dysfunction. Despite the neuroprotection of chitosan, its inhibitory effect on Arc expression should be considered.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) is a common neurotoxicant in the environment, but the molecular mechanism of its toxic effects is still unclear. Studies have shown that aluminum exposure causes an increase in neuronal apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism and signaling pathway of neuronal apoptosis induced by aluminum exposure. The rat model was established by intraperitoneal injection of maltol aluminum for 90 days. The results showed that the escape latency of the three groups exposed to maltol aluminum was higher than that of the control group on the 3rd, 4th and 5th days of the positioning cruise experiment (P < 0.05). On the 6th day of the space exploration experiment, compared with the control group(6.00 +/- 0.71,15.33 +/- 1.08) and the low-dose group(5.08 +/- 1.69,13.67 +/- 1.09), the number of times that the high-dose group crossed the platform(2.25 +/- 0.76) and the platform quadrant(7.58 +/- 1.43) was significantly reduced (P < 0.01). The relative expression levels of Sirt1 and Nrf2 in hippocampal tissues of all groups decreased gradually with increasing maltol aluminum exposure dose the relative expression levels of Sirt1 and Nrf2 in high-dose group (0.261 +/- 0.094,0.325 +/- 0.108) were significantly lower than those in control group (1.018 +/- 0.222,1.009 +/- 0.156)(P < 0.05). The relative expression level of Keap1 increased gradually with increasing maltol aluminum exposure dose (P < 0.05). The relative expression level of miR-128-3p in the high-dose group(1.520 +/- 0.280) was significantly higher than that in the control group(1.000 +/- 0.420) (P < 0.05). The content of GSH-Px in the hippocampus of rats decreased with increasing dose. ROS levels gradually increased. We speculated that subchronic aluminum exposure may lead to the activation of miR-128-3p in rat hippocampus of rats, thereby inhibiting the Sirt1-Keap1/Nrf2 pathway so that the Sirt1-Keap1/Nrf2 pathway could not be activated to exert antioxidant capacity, resulting in an imbalance in the antioxidant system of rats and the apoptosis of neurons, which caused reduced cognitive impairment in rats.

AB  - Simple Summary: Abnormal prolactin levels can lead to male infertility. However, the regulation mechanism of prolactin in the epididymis is still unclear. We studied the effects of prolactin on the epididymis function of Yanshan Cashmere bucks using the prolactin inhibitor bromocriptine. The results show that the inhibition of prolactin decreased the serum estradiol concentrations and the expression of the prolactin receptor protein in the epididymis (p < 0.05). The inhibition of prolactin also increased the height of the epididymal epithelium in the caput and cauda, as well as the diameter of the epididymal duct in the caput (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, prolactin inhibition decreased the duct diameter in the epididymal cauda (p < 0.05). Then, transcriptome analyses showed that the differentially expressed genes ESR2, MAPK10, JUN, ACTL7A, and CALML4 were enriched in multiple pathways, including the estrogen signaling pathway, the GnRH signaling pathway, the cAMP signaling pathway, the chemical carcinogenesis-reactive oxygen species pathway, steroid binding, and calcium ion binding, which may be the key genes in the prolactin regulation of epididymal function. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of prolactin regulating epididymis function in bucks. Yanshan Cashmere bucks are seasonal breeding animals and an important national genetic resource. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of prolactin (PRL) in the epididymal function of bucks. Twenty eleven-month-old Cashmere bucks were randomly divided into a control (CON) group and a bromocriptine (BCR, a prolactin inhibitor, 0.06 mg/kg body weight (BW)) treatment group. The experiment was conducted from September to October 2020 in Qinhuangdao City, China, and lasted for 30 days. Blood was collected on the last day before the BCR treatment (day 0) and on the 15th and 30th days after the BCR treatment (days 15 and 30). On the 30th day, all bucks were transported to the local slaughterhouse, where epididymal samples were collected immediately after slaughter. The left epididymis was preserved in 4% paraformaldehyde for histological observation, and the right epididymis was immediately preserved in liquid nitrogen for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The results show that the PRL inhibitor reduced the serum PRL and estradiol (E2) concentrations (p < 0.05) and tended to decrease luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations (p = 0.052) by the 30th day, but no differences (p > 0.05) occurred by either day 0 or 15. There were no differences (p > 0.05) observed in the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone (T), and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentrations between the two groups. The PRL receptor (PRLR) protein was mainly located in the cytoplasm and intercellular substance of the epididymal epithelial cells. The PRL inhibitor decreased (p < 0.05) the expression of the PRLR protein in the epididymis. In the BCR group, the height of the epididymal epithelium in the caput and cauda increased, as did the diameter of the epididymal duct in the caput (p < 0.05). However, the diameter of the cauda epididymal duct decreased (p < 0.05). Thereafter, a total of 358 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the epididymal tissues, among which 191 were upregulated and 167 were downregulated.
   Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed that ESR2, MAPK10, JUN, ACTL7A, and CALML4 were mainly enriched in the estrogen signaling pathway, steroid binding, calcium ion binding, the GnRH signaling pathway, the cAMP signaling pathway, and the chemical carcinogenesis-reactive oxygen species pathway, which are related to epididymal function. In conclusion, the inhibition of PRL may affect the structure of the epididymis by reducing the expression of the PRLR protein and the secretion of E2. ESR2, MAPK10, JUN, ACTL7A, and CALML4 could be the key genes of PRL in its regulation of epididymal reproductive function.

AB  - This study evaluates the effects of ensiled apple bagasse (EAB) in lamb diets on their performance and ruminal fermentation. Eighteen Dorper-Kathadin weaned, intact, male lambs (initial body weight 23.070 +/- 2.207 kg) were randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments for 77 days: T1 (control diet without EAB); T2 (diet with 20% EAB); and T3 (diet with 40% EAB). The diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous, and the diets' nutrient compositions was determined. Daily feed intake was measured, lambs were weighed monthly, and the feed conversion ratio was calculated at the end of the experiment. VFAs and N-NH3 production and the pH of ruminal fluid were determined. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance using SAS, and the means were compared using the Tukey test (P < 0.05). Daily weight gain was not different among treatments (P > 0.05). The feed conversion ratio was lower for T1 and T2 than T3 in the growing period (P < 0.05) but was not different in the finishing period. VFA production was higher in lambs fed T3 than those fed T1 and T2 (P < 0.05). No differences were observed in the proportion of acetic acid and N-NH3 concentration. The propionic acid production was higher for T1 compared to T2 and T3, and butyric acid was higher for T3 than T1. The results show that EAB can be used as an alternative for lamb diets to reduce production costs.

AB  - Environmental toxicants can impact brain health and function. Studying their effects on the rodent brain is paramount to understanding the mechanisms and devising therapies. The stereotaxic device is widely used to target brain regions. However, the cost of this device is very high and cannot be afforded by researchers from low- and low-middle-income countries. This study has modelled, designed, fabricated, and evaluated a cost-effective stereotaxic device. A 3-D model of the stereotaxic device was prepared using FUSION 360 software followed by fabrication using aluminium and steel. The aluminium has malleability, lightweight, high extrudability, and corrosion resistance property, making it the material of choice for fabricating the nose clamp, mouth restrainer, and ear bar. To construct the parts requiring motion, we used alloy steel, which has high density, tensile strength and smooth texture. To achieve better accuracy, computer numerical control (CNC) and an automatic wire-cutting (EDM) manufacturing processes were used in fabrication. Later, the dye microinjection and electrolytic lesion techniques were used to validate this instrument. A comparison of percent accuracy for hitting structures between the fabricated and commercial stereotaxic devices for both the deep and superficial brain structures such as the substantia nigra (91.7 vs. 92.5%), thalamus (92.6 vs. 98.22%) and hippocampus (92.85 vs. 98.75%), showcased comparable accuracies between devices. The cost of the materials used were approximately nine thousand Indian rupees, and the labour charges for different machining processes used were approximately seventeen thousand Indian rupees. Totalling to 26,000 Indian rupees or 310 US dollars. This cost may vary depending on the material type/vendor as well. The materials can be provided to a workshop, and the design reported here can be used to make a stereotaxic device for rodent research. The 3-D modeling approach presented here coupled with computerised numerical control/electronic discharge machining process achieves high precision comparable to a commercial product and is also affordable. This study will enable students/researchers in middle and low-income countries to perform neuroscience/toxicological studies on the brain using this self-made low-cost precision device.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a closed or open head injury caused by external mechanical forces that induce brain damage, resulting in a wide range of postinjury dysfunctions of emotions, learning and memory, adversely affecting the quality of life of patients. In this study, we aimed to explore the possible mechanisms of NOX2 on cognitive deficits in a TBI mouse model. Behavioral tests were applied to evaluate learning and memory ability, and electrophysiological experiments were performed to measure synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability of the CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the TBI hippocampus. We found that inhibitors of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NADPH oxidase 2; NOX2) (GSK2795039 and apocynin) attenuate neurological deficits, facilitate long-term potentiation (LTP) and decrease spontaneous synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) in traumatic brain injury (TBI) mice. NOX2-/- mice display reduced learning and memory impairment, enhanced LTP and reduced spontaneous synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability of PCs after TBI. Our study demonstrates that NOX2 is a potential target for learning and memory by modulating excitability and excitatory transmission in the hippo campus after TBI.

AB  - Paracetamol (acetaminophen, APAP) is the most common non-prescription analgesic drug used during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin E on acute APAP toxicity in pregnant rats. Toxicity in the liver, kidney, and brain (hippocampus, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb) was examined. Twenty pregnant female Wistar rats at gestational day 18 were used. Pregnant rats were divided into four groups: Control, APAP, E + APAP, and APAP + E. The Control group was treated with 0.5 mL p.o. corn oil. The APAP group received 3000 mg/kg p.o. APAP. The E + APAP group received 300 mg/kg p.o. vitamin E one hour before 3000 mg/kg APAP. The APAP + E group received 3000 mg/kg paracetamol one hour before 300 mg/kg p.o. vitamin E. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment administration, rats were euthanized and blood, brain, liver, and kidney samples were collected. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine levels, uric acid (UA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, as well as the relative mRNA expression of Cyp1a4, Cyp2d6, and Nat2, were determined. Acute APAP treatment upregulated ALT, AST, BUN, and creatinine levels. APAP treatment downregulated UA and SOD levels. APAP treatment upregulated the relative mRNA expression of Cyp1a4 and Cyp2d6, but downregulated Nat2 expression. Vitamin E treatment, either before or after APAP administration, attenuated the toxic effects of APAP. In conclusion, the results showed that an acute toxic APAP dose in late pregnancy can cause oxidative stress and dysregulation in Cyp isoform expression, and that vitamin E treatment attenuates these effects.

AB  - In order to analyse the transformations faced by pastoralists in coping with the uncertainties of their livelihoods, this paper analyses the evolutions of the marketing of camel milk, which has turned from a local taboo into a critical asset for the pastoral communities of Isiolo, a county typically associated with the rearing of cattle. Camel milk marketing (CMM) challenges several assumptions about pastoral societies and their supposed embedding conservativeness, inefficiency and risk aversion.A high-reliability perspective has been instrumental in revealing the ongoing dynamics that are reconfiguring pastoral resource management and livelihood patterns in Isiolo. Through this approach, the management practices and contractual relationships that underpin CMM production and marketing have been explored, with a view to unveiling the rationale inspiring the networks through which camel milk is transacted, and the related socially-regulated arrangements and practices. The social and political embeddedness of CMM networks is central to their ability to adapt and function in constantly changing local conditions.The marketing of camel milk provides an intriguing insight into how pastoral systems are informed by a high-reliability approach to operating under conditions of volatility and uncertainty. Political economy matters will have a significant influence on the evolution of this important enterprise. Adequate investments in infrastructure and public facilities would be crucial to further develop CMM and to enable its operators to respond and adapt to local dynamics, with a view to fairly share the associated risks, costs and benefits.

AB  - The chemical composition, content of cholesterol, retinol and alpha-tocopherol, and the total antioxidant capacity of different tissues from wild beavers were investigated. The total phenolic contents and free radical scavenging activity (DPPH and ABTS assays) were analysed spectrophotometrically, and fat-soluble vitamins were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. The type of tissue (skeletal muscle from loin and hind leg vs. adipose tissue from subcutaneous fat and tail) significantly affected content of all chemical components. The concentration of cholesterol was not related to total fat content. The retinol and alpha-tocopherol contents (mu g/100 g) were significantly higher in the tail (13.0 and 391.2) and subcutaneous fat (12.2 and 371.3) compared to skeletal muscles (as an average 9.1 and 361.4). Among all tissues the tail showed significantly the highest values of DPPH (3.07 mM TE/100 g), ABTS (3.33 mM TE/100 g), and total phenolics (TPC, 543.7 mg GAE/100 g). The concentration of retinol was positively correlated with alpha-tocopherol (0.748, p < 0.001), and both vitamins were very strongly correlated with DPPH (0.858 and 0.886, p < 0.001), ABTS (0.894 and 0.851, p < 0.001), and TPC (0.666 and 0.913, p < 0.001). The principal component analysis proved that moisture, ash, and protein contents were representative for skeletal muscles, whereas, retinol, alpha-tocopherol, ABTS and DPPH accurately described the antioxidant capacity of tissue from the tail.

AB  - As a key effector of the Hippo pathway, yes-associated protein (YAP) is a major regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this study, 23 hYAP isoforms were identified in HEK293 cells, with 14 isoforms being reported for the first time. These isoforms were classified into hYAP-a and hYAP-b isoforms based on the variation in exon 1. The two groups of isoforms showed distinctly different subcellular localizations. hYAP-a isoforms could activate TEAD- or P73-mediated transcription, affect the proliferation rate, and enhance the cellular chemosensitivity of HEK293 cells. Moreover, different activation abilities and pro-cytotoxic effects were observed among hYAP-a isoforms. However, hYAP-b isoforms were not found to exert any significant biological effects. Our findings add to the knowledge of YAP gene structure and protein-coding capacity and will help in the elucidation of the function and related molecular mechanisms of the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), which is associated with cognitive impairment. Previous study suggested CIH exposure could induce similar symptoms and signs to the clinical features of Deficiency of both Qi and Yin Syndrome (DQYS) in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Shashen-Maidong Decoction (SMD) has been applied clinically for DQYS for hundred years. However, SMD treatment could be beneficial to CIH induced cognitive impairment is still unclear.
   Aim of the study: Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of SMD treatment on CIH induced cognitive impairment, and to explore the related neuroprotective mechanism.
   Materials and methods: Mice were exposed to CIH for 5 weeks (8 h/day) and were orally treated with either vehicle or SMD (5.265 g/kg/day) 30 min before CIH exposure. Spatial memory was evaluated by Morris Water Maze and Y-Maze test. Synaptic morphology in hippocampus was observed by Golgi-Cox staining and Electron microscope, and NR2B-ERK signaling pathway were detected by western blotting.
   Results: Our results showed that SMD treatment improved performance in either Morris Water Maze or Y-Maze test in mice exposed to CIH, increased spine density and postsynaptic density (PSD) thickness in hippocampus. SMD treatment suppressed the over-activation of NR2B/CaMKII/SynGAP induced by CIH exposure, enhanced ERK/CREB phosphorylation and increased PSD-95 and BDNF expression.
   Conclusion: SMD attenuates the CIH-induced cognitive impairment through regulating NR2B-ERK signaling pathway. Additionally, our findings provided that DQYS may be the potential therapeutic target for neurocognitive diseases in patients with OSA.

AB  - Neuronal loss is the central abnormality occurring in brains suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). The notion that AD causes the death of neurons point towards protection of neuronal morphology and function as important therapeutic strategies. The perforant path projections from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus is the most vulnerable circuit with respect to AD. It's known that the perforant path is a very important structure for synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions. NgR (Nogo receptor) is not only involved in limiting injury-induced axonal growth but also in pathological features of AD. So, the mechanism of how NgR affects the perforant path needs further investigation. In this study, the effect of NgR in the perforant path on the neuronal morphology and function in APP/PS1 transgenic mice was studied. The results showed that downregulation of NgR in perforant path ameliorate the damaged morphology and decreased number of neurons in APP/PS1 mice. Concurrently, NgR knockdown enhanced dendritic complexity and increased postsynaptic protein density in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, the RT-PCR results indicated that there is downregulation of M1 phenotypes of microglial gene expression in the hippocampus of TG-shNgR mice. Our study suggests that NgR plays a critical role in microglial phenotype polarization, which might account for the NgR knockdown in the perforant path initiated a decrease in neuronal death and improved synaptic function. Our study provided a better understanding of the perforant path and the role of NgR in AD pathogenesis, thus offering the potential application of hippocampal neurons in treatment of AD.

TI  - Alzheimer's pathology causes impaired inhibitory connections and reactivation of spatial codes during spatial navigation
T2  - CELL REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - Synapse loss and altered synaptic strength are thought to underlie cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by disrupting neural activity essential for memory. While synaptic dysfunction in AD has been well characterized in anesthetized animals and in vitro, it remains unknown how synaptic transmission is altered during behavior. By measuring synaptic efficacy as mice navigate in a virtual reality task, we find deficits in interneuron connection strength onto pyramidal cells in hippocampal CA1 in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. These inhibitory synaptic deficits are most pronounced during sharp-wave ripples, network oscillations important for memory that require inhibition. Indeed, 5XFAD mice exhibit fewer and shorter sharp-wave ripples with impaired place cell reactivation. By showing inhibitory synaptic dysfunction in 5XFAD mice during spatial navigation behavior and suggesting a synaptic mechanism underlying deficits in network activity essential for memory, this work bridges the gap between synaptic and neural activity deficits in AD.

AB  - Background: Invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (IFS) is a rare but often fatal disease. There are limited studies regarding IFS with orbital complications (IFSwOC). The present study aimed to identify the clinical signs associated with IFSwOC and prognosticators of the disease. Methods: A retrospective case series was conducted of patients histopathologically confirmed IFS or fungal rhinosinusitis with clinically apparent neuro-orbital complications who underwent surgery between 2008 and 2018. Demographic data, presenting symptoms and signs, culture data, laboratory results, and patient outcomes were obtained from medical records. Results: A total of 38 patients were identified, including 9 patients with IFSwOC, and 29 patients with IFS without orbital complications (IFSsOC). The clinical signs associated with developing orbital complications include headache, fever, sphenoid sinus, or posterior ethmoid sinus involvement, CRP level >= 1.025 mg/dL, or ESR level >= 46.5 mm/h. In IFSwOC group, male, posterior ethmoid sinus involvement, WBC count >= 9000 mu L, CRP level >= 6.91 mg/dL, or ESR level >= 69 mm/h were correlated with a significantly poorer prognosis. Conclusion: IFS patients with sphenoid or posterior ethmoid sinus involvement, headache or fever as presenting symptoms, elevated CRP, and ESR level were at risk of developing orbital complications. Timely surgical debridement followed by systemic antifungal treatment may improve treatment outcomes.

AB  - Mucormycosis has emerged as a group of severe infections mainly in immunocompromised patients. We analysed the epidemiology of mucormycosis in Greece in a multicentre, nationwide prospective survey of patients of all ages, during 2005-2022. A total of 108 cases were recorded. The annual incidence declined after 2009 and appeared stable thereafter, at 0.54 cases/million population. The most common forms were rhinocerebral (51.8%), cutaneous (32.4%), and pulmonary (11.1%). Main underlying conditions were haematologic malignancy/neutropenia (29.9%), haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (4.7%), diabetes mellitus (DM) (15.9%), other immunodeficiencies (23.4%), while 22.4% of cases involved immunocompetent individuals with cutaneous/soft-tissue infections after motor vehicle accident, surgical/iatrogenic trauma, burns, and injuries associated with natural disasters. Additionally, DM or steroid-induced DM was reported as a comorbidity in 21.5% of cases with various main conditions. Rhizopus (mostly R. arrhizus) predominated (67.1%), followed by Lichtheimia (8.5%) and Mucor (6.1%). Antifungal treatment consisted mainly of liposomal amphotericin B (86.3%), median dose 7 mg/kg/day, range 3-10 mg/kg/day, with or without posaconazole. Crude mortality was 62.8% during 2005-2008 but decreased significantly after 2009, at 34.9% (p = 0.02), with four times fewer haematological cases, fewer iatrogenic infections, and fewer cases with advanced rhinocerebral form. The increased DM prevalence should alert clinicians for timely diagnosis of mucormycosis in this patient population.

AB  - Differential effect of the neonatal proinflammatory stress (NPS) on the development of neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and induction of the depressive-like behavior in juvenile and adult male and female rats was studied. NPS induction by bacterial lipopolysaccharide in the neonatal period upregulated expression of the Il6 and Tnf mRNAs accompanied by the development of depressive-like behavior in the adult male rats. NPS increased expression of the mRNAs for fractalkine and its receptor in the ventral hippocampus of the juvenile male rats, but did not affect expression of mRNAs for the proinflammatory cytokines and soluble form of fractalkine. NPS downregulated expression of fractalkine mRNA in the dorsal hippocampus of juvenile males. No significant effects of NPS were found in the female rats. Therefore, the NPS induces long-term changes in the expression of neuroinflammation-associated genes in different regions of the hippocampus, which ultimately leads to the induction of neuroinflammation and development of depressive-like behavior in male rats.

AB  - l-arginine is a versatile amino acid with a number of bioactive metabolites. Increasing evidence implicates altered arginine metabolism in the aging and neurodegenerative processes. The present study, for the first time, determined the effects of sex and estrous cycle on the brain and blood (plasma) arginine metabolic profile in naive rats. Female rats displayed significantly lower levels of l-arginine in the frontal cortex and three sub-regions of the hippocampus when compared to male rats. Moreover, female rats had significantly higher levels of l-arginine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, but lower levels of l-ornithine, agmatine and putrescine, in plasma relative to male rats. The observed sex difference in brain l-arginine appeared to be independent of the enzymes involved in its metabolism, de novo synthesis and blood-to-brain transport (cationic acid transporter 1 protein expression at least), as well as circulating l-arginine. While the estrous cycle did not affect l-arginine and its metabolites in the brain, there were estrous cycle phase-dependent changes in plasma l-arginine. These findings demonstrate the sex difference in brain l-arginine in the estrous cycle-independent manner. Since peripheral blood has been increasingly used to identify biomarkers of brain pathology, the influences of sex and estrous cycle on blood arginine metabolic profile need attention when experimental research involves female rodents.

AB  - Lead nanoparticles (PbNPs) in air pollution pose a significant threat to human health, especially due to their neurotoxic effects. In this study, we exposed mice to lead(II) oxide nanoparticles (PbONPs) in inhalation chambers to mimic real-life exposure and assess their impact on the brain. PbONPs caused the formation of Hirano bodies and pathological changes related to neurodegenerative disorders through cytoskeletal disruptions without the induction of inflammation. Damage to astrocytic endfeet and capillary endothelial cells indicated a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB), allowing PbONPs to enter the brain. Additionally, NPs were detected along the olfactory pathway, including fila olfactoria, suggesting that at least a proportion of PbNPs enter the brain directly by passing through the olfactory epithelium. PbNP inhalation severely damaged the apical parts of olfactory epithelial cells, including the loss of microtubules in their ciliary distal segments. Inhalation of PbONPs led to the rapid accumulation of lead in the brain, while more soluble lead(II) nitrate NPs did not accumulate significantly until 11 weeks of exposure. PbNPs induced disruption of the BBB at multiple levels, ranging from ultrastructural changes to functional impairments of the barrier; however, they did not induce systemic inflammation in the brain. The clearance ability of the brain to remove Pb was very low for both types of NPs, with significant pathological effects persisting even after a long clearance period. Cation-binding proteins (ZBTB20 and calbindin1) were distributed unevenly in the brain, with the strongest signal located in the hippocampus, which exhibited the greatest defects in nuclear architecture, indicating that this area is the most sensitive structure for PbNP exposure. PbNP exposure also altered the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus and inhibition of tau phosphorylation by GSK-3 inhibitor rescued the negative effect of PbONPs on the intracellular calcium level in trigeminal ganglion cultures. In zebrafish larvae, PbONPs affected locomotor activity and reduced calcium levels in the medium enhanced negative effect of PbONP on animal mobility, even increasing lethality. These findings suggest that cytoskeletal disruption and calcium dysregulation are key factors in PbNP-induced neurotoxicity, providing potential targets for therapeutic intervention to prevent neurodegenerative changes following PbNP exposure.

AB  - The complete molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain to be elucidated. Recently, microRNA-455-3p has been identified as a circulating biomarker of early AD, with increased expression in post-mortem brain tissue of AD patients. MicroRNA-455-3p also directly targets and down-regulates APP, with the overexpression of miR-455-3p suppressing its toxic effects. Here, we show that miR-455-3p expression decreases with age in the brains of wild-type mice. We generated a miR-455 null mouse utilising CRISPR-Cas9 to explore its function further. Loss of miR-455 resulted in increased weight gain, potentially indicative of metabolic disturbances. Furthermore, performance on the novel object recognition task diminished significantly in miR-455 null mice (p = 0.004), indicating deficits in recognition memory. A slight increase in anxiety was also captured on the open field test. BACE1 and TAU were identified as new direct targets for miR-455-3p, with overexpression of miR-455-3p leading to a reduction in the expression of APP, BACE1 and TAU in neuroblastoma cells. In the hippocampus of miR-455 null mice at 14 months of age, the levels of protein for APP, BACE1 and TAU were all increased. Such findings reinforce the involvement of miR-455 in AD progression and demonstrate its action on cognitive performance.

AB  - Circadian rhythms regulate physiological processes in approximately 24 h cycles, and their disruption is associated with various diseases. Inflammation may perturb circadian rhythms, though these interactions remain unclear. This study examined whether systemic inflammation induced by an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could alter central and peripheral circadian rhythms and diurnal neuroimmune dynamics. Mice were randomly assigned to two groups: the saline control group and the LPS group. The diurnal expression of circadian clock genes and inflammatory cytokines were measured in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and liver. Diurnal dynamic behaviors of microglia were also assessed. Our results revealed that the LPS perturbed circadian gene oscillations in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and liver. Furthermore, systemic inflammation induced by the LPS could trigger neuroinflammation and perturb the diurnal dynamic behavior of microglia in the hippocampus. These findings shed light on the intricate link between inflammation and circadian disruption, underscoring their significance in relation to neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Purpose The current study aimed to investigate the efficacy of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) synthesized by Melia azedarach aqueous extract to control Hyalomma dromedarii tick, and to evaluate their toxic effects on Swiss albino mice. Methods ZnO NPs were synthesized using M. azedarach aqueous extract. UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy were used to characterize the synthesized NPs. Egg, nymph, larva, and adult immersion tests were used for bioassay of tick stages with the synthesized ZnO NP. A toxicity study was performed on Swiss albino mice after treatment with 1/10 of the oral LD50 of ZnO NPs (8437 mg/kg) for 5 successive days by oral gavage. Results The LC50 of ZnO NPs on the eggs, larvae, and nymphs was 11.6, 8.03, and 3.9 mg/ml, respectively. The reproductive performance of females treated with ZnO NPs was lower than that of untreated females. The hematological results showed an insignificant increase in the level of white blood cells with normal red blood cells, hemoglobin, in addition to normal platelet count. The biochemical analysis showed an insignificant increased level (P > 0.05) of alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase. The liver and kidney suffered few histopathological changes after oral administration of ZnO NPs. Conclusion These results suggest that ZnO NPs have good acaricidal activity against eggs, larvae, and engorged nymphs of H. dromedarii. ZnO NPs minimized the number of eggs laid by engorged females and the hatchability of their eggs. ZnO NPs did not affect unfed adults. The toxicity results of the mice revealed insignificant changes in the hemogram, biochemistry, with liver and kidney suffering few histopathological changes. Future studies are needed to assess application routes (topical vs oral). Based on these findings, ZnO NPs may be incorporated in the control of camel tick H. dromedarii.

AB  - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are among the most common medications used for depression in postpartum and lactating people, who experience increased depression risk. However, there is a limited understanding of peripartum SSRI impacts on maternal neurobehavioral responses, and particularly those of sertraline, the most prescribed SSRI in United States (US) pregnancies. We administered C57Bl/6 females sertraline via a non-invasive, naturalistic approach (167 mg/L drinking water) from 2 weeks pre-conception through lactation (PND21) or for an equivalent duration in nonpregnant controls. We assessed behavior and molecular brain changes intrapartum and postpartum at similar to 1 year of age. Chronic sertraline reduced depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. Pregnancy itself decreased anxiety-like and hedonic behaviors. RNA sequencing of maternal brain revealed only 52 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in frontal cortex with sertraline. These DEGs over-represented functions related to immunity. In contrast, sertraline altered 962 targets in maternal hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, with DEGs overrepresenting neurotransmission and neurodegeneration. We then discontinued sertraline and aged animals to approximately 1 year to test neurodegenerative phenotypes. Having one prior litter, regardless of peripartum sertraline, improved aged females' spatial learning and memory. Sertraline, regardless of postpartum status, improved working memory. Further, we found buffering of neurodegeneration-related gene network changes and increased excitatory synapse density in the hippocampus after peripartum sertraline. Peripartum sertraline alters maternal neurobiology and behavior in pregnancy and beyond, with long-term benefits to neurodegenerative processes. Pregnancy also exerts its own, lasting effects on learning and memory. These findings might be exploited in the future to abrogate neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Aspergillosis and mucormycosis are filamentous fungal infections occurring predominantly in immunocompromised patients. Fulminant process with rapid infiltration of the contiguous tissue is distinctive for both type of fungi. The rhinocerebral co-infection by Aspergillus and Mucorales is very rare and is usually associated in immunocompromised patients with a high mortality rate. This rare co-infection leads to difficulties in diagnosis, and therapeutic delays can result in a poor prognosis. Overall, the treatment of choice is surgical debridement and liposomal amphotericin B. This paper describes a combined aspergillosis and mucormycosis case in a diabetes mellitus type 2 patient with chronic ulcerations of the palatal and cheek. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an uncommon co-infection of Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus arrhizus in a rhino-orbital presentation.

AB  - Ecological host range testing complements pre-release fundamental host range testing by offering a more realistic picture of insect host plant use in the field, including spillover risk. The biological control program targeting the weed Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi (Anacardiaceae) first released the flush-feeding thrips Pseudophilothrips ichini (Hood) (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae) in Florida in 2019. Pre-release quarantine testing indicated that P. ichini could oviposit and develop on ten host plant species, two of which (Rhus sandwicensis and Dodonaea viscosa) are culturally and ecologically important in Hawaii, where S. terebinthifolia is also a serious weed. We performed two open field experiments, one to simulate temporary spillover and one to simulate continuous spillover and determine if P. ichini could damage non-target plants under natural conditions. In the first experiment, P. ichini thrips dispersed from most non-targets within 24 h, did not move onto non-target plants following the cutting of adjacent S. terebinthifolia plants at soil level, and produced larvae only on R. sandwicensis. In the second experiment, S. terebinthifolia plant quality declined from P. ichini feeding damage, the thrips dispersed more quickly from non-target plants than S. terebinthifolia, produced larvae only on the weed S. terebinthifolia, and did

AB  - Early diagnosis and treatment of rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) are crucial. Potassium hydroxide with Calcofluorwhite (KOH + CFW) smears can demonstrate the fungal hyphae, but mixed infections caused by both mucorales and non-mucorales pose a diagnostic challenge. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can detect mixed infections and differentiate mucorales from non-mucorales. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of a single reaction PCR in the diagnosis of ROCM and the efficacy of nasal biopsy and endonasal swab in the detection of fungus. Sixty-six clinical samples were collected from 33 patients and were subjected to KOH + CFW smear, culture and PCR. PCR was performed using pan-fungal primers targeting the 28S large subunit rRNA gene, and the amplified products were further sequenced to identify the fungi. KOH + CFW smear, culture and PCR detected mucorales in 54.6%, 27.3% and 63.6% patients, respectively. PCR detected mixed infection in 51.5% patients compared to 9.1% by KOH + CFW smear. PCR detected fungus in 90% of nasal biopsies and 77.8% of endonasal swabs. Rhizopus spp. was the most common fungi identified in 43.2% of PCR-positive samples. PCR is effective in detecting mixed infection and in the diagnosis of ROCM. Nasal biopsies had better fungal detection rates than endonasal swabs.

AB  - Background The second COVID-19 wave in India has been associated with an unprecedented increase in cases of COVID-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM), mainly Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM). Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Noble hospital and Research Centre (NHRC), Pune, India, between 1 April, 2020, and 1 August, 2021, to identify CAM patients and assess their management outcomes. The primary endpoint was incidence of all-cause mortality due to CAM. Results 59 patients were diagnosed with CAM. Median duration from the first positive COVID-19 RT PCR test to diagnosis of CAM was 17 (IQR: 12,22) days. 90% patients were diabetic with 89% having uncontrolled sugar level (HbA1c >7%). All patients were prescribed steroids during treatment for COVID-19. 56% patients were prescribed steroids for non-hypoxemic, mild COVID-19 (irrational steroid therapy), while in 9%, steroids were prescribed in inappropriately high dose. Patients were treated with a combination of surgical debridement (94%), intravenous liposomal Amphotericin B (91%) and concomitant oral Posaconazole (95.4%). 74.6% patients were discharged after clinical and radiologic recovery while 25.4% died. On relative risk analysis, COVID-19 CT severity index >= 18 (p = .017), presence of orbital symptoms (p = .002), presence of diabetic ketoacidosis (p = .011) and cerebral involvement (p = .0004) were associated with increased risk of death. Conclusions CAM is a rapidly progressive, angio-invasive, opportunistic fungal infection, which is fatal if left untreated. Combination of surgical debridement and antifungal therapy leads to clinical and radiologic improvement in majority of cases.

AB  - The ascomycete Podospora anserina is a heterothallic filamentous fungus found mainly on herbivore dung. It is commonly used in laboratories as a model system, and its complete life cycle lasting eight days is well mastered in vitro. The main objective of our team is to understand better the global process of fruiting body development, named perithecia, induced normally in this species by fertilization. Three allelic mutants, named pfd3, pfd9, and pfd23 (for "promoting fruiting body development") obtained by UV mutagenesis, were selected in view of their abilities to promote barren perithecium development without fertilization. By complete genome sequencing of pfd3 and pfd9, and mutant complementation, we identified point mutations in the mcm1 gene as responsible for spontaneous perithecium development. MCM1 proteins are MADS box transcription factors that control diverse developmental processes in plants, metazoans, and fungi. We also identified using the same methods a mutation in the VelC gene as responsible for spontaneous perithecium development in the vacua mutant. The VelC protein belongs to the velvet family of regulators involved in the control of development and secondary metabolite production. A key role of MCM1 and VelC in coordinating the development of P. anserina perithecia with gamete formation and fertilization is highlighted.

AB  - Damage generated by insects is one of main restricting factors for soybean production. Stink bugs are a great threat within pests because, by feeding mainly on pods, they cause direct and irreversible damage to developing seeds. Thus, plant resistance is an important management strategy to reduce insect population impact on yield losses. Association mapping can be used as a powerful tool for dissecting resistance mechanisms in soybean, more specifically to recover functional loci involved in plant defense against herbivorous insects; and can also provide valuable markers for the development of soybean cultivars with resistance. The purpose of this study was to identify molecular markers associated with resistance genes to stink bugs in a collection of soybean germplasm, using the association mapping strategy. According to the decline value in the linkage disequilibrium, an accurate power of mapping resolution was predicted in this population. Four associated markers located in chromosomes 6 and 15 were identified. Out of the 112 candidate genes close to them, 31 would encode proteins related to defense pathways triggered by the attack of herbivorous insects. The proteins encoded by these candidate genes could be associated to the jasmonic acid pathway. The main contribution of this study was the identification of molecular markers associated with resistance genes to stink bugs. These markers will be a useful tool for marker-assisted selection applied to soybean genetic breeding.

AB  - In regenerative medicine, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are considered as a promising cell-free approach. EVs are lipid bilayer-enclosed vesicles secreted by cells and are key players in intercellular communication. EV-based therapeutic approaches have unique advantages over the use of cell-based therapies, such as a high biological, but low immunogenic and tumorigenic potential. To analyze the purity and biochemical composition of EV preparations, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) has prepared guidelines recommending the analysis of multiple (EV) markers, as well as proteins coisolated/recovered with EVs. Traditional methods for EV characterization, such as Western blotting, require a relatively high EV sample/protein input for the analysis of one protein. We here evaluate a combined Western and bead-based multiplex platform, called DigiWest, for its ability to detect simultaneously multiple EV markers in an EV-containing sample with inherent low protein input. DigiWest analysis was performed on EVs from various sources and species, including mesenchymal stromal cells, notochordal cells, and milk, from human, pig, and dog. The study established a panel of nine antibodies that can be used as cross-species for the detection of general EV markers and coisolates in accordance with the ISEV guidelines. This optimized panel facilitates the parallel evaluation of EV-containing samples, allowing for a comprehensive characterization and assessment of their purity. The total protein input for marker analysis with DigiWest was 1 mu g for all nine antibodies, compared with similar to 10 mu g protein input required for traditional Western blotting for one antibody. These findings demonstrate the potential of the DigiWest technique for characterizing various types of EVs in the regenerative medicine field.
   Impact statementIn regenerative medicine, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained attention as a cell-free approach because of their high biological and low immunogenic/tumorigenic potential. We here explored a multiplex bead-based Western blot technique (DigiWest) for the characterization of EV preparations from different sources and species with regenerative potential. Using this technology, which can simultaneously detect many different proteins in a single EV sample and requires low total protein input, we established a panel of nine antibodies that can be used for cross-species EV preparations analysis. As such, the DigiWest technology might facilitate the translation of EV-based regenerative approaches.

AB  - The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a complex interconnected system altered in schizophrenia. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been proposed as an adjunctive therapy to antipsychotics in clinical trials, but its role in the microbiota-gut-brain axis has not been sufficiently explored. We aimed to describe the effect of NAC administration during pregnancy on the gut-brain axis in the offspring from the maternal immune stimulation (MIS) animal model of schizophrenia. Pregnant Wistar rats were treated with PolyI:C/Saline. Six groups of animals were studied according to the study factors: phenotype (Saline, MIS) and treatment (no NAC, NAC 7 days, NAC 21 days). Offspring were subjected to the novel object recognition test and were scanned using MRI. Caecum contents were used for metagenomics 16S rRNA sequencing. NAC treatment prevented hippocampal volume reduction and long-term memory deficits in MIS-offspring. In addition, MIS-animals showed lower bacterial richness, which was prevented by NAC. Moreover, NAC7/NAC21 treatments resulted in a reduction of proinflammatory taxons in MIS-animals and an increase in taxa known to produce anti-inflammatory metabolites. Early approaches, like this one, with anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidative compounds, especially in neurodevelopmental disorders with an inflammatory/oxidative basis, may be useful in modulating bacterial microbiota, hippocampal size, as well as hippocampal-based memory impairments.

AB  - Isolated exposure to intermittent hypoxia and permissive hypercapnia activates signaling mechanisms that induce ultrastructural changes in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, accompanied by the development of maximal ischemic tolerance in neurons under the combined influence of these factors. However, there are a lack of data on the combined impact of these factors on the ultrastructure of neuronal organelles. The present study aims to comparatively assess the ultrastructural changes in neurons following isolated and combined exposure to hypoxia and hypercapnia, as well as to correlate these changes with the neuroprotective potential previously observed for these factors. Following a 15-session course of 30-min exposures to permissive hypercapnia (PCO2 & AP; 50 mmHg) and/or normobaric hypoxia (PO2 & AP; 150 mmHg), morphometric assessment was conducted to evaluate the extent of ultrastructural changes in hippocampal neurons (mitochondria, perinuclear space, and granular endoplasmic reticulum). It was found that in hippocampal neurons from the CA1 region, permissive hypercapnia resulted in increased mitochondrial size, expansion of membranous compartments of the granular endoplasmic reticulum, and perinuclear space. Normobaric hypoxia affected only mitochondrial size, while hypercapnic hypoxia specifically widened the perinuclear space. These ultrastructural changes objectively reflect varying degrees of the influence of hypoxia and hypercapnia on organelles responsible for energy metabolism, anti-apoptotic, and synthetic functions of neurons. This confirms the effect of potentiation of their neuroprotective effects under combined exposure and highlights the dominant role of the hypercapnic component in this mechanism.

AB  - Introduction: After birth, the lungs must resorb the fluid they contain. This process involves multiple actors such as surfactant, aquaporins and ENaC channels. Preterm newborns often exhibit respiratory distress syndrome due to surfactant deficiency, and transitory tachypnea caused by a delay in lung liquid resorption. Our hypothesis is that surfactant, ENaC and aquaporins are involved in respiratory transition to extrauterine life and altered by preterm birth. We compared these candidates in preterm and term fetal sheeps. Materials and methods: We performed cesarean sections in 8 time-dated pregnant ewes (4 at 100 days and 4 at 140 days of gestation, corresponding to 24 and 36 weeks of gestation in humans), and obtained 13 fetal sheeps in each group. We studied surfactant synthesis (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C), lung liquid resorption (ENaC, aquaporins) and corticosteroid regulation (glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor and 11-betaHSD2) at mRNA and protein levels.Results: The mRNA expression level of SFTPA, SFTPB and SFTPC was higher in the term group. These results were confirmed at the protein level for SP-B on Western Blot analysis and for SP-A, SP-B and SP-C on immunohistochemical analysis. Regarding aquaporins, ENaC and receptors, mRNA expression levels for AQP1, AQP3, AQP5, ENaC alpha, ENaCfi, ENaC gamma and 11fiHSD2 mRNA were also higher in the term group.Discussion: Expression of surfactant proteins, aquaporins and ENaC increases between 100 and 140 days of gestation in an ovine model. Further exploring these pathways and their hormonal regulation could highlight some new explanations in the pathophysiology of neonatal respiratory diseases.

AB  - Methylphenidate (MPH) has been widely misused by children and adolescents who do not meet all diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Since it is not yet known whether MPH can be administered in childhood without consequences in adulthood, in the present study we proposed to investigate the effects of chronic early treatment with MPH after a long period of discontinuation. Wistar male rats were injected with MPH (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or saline solution once daily from 15th to 44th day of life. Two months after the last MPH administration, we evaluated the animal's performances on a battery of behavior tests. We also tested Na+,K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase activities in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which may be associated with behavior. Rats treated with MPH during peri-adolescence show changes in exploratory behavior in adulthood in the open field but not in the elevated plus maze and light-dark transition tests. MPH-treated rats showed a lower latency to find the platform in the training phase, as well as a better performance in the test phase in the Morris water maze test. No differences were observed in the object recognition index and working memory. Acetylcholinesterase was increased in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, while Na+,K+-ATPase was increased only in hippocampus. These findings provide additional evidence that early-life exposure to MPH can have complex effects in adulthood and new basis for understanding the behavioral and neurochemical consequences associated with chronic use of MPH during the development of central nervous system.

AB  - The potential therapeutic value of Eleutheroside E in radiation-induced cognitive and memory impairments is regulated by the gut microbiota via neurotransmitter systems and PKA/CREB/BDNF signaling pathways.
   Radiation affects not only cognitive function but also gut microbiota. Eleutheroside E (EE), a principal active compound of Acanthopanax senticosus, has a certain protective effect on the nervous system. Here, we find a four-week EE supplementation to the Co-60-gamma ray irradiated mice improves the cognition and spatial memory impairments along with the protection of hippocampal neurons, remodels the gut microbiota, especially changes of Lactobacillus and Helicobacter, and altered the microbial metabolites including neurotransmitters (GABA, NE, ACH, 5-HT) as well as their precursors. Furthermore, the fecal transplantation of EE donors verifies that EE alleviated cognition and spatial memory impairments, and activates the PKA/CREB/BDNF signaling via gut microbiota. Our findings provide insight into the mechanism of EE effect on the gut-brain axis and underpin a proposed therapeutic value of EE in cognitive and memory impairments induced by radiation.

AB  - The goal of this study is to promote the development of high-quality energy and emission reduction measures for super large deep foundation pits applied in metro system construction projects in areas with loess. In this paper, Rhinoceros 6 is first used to model the super large deep foundation pit on both sides of the existing subway. Second, the Mohr-Coulomb model and the elastic model are used for numerical calculations in FLAC 3D. In-depth analysis of the deformation of the foundation pit and its surrounding environment and optimization of the support system are performed from the perspectives of safety, economy and environmental protection. Finally, the emission factor method is used to analyze the energy consumption level of the support system. The results reveal that the surface settlement, horizontal displacement of support structure, and horizontal and vertical displacements of the lining increase with the number of construction stages (CONS). In addition, there are strong and stable areas of ground settlement. The ground settlement in the strong area exhibits a V-shaped trend. The horizontal displacement of the lining structure is concentrated in the lower 1/5 of the lining structure, and the vertical displacement gradually decreases from the center toward the east and west. Increases in the pile diameter and diagonal steel support stiffness significantly reduce the deformation of the super large deep foundation pit excavation on its sidewalls and surroundings. The optimized support system greatly reduces the project cost and construction difficulty, and the total carbon emissions are reduced by 27.52%.

AB  - In line with the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the circular economy may become an opportunity for change even in the construction industry, which is traditionally distinguished for its high resource consumption and considerable waste generation. Schools of architecture play a crucial role because the transition towards a circular economy implies the necessary development of new professional figures with wide-ranging skills that may pave the way for new directions in R&D. This article describes three different learning experiences developed at Politecnico di Torino, which have in common the prospect of supply chains in transition. In particular, it discusses the following: the transition of waste from the agrifood chain to the design sector through the experimentation of panels for furniture; the integration of local supply chains for cork, sheep wool, and soil through the design of insulation blocks and panels; and the 'as-is' transition of an element originally used as packaging from the agrifood supply chain to the building envelope component sector. These experiences show the possibility of hybridization between sectors that are only apparently distant from one other. Above all, they can be considered 'exercises' to train future architects in the experimentation and transformation of matter, systemic design, and divergent and lateral thinking for the development of new building materials and components.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) is one of the most important economic plants in China, and has many benefits for human health. Anthracnose is one of the most serious diseases of tea in China, and control of the fungus is important since most Chinese cultivars are susceptible to it. The agent of tea anthracnose was initially described as Gloeosporium theae-sinensis I. Miyake in Japan, which was later transferred to Discula, but this taxonomic position remains problematic. To shed light on these taxonomic and phylogenetic issues, the tea anthracnose pathogens were re-studied. Combining the morphological characteristics and a multigene phylogenetic analysis of nrITS, nrLSU, rpb2, and tef1 sequence data, a new genus Sinodiscula was proposed to accommodate the causal fungi of tea anthracnose, including a new species Sinodiscula camellicola and a new combination Sinodiscula theae-sinensis. Furthermore, the pathogenicity of the pathogens was determined according to Koch's postulates. This study thoroughly resolves the long-standing taxonomic and phylogenetic problems of the tea anthracnose pathogens.

AB  - Mucormycosis (a.k.a. zygomycosis) is an often-life-threatening disease caused by fungi from the ancient fungal division Mucoromycota. Globally, there are nearly a million people with the disease. Rhizopus spp., and R. delemar (R. oryzae, R. arrhizus) in particular, are responsible for most of the diagnosed cases. Pulmonary, rhino-orbito-cerebral, and invasive mucormycosis are most effectively treated with amphotericin B (AmB) and particularly with liposomal formulations (e.g., AmBisome (R)). However, even after antifungal therapy, there is still a 50% mortality rate. Hence, there is a critical need to improve therapeutics for mucormycosis. Targeting AmB-loaded liposomes (AmB-LLs) with the pathogen receptor Dectin-1 (DEC1-AmB-LLs) to the beta-glucans expressed on the surface of Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans lowers the effective dose required to kill cells relative to untargeted AmB-LLs. Because Dectin-1 is an immune receptor for R. delemar infections and may bind it directly, we explored the Dectin-1-mediated delivery of liposomal AmB to R. delemar. DEC1-AmB-LLs bound 100- to 1000-fold more efficiently to the exopolysaccharide matrix of R. delemar germlings and mature hyphae relative to AmB-LLs. DEC1-AmB-LLs delivering sub-micromolar concentrations of AmB were an order of magnitude more efficient at inhibiting and/or killing R. delemar than AmB-LLs. Targeted antifungal drug-loaded liposomes have the potential to improve the treatment of mucormycosis.

AB  - Neuronal protein synthesis is required for long-lasting plasticity and long-term memory consolidation. Dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2a is one of the key translational control events that is required to increase de novo protein synthesis that underlies long-lasting plasticity and memory consolidation. Here, we interrogate the molecular pathways of translational control that are triggered by neuronal stimulation with brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which results in eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) dephosphorylation and increases in de novo protein synthesis. Primary rodent neurons exposed to BDNF display elevated translation of GADD34, which facilitates eIF2a dephosphorylation and subsequent de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, GADD34 requires G -actin generated by cofilin to dephosphorylate eIF2a and enhance protein synthesis. Finally, GADD34 is required for BDNF-induced translation of synaptic plasticity -related proteins. Overall, we provide evidence that neurons repurpose GADD34, an effector of the integrated stress response, as an orchestrator of rapid increases in eIF2-dependent translation in response to plasticity -inducing stimuli.

AB  - The brominated flame retardant 2,2 & PRIME;,4,4 & PRIME;-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) is widely distributed in the environment and poses a certain risk to human health. Studies have reported that oxidative stress is a key mechanism underlying BDE-47-induced neurotoxicity. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) is a crucial mediator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which is involved in cognitive dysfunction induced by environmental toxins. However, the function of the mtROS-NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in BDE-47-elicited cognitive deficits and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Our data illustrated that eight weeks of BDE-47 (20 mg/kg) gavage led to cognitive deficits and hippocampal neuronal injury in mice. BDE-47 exposure downregulated Sirt3 expression and decreased the activity and expression level of SOD2, thereby inhibiting mtROS scavenging and activating NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis in the mouse hippocampus and BV-2 cells. In vitro, BDE-47-evoked microglial pyroptosis relied on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, a mtROS scavenger (TEMPO) attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent microglial pyroptosis under BDE-47 stress. Furthermore, Sirt3 overexpression restored the activity and expression of SOD2 and enhanced mtROS scavenging, thereby suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation and ameliorating microglial pyroptosis. Notably, honokiol (HKL), a pharmacological agonist of Sirt3, mitigated BDE-47-evoked hippocampal neuronal injury and cognitive impairment by inhibiting mtROS-NLRP3 axis-mediated pyroptosis via Sirt3 upregulation.

AB  - Sulfomucins are in some body locations and species a normal occurrence, whereas in other situations, are a sign of pathology. Sulfomucin content on histological sections and isolated material is frequently analyzed with Alcian blue staining at pH 1.0. However, since the stain detects the charge, a high density of other charged molecules, such as sialic acids, has potential to impede specificity. Here, we compared the outcome from four staining protocols with the level of sulfation determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric analysis on samples from various tissues with variable sulfation and sialylation levels. We found that a protocol we designed, including rinsing with MetOH and 0.5 M NaCl buffer at pH 1.0, eliminates the false positive staining of tissues outperforming commonly recommended solutions. In tissues with low-to-moderately sulfated mucins (e.g. human stomach and salmonid epithelia), this method enables accurate relative quantification (e.g. sulfate scoring comparisons between healthy and diseased tissues), whereas the range of the method is not suitable for comparisons between tissues with high sulfomucin content (e.g. pig stomach and colon).

AB  - Search for novel antimicrobial agents, including plant-derived flavonoids, and evaluation of the mechanisms of their antibacterial activities are pivotal objectives. The goal of this study was to compare the antihemolytic activity of flavonoids, quercetin, naringenin and catechin against sheep erythrocyte lysis induced by alpha-hemolysin (alpha HL) produced by the Staphylococcus aureus strain NCTC 5655. We also sought to investigate the membrane-modifying action of the flavonoids. Lipophilic quercetin, but not naringenin or catechin, effectively inhibited the hemolytic activity of alpha HL at concentrations (IC50 = 65 +/- 5 mu M) below minimal inhibitory concentration values for S. aureus growth. Quercetin increased the registered bacterial cell diameter, enhanced the fluidity of the inner and surface regions of bacterial cell membranes and raised the rigidity of the hydrophobic region and the fluidity of the surface region of erythrocyte membranes. Our findings provide evidence that the antibacterial activities of the flavonoids resulted from a disorder in the structural organization of bacterial cell membranes, and the antihemolytic effect of quercetin was related to the effect of the flavonoid on the organization of the erythrocyte membrane, which, in turn, increases the resistance of the target cells (erythrocytes) to alpha HL and inhibits alpha HL-induced osmotic hemolysis due to prevention of toxin incorporation into the target membrane. We confirmed that cell membrane disorder could be one of the direct modes of antibacterial action of the flavonoids.

AB  - This study extends observations on the effects of intra-vaginal progesterone treatment on the relationships between the time of luteolysis, emergence of the ovulatory follicle, timing of estrus and ewe fertility. Observations were made in progesterone -treated ewes in autumn, the spring equinox and late spring (Experiment 1, Data set 1) and in progesterone -treated ewes and naturally cycling ewes in autumn and the spring equinox (Experiment 1, Data set 2). In Data set 1, the day of emergence of both the first and second ovulatory follicle was positively related to the day luteal regression within each season. In turn, the day of emergence influenced the timing of estrus by means of a season by day of luteal regression interaction (P < 0.001) indicating that the relationship was positive in autumn and the spring equinox but negative in late spring. In autumn, older ovulatory follicles were associated with an earlier onset of estrus compared with younger ovulatory follicles. In late spring, this relationship was reversed and was influenced by whether or not ewes were cycling at the time of pessary insertion. In Data set 2, the relationship between the day of follicle emergence and luteal regression was influenced by a treatment by day of regression interaction indicating the relationship was positive in treated ewes and negative in naturally cycling ewes. Timing of estrus was positively related (P < 0.001) to both the day of luteal regression and the day of follicle emergence (P < 0.05), with both relationships being stronger in naturally cycling ewes than in treated ewes. In Experiment 2, pregnancy rate following artificial insemination in autumn was highest (90.2%) when luteolysis occurred during Days 7-9 of the pessary period compared with Days 1-6 (77.8%, P = 0.16), 10 to 12 (68.8%, P < 0.05) or Days >= 13 (71.2%, P < 0.05). Timing of estrus was not affected. The mean diameter of ovulatory follicles that emerged during Days 7-9 was larger on Day 12 (5.8 +/- 0.13 mm) compared with other periods (range 4.7 +/- 0.05 to 5.6 +/- 0.14 mm). This study provides two potential strategies to improve the success of AI programs. Firstly, appropriately timed treatment with PGF2a to control the time of emergence of ovulatory follicles and, secondly, earlier treatment with eCG to improve the development of ovulatory follicles that emerge late in the pessary period. Each is likely to be influenced by season and the cyclical status of the ewe. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The hippocampal formation contains neurons responsive to an animal's current location and orientation, which together provide the organism with a neural map of space.1-3 1-3 Spatially tuned neurons rely on external landmark cues and internally generated movement information to estimate position.4,5 4,5 An important class of landmark cue are the boundaries delimiting an environment, which can define place cell field position6,' 6, ' and stabilize grid cell firing.8 8 However, the precise nature of the sensory information used to detect boundaries remains unknown. We used 2-dimensional virtual reality (VR)9 9 to show that visual cues from elevated walls surrounding the environment are both sufficient and necessary to stabilize place and grid cell responses in VR, when only visual and self-motion cues are available. By contrast, flat boundaries formed by the edges of a textured floor did not stabilize place and grid cells, indicating only specific forms of visual boundary stabilize hippocampal spatial firing. Unstable grid cells retain internally coherent, hexagonally arranged firing fields, but these fields "drift"with respect to the virtual environment over periods >5 s. Optic flow from a virtual floor does not slow drift dynamics, emphasizing the importance of boundary-related visual information. Surprisingly, place fields are more stable close to boundaries even with floor and wall cues removed, suggesting invisible boundaries are inferred using the motion of a discrete, separate cue (a beacon signaling reward location). Subsets of place cells show allocentric directional tuning toward the beacon, with strength of tuning correlating with place field stability when boundaries are removed.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: As a typical prescription for soothing the liver, Xiangshao granule has a good effect on the symptoms of irritability and anxiety. Clinical evidence suggests that it has significant efficacy in the treatment of Premenstrual dysphoria disorder (PMDD). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear.Aim of the study: PMDD is a common disease in women of childbearing age, seriously affecting their family, society, and daily work life. The registered herbal medicine, Xiangshao granules, is used for relieving PMDD dysphoria and irritability symptoms with excellent efficacy in China. This study was focused on the deep intervention mechanism of Xiangshao granules in treating PMDD. Materials and methods: The vaginal smear and open field test were used to screen rats in nonreception phase of estrus cycle with similar macroscopic behaviors and regular estrus cycle. The rat model of PMDD irritability was established through social isolation and residential invasion, with which, the irritability symptoms of PMDD patients with menstrual cycle dependence was also well simulated. Elevated plus Maze Test and Social inter -action activities were used to measure the anxiety-like behavior of rats. TUNEL Staining and Hematoxylin-Eosin staining were used to measure apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluores-cence were used to measure the expression of GR, JIK, p-JIK, p38, P-P38, JNK, caspase 3, and caspase 12.Results: In this study, Xiangshao granules showed consistent therapeutic effects similar with those in clinic, significantly reducing aggressive and anxiety-like behaviors with improved social skills in PMDD rats. In mechanism, Xiangshao granules lowered the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons and weakened the morphological damage of the hippocampal brain evidenced by the decreased mRNA and protein expression of glucocorticoid receptor, caspase-3, and caspase-12. In addition, administration of Xiangshao granules led to the decreased expression of JIK in the PMDD irritability rat model which agreed well with the previous studies. The JNK/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway is abnormally activated in the hippocampal brain region of PMDD rats, while treated with Xiangshao granules could increase JIK expression and inhibit the abnormal activation of the JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway, effectively reducing the stress damage in the hippocampus.Conclusions: Xiangshao Granules Reduce the Aggressive Behavior and Hippocampal Injury of Premenstrual Ir-ritability in Rats by Regulating JIK/JNK/p38 Signal Pathway.

AB  - Lack of sleep, whether acute or chronic, is quite common and negatively affects an individual's memory and cognitive function. The question of whether chronic sleep deprivation (CSD) causes cognitive impairment to arise and progress is not well studied. To investigate the effects of CSD on memory and cognition, this study began by establishing a CSD mouse model. Behavioral experiments on animals revealed that CSD induced cognitive behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of Alzheimer's disease. Western blot experiments further demonstrated a considerable increase in amyloid-beta (A beta) expression in the mouse brain following CSD. Meanwhile, the hub gene Prkcg was searched for in the cerebellum using RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis. PKC gamma (Prkcg) expression was significantly reduced, as demonstrated by RT-qPCR and Western blot validations. Additionally, CSD was associated with downregulated CREB expression, decreased expression of the endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE1), and increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 downstream of PKC gamma. These findings suggested that CSD down-regulated PKC gamma expression, decreased ECE1 expression, impaired A beta degradation, and affected the PKC gamma/ERK/CREB pathway and the synthesis of memory-related proteins. Overall, this study highlighted how CSD modulated PKC gamma-related metabolism, impacting A beta clearance and the production of memory-related proteins. Such insights are crucial for understanding and preventing sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) associated with CSD.

AB  - Mutations in SHANK genes play an undisputed role in neuropsychiatric disorders. Until now, research has focused on the postsynaptic function of SHANKs, and prominent postsynaptic alterations in glutamatergic signal transmission have been reported in Shank KO mouse models. Recent studies have also suggested a possible presynaptic function of SHANK proteins, but these remain poorly defined. In this study, we examined how SHANK2 can mediate electrophysiological, molecular, and behavioral effects by conditionally overexpressing either wild-type SHANK2A or the extrasynaptic SHANK2A(R462X) variant. SHANK2A overexpression affected pre- and postsynaptic targets and revealed a reversible, development-dependent autism spectrum disorder-like behavior. SHANK2A also mediated redistribution of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors between apical and basal hippocampal CA1 dendrites, leading to impaired synaptic plasticity in the basal dendrites. Moreover, SHANK2A overexpression reduced social interaction and increased the excitatory noise in the olfactory cortex during odor processing. In contrast, overexpression of the extrasynaptic SHANK2A(R462X) variant did not impair hippocampal synaptic plasticity, but still altered the expression of presynaptic/axonal signaling proteins. We also observed an attention-deficit/hyperactivity-like behavior and improved social interaction along with enhanced signal-to-noise ratio in cortical odor processing. Our results suggest that the disruption of pre- and postsynaptic SHANK2 functions caused by SHANK2 mutations has a strong impact on social behavior. These findings indicate that pre- and postsynaptic SHANK2 actions cooperate for normal neuronal function, and that an imbalance between these functions may lead to different neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Native to South Africa and Madagascar, the invasive fireweed, Senecio madagascariensis Poiret (Asteraceae), is a target for biological control in Australia and Hawaii, where substantial infestations persist. Earlier studies in the weed's region of origin, namely KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa, assessed the seasonal abundance of stem-boring insect herbivores in S. madagascariensis populations. The weevil Gasteroclisus tricostalis (Thunberg) (Curculionidae) and moth Metamesia elegans (Walsingham) (Tortricidae) were prioritised as candidate agents for Australia due to their persistence across seasons. In this study, the host ranges of these two candidate agents were assessed by comparing the stem-boring curculionids and lepidopterans that are associated with S. madagascariensis with those associated with non-target Senecio species in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands region. DNA barcoding of the adults and endophagous larvae recovered during field sampling of S. madagascariensis and 17 non-target Senecio species in 2017/18, as well as those from earlier field surveys, was used to differentiate the insect species and elucidate their host-plant affinities. Although weevil larvae were recovered from the stems of seven non-target Senecio species, G. tricostalis was associated only with Senecio inaequidens DC. and Senecio skirrhodon DC., both in the S. madagascariensis species complex. Lepidopteran larvae were associated with three non-target Senecio species, all in the S. madagascariensis species complex, with M. elegans associated only with Senecio harveianus MacOwan and S. inaequidens. These results suggest that G. tricostalis and M. elegans have restricted host ranges and that further host-specificity studies in quarantine are warranted to demonstrate their suitability for release.

AB  - This study aimed to provide a low-cost technique for virus detection in wastewater by improving an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation method. The releasing efficiency of viruses trapped by the aluminum hydroxide precipitates was improved by adding ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na) to dissolve the precipitates at a Na(2)EDTA center dot 2H(2)O:AlCl3 molar ratio of 1.8-3.6. The recovery rates of the improved method for seven viruses, including SARS-CoV-2-abEN pseudovirus and six animal viruses, were 5.9-22.3% in tap water and 4.9-35.1% in wastewater. Rotavirus A (9.0-4.5 X 10(3) copies/mL), porcine circovirus type 2 (5.8-6.4 X 10(5) copies/mL), and porcine parvovirus (5.6-2.7 X 10(4) copies/mL) were detected in China's pig farm wastewater, while rotavirus A (2.0 X 10(3) copies/mL) was detected in hospital wastewater. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in hospital wastewater (8.4 X 10(2) to 1.4 X 10(4) copies/mL), sewage (6.4 X 10 to 2.3 X 10(3) copies/mL), and river water (6.6 X 10 to 9.3 X 10 copies/mL) in Nepal. The method was automized, with a rate of recovery of 4.8 +/- 1.4% at a virus concentration of 10(2) copies/mL. Thus, the established method could be used for wastewater-based epidemiology with sufficient sensitivity in coping with the COVID-19 epidemic and other virus epidemics.

AB  - Spermidine (SPD) is a widely recognized polyamine compound found in mammalian cells and plays a key role in various cellular processes. We propose that SPD may enhance placental vascular development in pregnant sows, leading to increased birth weight of piglets. Six hundred and nine sows at 60 days of gestation were randomly assigned into a basal diet (CON group), basal diet supplemented 10 mg/kg of SPD (SPD1 group), and basal diet supplemented 20 mg/kg of SPD (SPD2 group), respectively. Compared with the CON, SPD1 significantly increased the average number of healthy piglets per litter and the placental efficiency ( P < .05), while the average number of mummified fetus per litter and the percentage of weak piglets significantly decreased ( P < .05). In the plasma metabolomics, SPD content in plasma of sows ( P = .075) and umbilical cord plasma of piglets ( P = .078) had an increasing trend in response to SPD1. Furthermore, SPD1 increased the expression of the vascular endothelial cell marker protein, platelet endothelial cell adhesionmolecule-1 (PECAM-1/CD31) and the density of placental stromal vessels ( P < .05). Moreover, as compared to CON, SPD2 significantly decreased the average number of mummified fetus per litter ( P < .05), while the placental efficiency and the expression of amino acid transporter solute carrier (SLC) family 7, member7 ( SLC7A7 ) and glucose transporters SLC2A2) and SLC5A4 in placental tissue significantly increased ( P < .05). These results suggest that maternal supplementation of SPD during pregnancy increased healthy litter number, and promoted placental tissue development. Our findings provide evidence that maternal SPD has the potential to improve the production performance of sows. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The objective of this study was to define a more practical and reliable alternative to manual temperament classification methods that rely on the behavioral responses of animals individually subjected to various tests. Specifically, this study evaluated the correlation between facial image information and temperament based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to predict the temperament of lambs based on their facial images. In the first phase, the lambs were categorized as to their temperament based on data acquired from a behavioral test to establish a ground truth for the temperament of the lambs. This enabled us to train (70%), validate (20%), and test (10%) deep-learning models in the second phase based on facial images and the corresponding temperament labels derived from the behavioral test. The performance of a custom deep convolutional neural network (C-DCNN) was compared to that of pre-trained VGG19 and Xception models for image classification. The Xception model achieved a training accuracy of 81%, which indicated that it learned well the underlying patterns in the data; however, lower validation (0.75) and test (0.58) accuracies indicate that it overfit the training data and did not generalize well to new samples. The VGG19 model, produced lower training (0.59), validation (0.46), and test (0.34) accuracies, which indicated that it did not learn the underlying patterns in the data as well as the Xception model. Furthermore, its precision (0.47), recall (0.42), and F1 score (0.41) indicated that the model performed poorly in identifying the classes correctly. The C-DCNN produced a moderate accuracy of 60%, which indicated that the model was able to predict the temperament traits of lambs with an accuracy of 60%, which was better than random guessing (33% accuracy), and demonstrated the potential of this approach in assessing temperament. The C-DCNN precision (0.69), recall (0.61) and F1 score (0.63) indicated that it had a moderate ability to correctly identify positive cases; however, the small size of the original dataset remains a limitation of the study because it might have caused the suboptimal performance of the models. To validate this approach, further research is needed based on a larger and more diverse dataset. We will continue to investigate the potential of deep learning and computer vision to predict animal personality traits from facial images based on large, diverse datasets, which might lead to more efficient and objective methods for assessing animal temperament and improving animal welfare.

AB  - The 5xFAD mouse model shows age-related weight loss as well as cognitive and motor deficits. Metabolic dysregulation, especially impaired insulin signaling, is also present in AD. This study examined whether intranasal delivery of insulin (INI) at low (0.875 U) or high (1.750 U) doses would ameliorate these deficits compared to saline in 10-month-old female 5xFAD and B6SJL wildtype (WT) mice. INI increased forelimb grip strength in the wire hang test in 5xFAD mice in a dose-dependent manner but did not improve the performance of 5xFAD mice on the balance beam. High INI doses reduced frailty scores in 5xFAD mice and improved spatial memory in both acquisition and reversal probe trials in the Morris water maze. INI increased swim speed in 5xFAD mice but had no effect on object recognition memory or working memory in the spontaneous alternation task, nor did it improve memory in the contextual or cued fear memory tasks. High doses of insulin increased the liver, spleen, and kidney weights and reduced brown adipose tissue weights. P-Akt signaling in the hippocampus was increased by insulin in a dose-dependent manner. Altogether, INI increased strength, reduced frailty scores, and improved visual spatial memory. Hypoglycemia was not present after INI, however alterations in tissue and organ weights were present. These results are novel and important as they indicate that intra-nasal insulin can reverse cognitive, motor and frailty deficits found in this mouse model of AD.

AB  - Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is one of the most important enzymes in base excision repair. Studies on this enzyme have been conducted for a long time, but some aspects of its activity remain poorly understood. One such question concerns the mechanism of damaged-nucleotide recognition by the enzyme, and the answer could shed light on substrate specificity control in all enzymes of this class. In the present study, by pulsed electron-electron double resonance (DEER, also known as PELDOR) spectroscopy and pre-steady-state kinetic analysis along with wild-type (WT) APE1 from Danio rerio (zAPE1) or three mutants (carrying substitution N253G, A254G, or E260A), we aimed to elucidate the molecular events in the process of damage recognition. The data revealed that the zAPE1 mutant E260A has much higher activity toward DNA substrates containing 5,6-dihydro-2 & PRIME;-deoxyuridine (DHU), 2 & PRIME;-deoxyuridine (dU), alpha-2 & PRIME;-deoxyadenosine (& alpha;A), or 1,N6-ethenoadenosine (& epsilon;A). Examination of conformational changes in DNA clearly revealed multistep DNA rearrangements during the formation of the catalytic complex. These structural rearrangements of DNA are directly associated with the capacity of damaged DNA for enzyme-induced bending and unwinding, which are required for eversion of the damaged nucleotide from the DNA duplex and for its placement into the active site of the enzyme. Taken together, the results experimentally prove the factors that control substrate specificity of the AP endonuclease zAPE1.

AB  - Honeydew produced by insects is not only recognized as a nutrient-rich substance for natural enemies, influencing their survival, development, and reproduction but also a source of volatiles that regulate the foraging behavior of natural enemies. Hippodamia variegata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is an effective predatory natural enemy of Aphis gossypii (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in Xinjiang, China. However, the functional significance of honeydew volatiles from A. gossypii for H. variegata remains largely unclear. Here we reported that H. variegata adults were attracted by the crude honeydew of A. gossypii, and we identified fifteen volatiles using headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS). Electroantennogram (EAG) results showed that H. variegata exhibits a significant dose-dependent response to nine volatiles from honeydew. Y-tube olfactometer and cage predation tests showed that 1-heptanol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 2-phenylethanol, and 2methyl-1-propanol attracted H. variegata adults. Furthermore, our study also elucidated the relationship between honeydew compounds and microorganisms. The findings demonstrated that the compounds 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 2-phenylethanol, and 2-methyl-1-propanol originate from five distinct cultivable bacteria identified using the 16S rRNA markers. Our results provide potential eco-friendly strategies for enhancing biological control of aphids.

AB  - Simple Summary Asthma is one of the leading problems affecting the lower airways in equids. At the same time, palatal disorders, including primary palatal instability and dorsal displacement of the soft palate, are common problems affecting the equine upper airways. In human medicine, "one airway, one disease" is a widely accepted concept describing the anatomical, physiological, and immunological connections between upper and lower airways. Clinical studies have already highlighted co-occurrences and associations between lower airway diseases, such as asthma, and upper airway diseases, such as rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, vocal cord dysfunction, or obstructing sleep apnea in people. However, only a few studies have explored co-occurrences and associations between asthma and palatal disorder in horses. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of palatal disorders in horses affected by severe asthma in exacerbation and to assess whether a decrease can be observed after treatment-induced disease remission. The presence of palatal disorders was investigated by overground endoscopy in forty-six horses diagnosed with severe equine asthma before and after asthma treatment. Palatal disorders were diagnosed less frequently in remission after asthma treatment than during exacerbation before treatment, suggesting that both asthma and palatal disorders may respond to similar treatment plans. According to the "unified or united airway disease" theory, diseases in the upper and lower airways frequently co-occur because they represent a single morphological and functional unit. Palatal disorders (PDs) and severe equine asthma (SEA) are frequent diseases that, respectively, affect upper and lower equine airways; however, clinical studies focusing on the co-occurrence of PDs and SEA are limited. The present study investigated the prevalence of PDs in horses affected by SEA, and whether prevalence decreased after SEA treatment. Forty-six privately owned horses affected by SEA in exacerbation were included. For each horse, the severity of the asthma clinical signs was assessed using a previously described scoring system, and the co-occurrence of palatal disorders was investigated using overground endoscopy, before and after treatment for SEA. Before treatment (in exacerbation), 67.4% of SEA-affected horses showed evidence of PDs, including 39.1% showing evidence of palatal instability (PI) and 28.3% of dorsal displacement of the soft palate (DDSP). Airway inflammation (neutrophil percentage in the tracheal wash and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) was worse in horses with co-occurring PDs. After treatment (in remission), no horses showed evidence of PI, while DDSP was diagnosed in 8.7% of horses. These findings suggest that palatal disorders respond to asthma treatment, supporting the hypothesis that both diseases could be manifestation of a common underlying disorder.

AB  - Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding 8 (CHD8) is a gene that poses a high risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurological development delay. Nevertheless, the impact of CHD8 haploinsufficiency on both hippocampus neurogenesis and behavior remains uncertain. Here, we performed behavioral assessments on male and female CHD8 heterozygous mice. The study discovered that both male and female CHD8 heterozygous mice displayed an impairment in preference for social novelty. Concurrently, CHD8 heterozygous mice exhibited anxiety-like behavior. However, its cognitive capacity for learning and memory is within the expected range. Furthermore, we discovered a reduction in the number of both immature and mature new neurons in mice with CHD8 heterozygous, resulting in an impeded neurogenesis process in the hippocampus. Taken together, our findings indicate that CHD8 plays a crucial role in the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis, and further suggest that ASD-like behaviors observed in CHD8 heterozygous mice may be associated with disruptions in hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Bone scaffolds are essential in regenerative medicine treatments for bone defects, fractures, and disease. Despite the popularity in bone scaffold research, many challenges still remain including mechanical strength. This study focuses on compression analysis of 10 novel bone scaffold designs with each design created using Rhino 7 with the Grasshopper extension. This coding software took existing scaffold design equations and converted them into 3D models utilizing code based on previous studies. The equations were created by combining and manipulating popular equations used for bone scaffold fabrication. The scaffold models were 3D printed using SimuBone, a PLA biomaterial known for its bone-like properties and printability. The results concluded that Design 6 had the highest compression modulus and mass/density, while Design 9 had a moderate compression modulus and mass/density. Design 8 had the lowest compression modulus and Design 2 had the lowest mass/density. Additionally, Design 6 exhibits the highest stiffness but increased weight, and Design 8 performs the worst in these categories. Therefore, Design 2 was the most optimal for balancing stiffness, mass, and density. The evolution of failure between all 10 designs was also analyzed. This concluded that Design 9 and Design 6 had the highest strength with minimal collapse. Design 8 had the lowest strength with little to no collapse, while Design 2 had medium compression strength with significant collapse. Although Design 2 was found to have significant collapse, it is still considered the most optimal scaffold within this study due to having the best overall mass/density ratio and stiffness modulus with a moderate compression strength.

AB  - In solid tumors, hypoxia facilitates malignant progression of cancer cells by triggering epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stemness. Fascin-1, an actin-bundling protein, takes part in the formation of many actin-based cellular structures. In the present study, we explored the potential functions of hypoxia-induced upregulation of Fascin-1 in liver cancer. Transcriptome RNA-sequencing was conducted to identify hypoxia-related genes. The potential functions of Fascin-1 were evaluated by western blot, transwell migration and invasion assays, sphere-formation assay, tumor xenograft growth, gelatin zymography analysis, immunofluorescence, cell viability assay, soft agar assay, and flow cytometry. We found that Fascin-1 was upregulated by hypoxia in liver cancer cell lines, elevated in liver cancer patients and correlated with larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and shorter overall survival. Knockdown of Fascin-1 suppressed migration, invasion, EMT, stemness, and tumor xenograft growth of liver cancer cells under both normoxia and hypoxia conditions, while forced Fascin-1 expression showed opposite effects. Moreover, hypoxia-induced upregulation of Fascin-1 was regulated by the Akt/Rac1 signaling, and inhibition of Akt/Rac1 signaling by EHop-016 and MK-2206 restrained migration, invasion, EMT, and stemness of liver cancer cells under hypoxia. Furthermore, Fascin-1 knockdown suppressed MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression, impaired actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, inactivated Hippo/YAP signaling, and increased Sorafenib sensitivity in liver cancer cells. Our study provided a novel insight of Fascin-1 in regulating migration, invasion, EMT, and stemness of liver cancer cells under normoxia and hypoxia conditions.

AB  - Salmonella spp. control in pork supply chains has always been a challenging issue and insufficient control can lead to high social and economic consequences. Conventional risk management and risk management approaches and models are not sufficient to address potential food safety shocks caused by Salmonella spp., as they mainly focus on assessing measures to reduce Salmonella spp. risks instead of developing the resilience capability (e.g., flexibility to adapt to sudden changes in the risks). Our study is the first that incorporated the resilience concept to the quantitative modeling of Salmonella spp. spread in the pork supply chain. The objective of this study was to explore the resilience performance of the pork supply chain under different food safety shocks caused by Salmonella spp., and to investigate the effectiveness of interventions on reducing the impact of these shocks on the resilience performance of the chain. Scenario analysis indicated that the effectiveness of the investigated resilience strategies or interventions depended on the risk profile (i.e., default, minimum, maximum level of Salmonella spp. contamination) of the pork supply chain. For pork supply chains with minimum and default risk profiles, more attention should be paid to increasing resilience of pigs towards Salmonella spp. infection. For supply chains with maximum risk profile, the focus should be on improving the performance of the slaughterhouse, such as careful evisceration, logistic slaughtering. To conclude, enhancing resilience performance of the pork supply chain can contribute to a safe pork supply.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review was to quantify the impact of isthmocele and its treatment on fertility. The review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines, and the meta-analysis according to the MOOSE guidelines. The meta-analysis of data from 29 studies showed that 43% (rate 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.54; n = 2038) of women with a symptomatic isthmocele reported secondary infertility as a presenting symptom (quality of evidence [QOE)]: very low). In the IVF setting, women with an isthmocele were shown to have a lower live birth rate (LBR) than women with a previous Caesarean section without an isthmocele (odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% CI 0.49-0.66; n = 7719, eight studies) (QOE: high). Ten studies reported the LBR after isthmocele hysteroscopic repair in a cohort of infertile women (LBR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.77; QOE: very low). Seven studies reported the LBR after isthmocele laparoscopic repair (LBR 0.51, 95% CI 0.40-0.63; QOE: very low). The combination of these findings suggests that isthmoceles play a role in the pathophysiology of infertility. Hysteroscopic and laparoscopic surgical repair emerged as promising options for the treatment of infertility in women with an isthmocele. To provide comprehensive counselling, these findings must be communicated to patients, together with the weaknesses of the underlying evidence.

AB  - Simple Summary Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2) vaccination is a widespread measure that effectively reduces infection prevalence in swine farms. However, this tool has failed to eradicate the infection, probably because of the persistence of PCV2 in the environment of the farms. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of PCV2 in different areas of swine farms to identify critical points which may act as possible viral reservoirs. Four farrow-to-wean long-term vaccinated farms were studied, sampling different surfaces from animal and non-animal areas and analyzing them by qPCR to detect and quantify the PCV2 load. The results show the near absence of PCV2 in animal areas; in contrast, the virus is frequently detected in offices, farm staff clothing and the farm perimeter. As PCV2 vaccination does not provide sterilizing immunity, the detected viral load is probably the result of low shedding from subclinically infected animals on the farm; thus, PCV2 would tend to accumulate in areas not cleaned and disinfected regularly. Nevertheless, an external source of PCV2 cannot be totally ruled out. This study shows the existence of potential critical points for PCV2 persistence in vaccinated farms, indicating the need of considering them for future eradication plans. Vaccination against Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2) even over several years has proven as an insufficient measure to eradicate the infection from farms, possibly due to not producing sterilizing immunity. Viral persistence in the farm environment has been proposed as a possible cause of reinfection, and for that reason, the main objective of this study was to identify potential critical points where PCV2 could persist in farrow-to-wean farms which had been vaccinating piglets for years. Surface samples were collected from different farm facilities with and without animals and analyzed by qPCR to detect and quantify the viral load. Most of the samples taken in animal housing facilities tested negative (96.6%); however, PCV2 was more frequently detected in samples from the offices (37.5%), the farm staff (25%) and the perimeter (21%). These results indicate that PCV2 contamination is frequent in facilities despite the long-term use of vaccination programs. Therefore, PCV2 control programs should include more exhaustive cleaning and disinfection protocols in non-animal facilities, as well as the implementation of specific biosecurity measures in these areas to minimize the risk of PCV2 introduction from external sources.

AB  - Depression and anxiety are common neuropsychiatric symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), reflecting reduced quality of life in patients with PD. Silibinin (silybin), a flavonoid extracted and isolated from the fruit of Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn, is widely used for the treatment of hepatic diseases. We report here that silibinin shows anti-depressant and anti-anxiety effects on 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced model mice with PD. All the results of open field test, elevated plus maze test, tail suspension test and forced swimming test demonstrated that silibinin administration significantly attenuated MPTP-induced depression/anxiety. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and Nissl staining results showed that MPTP injection caused the damage of hippocampal neurons, but this was ameliorated by oral administration of silibinin. Silibinin significantly restored hippocampal levels of 5-hydroxyptramine (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA), two important neurotransmitters for regulating mood, which decreased in MPTP-injected mice. Neuroinflammation, as reflected by the increased expressions of IL-1 beta, TNF alpha and IFN-beta, was marked in the hippocampus of MPTP-treated mice, accompanying increased stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3). Silibinin administration, however, down-regulated the levels of IL-1 beta, TNF alpha and IFN-beta, as well as STING and IRF3, protecting MPTP-induced PD model mice. These findings indicate that silibinin has a potential of being further developed as a therapeutic for depression and anxiety in PD.

AB  - Vitamin K2/ Menaquinones produced predominantly by the gut microbiome improve bone health and prevent coronary calcification. The central nervous system has been linked with gut microbiota via the gut-brain axis and is strongly associated with psychiatric conditions. In the present study, we show the role of Vitamin K2 (MK-7) in gut dysbiosis-associated cognitive decline. Gut dysbiosis was induced in mice by administering Ampicillin (250 mg/kg twice a day orally) for 14 days and Vitamin K2 (0.05 mg/kg) for 21 days with or without antibiotic treatment and altered gene expression profile of intestinal microbes determined. This was followed by behavioural studies to determine cognitive changes. The behavioural observations are then correlated with proinflammatory, oxidative, and brain and intestinal histopathological changes in antibiotic-treated animals with or without vitamin K2 administration. With the use of antibiotics, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Firmicutes, and Clostridium's relative abundance reduced. When vitamin K2 was added to the medication, their levels were restored. Cognitive impairment was observed in behavioural trials in the antibiotic group, but this drop was restored in mice given both an antibiotic and vitamin K. Myeloperoxidase levels in the colon and brain increased due to gut dysbiosis, which vitamin K2 prevented. The acetylcholine esterase and oxidative stress markers brought on by antibiotics were also decreased by vitamin K2. Additionally, vitamin K2 guarded against alterations in intestine ultrastructure brought on by antibiotic use and preserved hippocampus neurons. So, it can be concluded that vitamin K2 improved cognitive skills, avoided hippocampus neuronal damage from antibiotics, and lowered intestine and brain inflammation and oxidative stress.

AB  - Although extensive and untreated pain that occurs during a critical developmental window may impair cognition later in life, environmental interventions early in life might promote cognition. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Our current study utilized a rat model of "repetitive needle pricks" from the day of birth (P0) to postnatal day 7 (P7) to mimic the painful experience of preterm neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit. Enriched environment (EE) during development period (from P15 to P70) was implemented as a nonpharmacological intervention approach. Electrophysiological recording, behavioral tests, and biochemical analysis were performed after the end of EE (between P71 and P80). The results showed neonatal repetitive pain resulted in a reduction in mechanical withdrawal thresholds by the von Frey test in P70 (p < .001). Furthermore, neonatal repetitive pain impaired spatial learning and memory (p < .05) and even led to dysfunction in fear memory (p < .01). In contrast, EE rescued neonatal pain-induced cognitive deficits and normalized hippocampal long-term potentiation in rats exposed to neonatal pain (p << .05). The beneficial effect of EE might be the improvements in hippocampal synaptic plasticity via upregulating neurotrophic factors and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the hippocampus. Our findings provide evidence that early environmental intervention might be a safe strategy to overcome neurodevelopmental abnormalities in preterm infants who experienced multiple procedural painful events during the early critical period.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is a major air pollutant. However, few studies have been extended beyond the histopathological changes in the olfactory mucosa to the impact of NH3 exposure on other parts of the olfactory system and olfactory functioning. Therefore, we assessed the effects of exogenous NH3 (either 20 ppm for the low exposure group or 200 ppm for the high exposure group) on the various parts of the olfactory system by histological observation, gene expression, immunochemistry, and chemical analyses. A total of 140 Institute of Cancer Research mice (4 weeks old), 70 females and 70 males (average body weight at the start: 21.5 +/- 1.9 g), were used. The exposure lasted for 4 weeks, and the mice were exposed to the NH3 for 4 h per day. Our results showed that chronic exposure to NH3 damaged the olfactory system, with consequences for changing the foraging behavior and anxiety behavior. Our results also suggest that it is plausible that NH3 recruited T cells and activated microglia cells and astrocytes, leading to inflammation in the olfactory system. Increased release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and interferon-gamma) and reduced release of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IFN-beta) led to tissue damage and compromised the functions of the olfactory system.

AB  - Optimal management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) endotypes includes post-operative application of topical formulations. There is little evidence regarding the ideal aerosol delivery characteristics and techniques to achieve the most efficient deposition on affected sinus mucosa. Nebulisers provide an alternative to nasal sprays by producing smaller particle sizes at lower velocities. We applied a reverse-particle-tracking simulation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to evaluate the ideal aerosol characteristics from a nebuliser to target the post-operative maxillary sinus mucosa. A CT scan of a CRS patient was used to create a pre-operative and virtual post-operative model. Particles of diameter 2 to 30 mu m were tracked through the sinonasal cavity at 5, 10 and 15 L min(-1) flow rates using CFD. Reverse particle simulations demonstrated that the optimised combination of parameters were 20 mu m particles, delivered at 5 m s(-1) (or 14 microns, delivered at 15 m s(-1)) at an inhalation rate of 5 L min(-1), released from a nozzle in an elliptical oblique-superior direction into the superior half of the nasal valve significantly improved the maximum deposition efficiency (from 3% up to 55%) in the post-operative maxillary sinus mucosa. The nebulised spray (without optimisation) demonstrated negligible particle deposition within the sinuses of the pre-op model, while it increased marginally in the post-op model for smaller diameter particles at lower inhalation rates. The ideal combination of parameters to achieve targeted medication deposition on specific sinus mucosal surfaces can guide the development of new nasal drug delivery devices that produce the desired deposition regions for clinical applications in post-operative CRS patients.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is one of the most valuable woody edible-oil crops, and anthracnose seriously afflicts its yield and quality. We recently showed that the CfSnt2 regulates the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum fructicola, the dominant causal agent of anthracnose on C. oleifera. However, the molecular mechanisms of CfSnt2-mediated pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Here, we found that CfSnt2 is localized to the nucleus to regulate the deacetylation of histone H3. The further transcriptomic analysis revealed that CfSnt2 mediates the expression of global genes, including most autophagy-related genes. Furthermore, we provided evidence showing that CfSnt2 negatively regulates autophagy and is involved in the responses to host-derived ROS and ER stresses. These combined functions contribute to the pivotal roles of CfSnt2 on pathogenicity. Taken together, our studies not only illustrate how CfSnt2 functions in the nucleus, but also link its roles on the autophagy and responses to host-derived stresses with pathogenicity in C. fructicola.

AB  - Stress hormones such as cortisol play a critical role in depressive disorders. Therefore, corticosterone has been used to develop a depression model in animals. Our previous studies found that the precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) and its receptors are upregulated in depression in human and animal models. In the present study, we aimed to examine whether proBDNF and mature BDNF (mBDNF) are altered in the corticosterone-induced depression model in mice. Male and female mice were given corticosterone dissolved in 0.3% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) or vehicle (beta-CD) in drinking water for 33 days. We have found that corticosterone induced depressive-like behaviours as reflected by increased immobility time in the tail suspension test and decreased grooming time in the splash test. Corticosterone also induced anxiety-like behaviours as represented by decreased entries into the central zone of the open field test and the open arms of the elevated plus maze test. We found that corticosterone administration resulted in differential changes of proBDNF and mature BDNF in different brain regions and peripheral tissues. ProBDNF was increased in the hippocampus and cerebellum, but no change was found in the prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus. Both proBDNF and mBDNF were significantly increased in the pituitary gland. In contrast, proBDNF was significantly decreased in the adrenal gland. There were no significant changes in proBDNF or mBDNF in other peripheral tissues, including the liver and sex organs. We conclude that the stress hormone corticosterone causes depressive behaviours but differentially regulates the processing of proBDNF in mice. ProBDNF may participate in the development of depression behaviours in corticosterone treated animals.

AB  - BackgroundMucormycosis is a rare but critical infection. Due to its rarity, there is scarce evidence about the longitudinal changes in the epidemiology of mucormycosis in the US.ObjectivesWe investigated the longitudinal epidemiology, detailed clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes of patients with mucormycosis within the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) over 20-year period.Patients/MethodsAll adult patients who were admitted to an acute-care hospital with a diagnosis of mucormycosis within the VHA from January 2003 to December 2022.ResultsOur study included 201 patients from 68 hospitals. Incidence rates of mucormycosis increased from 1.9 per 100,000 hospitalisations in 2003 to 3.3 per 100,000 hospitalisations in 2022, with a peak incidence at 5.9 per 100,000 hospitalisations in 2021, when the Delta wave of COVID-19 hit the US. Rhino-orbital (37.3%) and pulmonary mucormycosis (36.8%) were the most common types of infection. Diabetes mellitus (59.1%) and leukaemia (28.9%) were most common comorbidities predisposing to mucormycosis. Use of posaconazole or isavuconazole increased over time. The 90-day and 1-year mortalities were 35.3% and 49.8%, respectively. The mortality was lower in more recent years (2013-2017, 2018-2022) compared to earlier years (2003-2007). Age >= 65 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.47, 95% CI 1.59-7.40), leukaemia as a comorbidity (aOR: 2.66, 95% CI 1.22-5.89) and central nervous system infection (aOR: 10.59, 95% CI 2.81-44.57) were significantly associated with higher 90-day mortality.ConclusionsOur longitudinal cohort study suggests the increasing incidence rates but lower mortality of mucormycosis over this 20-year period.

AB  - Mucormycosis (MCM) is a serious invasive fungal disease (IFD) that is associated with high mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. A global surge in MCM cases was reported with the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed all recorded cases of MCM at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), a tertiary care center in Lebanon, over 14 years. We aimed to identify the incidence, seasonal variation, clinical characteristics of the patients, and predictors of mortality. We conducted a retrospective chart review between 1 January 2008 and 1 January 2023. All patients with proven or probable MCM were included in the study. Proven or probable MCM was defined by positive histopathology and/or positive cultures. A total of 43 patients were identified as having MCM. Their median age was 53 years, and the majority were males (58.1%). Most of the cases were diagnosed in the autumn season. In total, 67.4% of the patients had hematological malignancies (HMs), and 34.9% had uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM). The most common site of involvement was rhino-orbital-cerebral MCM (ROCM) (74%). The annual cases of MCM per 100,000 patient days increased markedly during the years of the COVID-19 pandemic (from 0 to 4.4 cases/100,000 patient days to 7.5 cases/100,000 during 2020 and 2021). Liposomal amphotericin (Ampho) B was used as a first-line agent in most of the patients (86%). The median duration of total in-hospital antifungal therapy was 21 days and 51.2% of the patients received step-down therapy with azoles. Surgical debridement and isolated ROCM were significantly associated with survival (p-value: 0.02 and <0.001, respectively). All-cause mortality was 46.7%, with chronic renal disease being significantly associated with mortality (p-value < 0.05). The incidence of MCM has been increasing at our institution, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. Early diagnosis, treatment, and surgical debridement improve patient outcomes and overall survival.

AB  - Schizophyllum commune is a causative agent of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, and basidiomycosis. Diagnosis of these diseases remains difficult because no commercially available tool exists to identify the pathogen. Unique volatile organic compounds produced by a pathogen might be useful for non-invasive diagnosis. Here, we explored microbial volatile organic compounds produced by S. commune. Volatile sulfur compounds, dimethyl disulfide (48 of 49 strains) and methyl ethyl disulfide (49 of 49 strains), diethyl disulfide (34 of 49 strains), dimethyl trisulfide (40 of 49 strains), and dimethyl tetrasulfide (32 of 49 strains) were detected from headspace air in S. commune cultured vials. Every S. commune strain produced at least one volatile sulfur compound analyzed in this study. Those volatile sulfur compounds were not detected from the cultures of Aspergillus spp. (A. fumigatus, A. flavus, A. niger, and A. terreus), which are other major causative agents of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis. The last, we examined H2S detection using lead acetate paper. Headspace air from S. commune rapidly turned the lead acetate paper black. These results suggest that those volatile sulfur compounds are potent targets for the diagnosis of S. commune and infectious diseases.

To date, the impact of UTX on neurodevelopment remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of UTX on neurodevelopment through untargeted metabolomics based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). We found that UTX knockout in neurones leads to cell death and apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex, as well as induces impaired learning and memory functions in mice. Moreover, UTX deletion contributed to significant metabolic perturbations in brain tissues. A total of 223 differential metabolites were identified between wild-type (WT) and UTX cKO mice. Pathway analysis indicated that the metabolic pathways mainly affected by UTX deletion were alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, resulting in significant alterations in L-alanine, L-aspartate, D-aspartate, N-acetylaspartylglutamate, L-glutamate, and argininosuccinic acid. These data emphasised that UTX may exert a key effect in neurodevelopment and that the underlying mechanism may be related to the regulation of the alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathways, especially the characteristic metabolites involved in this pathway.

AB  - Identification of stably expressed gene(s) as internal reference(s) for different experimental conditions is key to the accurate normalization and quantification of target transcripts. Previously, our RNA-seq study showed that Hprt1, Actb, and 18S rRNA abundances were all significantly altered in porcine immature Sertoli cells (iSCs) during acute heat stress (HS). In the current study, we aimed to identify stable reference gene(s) to study the gene expression dynamics of quick and delayed responses after acute HS treatment of porcine iSCs. A total of six genes previously used in pig testis or Sertoli cells (Hprt1, Top2b, Actb, Rpl32, Gapdh, and 18S rRNA) were chosen to perform RT-qPCR for the control (before acute HS), HS0.5 (acute HS at 43 degrees C for 0.5 h), and HS0.5-R36 (36 h recovery following acute HS) groups. The stability of candidate reference genes was examined by the GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and Comparative Delta Ct methods, and RefFinder to obtain the final rank. Rpl32 and Actb were the two most stable internal reference genes as found by all methods, whereas Hprt1 and 18S rRNA were the two most unstable as ranked by RefFinder. Moreover, expression of six target mRNAs (Ccn1, Ccnb1, Eif4g1, Hdac6, Plk2, and Ptma) was normalized using Rpl32, Actb, or the combination of Rpl32 and Actb, respectively. Therefore, our findings that the most suitable internal references are Rpl32 and Actb provide useful information for further functional investigation on genes regulating the acute HS of porcine iSCs.

AB  - Invadopodia are adhesive, actin-rich protrusions formed by metastatic cancer cells that degrade the extracellular matrix and facilitate invasion. They support the metastatic cascade by a spatially and temporally coordinated process whereby invading cells bind to the matrix, degrade it by specific metalloproteinases, and mechanically penetrate diverse tissue barriers by forming actin-rich extensions. However, despite the apparent involvement of invadopodia in the metastatic process, the molecular mechanisms that regulate invadopodia formation and function are still largely unclear. In this study, we have explored the involvement of the key Hippo pathway co-regulators, namely YAP, and TAZ, in invadopodia formation and matrix degradation. Toward that goal, we tested the effect of depletion of YAP, TAZ, or both on invadopodia formation and activity in multiple human cancer cell lines. We report that the knockdown of YAP and TAZ or their inhibition by verteporfin induces a significant elevation in matrix degradation and invadopodia formation in several cancer cell lines. Conversely, overexpression of these proteins strongly suppresses invadopodia formation and matrix degradation. Proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of MDA-MB-231 cells, following co-knockdown of YAP and TAZ, revealed a significant change in the levels of key invadopodia-associated proteins, including the crucial proteins Tks5 and MT1-MMP (MMP14). Collectively, our findings show that YAP and TAZ act as negative regulators of invadopodia formation in diverse cancer lines, most likely by reducing the levels of essential invadopodia components. Dissecting the molecular mechanisms of invadopodia formation in cancer invasion may eventually reveal novel targets for therapeutic applications against invasive cancer.

AB  - The use of live food in zoological collections is a constant source of debate, with multiple approaches to discussions of implementation. The debate can be divided between those 'internal' (professionals within captive care) and 'external' (public) to the zoo world. Generally, there is a certain objection by a part of the public to the use of live prey, especially regarding the use of animals that commonly generate empathy such as mammals. The public is more likely to accept this practice if it is performed behind the scenes. The focus is often on the visual impact of such a practice, especially on families visiting with children. Additionally, each country has its own national regulations and therefore public perception may be different. Internally in the community of zoo professionals, the debate should be centred primarily on animal welfare-of both predator and prey. Some of the factors that should be considered are positive stimulation of predatory instincts with environmental enrichment, pain and stress for the prey and in turn injury to the predators, sanitary risks and conditions of the facilities. The European Zoo Nutrition Conference 2023 was considered an appropriate event at which to highlight the situation, presenting the latest research on this issue, combined with data provided by conference participants. The authors hope to generate a purposeful discussion to address this 'elephant in the room'.

AB  - About 10% of angiosperms, an estimated 20,000 species, produce latex from ubiquitous isoprene precursors. Latex, an aqueous suspension of rubber particles and other compounds, functions as an antifeedant and herbivory deterrent. It is soluble in neutral to alkaline pH, and coagulates in acidic environments. Here, I propose that foregut-fermenting herbivores such as ruminants, kangaroos, sloths, insect larvae, and tadpoles have adapted to latex in forage with the evolution of alkaline anterior digestive chamber(s). However, they consequently become susceptible to the action of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) delta-endotoxin and related bioinsecticides which are activated in alkaline environments. By contrast, hindgut-fermenting herbivores, such as horses and rabbits, have acidic anterior digestive chambers, in which latex coagulates and may cause gut blockage, but in which Bt is not activated. The latex-adapted foregut herbivore vs. latex-maladapted hindgut herbivore hypothesis developed in this paper has implications for hindgut-fermenting livestock and zoo animals which may be provided with latex-containing forage that is detrimental to their gut health. Further, ruminants and herbivorous tadpoles with alkaline anterior chambers are at risk of damage by the supposedly "environmentally friendly" Bt bioinsecticide, which is widely disseminated or engineered into crops which may enter animal feed streams.

AB  - Research question: Treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma have improved but one of their common effects is gonadal toxicity, which contributes to fertility damage of patients and induces temporary or irreversible loss of fertility. Could micro-RNA (miRNA) expression profiles in follicular fluid be influenced by Hodgkin lymphoma? Could their alteration affect molecular pathways involved in follicle growth and oocyte maturation? Design: miRNA expression profile was investigated in follicular fluid samples from young women affected by Hodgkin lymphoma compared with healthy controls by NanoString technology. Bioinformatic analysis was used to verify miRNA involvement in follicle development and miRNA deregulation with Hodgkin lymphoma in a larger cohort of follicular fluid samples was confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Thirteen miRNAs are deregulated in Hodgkin lymphoma samples compared with controls and are involved in molecular pathways related to cancer, gametogenesis and embryogenesis. Among them, let-7b-5p, miR-423-5p, miR-503-5p, miR-574-5p and miR-1303 are implicated in biological processes related to follicle development and oocyte maturation. Let-7b-5p holds the central position in the regulatory network of miRNA-mRNA interactions, has the highest number of mRNA target genes shared with the other differentially expressed miRNAs and is significantly downregulated in Hodgkin lymphoma follicular fluid samples. Conclusions: These data led us to question the potential influence of miRNA deregulation on oocyte quality. Further studies are needed to verify the reproductive potential of young patients with Hodgkin lymphoma before starting chemotherapy protocols and an adequate protocol of fertility preservation needs to be guaranteed.

AB  - Background: Liver fibrosis (LF) is a pathological process of the liver that threatens human health. Currently, effective treatments are still lacking. Esculin, a prominent constituent found in the Fraxinus rhynchophylla. (bark), Aesculus hippocastanum. (bark), and Cichorium intybus. (herb), has been shown to possess significant antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties. However, to date, there have been no studies investigating its potential efficacy in the treatment of LF. Objective: The study aims to investigate the therapeutic effect of esculin on LF and elucidate its potential molecular mechanism. Methods: Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was injected intraperitoneally to induce LF in mice, and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) was injected to induce LX-2 cells to investigate the improvement effect of esculin on LF. Kit, histopathological staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and western blot (WB) were used to detect the expression of fiber markers and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) signaling pathway in liver tissue and LX-2 cells. Finally, molecular docking, cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) were used to verify the targeting between Nrf2 and esculin. Results: Esculin significantly inhibited CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis and inflammation in mice. This was evidenced by the improvement of liver function indexes, fibrosis indicators, and histopathology. Additionally, esculin treatment prominently reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory factors, oxidative stress, and liver Fe2+ in CCl4-induced mice. In vitro studies also showed that esculin treatment significantly inhibited TGF-beta 1-induced LX2 cell activation and decreased alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and collagen I expression. Mechanism experiments proved that esculin can activate the Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway and inhibit liver ferroptosis. However, when LX-2 cells were treated with the Nrf2 inhibitor (ML385), the therapeutic effect of esculin significantly decreased. Conclusion: This study is the first to demonstrate that esculin is a potential natural active ingredient in the treatment of LF, which can inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and improve LF. Its therapeutic effect is related to the activation of the Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway.

AB  - For the first time, cadmium oxide (CdO) nanofibers (NFs) and graphene nanosheet (GNS)-doped CdO nanocomposites (NCs) have been synthesized by a simple green route using green tea (Camellia sinensis) extract, for subsequent application as photocatalysts for methylene blue (MB) removal from an aqueous matrix. In addition, the materials were tested as working electrodes for supercapacitors. The prepared samples were analyzed by FESEM, UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). FESEM revealed that the obtained NPs and NCs show fiber-shaped nanostructure. FTIR confirmed the presence of biomolecules on CdO and carbon compounds on CdO/GNS, while XRD exhibited the cubic crystalline structure of obtained NPs and NCs. The Rietveld refinement using XRD data was performed to ascertain the crystallographic characteristics of the produced samples and look into lattice imperfections. UV-Vis spectroscopy evaluated the optical bandgap energies of CdO and CdO/GNS NCs. The CdO/GNS NCs demonstrated a fast cleavage of the dye molecule under UV irradiation, resulting in 97% removal in 120 min. In addition, CdO/GNS NCs showed remarkable chemical stability as an electrode material, with a high specific capacitance of 231 F g-1 at a scan rate of 25 mV s-1. These observed NCs characteristics are higher when compared to pristine CdO NPs. Finally, we found that the investigated NCs showed enhanced multifunctional properties, such as photocatalytic and supercapacitor characteristics, which can be useful in practical applications.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis L.), an important economic crop, is recalcitrant to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT), which has seriously hindered the progress of molecular research on this species. The mechanisms leading to low efficiency of AMT in tea plants, related to the morphology, growth, and gene expression of Agrobacterium tumefaciens during tea-leaf explant infection, were compared to AMT of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves in the present work. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that tea leaves induced significant morphological aberrations on bacterial cells and affected pathogen-plant attachment, the initial step of a successful AMT. RNA sequencing and transcriptomic analysis on Agrobacterium at 0, 3 and 4 days after leaf post-inoculation resulted in 762, 1923 and 1656 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the tea group and the tobacco group, respectively. The expressions of genes involved in bacterial fundamental metabolic processes, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, two-component systems (TCSs), secretion systems, and quorum sensing (QS) systems were severely affected in response to the tea-leaf phylloplane. Collectively, these results suggest that compounds in tea leaves, especially gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) and catechins, interfered with plant-pathogen attachment, essential minerals (iron and potassium) acquisition, and quorum quenching (QQ) induction, which may have been major contributing factors to hinder AMT efficiency of the tea plant.

AB  - Borehole thermal energy storage systems represent a potential solution to increase the energy efficiency of renewable energy plants, but they generally have to comply with strict regulatory frameworks, mainly due to the deliberate modification of the subsoil's natural state. This paper presents the design, testing, and monitoring phases carried out to set up a borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) system able to exploit the excess solar heat from photovoltaic thermal (PVT) collectors. The case study is the refurbishment of a pig nursery barn, hosting up to 2500 weaners, in Northern Italy. This study aims to define a BTES suitable to develop a heating system based on renewable energy, ensuring environmental protection and long-term sustainability. The retrofitting intervention includes the installation of a dual-source heat pump (DSHP), in order to recover the solar heat stored in summer during winter. Specific constraints by the Environmental Authority were as follows: maximum storage temperature of 35 degrees C, authorization to intercept the shallowest aquifer at a maximum depth of 30 m, obligation of BHE grouting, and the definition of a strategy for continuous measuring and monitoring of the groundwater's thermophysical properties. The results were used as inputs to optimize the design and installation of the integrated system with PVT, BTES, and DSHP.

AB  - Background: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a common psychiatric symptom after a stroke. Morroniside, an iridoid glycoside found in Cornus officinalis, has garnered significant attention for its potential to alleviate symptoms associated with depression. Purpose: This study aims to highlight the potential use of morroniside in the treatment of PSD and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.
   Methods: To establish a reliable PSD model, male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to brief MCAO in conjunction with CUMS. Post-morroniside administration, neuronal viability, and hippocampal cell apoptosis were evaluated by Nissl staining and TUNEL detection, respectively. Depression-like behaviors were evaluated using SPT, TST, and FST. The Longa score and cylinder test were used to evaluate the effect of morroniside on motor function. Furthermore, to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, bioinformatic analysis and the dual luciferase assay were performed to investigate the MiR-409-3p-BDNF interaction. In addition, subsequent to MiR-409-3p overexpression via AAV virus, we assessed mRNA expression and protein levels of key components within the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway using RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and western blot analysis.
   Results: The observed decrease in apoptosis and amelioration of depression-like behaviors strongly indicate the potential of morroniside as a therapeutic agent for PSD. Furthermore, the upregulation of key proteins within the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway in the cortex suggests that morroniside activates this pathway. Through bioinformatics analysis, MiR-409-3p was identified and found to bind to the BDNF gene, resulting in the inhibition of BDNF expression. Importantly, we demonstrate that morroniside mitigates this inhibitory effect of MiR-409-3p on BDNF, thereby facilitating the activation of the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway.
   Conclusion: The findings suggest that morroniside demonstrates the ability to improve PSD symptoms through the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway mediated by MiR-409-3p. These results emphasize the importance of the BDNF signaling pathway in improving PSD symptoms and provide a possible mechanism for morroniside to treat PSD.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Metabolomic studies of different parasite-derived biomolecules, such as lipids, are needed to broaden the discovery of novel targets and overcome anthelmintic resistance. Lipids are involved in diverse functions in biological systems, including parasitic helminths, but little is known about their role in the biology of these organisms and their impact on host-parasite interactions. This study aimed to characterize the lipid profile secreted by Haemonchus contortus, the major parasitic nematodes of farm ruminants. Methods: H. contortus adult worms were recovered from infected sheep and cultured ex vivo. Parasite medium was collected at different time points and samples were subjected to an untargeted global lipidomic analysis. Lipids were extracted and subjected to Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Annotated lipids were normalized and subjected to statistical analysis. Lipid clusters' fold change (FC) and individual lipid features were compared at different time points. Lipids were also analyzed by structural composition and saturation bonding. Results: A total of 1057 H. contortus lipid features were annotated, including glycerophospholipids, fatty acyls, sphingolipids, glycerolipids, and sterols. Most of these compounds were unsaturated lipids. We found significant FC differences in the lipid profile in a time-dependent manner. Conclusions: We predict that many lipids found in our study act as signaling molecules for nematodes' physiological functions, such as adaptation to nutrient changes, life span and mating, and as modulators on the host immune responses.

AB  - Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an important swine enteric coronavirus causing viral diarrhea in pigs of all ages. Currently, the development of antiviral agents targeting host proteins to combat viral infection has received great attention. The heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a critical host factor and has important regulatory effects on the infection of various viruses. However, its roles in porcine coronavirus infection remain unclear. In this study, the effect of HSP90 on TGEV infection was evaluated. In addition, the influence of its inhibitor VER-82576 on proinflammatory cytokine (IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha, CXCL10, and CXCL11) production induced by TGEV infection was further analyzed. The results showed that the knockdown of HSP90AB1 and HSP90 inhibitor VER-82576 treatment resulted in a reduction in TGEV M gene mRNA levels, the N protein level, and virus titers in a dose-dependent manner, while the knockdown of HSP90AA1 and KW-2478 treatment had no significant effect on TGEV infection. A time-of-addition assay indicated that the inhibitory effect of VER-82576 on TGEV infection mainly occurred at the early stage of viral replication. Moreover, the TGEV-induced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine (IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha, CXCL10, and CXCL11) expression was significantly inhibited by VER-82576. In summary, these findings indicated that HSP90AB1 is a host factor enhancing TGEV infection, and the HSP90 inhibitor VER-82576 could reduce TGEV infection and proinflammatory cytokine production, providing a new perspective for TGEV antiviral drug target design.

AB  - Buck sperm cryopreservation is an effective method to distribute qualified sperm for reproductive purposes, but this procedure reduces sperm quality. The current study was conducted to inves-tigate the effect of L-carnitine (LC) on the quality and epigenetic patterns of buck's post-thawed semen. Semen samples were collected from five male goats twice a week and diluted in extenders supplemented with 0 (LC-0), 1 (LC-1), 5 (LC-5) and 10 (LC-10) mM LC. Samples were cry-opreserved according to standard protocol. After thawing, motility characteristics, lipid peroxi-dation, membrane functionality, abnormal morphology, mitochondrial activity, acrosome integrity, epigenetic modifications, viability, apoptotic-like changes and DNA fragmentation were assessed. Samples supplemented with 5 mM LC showed greater (P <= 0.05) total motility, pro-gressive motility, membrane functionality, mitochondrial activity, acrosome integrity, DNA methylation, viability, and lower (P <= 0.05) apoptotic-like changes. Lipid peroxidation was lower (P <= 0.05) in LC-5 and LC-10 compared to the control group. Addition of LC to the cryopreser-vation extender had no effect (P > 0.05) on velocity parameters, abnormal morphology, histone modifications, or DNA fragmentation. In conclusion, supplementing the cryopreservation extender with 5 mM LC significantly preserves the quality of buck sperm after the cryopreser-vation process.

AB  - The deleterious health impacts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on the population have been extensively substantiated and acknowledged. Mounting evidence underscores that PAH exposure is closely linked to an elevated risk of mental disorders, particularly in populations experiencing occupational and high-level exposure. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying anxiety-like behaviors induced by different dosages of PAHs, with a concentrated focus on brain region-specific metabolic alterations in mice using various metabolomics approaches. Male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a typical PAH, through gavage at occupational exposure and EPA toxicologically relevant dosages (2.0 and 20.0 mg/kg/day) for 21 days, respectively. Behavioral assessments revealed that occupational exposure to B[a]P induced anxiety-like behaviors in C57BL/6 mice. Meanwhile, elevated serum norepinephrine and corticotropin-releasing hormone further confirmed the anxiety-inducing effects of B[a]P exposure. Metabolomics analysis uncovered dysregulation across various metabolic pathways following B[a]P exposure, encompassing brain neurotransmitter, organic acid, amino acid, lipid, fatty acid, and cholesterol. Anxiety levels and lipid metabolic abnormalities were notably exacerbated at the higher dosage, despite being only a 10-fold increase. Of particular significance, a decrease in lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and lysophosphatidylserine (LPS) emerged as pivotal indicators of B[a]P neurotoxicity. Spatial-resolved metabolomics further demonstrated distinctive lipid and metabolite profiles across different brain subregions after exposure to B[a]P. Remarkably, alterations were specifically observed in the anxiety-related brain regions, such as the hippocampus, cortex, white matter, and thalamus, varying with exposure dosages. These findings underscore the significance of brain metabolic abnormalities in the development of mental disorders triggered by B[a]P exposure and highlight the need for establishing precise exposure limits of B[a]P to safeguard public mental health.

AB  - Although fossil assemblages from the late Early Pleistocene are very rare in Britain, the site of Westbury Cave in Somerset, England, has the potential to address this gap. The mammal fossils recovered previously from the Siliceous Member in Westbury Cave, though few in number, have hinted at an age for the deposits that is as yet unparalleled in Britain. Here, we describe the first bona fide occurrence of Hippopotamus in the British Early Pleistocene, discovered during recent reinvestigation of the Siliceous Member. The hippo fossil indicates a refined biochronological age of ca. 1.5-1.07 Ma for the Siliceous Member and a palaeoclimate that was warm and humid, which accords well with previous palaeoenvironmental inferences. A synthesis of late Early Pleistocene hippo occurrences suggests that the Siliceous Member hippo may have been part of an early colonization of north-west Europe by these megaherbivores, possibly during MIS (Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage) 31. Alternatively, it evidences a currently cryptic northward migration during an even earlier temperate phase. In either case, the Siliceous Member is likely to represent a warm period that has not been recognized previously in the British Quaternary record.

AB  - This article describes results from a review of South Asian fossils in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. These materials include two early 19(th) century collections of fossils from the Siwalik Hills in India. While this assemblage was summarised in 1837 by William Buckland as 'large and valuable collections of fossil bones', it has remained largely unstudied and unpublished in any detail since collection. Here, as a precursor to a comprehensive re-evaluation, we establish a chronological and geographical context of one collection event, provide details of its donor, and outline its history after arrival in Oxford. We then describe select taxa in the collection, including a well-preserved maxilla and toothrow of the large extinct giraffid, Sivatherium giganteum, as a basis to justify our current understanding of the biostratigraphic affinity of the assemblage. Conservatively, the collection is a 'classic' Upper Siwalik Plio-Pleistocene fauna, possibly the first to be transported to the UK. While further analyses will realise the scientific potential of the fossils, the narrative of their journey from India to Oxford remains incomplete. Further investigation of the hidden history of the collection is warranted.

AB  - Introduction: A previous study from our Laboratory showed no alteration in inflammatory parameters seven days after ouabain (OUA) administration, a Na(+)K(+)ATPase inhibitor, which was previously considered only a mania model. However, the administration of OUA in rats was recently validated as a model of bipolar disorder (BD) symptoms, demonstrating that 14 days after single intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration, OUA also induces depressive-like behavior. Therefore, it is important to investigate the long-term effect of OUA on inflammatory parameters since this mechanism seems to play a key role in BD physiopathology. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats received a single ICV administration of OUA or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). From the fourth day after the ICV infusion, the rats received saline or Lithium (Li) for 14 days. The open-field test was performed on the 7th day after OUA. On the 14th day, locomotion was re-evaluated, and the forced swimming test (FST) was used to evaluate depressive-like behavior. Inflammatory parameters were assessed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Results: OUA increased the locomotion of rats after seven days, considered a mania-like behavior. In the FST, OUA increased the time of immobility on the 14th day, considered a depressive-like behavior. Li reversed the mania-like behavior and partially reversed the depressive-like behavior. Furthermore, OUA increased the levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and CINC-1 in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Li treatment re-verses all these inflammatory alterations. Conclusion: This study suggests that the long-term Na+K+ATPase inhibition effects induce depressive-like behavior, which was accompanied by inflammation in the BD symptoms model.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder that causes severe complications in several tissues due to redox imbalances, which in turn cause defective angiogenesis in response to ischemia and activate a number of proinflammatory pathways. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of bee gomogenat (BG) dietary supplementation on the architecture of immune organs in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes (T1D) mouse model. Three animal groups were used: the control non-diabetic, diabetic, and BG-treated diabetic groups. STZ-induced diabetes was associated with increased levels of blood glucose, ROS, and IL-6 and decreased levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-4, and GSH. Moreover, diabetic mice showed alterations in the expression of autophagy markers (LC3, Beclin-1, and P62) and apoptosis markers (Bcl-2 and Bax) in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. Most importantly, the phosphorylation level of AKT (a promoter of cell survival) was significantly decreased, but the expression levels of MCP-1 and HSP-70 (markers of inflammation) were significantly increased in the spleen and lymph nodes in diabetic mice compared to control animals. Interestingly, oral supplementation with BG restored the levels of blood glucose, ROS, IL-6, IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and GSH in diabetic mice. Treatment with BG significantly abrogated apoptosis and autophagy in lymphoid organs in diabetic mice by restoring the expression levels of LC3, Beclin-1, P62, Bcl-2, and Bax; decreasing inflammatory signals by downregulating the expression of MCP-1 and HSP-70; and promoting cell survival by enhancing the phosphorylation of AKT. Our data were the first to reveal the therapeutic potential of BG on the architecture of lymphoid organs and enhancing the immune system during T1D.

AB  - Exposure to Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with various neurological disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms of PM2.5-induced adverse effects on the brain are still not fully defined. Multi-omics analyses could offer novel insights into the mechanisms of PM2.5-induced brain dysfunction. In this study, a real-ambient PM2.5 exposure system was applied to male C57BL/6 mice for 16 weeks, and lipidomics and transcriptomics analysis were performed in four brain regions. The findings revealed that PM2.5 exposure led to 548, 283, 304, and 174 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), as well as 184, 89, 228, and 49 distinctive lipids in the hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb, respectively. Additionally, in most brain regions, PM2.5-induced DEGs were mainly involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and calcium signaling pathway, while PM2.5-altered lipidomic profile were primarily enriched in retrograde endocannabinoid signaling and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Importantly, mRNA-lipid correlation networks revealed that PM2.5-altered lipids and DEGs were obviously enriched in pathways involving in bile acid biosynthesis, De novo fatty acid biosynthesis, and saturated fatty acids beta-oxidation in brain regions. Furthermore, multi-omics analyses revealed that the hippocampus was the most sensitive part to PM2.5 exposure. Specifically, dysregulation of Pla2g1b, Pla2g, Alox12, Alox15, and Gpx4 induced by PM2.5 were closely correlated to the disruption of alpha-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid and linoleic acid metabolism in the hippocampus. In summary, our findings highlight differential lipidomic and transcriptional signatures of various brain regions by real-ambient PM2.5 exposure, which will advance our understanding of potential mechanisms of PM2.5-induecd neurotoxicity.

AB  - Background: Prenatal exposure to air pollution is associated with adverse neurologic consequences in childhood. However, the relationship between in utero exposure to air pollution and neonatal brain development is unclear. Methods: We modelled maternal exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) at postcode level between date of conception to date of birth and studied the effect of prenatal air pollution exposure on neonatal brain morphology in 469 (207 male) healthy neonates, with gestational age of >= 36 weeks. Infants underwent MR neuroimaging at 3 Tesla at 41.29 (36.71-45.14) weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) as part of the developing human connectome project (dHCP). Single pollutant linear regression and canonical correla-tion analysis (CCA) were performed to assess the relationship between air pollution and brain morphology, adjusting for confounders and correcting for false discovery rate. Results: Higher exposure to PM10 and lower exposure to NO2 was strongly canonically correlated to a larger relative ventricular volume, and moderately associated with larger relative size of the cerebellum. Modest as-sociations were detected with higher exposure to PM10 and lower exposure to NO2 and smaller relative cortical grey matter and amygdala and hippocampus, and larger relaive brainstem and extracerebral CSF volume. No associations were found with white matter or deep grey nuclei volume. Conclusions: Our findings show that prenatal exposure to air pollution is associated with altered brain morphometry in the neonatal period, albeit with opposing results for NO2 and PM10. This finding provides further evidence that reducing levels of maternal exposure to particulate matter during pregnancy should be a public health priority and highlights the importance of understanding the impacts of air pollution on this critical development window.

AB  - The taxonomy, chronology and dispersal patterns of hippopotamuses in Western Europe are still a matter of debate, despite the long history of researchers on these topics. In this framework, the Portuguese material has never been investigated or recently revised, and it can contribute to increasing our comprehension about Quaternary hippopotamuses. The material considered in this work, collected from sites dated between 1 Ma and 0.13 Ma, is compared with fossil Pleistocene hippopotamuses from the Iberian Peninsula, Italy, Germany and Greece, in order to contribute into the discussion on evolutionary and dispersal patterns of these large semi-aquatic mammals in Europe during the Pleistocene. Portugal deposits recorded the presence of H. antiquus, starting from 1 Ma up to 0.4 Ma, and H. cf. amphibius during the late Middle Pleistocene. In particular, the occurrence of H. antiquus in Condeixa, dated around 0.4 Ma, can be considered as the LAD of this species in Europe.

AB  - Memory impairment is the most common cognitive deficit in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This type of epilepsy is currently regarded as a network disease because of its brain-wide alterations in functional connectivity between temporal and extra-temporal regions. In patients with TLE, network dysfunctions can be observed during ictal states, but are also described interictally during rest or sleep. Here, we examined the available literature supporting the hypothesis that hippocampal-cortical coupling during sleep is hijacked in TLE. First, we look at studies showing that the coordination between hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (100-200 Hz), corticothalamic spindles (9-16 Hz), and cortical delta waves (1-4 Hz) during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is critical for spatial memory consolidation. Then, we reviewed studies showing that animal models of TLE display precise coordination between hippocampal interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and spindle oscillations in the prefrontal cortex. This aberrant oscillatory coupling seems to surpass the physiological ripple-delta-spindle coordination, which could underlie memory consolidation impairments. We also discuss the role of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep for local synaptic plasticity and memory. Sleep episodes of REM provide windows of opportunity for reactivation of expression of immediate early genes (i.e., zif-268 and Arc). Besides, hippocampal theta oscillations during REM sleep seem to be critical for memory consolidation of novel object place recognition task. However, it is still unclear which extend this particular phase of sleep is affected in TLE. In this context, we show some preliminary results from our group, suggesting that hippocampal theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling is exacerbated during REM in a model of basolateral amygdala fast kindling. In conclusion, there is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that circuits responsible for memory consolidation during sleep seem to be gradually coopted and degraded in TLE.

AB  - Despite being a parasitic disease known since ancient times, some epidemiological aspects of cystic echinococcosis (CE) remain unclear. Many studies describe its prevalence and genotyping in populations of domestic animals and livestock, but data regarding wildlife are often scarce and incomplete. The available literature suggests that CE has never been reported in African rhinos. Considering the fragile conservation status of these species due to continued poaching, this study tries to clarify some neglected epidemiological aspects. In February 2020, an adult female of the Southern white rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum simum (Burchell, 1817), was killed by poachers. The subsequent necropsy performed by the state veterinary team revealed the presence of seven cysts within the pulmonary tissue (four cysts in the right medio-caudal lobe and three cysts in the left medio-caudal lobe) with a diameter of between 1.5 and 2.3 cm. Given the state of decomposition of the carcass, only two of these were suitable for microscopic examination. Specimens were examined under 10x and 40x microscopic magnification for the confirmation of fertility of the cysts, based on the presence of numerous protoscoleces in different stages of maturation. A histopathological examination was also performed to describe the relationship between parasite and host tissue reaction. Cyst samples were subjected to PCR. The primers successfully amplified the expected fragments of the cox-1 and the nad-1 gene from the isolated genomic DNA, revealing high sequence identity with published sequences of Echinococcus equinus Williams & Sweatman, 1963 isolate G4 and E. equinus isolate SLG5-G4.

   The color of fresh pork is a very important feature, both for the meat industry and especially for direct consumers. Consumers often relate color to the freshness and quality of pork. Quality evaluation of fresh pork intended for sale or processing seems to be a priority task for meat plants due to the expectations of modern consumers. Meat can be characterized as a mixture of different chemical components, each of which contributes to its quality either independently or in combination with other ingredients. The complexity of muscle structure and the tasks performed by individual muscles may contribute to uneven color distribution. The presented results are an important contribution to the rapid and precise instrumental evaluation of pH and color. The information may be particularly important for meat plants, which, by introducing such an evaluation, allow consumers to additionally verify the product.
   The aim of this study was to determine the effect of 30 min bloom time and the type of muscle on pH and color parameters together with the possibility of estimating these measurements. The research material consisted of 270 samples from 6 muscle types: LD-Longissimus dorsi, LL-Longissimus lumborum, IL-Iliacus, SEM-Semimembranosus, CT-Cutaneous trunci, LTD-Latissimus dorsi. Measurements included pH and color of fresh pork at 0 min, and after 30 min bloom time. Bloom time influenced all analyzed parameters, although to a varying effect, depending on the muscle type. The lowest pH values were noted for dorsal-located muscles (LD, LL), then in the ham area (IL, SEM), and the highest values of the location on the side surface of the carcass (CT, LTD). The large increase in the proportion of L* and a* was observed for CT muscle (20-30%, the highest of all observed) and LTD (20-25%); for LD and LL the largest growth changes were observed for parameters b* (15-20%) and H* (20-30%). The lowest number of strong correlations was noted for LD and CT muscles, and the largest for SEM. A very good fit (R-2 > 0.90) of regression equations was achieved in 7 cases. The presented results are an important contribution to the rapid and precise instrumental evaluation of pH and color.

AB  - The G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has been described to exert several cardioprotective effects. However, the exact mechanism involved in cardiac protection remains unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of GPER activation on excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) and the possibility that such effect participates in cardioprotection. The cardiac myocytes of male Wistar rats were isolated with a digestive buffer and loaded with Fura-2-AM for the measurement of intracellular calcium transient (CaT). Sarcomere shortening (SS) and L-type calcium current (ICaL) were also registered. The confocal technique was used to measure nitric oxide (NO) production in cells loaded with DAF-FM-diacetate. Cardiac myocytes exposed to 17-beta-estradiol (E2, 10 nM) or G-1 (1 mu M) for fifteen minutes decreased CaT, SS, and ICaL. These effects were prevented using G-36 (antagonist of GPER, 1 mu M), L-Name (NO synthase -NOS- inhibitor, 100 nM), or wortmannin (phosphoinositide-3-kinase -PI3K- inhibitor, 100 nM). Moreover, G1 increased NO production, and this effect was abolished in the presence of wortmannin. We concluded that the selective activation of GPER with E2 or G1 in the isolated cardiac myocytes of male rats induced a negative inotropic effect due to the reduction in ICaL and the decrease in CaT. Finally, the pathway that we proposed to be implicated in these effects is PI3K-NOS-NO.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by complex interactions between neuropathological markers, metabolic dysregulation, and structural brain changes. In this study, we utilized a multimodal approach, combining immunohistochemistry, functional metabolic mapping, and microstructure sensitive diffusion MRI (dMRI) to progressively investigate these interactions in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. Our analysis revealed age-dependent and region-specific accumulation of key AD markers, including amyloid-beta (A beta), GFAP, and IBA1, with significant differences observed between the hippocampal formation and upper and lower regions of the cortex by 6 months of age. Functional metabolic mapping validated localized disruptions in energy metabolism, with glucose hypometabolism in the hippocampus and impaired astrocytic metabolism in the cortex. Notably, increased cortical glutaminolysis suggested a shift in microglial metabolism, reflecting an adaptive response to neuroinflammatory processes. While dMRI showed no significant microstructural differences between 5xFAD and wild-type controls, the study highlights the importance of metabolic alterations as critical events in AD pathology. These findings emphasize the need for targeted therapeutic strategies addressing specific metabolic disturbances and underscore the potential of integrating advanced imaging with metabolic and molecular analyses to advance our understanding of AD progression.

AB  - Carotenoids are powerful antioxidants capable of helping to protect the skin from the damaging effects of exposure to sun by reducing the free radicals in skin produced by exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and they may also have a physical protective effect in human skin. Since carotenoids are lipophilic molecules which can be ingested with the diet, they can accumulate in significant quantities in the skin. Several studies on humans have been conducted to evaluate the protective function of carotenoids against various diseases, but there is very limited published information available to understand the mechanism of carotenoid bioavailability in animals. The current study was conducted to investigate the skin carotenoid level (SCL) in two cattle skin sets - weaners with an unknown feeding regime and New Generation Beef (NGB) cattle with monitored feed at three different ages. Rapid analytical and sensitive Raman spectroscopy has been shown to be of interest as a powerful technique for the detection of carotenoids in cattle skin due to the strong resonance enhancement with 532 nm laser excitation. The spectral difference of both types of skin were measured and quantified using univariate and linear discriminant analysis. SCL was higher in NGB cattle than weaners and there is a perfect classification accuracy between weaners and NGB cattle skin using carotenoid markers as a basis. Further work carried out on carotenoid rich NGB cattle skin of 8, 12 and 24 months of age identified an increasing trend in SCL with age. The present work validated the ability of Raman spectroscopy to determine the skin carotenoid level in cattle by comparing it with established HPLC methods. There is an excellent correlation of R-2 = 0.96 between the two methods that could serve as a model for future application for larger population studies.

AB  - The roles of Ca2+-induced calcium release in synaptic plasticity and metaplasticity are poorly understood. The present study has addressed the role of intracellular Ca2+ stores in long-term potentiation (LTP) and a form of heterosynaptic metaplasticity known as synaptic tagging and capture (STC) at CA1 synapses in mouse hippocampal slices. The effects of two compounds, ryanodine and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), were examined on LTP induced by three distinct induction protocols: weak (w), compressed (c) and spaced (s) theta-burst stimulation (TBS). These compounds did not significantly affect LTP induced by the wTBS (one episode of TBS; 25 stimuli) or cTBS (three such episodes with a 10 s inter-episode interval (IEI); 75 stimuli) but substantially inhibited LTP induced by a sTBS (10 min IEI; 75 stimuli). Ryanodine and CPA also prevented a small heterosynaptic potentiation that was observed with the sTBS protocol. Interestingly, these compounds also prevented STC when present during either the sTBS or the subsequent wTBS, applied to an independent input. All of these effects of ryanodine and CPA were similar to that of a calcium-permeable AMPA receptor blocker. In conclusion, Ca2+ stores provide one way in which signals are propagated between synaptic inputs and, by virtue of their role in STC, may be involved in associative long-term memories.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Long-term potentiation: 50 years on'.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy is a very complex and highly stressful time in women. Despite the high prevalence of postpartum depression, more than 50 % of mothers are undiagnosed or untreated, showing an urgent need to explore an effective preventive strategy. Regular physical activity has been suggested to be associated with an increased quality of life in pregnant and postpartum women. The purpose of this study was to determine whether perinatal running training can affect maternal care stress-related anxiety, depressive-like behavior, and cognitive changes in postpartum dams and to explore the possible underlying mechanism. Methods: 40 female C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups: prenatal control (NC) and running training (EX) group (NC+EX), prenatal control and nonrunning training (RE) group (NC+RE), prenatal subchronic variable stress (SCVS) and running training group (SCVS+EX) and prenatal SCVS and non-running training group (SCVS+RE). Mice in prenatal stress groups were subjected to SCVS after pregnancy confirmed. Mice in running training groups subjected to running training throughout pregnancy and lactation. Then after the delivery, maternal behavior, cognitive changes, anxiety and depressive-like behaviors were tested. Then we measured the serum prolactin (PRL), hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activity, and adult hippocampus neurogenesis (AHN) in dams. Results: Compared to NC+RE, prenatal SCVS caused cognitive impairments, the decrease in maternal behavior, and anxiety and depressive-like behavior in SCVS+RE dams, accompanying increase in HPA axis activity and decreased the PRL levels and AHN in postpartum period. Then compared to SCVS+RE, perinatal running training mitigates cognitive impairments, increased maternal behavior, and alleviates anxiety and depressive-like behavior in SCVS+EX dams, accompanying the decreased HPA axis activity, and the increased PRL levels and AHN in postpartum period. Conclusion: Overall, this study suggests that perinatal running training might improve maternal care and reverse prenatal stress-related cognitive impairment and anxiety and depressive-like behavior in postpartum dams.

AB  - The Mammoth Faunas, the famous cold-adapted mammal assemblages, were distributed widely across northern Eurasia and North America during the Late Pleistocene. The now extinct woolly rhinoceros, Coelodonta antiquitatis, was a major component. Abundant fossil remains of this species with radiocarbon dates have been reported through almost all of northern Eurasia, but the fossil rhinoceroses of Mongolia are poorly known. Here, we describe a rhinocerotid skeleton from Ondorkhaan, eastern Mongolia, and compare it with four Late Pleistocene rhinoceros species of northern Eurasia (Elasmotherium sibiricum, Stephanorhinus hemitoechus, Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis and C. antiquitatis), resulting in its identification as a woolly rhinoceros (C. antiquitatis). Accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dates obtained from two samples (ODK01 and ODK02) of the skeleton essentially agree, 42 160-40 040 cal. a BP and 42 105-39 955 cal. a BP, and the two samples had delta C-13 values of -19.5 parts per thousand and -20.2 parts per thousand SMMKW, respectively. This find suggests that the Mammoth Faunas were distributed in eastern Mongolia c. 45-40 ka during the period of climatic amelioration between Heinrich events 5 (H5: 46 000 cal. a BP) and 4 (H4: 39 000 cal. a BP).

AB  - Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is a critical factor influencing the quality and palatability of pork. However, established breeding and nutritional methods lead to systemic fat deposition. The efficient and specific methods to increase IMF content in livestock remain a challenge. In this study, Lipid droplets (LDs), an organelle in cells, are shown to be a controllable and biocompatible carrier that can be used to increase IMF content. This study demonstrated that isolated LDs stimulate lipid synthesis by encapsulating Oleic Acid (OA), a PPAR gamma ligand. Importantly, artificial LDs (aLDs) can effectively substitute isolated LDs. In vivo, investigations showed that OA-loading aLDs significantly increased the expression of lipid synthases such as DGAT2 and FASN through activation of PPAR gamma, a key pathway for lipid synthesis. Furthermore, the IMF content on the injected side is increased up to 35% with minimal side effects. The development of OA-aLDs promotes IMF deposition and demonstrates the significant potential of aLDs as drug carriers. The exploration of LDs-based carriers provides a new theoretical basis for their application in the medical field.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures originating in the temporal lobe, often affecting patients' physical, cognitive, and social well-being. Despite the availability of antiseizure medication (ASMs), approximately 30% of TLE patients exhibit drug-resistant seizures, emphasizing the need for alternative therapeutic approaches. Ketogenic diets, known for their anticonvulsant effects, have shown promise in managing drug-resistant epilepsy. However, their demanding high-fat, low-carbohydrate regimens pose significant adherence challenges. Medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) offers a viable alternative by inducing ketosis periodically without the need for continuous dietary restrictions. This study evaluated seizure severity, biochemical markers, and immune-related factors in TLE patients. The intervention group received neuro-Capridin caprylate and caprate (n-CAP), while the control group did not. Significant findings included increased plasma ATP and adenosine levels in the treatment group, along with higher expression of ADORA1 and CD73 and reduced expression of ADK. Corresponding protein changes were observed, with increased CD73 and decreased ADK levels. Caprylate and Caprate also elevated regulatory T cells and reduced proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta). These changes were associated with significant reductions in seizure severity and frequency. Intermittent ketogenesis through the consumption of Caprylate and Caprate effectively reduced seizures and improved immune and metabolic markers in drug-resistant TLE patients. These findings highlight its potential as a complementary therapy, warranting further exploration of its long-term impact and underlying molecular mechanisms.

AB  - Decisions made in the early design stage have a significant effect on a building's performance and environmental impact. In practice, a conceptual design is performed by an architect, while a structural engineer begins to work in later phases when the architectural concept has already evolved. However, the geometry and form of a building directly determine the type of structure and applicable materials; therefore, the conceptual design phase gives rise to examining alternative solutions. This paper presents a method for generating alternative structural solutions in the conceptual design phase and examining their embodied environmental impact by integrating parametric design and building information modeling (BIM). Rhinoceros and Grasshopper were used to develop the parametric script, which includes the generation of geometrical variations, the automatic definition of initial cross sections for the load-bearing elements based on in-built structural design approximations, the datasets for embodied environmental impact of the used building materials, the generation of life cycle inventory (LCI), the automatic calculation of life cycle assessment (LCA) results based on the geometry, and the conversion of the parametric model into building information model. The method was demonstrated using a case study of 48 different alternative solutions for an unheated warehouse made of steel frames. Based on the results, the areas with the greatest energy impact were identified. The case study analysis also illustrated that the applied cross section may have a significant effect on the impact categories. The results draw attention to the complexity of LCA calculations even in the case of a simple structure containing a limited number of variables, where parametric design can serve as an effective tool for a comprehensive environmental impact assessment.

AB  - BackgroundPrednisone is one of the most used synthetic glucocorticoids during pregnancy. Epidemiological investigations suggested that prenatal prednisone therapy could affect fetal development, but systematic studies on its effects on ovarian development and the "toxic effect window" remained scarce.MethodsIn this study, by simulating clinical application characteristics, Kunming mice were given prednisone by oral gavage with different doses (0.25 or 1.0 mg/kg center dot d) or at different time gestational days (GD) (GD0-9, GD10-18, or GD0-18). Blood and ovaries of fetal mice were collected on GD18, and the serum estradiol level and the related function indexes of ovarian granulosa cells and oocytes were detected.ResultsCompared with the control group, prenatal prednisone exposure (PPE) induced pathological injury and enhanced cell proliferation in fetal mice ovary. Furthermore, the expression of steroid synthesis functional genes in pre-granulosa cells, the oocyte function markers, and developmentally related genes was enhanced with different doses or at different time of PPE. The Hippo signaling was activated in the fetal ovary of PPE groups. The above changes were most significant in the low or high-dose and full-term PPE groups.ConclusionPPE caused various cell developmental toxicity in the fetal ovary, especially in the low or high-dose, full-term exposure groups. The potential mechanism might be related to the activation of the Hippo signaling pathway.

AB  - The conflict between humans and wildlife is a global issue in the increasingly shared landscape. Human-Wildlife Conflict (HWC) is often viewed as a threat to most of the rural populace of the world, as crop losses to wildlife remove the household's food supply, and are an economic drain on the homestead. In this paper, we study the extent of crop damage by wild animals in two districts of Bhutan: Trashiyangtse and Tsirang. We surveyed 431 respondents from the two districts and interviewed 40 central and local government officials and residents. The vast majority of respondents from both study districts (Trashiyangtse = 98.7%; Tsirang = 92.2%) reported having experienced conflicts with wild animals from 2017 to 2019. On average, respondents' households lost over half a month to more than a month's worth of household food requirements, with some households claiming to have lost over six months' worth of household food requirements, annually to wild animals. The loss of crops to wild animals removes households' food supply and discourages farming, resulting in increased fallow lands. The fallow lands which are close to human settlements, then become habitats for wild animals, aggravating the incidence of HWC, and as such are directly linked to reduced food production.

AB  - The present study evaluated the protective effect of 1-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)-5-methyl-N-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-carboxamide (QTCA-1) on seizure severity, oxidative stress, and memory disorder in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-kindling model in mice. Male Swiss mice were treated with QTCA-1 (10 mg/kg, intragastrically (i.g.)) or phenobarbital (PHEN) (10 mg/kg; i.g.), 30 min before the injection of PTZ (35 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)). Treatments with QCTA-1 or PHEN and PTZ were performed once every 48 h (on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 11th days). After each PTZ injection, the animals were observed for 30 min to assess the stage of seizure intensity. Behavioral parameters were evaluated from the 12th day until the 16th day of the experimental protocol. On the 16th day, mice were euthanized, and the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice were removed to determine the thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and reactive species (RS) levels, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), Na+/K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities. Our results demonstrated that QTCA-1 significantly decreased the seizure stage score in PTZ-kindled mice. QCTA-1 protected against memory impairment induced by PTZ. QTCA-1 normalized oxidative stress and Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the cerebral structures of PTZ-kindled mice. The effect of QTCA-1 treatment was similar to the positive control used in this study (PHEN). AChE activity did not change in the cerebral structures in PTZ- kindling mice. In conclusion, QCTA-1 may be a promising tool for the treatment of epileptogenesis and epilepsy-associated comorbidity (memory impairment). QCTA-1 to prevent these alterations may involve the reduction of oxidative stress and normalization of Na+/K+-ATPase activity.

AB  - Little is known about the influence of (impaired) neurodevelopment on cognitive aging. We here used a mouse model for tuberous sclerosis (TS) carrying a heterozygous deletion of the Tsc2 gene. Loss of Tsc2 function leads to mTOR hyperactivity in mice and patients. In a longitudinal behavioral analysis, we found premature decline of hippocampus-based cognitive functions together with a significant reduction of immediate early gene (IEG) expression. While we did not detect any morphological changes of hippocampal projections and synaptic contacts, molecular markers of neurodegeneration were increased and the mTOR signaling cascade was downregulated in hippocampal synaptosomes. Injection of IGF2, a molecule that induces mTOR signaling, could fully rescue cognitive impairment and IEG expression in aging Tsc2+/- animals. This data suggests that TS is an exhausting disease that causes erosion of the mTOR pathway over time and IGF2 is a promising avenue for treating age-related degeneration in mTORopathies.
   Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in Tsc1 or Tsc2 genes, leading to hyperactivity of the mTOR pathway. Using a conventional Tsc2+/- model, we observed a premature decline of cognitive functions and a reduction of immediate early gene expression, that could be rescued by IGF2. Our data suggest that TS is an exhausting disease that causes erosion of the mTOR pathway over time and IGF2 is a promising avenue for treating age-related degeneration in mTORopathies.image

AB  - The sedimentary sequence of Ararat-1 Cave encapsulates an intricate depositional archive (Marine Isotope Stage 3), crucial for our understanding of the Middle Palaeolithic in the Armenian Highlands and beyond. The study of this record is accomplished through the use of a multi-proxy geoarchaeological framework of analysis, incorporating stratigraphical, micromorphological, sedimentological, mineralogical, chemical, magnetic, microarchaeological and geochronological methods. These analyses demonstrate the predominance of geogenic processes, including rockfalls, grain and debris flows, interbedded with aeolian sedimentation, as well as localised pyroclastic material in-wash events. Post-depositional alterations are primarily linked to intense bioturbation, as well as minimal karst-induced cementation and minor phosphate diagenesis. The study of the anthropogenic and biogenic records indicates dynamic human-animal habitation histories. Human visits, associated with combustion and consumption activities, were infrequent and short-lived, representing brief occupation episodes in a cave habitually visited by carnivores and herbivores. This high-resolution reconstruction of Ararat-1 Cave formation histories improves our understanding of regional settlement and mobility patterns, highlighting the presence of Middle Palaeolithic groups that temporarily camped in the Ararat Depression.

AB  - Saponins, a diverse group of natural compounds, offer an interesting pool of derivatives with biomedical application. In this study, three structurally related spirostanol saponins were isolated and identified from the leek flowers of Allium porrum L. (garden leek). Two of them were identical with the already known leek plant constituents: aginoside (1) and 6-deoxyaginoside (2). The third one was identified as new component of A. porrum; however, it was found identical with yayoisaponin A (3) obtained earlier from a mutant of elephant garlic Allium ampeloprasun L. It is a derivative of the aginoside (1) with additional glucose in its glycosidic chain, identified by MS and NMR analysis as (2 ff, 3 fi, 6 fi, 25R)-2,6-dihydroxyspirostan-3-yl fi-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 ! 3)- fi-D-glucopranosyl-(1 ! 2)-[ fi-D-xylopyranosyl-(1 ! 3)]- fi-D-glucopyranosyl]-(1 ! 4)- fi-Dgalactopyranoside, previously reported also under the name alliporin. The leek native saponins were tested together with other known and structurally related saponins (tomatonin and digitonin) and with their related aglycones (agigenin and diosgenin) for in vitro cytotoxicity and for effects on NO production in mouse peritoneal cells. The highest inhibitory effects were exhibited by 6deoxyaginoside. The obtained toxicity data, however, closely correlated with the suppression of NO production. Therefore, an unambiguous linking of obtained bioactivities of saponins with their expected immunobiological properties remained uncertain.

AB  - Background: Thiamine deficiency (TD) has a number of features in common with the neurodegenerative diseases development and close relationship between TD and oxidative stress (OS) has been repeatedly reported in the literature. The aim of this study is to understand how alimentary TD, accompanied by OS, affects the expression and level of two thiamine metabolism proteins in rat brain, namely, thiamine transporter 1 (THTR1) and thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK1), and what factors are responsible for the observed changes.
   Methods: The effects of OS caused by TD on the THTR1 and TPK1 expression in rat cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus were examined. The levels of active and oxidized forms of ThDP (enzymatically measured) in the blood and brain, ROS and SH-groups in the brain were also analyzed.
   Results: TD increased the expression of THTR1 and protein level in all studied regions. In contrast, expression of TPK1 was depressed. TD-induced OS led to the accumulation of ThDP oxidized inactive form (ThDPox) in the blood and brain. In vitro reduction of ThDPox by dithiothreitol regenerates active ThDP suggesting that ThDPox is in disulfide form. A single high-dose thiamine administration to TD animals had no effect on THTR1 expression, partly raised TPK1 mRNA and protein levels, but is unable to normalize TPK1 enzyme activity. Brain and blood ThDP levels were increased in these conditions, but ThDPox was not decreased.
   General significance: It is likely, that the accumulation of ThDPox in tissue could be seen as a potential marker of neurocellular dysfunction and thiamine metabolic state.

AB  - Aeolianites and cemented foreshore deposits on South Africa's Cape south coast have the capacity to record and preserve events that transpired on them when they were composed of unconsolidated sand. Thirty-five Pleistocene elephant tracksites have been identified along this coastline. This abundance of sites along what was the margin of the vast Palaeo-Agulhas Plain allows for an appreciation of the forms that elephant tracks and traces can take in the context of the global proboscidean track record. They point to a significant regional elephant presence from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 (similar to 400 ka) through MIS 5 (similar to 130-80 ka) to MIS 3 (similar to 35 ka) and also indicate repeated use of certain dune areas. They buttress Holocene and historical evidence that elephants made use of open areas in the region, and that the remaining "Knysna elephants" retreated into dense afrotemperate forest for protection in recent centuries. Analogies can be drawn between Pleistocene elephant tracks and Mesozoic dinosaur tracks, and some of the Cape south coast elephant tracks are among the largest Cenozoic (and hence, Quaternary) tracks ever to be described. A newly identified tracksite in this area may provide the first reported evidence of elephant trunk-drag impressions.

AB  - The endocannabinoid system (eCS) is widely distributed in mammalian tissues and it is classically formed by cannabinoid receptors, endogenous bioactive lipids and its synthesis and degradation enzymes. Due to the modulatory role of eCS in synaptic activity in the Central Nervous System (CNS), phytocannabinoids have been increasingly used for the treatment of neurological disorders, even though little is known in terms of the long-term effect of these treatments on CNS development, mainly in the timeframe that comprises childhood and adolescence. Furthermore, an increased number of clinical trials using full-spectrum Cannabis extracts has been seen, rather than the isolated form of phytocannabinoids, when exploring the therapeutical benefits of the Cannabis plant. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effect of cannabidiol (CBD)-enriched Cannabis extract on synaptic components in the hippocampus of rats from adolescence to early adulthood (postnatal day 45 to 60). Oral treatment of healthy male Wistar rats with a CBD-enriched Cannabis extract (3 mg/kg/day CBD) during 15 days did not affect food intake and water balance. There was also no negative impact on locomotor behaviour and cognitive performance. However, the hippocampal protein levels of GluA1 and GFAP were reduced in animals treated with the extract, whilst PSD95 levels were increased, which suggests rearrangement of glutamatergic synapses and modulation of astrocytic features. Microglial complexity was reduced in CA1 and CA3 regions, but no alterations in their phagocytic activity have been identified by Iba-1 and LAMP2 co-localization. Collectively, our data suggest that CBD-enriched Cannabis treatment may be safe and well-tolerated in healthy subjects, besides acting as a neuroprotective agent against hippocampal alterations related to the pathogenesis of excitatory and astrogliosis-mediated disorders in CNS.

AB  - Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a hormone exerting vasoconstrictive and antidiuretic action in the periphery and serves as a neuromodulator in the brain. Although the hippocampus receives vasopressinergic innervation and AVP has been shown to facilitate the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, the involved ionic and signaling mechanisms have not been determined. Here we found that AVP excited CA1 pyramidal neurons by activation of V-1a receptors. Functions of G proteins and phospholipase C beta (PLC beta) were required for AVP-elicited excitation of CA1 pyramidal neurons, whereas intracellular Ca2+ release and protein kinase C were unnecessary. PLC beta-mediated depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) was required for AVP-elicited excitation of CA1 pyramidal neurons. AVP augmented the input resistance and increased the time constants of CA1 pyramidal neurons. AVP induced an inward current in K+-containing intracellular solution, whereas no inward currents were observed with Cs+-containing intracellular solution. AVP-sensitive currents showed inward rectification with a reversal potential close to the K+ reversal potential, suggesting the involvement of inwardly rectifying K+ channels. AVP-induced currents were sensitive to the micromolar concentration of Ba2+ and tertiapin-Q, whereas application of ML 133, a selective Kir2 channel blocker had no effects, suggesting that AVP excited CA1 pyramidal neurons by depressing G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels. Activation of V-1a receptors in the CA1 region facilitated glutamatergic transmission onto subicular pyramidal neurons, suggesting that AVP modulates network activity in the brain. Our results may provide one of the cellular and molecular mechanisms to explain the in vivo physiological functions of AVP.

AB  - Genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) enable long-term monitoring of cellular and subcellular dynamics of this second messenger in response to environmental and developmental cues without relying on exogenous dyes. Continued development and optimization in GECIs, combined with advances in gene manipulation, offer new opportunities for investigating the mechanism of Ca2+ signaling in fungi, ranging from documenting Ca2+ signatures under diverse conditions and genetic backgrounds to evaluating how changes in Ca2+ signature impact calcium-binding proteins and subsequent cellular changes. Here, we attempted to express multi-color (green, yellow, blue, cyan, and red) circularly permuted fluorescent protein (FP)-based Ca2+ indicators driven by multiple fungal promoters in Fusarium oxysporum, F. graminearum, and Neurospora crassa. Several variants were successfully expressed, with GCaMP5G driven by the Magnaporthe oryzae ribosomal protein 27 and F. verticillioides elongation factor-1? gene promoters being optimal for F. graminearum and F. oxysporum, respectively. Transformants expressing GCaMP5G were compared with those expressing YC3.60, a ratiometric Cameleon Ca2+ indicator. Wild-type and three Ca2+ signaling mutants of F. graminearum expressing GCaMP5G exhibited improved signal-to-noise and increased temporal and spatial resolution and are also more amenable to studies involving multiple FPs compared to strains expressing YC3.60.

AB  - Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is inflammation of the sinuses and nasal passages that lasts for >3 months. Its pathogenesis is complex, treatment is difficult, and it has multiple effects on patients. Although surgical treatment can effectively relieve the symptoms, the recurrence rate is high, and there are postoperative complications such as infection. At present, nasal spray hormone, antibiotics and other western drugs are used in clinical treatment, but there are drug dependence and toxic side effects. However, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has made remarkable progress in the treatment and promotion of postoperative recovery, guided by its unique TCM theory, and has little toxic and side effects, providing more treatment options for patients. Purpose: The review aims to elucidate the mechanism of CRS from the aspects of traditional medicine and modern medicine, and evaluate the influence of TCM compound, components of TCM, TCM nasal irrigation, TCM fumigation and other auxiliary treatment methods on CRS, providing a new perspective for the application of TCM in CRS. Methods: We conducted the literature retrieval with PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar and CNKI databases in a systematic manner (up to July 2024). The keywords included "sinusitis", "chronic rhinosinusitis", "nasal polyps", "herbal medicine", "medicinal plants", "traditional Chinese medicine", "oxidative stress", "pathogenic microbial", "anatomic structure" and so on. The obtained literatures were comprehensively sorted out. For image creation, Figdraw 2.0 was methodically employed. Results: The pathogenesis of CRS involves various interaction mechanisms such as bacterial biofilm formation, oxidative stress injury and impaired ciliary mucosa clearance. It is worth noting that TCM exerts therapeutic effects by targeting the above-mentioned pathological processes. Clinical studies have confirmed that TCM comprehensive therapy can significantly improve sinus symptom score, accelerate postoperative mucosal epithelialization, and promote postoperative rehabilitation of CRS. We also discussed the toxic side effects and clinical applications of related drugs. Conclusion: In TCM, CRS is classified under the diagnostic category of Bi Yuan. Its pathogenesis is attributed to exogenous invasion of the six climatic pathogens (Liu Yin: wind, cold, summer heat, dampness, dryness, and fire), spleen-stomach qi deficiency, internal damp-heat accumulation, and qi-blood stasis. Guided by TCM principles, therapeutic strategies are individualized through syndrome differentiation, which tailors interventions to the patient's unique clinical manifestations. Therapeutic modalities include oral herbal formulations (e.g., decoctions or granules), acupuncture, and acupoint application. These approaches aim to restore physiological balance by harmonizing yin and yang, resolving meridian obstructions, and enhancing lung qi circulation to alleviate nasal congestion and improve ventilation.

AB  - Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) is a widely used industrial chemical detected in human umbilical cord blood and breast milk, and has been suggested to exhibit developmental neurotoxicity. Previous studies on mice reported that neonatal exposure to PFHxS altered neuroprotein levels in the developing brain, and caused behavioral toxicity and cognitive dysfunction in the mature brain. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for PFHxS-induced neuroprotein dysregulation are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the effect of neonatal exposure to PFHxS on memory function using an in vivo mice model. Furthermore, we examined the levels of growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (biomarkers of neuronal development) and the involved signaling pathways using differentiated neuronal PC12 cells. PFHxS decreased cell viability, GAP-43 and CaMKII levels, and neurite formation. These effects were mediated by the NMDA receptor, PKC-alpha, PKC-delta, AMPK and ERK pathways. MK801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, reduced the activation of PKC-alpha, PKC-delta, ERK and AMPK. The activation of ERK was suppressed by pharmacological and knockdown inhibition of PKC-alpha and -delta. Interestingly, the AMPK pathway was selectively inhibited by inhibiting PKC-delta but not PKC-alpha. Consistent with PFHxS-induced neuronal death, and GAP-43 and CaMKII downregulation, neonatal exposure to PFHxS caused significant memory impairment in adult mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate that PFHxS induces persistent developmental neurotoxicity, as well as GAP-43 and CaMKII downregulation via the NMDA receptor-mediated PKCs (alpha and delta)-ERK/AMPK pathways.

AB  - The Galeria de las Estatuas is a Mousterian site located within the Cueva Mayor-Cueva del Silo karstic system at the Sierra de Atapuerca (Burgos, Spain). This site is characterised by an important Upper Pleistocene strati graphic sequence in which a large number of lithic artefacts exhibiting clear Mousterian affinities and a rich assemblage of faunal remains have been found. Additionally, this site has yielded a foot phalanx of a clear Neanderthal affinities and its sediment has yielded Neanderthal mitochondrial and nuclear DNA.Two test pits, GE-I and GE-II, have been excavated since 2008 which have been divided in 5 and 2 lithostratigraphical units, respectively. A minimum age of 45 ka cal BP for this site was obtained by radiocarbon dating in GE-II. This chronology was refined using single-grain Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL: 80-112 ka in GE-I and 70-79 ka in GE-II) and single-grain thermally transferred OSL (TT-OSL). Although in all case TT-OSL ages were systematically older than their single-grain counterparts. The detrital sequence is sealed by a flow stone whose base is dated to 53.7 +/- 3.5 ka cal BP using U-series dating.In order to better constrain the age of this site, nine herbivorous teeth were collected from the whole sedimentary sequence to be dated by the ESR/U-series dating method though only seven provided modelled ages. Six of them were collected from levels 2 to 5 of the GE-I test pit while the last tooth was taken from level 2 of the GE II test pit. Our results, ranging between 80 and 110 ka, are in agreement with those obtained by single grain TTOSL and suggest that the sedimentological levels containing Mousterian lithic artefacts and faunal and human remains began to be deposited during the second part of the MIS5. These results fill a temporal gap in the chronology of the Atapuerca sites for which no contemporary MIS5 date was obtained until recently.

Methods: We retrospectively analysed the data collected from 25 centres across India on COVID-19-associated mucormycosis. We included only CAPM and excluded subjects with disseminated or rhino-orbital mucormycosis. We defined co-existent CAPA if a respiratory specimen showed septate hyphae on smear, histopathology or culture grew Aspergillus spp. We also compare the demography, predisposing factors, severity of COVID-19, and management of CAPM patients with and without CAPA. Using a case-control design, we assess whether mixed mould infection (primary exposure) were associated with early mortality in CAPM. Results: We included 105 patients with CAPM. The prevalence of mixed mould infection was 20% (21/105). Patients with mixed mould infection experienced early mortality (9/21 [42.9%] vs. 15/84 [17.9%]; p = 0.02) and poorer survival at 6 weeks (7/21 [33.3] vs. 46/77 [59.7%]; p = 0.03) than CAPM alone. On imaging, consolidation was more commonly encountered with mixed mould infections than CAPM. Co-existent CAPA (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 19.1 [2.62-139.1]) was independently associated with early mortality in CAPM after adjusting for hypoxemia during COVID-19 and other factors. Conclusion: Coinfection of CAPA and CAPM was not uncommon in our CAPM patients and portends a worse prognosis. Prospective studies from different countries are required to know the impact of mixed mould infection.

AB  - Ultrasonic plasticization microinjection molding (UPMIM) presents a great application prospect in the PP microneedle array molding field by virtue of significant reduction of melt viscosity, energy, and material saving. In order to achieve efficient, rapid, and high-volume fabrication of polymer microneedle arrays, this paper presents a method for the preparation of polypropylene (PP) microneedle arrays with a high replication rate and good mechanical and penetration properties. The micromilling technology is adopted to prepare the metal core at first, and then, UPMIM is used for the preparation of PP microneedle arrays. The influence of the ultrasonic effect on plasticization rate, viscosity, and crystalline property of PP is mastered in this research. The molding experimental results show that the maximum replication rate of the PP microneedle array can reach 98.6 +/- 0.6%, achieving the precision molding of the PP microneedle array. The test results of mechanical and penetration performance show that the PP microneedle array presents the approximate displacement & horbar;force character under different compression speeds and owns good mechanical performance; the PP microneedle array can completely pierce into the 0.1 and 0.2 mm silica membrane and the surface of pig skin, showing a good penetration performance. Therefore, UPMIM can prepare the PP microneedle array efficiently and accurately and presents important application value in its mass production.

AB  - The shift to increased meat consumption is one of the major adaptive changes in hominin dietary evolution. Although meat eating by Oldowan hominins is well evidenced at Pleistocene archaeological sites in eastern Africa by butchery marks on bones, the methods through which carcasses were acquired (i.e., hunting vs. scavenging) and extent of their completeness (fleshed vs. defleshed) is less certain. This study addresses these issues through a geographic information systems (GIS) comparative analysis of bone modification patterns created by hominins and carnivores observed in the ca. 2.0 Ma assemblage from Kanjera South, Kenya and those of several modern, experimentally modified bone assemblages. Comparison of GIS-generated models shows that the pattern of bone preservation at Kanjera South is similar to that found in experimental bone assemblages that were first butchered and hammerstone fractured by humans, and subsequently scavenged by carnivores. The distribution of bone modifications on the Kanjera fauna also suggests hominins had early access to small bovids. Butchery marks appear almost exclusively in 'hot zones'-areas where flesh does not typically survive lion consumption-further suggesting Kanjera hominins were not scavenging carnivore kills. Our findings support previous claims that the Kanjera assemblage offers the earliest clear evidence of repeated butchery of antelope carcasses by Early Stone Age (Oldowan) hominins and perhaps the earliest evidence for hunting. Kanjera carnivore damage frequencies are lower than those reported for the slightly younger site of FLK Zinj (Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania), suggesting differing competitive regimes at the two sites.

AB  - Camelids have been known in South America since the late Pliocene, where they arrived from North America as part of the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI). They became extinct in North America by the late Pleistocene, while surviving in the Southern Cone of South America and in high altitudes of the Andean region. Extinct South American camelids are generally included in the genera Palaeolama and Hemiauchenia, members of which are larger than modern species. We describe here a new, small species of the genus Hemiauchenia based on late Pleistocene specimens previously assigned to Lama guanicoe. This specimen lived in northeastern Brazil at 22 345-21 907 cal a bp, and had a diet composed mainly of C3 plants.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the possible role of pesticide exposure in contributing to neurological diseases such as depression. Here, we evaluated whether a subchronic low dose of a glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) could induce alterations in the central nervous system, using the flavonoid quercetin as a therapeutic strategy. Forty mice were divided into four treatment groups: control, GBH, quercetin, and GBH+Quer groups and received 50 mg/kg of GBH solution, 30 mg/kg of quercetin, and/or vehicles for 30 days via gavage. After performing behavioral tests, such as the open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM), forced swim test (FST), and sucrose preference test (SPT), the mice were euthanized and their hippocampal tissues were collected to measure the levels of oxidative stress markers such as reactive species (RS), total antioxidant capacity (FRAP), reduced glutathione (GSH), and acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE), as well as for histological evaluation. The GBH group showed anxious and depressive-like behavior in the EPM and FST tests, as well as increased levels of RS and decreased GSH levels in the hippocampus. Quercetin treatment in the GBH+Quer group allowed partial or total improvement in behavioral tests (EPM and FST) and in the levels of oxidative stress markers (RS and GSH). However, the quercetin group showed similar behavior to the GBH group after treatment. The results revealed that oral exposure to a subchronic low dose of GBH was capable of promoting effects on behavior and oxidative stress in the hippocampus of mice. In addition, despite quercetin having a neuroprotective role, caution is needed when considering the possible per se effects of its continuous supplementation.

AB  - Many difficulties related to using antibodies in diagnostic and therapeutic applications can sometimes be circumvented by using smaller, less complex single domain antibodies based on variable heavy chain (VH) domain constructs such as camelid VHH domains. However, VH domains have their own limitations, including an increased tendency to aggregate. VH domains often contain hydrophobic residues within their complementaritydetermining regions (CDRs) that facilitate binding to target antigens but can also mediate VH domain aggregation, which is a concern for therapeutic applications since this can trigger immune responses. In this study, we engineered the human VH-1Ba domain to improve its stability and solubility by introducing charged amino acids in the VH domain framework region and CDRH1. We followed two strategies to improve the stability and solubility of VH domains. First, we introduced positive and negatively charged amino acids in the framework region of an autonomous human VH domain (VH-B1a) and observed the effect of framework net charge on VH domain refolding, stability, and solubility. Introducing positive charge into the VH-B1a framework increased its thermostability but slightly lowered its refolding ability and solubility. We were not able to obtain correctly folded negatively charged (-VH) VH domains. Second, we introduced a series of positive and negatively charged amino acids in the CDRH1 loop of near-neutral (VH-B1a) and positively charged (+VH) VH domains, and observed their effect on expression, refolding, stability, and solubility. For both the VH-B1a and +VH domains, we observed a decrease in melting temperature (Tm) and room temperature solubility as more negative or positive charged amino acids were added to the CDRH1. The VH-B1a domain had higher room temperature solubility for negative and slightly positive CDRH1 net charges. The + VH domain had higher Tms for all CDRH1 net charges and was better able to tolerate the adverse effects of adding positive charge to CDRH1. We observed a similar response in refolding and solubility of VH-B1a and +VH in response to changes in CDRH1 net charge after temperature-induced denaturation for negative and neutral CDRH1s. We observed a positional effect with a single Lys (31K) and double Lys (31, 32 KK) substitutions in CDRH1, which promoted VH-B1a aggregation and was partially overcome by the +VH domain. In summary, this study provides information for designing VH domains with improved biophysical properties and a +VH domain that will be useful for applications where positive surface charge and CDRH1 are desirable.

AB  - Simple Summary Endometritis, both with non-infectious and infectious backgrounds, is one of the most prevalent pathological states among domestic animals. In animals, it generates severe economic problems, including lowered reproductive indices and rising medical treatment costs, and in women, it might lead to severe fertility impairment. In order to determine how the autonomic nervous system responds to such a pathological state, an experimental group of pigs were treated with Escherichia coli injection into the uterine horns, and several ganglions responsible for innervation of this organ were examined, including the paracervical ganglion located on both sides of the broad ligament of the uterus. The results clearly showed a strong impact of the inflammation on the chemical coding of neurons, some even synthesizing neurotransmitters de novo such as the GAL-expressing perikarya. Additionally, applied injections decreased the number of parasympathetic, acetylcholinesterase-expressing neurons implying the importance of the cholinergic population to keep the inflammation under control. The obtained data serve as a basis for the future implementation of modern treatment and enhancements in animal breeding. The focus of this study was based on examining the impact of endometritis on the chemical coding of the paracervical ganglion (PCG) perikaryal populations supplying pig uterus. Four weeks after the injection of Fast Blue retrograde tracer into uterine horns, either the Escherichia coli (E. coli) suspension or saline solution was applied to both horns. Laparotomy treatment was performed for the control group. Uterine cervices containing PCG were extracted on the eighth day after previous treatments. Subsequent macroscopic and histopathologic examinations acknowledged the severe form of acute endometritis in the E. coli-treated gilts, whereas double-labeling immunofluorescence procedures allowed changes to be analyzed in the PCG perikaryal populations coded with vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and/or somatostatin (SOM), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), a neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), galanin (GAL). The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) detection method was used to check for the presence and changes in the expression of this enzyme and further confirm the presence of cholinergic perikarya in PCG. Treatment with E. coli resulted in an increase in VAChT+/VIP+, VAChT+/VIP-, VAChT+/SOM+, VAChT+/SOM-, VAChT+/GAL- and VAChT+/nNOS- PCG uterine perikarya. An additional increase was noted in the non-cholinergic VIP-, SOM- and nNOS-immunopositive populations, as well as a decrease in the number of cholinergic nNOS-positive perikarya. Moreover, the population of cholinergic GAL-expressing perikarya that appeared in the E. coli-injected gilts and E. coli injections lowered the number of AChE-positive perikarya. The neurochemical characteristics of the cholinergic uterine perikarya of the PCG were altered and influenced by the pathological state (inflammation of the uterus). These results may indicate the additional influence of such a state on the functioning of this organ.

AB  - Asthma is a heterogeneous chronic airway disease with an unmet need for improved therapeutics in uncontrolled severe disease. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor upregulated in asthma. The CaSR agonist, spermine, is also increased in asthmatic airways and contributes to bronchoconstriction. CaSR negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) oppose chronic airway inflammation, remodeling, and hyperresponsiveness in murine and guinea pig asthma models, but whether CaSR NAMs are effective acute bronchodilators compared with standard of care has not yet been established. Furthermore, the ability of different classes of NAMs to inhibit spermine-induced CaSR signaling or methacholine (MCh)-induced airway contraction has not been quantified. Here, we show CaSR NAMs differentially inhibit spermine-induced intracellular calcium mobilization and inositol monophosphate accumulation in HEK293 cells stably expressing the CaSR. NAMs reverse MCh-mediated airway contraction in mouse precision-cut lung slices with similar maximal relaxation compared with the standard treatment, salbutamol. Of note, the bronchodilator effects of CaSR NAMs are maintained under conditions of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor desensitization when salbutamol efficacy is abolished. Furthermore, overnight treatment with some, but not all, CaSR NAMs prevents MCh-mediated bronchoconstriction. These findings further support the CaSR as a putative drug target and NAMs as alternative or adjunct bronchodilators in asthma.

AB  - The oxygen content in the fish ponds is facing greater challenges than before in the aquaculture of mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) due to the change of climate and eutrophication. Until now, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the harmful effects of hypoxia on this species. In this work, we built transcriptomes for the mandarin fish that were exposed to decreased oxygen concentration at two times points (24 hand 96 h). The respiratory metabolism activities of pyruvate kinase (PK), hexokinase (HK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) had different significantly changes during hypoxic treatment. Histological observation of the gill and brain also revealed some damages by hypoxia. A total of 196,355 transcripts were involved in the Gene Ontology analysis, and the numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the brain and the gill between the control and experiment groups are 141 and 552 respectively involved in the different hypoxic stress time. The DEGs were then analyzed using KEGG enrichment analysis. The results showed significant differences in the expression of some genes involved in ribosome pathways,biosynthesis of amino acids, hippo signaling pathway, and pentose phosphate pathway,glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway and the TCA cycle. The huge number of transcriptome sequences collected in this study has enhanced the mandarin fish gene resources, and the identified DEGs and related pathway analysis give essential information for understanding biological responses to hypoxia.

AB  - Background Whether dysregulated iron metabolism is associated with COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) remains unknown. Herein, we compare the serum iron indices in COVID-19 subjects with and without mucormycosis. Methods We conducted a case-control study enrolling COVID-19 participants with and without mucormycosis. We compared the baseline serum iron indices (iron, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity [TIBC], unsaturated iron-binding capacity and percentage transferrin saturation) between CAM cases and COVID-19 controls. Additionally, we performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess whether any iron indices are associated with CAM. Results We enrolled 28 CAM cases (mean age 53.6 years old; 78.6% men) and 26 controls (mean age 57.2 years old; 73.1% men). Rhino-orbital (+/- cerebral) mucormycosis (85.7%) was the most clinical presentation. Diabetes mellitus was more frequent in the cases than controls (75% vs. 42.3%; p = .015). Hypoxaemia during COVID-19 illness was more common in controls than cases. The mean serum iron values (33 vs. 45 mu g/dl, p = .03) and TIBC (166.6 vs. 201.6 mu g/dl, p = .003) were significantly lower in CAM cases than controls. On multivariate analysis, we found a lower TIBC (odds ratio [OR] 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-0.99) and diabetes mellitus (OR 5.23; 95% CI, 1.21-22.68) to be independently associated with CAM after adjusting for serum iron, ferritin and glucocorticoid therapy. The case fatality rate of CAM was 73.9%. The iron indices were not significantly different between CAM survivors and non-survivors. Conclusions The CAM is associated with lower TIBC levels than COVID-19 subjects without mucormycosis, suggesting dysregulated iron metabolism in its pathogenesis. Further studies are required to confirm our preliminary observations.

AB  - Early-life stress (ELS) is considered a relevant etiological factor for neurodegenerative and mental disorders. In the present study, we hypothesized that ELS may persistently and sex dependently influence blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and function during critical periods of brain development and consequently determine susceptibility to and sex-related prevalence of chronic diseases in adult life. We used the maternal separation (MS) procedure in rats to model ELS and evaluated BBB permeability and gene expression of selected tight junction (TJ) proteins, glucose transporter type 1 (Slc2a1) and aquaporin 4 (Aqp4) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsal striatum (dSTR) and hippocampus of juvenile and adult rats. Serum concentrations of a peripheral marker of BBB function (S100 beta) and proinflammatory cytokines were also assessed. We observed developmental sealing of the BBB and sex differences in the permeability of the BBB and the mRNA expression of TJ proteins and Slc2a1. Adult females showed lower BBB permeability and higher levels of Cldn3, Cldn5, Ocln, and Slc2a1 in the mPFC and dSTR than males. MS temporarily increased BBB permeability in the dSTR of juvenile males and affected mRNA expression of the majority of studied proteins related to BBB function in age-, region- and sex-dependent manners. Additionally, MS sex dependently decreased serum S100 beta levels and did not affect proinflammatory cytokine concentrations. In general, our study did not reveal a clear or strong negative effect of MS on BBB integrity. However, the results suggest that ELS may induce adaptive/maladaptive changes or compensatory mechanisms within the BBB of unknown yet consequences.

TI  - Tea polyphenol mediated CsMYB77 regulation of CsPOD44 to promote tea plant (Camellia sinensis) root drought resistance

AB  - Drought stress significantly alters the metabolic homeostasis of tea plants; however, few studies have examined the role of specific metabolites, particularly tea polyphenols, in drought resistance. This study reveals that the tea polyphenol content in drought-tolerant tea cultivars tends to increase under drought conditions. Notably, in environments characterized by staged and repeated drought, changes in tea polyphenol are significantly positively correlated with drought resistance. To investigate this further, we irrigated the roots with exogenous tea polyphenols before subjecting the plants to drought. Our findings indicated that the absorptive roots of the experimental group exhibited enhanced development, improved cellular integrity, and a significant increase in peroxidase activity. A comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome revealed that tea polyphenols are closely associated with the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway. Notably, CsMYB77 and CsPOD44 genes were identified as highly correlated with this pathway. Overexpression experiments in Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated that CsMYB77 promotes the expression of phenylpropanoid pathway genes, thereby enhancing drought resistance. Conversely, antisense oligonucleotide silencing of CsMYB77 decreased drought resistance in tea plants. Additional experiments, including yeast one-hybrid assays, luciferase complementation imaging, dual-luciferase assays, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, confirmed that CsMYB77 positively regulates the expression of CsPOD44. In summary, our findings indicate that the differences in drought tolerance among tea cultivars are closely linked to phenylpropanoid metabolism. Specifically, tea polyphenols may mediate the regulatory network involving CsMYB77 and CsPOD44, thereby enhancing stress resistance by promoting root development. This study offers new insights into the breeding of drought-resistant tea cultivars.

AB  - Macrophages are the foremost controllers of innate and acquired immunity, playing important roles in tissue homeostasis, vasculogenesis, and congenital metabolism. In vitro macrophages are crucial models for understanding the regulatory mechanism of immune responses and the diagnosis or treatment of a variety of diseases. Pigs are the most important agricultural animals and valuable animal models for preclinical studies, but there is no unified method for porcine macrophage isolation and differentiation at present; no systematic study has compared porcine macrophages obtained by different methods. In the current study, we obtained two M1 macrophages (M1_IFN gamma + LPS, and M1_GM-CSF) and two M2 macrophages (M2_IL4 + IL10, and M2_M-CSF), and compared the transcriptomic profiles between and within macrophage phenotypes. We observed the transcriptional differences either between or within phenotypes. Porcine M1 and M2 macrophages have consistent gene signatures with human and mouse macrophage phenotypes, respectively. Moreover, we performed GSEA analysis to attribute the prognostic value of our macrophage signatures in discriminating various pathogen infections. Our study provided a framework to guide the interrogation of macrophage phenotypes in the context of health and disease. The approach described here could be used to propose new biomarkers for diagnosis in diverse clinical settings including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), African swine fever virus (ASFV), Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), Haemophilus parasuis serovar 4 (HPS4), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhp), Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2), and LPS from Salmonella enterica serotype minnesota Re 595.

AB  - Background: Previous research has demonstrated that glycyrrhizic acid (GA) exhibits antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiapoptotic characteristics. Using myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury as a case study, this study aims to clarify the functional significance of GA and to elucidate the mechanisms involved. Materials and methods: In this study, an MI/R injury model was established both in vivo and in vitro to investigate the impact of GA on MI/R injury. The viability of H9c2 cells was evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit -8. Myocardial damage was assessed through the measurement of creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) levels and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), HE staining, and MASSON staining. Inflammatory cytokine levels (IL -6, IL-1 beta, IL -10, and TNF-alpha) were measured to determine the presence of inflammation. Cellular oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring ROS and MMP levels, while cardiac function was assessed using cardiac color Doppler ultrasound. Immunofluorescence staining to determine the nuclear translocation of YAP, TUNEL to determine apoptosis, and western blotting to determine gene expression. Results: GA treatment effectively alleviated myocardial injury induced by MI/R, as evidenced by reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL -6, IL -10, and TNF-alpha) and cardiac biomarkers (CK-MB, LDH) in MI/R rats. Moreover, There was a significant increase in cell viability in vitro after GA treatment and inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative stress, while also increasing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in vitro. The Western blot findings indicate that GA treatment effectively suppressed apoptosis in both in vivo and in vitro settings. Additionally, GA demonstrated inhibitory effects on the activation of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway triggered by MI/R and facilitated YAP nuclear translocation both in vitro and in vivo. It has been found, however, in vitro, that silencing the YAP gene negates GA's protective effect against hypoxia/reoxygenationinduced myocardial injury. Conclusion: This study suggests that GA regulates YAP nuclear translocation by inhibiting the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, which protects ists against MI/R injury.

AB  - Isolated teeth and bones of rhinoceroses are sometimes difficult to identify at specific level because our poor knowledge of the morphological variability of fossil and, often, of extant species. During the past century, several studies have been devoted to highlight morphological and morphometric differences among the fossil Pleistocene species, but only a few of them considered the variability of the extant taxa, in particular Dicerorhinus sumatrensis, to support and interpret their results. Dicerorhinus sumatrensis is the closest extant relative of the Eurasian Stephanorhinus, as recently evidenced by molecular analyses, and it provides useful data to better understand the variability in extinct Pleistocene Eurasian taxa. Taking into account the observations on the extant Sumatran rhinoceros, the validity of some morphological traits, often used for specific attribution in Early Pleistocene fossil rhinoceroses, is revised. Sexual dimorphism and ontogenetic stage drive the development of some important features in Eurasian rhinoceroses and a detailed comparison among crania lead to new considerations on taxonomy, and, therefore, on paleobiogeography and biochronology of the different species.

AB  - With the widespread presence of plastic wastes, knowledge about the potential environmental risks and bioavailability of micro- or nanoplastics fragmented from large analogs is of utmost importance. As the particle size matters in mediating endocytic mechanism and particle internalization, we first studied the effects of polystyrene microparticles (PS-MPs, 1 mu m) and polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NPs, 100 nm) of two different sizes at varying concentrations of 5, 25 and 75 mu g/mL on the mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells. The in vitro study showed efficient cellular uptake of PS-MPs and PS-NPs of both sizes. The adverse effects of cellular metabolic activity as reflective of excess Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and cell cycle S phase arresting were observed especially at the greater concentration of smaller-sized PS particles, consequently leading to mild cytotoxicity. We further evaluated the dynamic particle-cell interaction with a continuous supply of PS particles using a microfluidic device. By recapitulating the in vivo mechanical microenvironments while allowing homogeneous distribution of PS particles, the dynamic exposure to PS particles of both sizes under flowing conditions resulted in much lesser viability of neural cells than the traditional static exposure. As the flowing dynamics may avoid the gravitational settling of particles and allow more efficient cellular uptake, the size distribution, together with the exposure configurations, contributed significantly to the determination of the PS particle cytotoxicity. The on-chip investigation and a better understanding of particle translocation mechanisms would offer very much to the risk assessment of PS particles on human health.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Psychogenic nonepileptic (functional) seizures (FS) clinically resemble epileptic seizures (ES) with both often preceded by traumatic brain injury (TBI). FS and ES emergence and occurrence after TBI may be linked to aberrant neurobehavioral stress responses. We hypothesized that neural activity signatures in response to a psychosocial stress task would differ between TBI + FS and TBI + ES after controlling for TBI status (TBI-only). Methods: In the current multicenter study, participants were recruited prospectively from Rhode Island Hospital, Providence Rhode Island Veterans Administration Medical Center, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham Medical Center. Previous diagnoses of TBI, ES, and FS were verified based on data collected from participants, medical chart and record review, and, where indicated, results of EEG and/or video -EEG confirmatory diagnosis. TBI + ES (N = 21) and TBI + FS (N = 21) were matched for age and sex and combined into an initial group (TBI + SZ; N = 42). A TBI-only group (N = 42) was age and sex matched to the TBI with seizures (TBI + SZ) group. All participants completed an fMRI control math task (CMT) and stress math task (SMT) based on the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST). Results: The TBI + SZ group (n = 24 female) did not differ in mood or anxiety severity compared to TBI-only group (n = 24 female). However, TBI + FS group (n = 11 female) reported greater severity of these symptoms compared to TBI + ES (n = 13 female). The linear mixed effects analysis identified neural responses that differed between TBI-only and TBI + SZ during math performance within the left premotor cortex and during auditory feedback within bilateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus/amygdala regions. Additionally, neural responses differed between TBI + ES and TBI + FS during math performance within the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral amygdala during auditory feedback within the supplementary motor area. All tests comparing neural stress responses to psychiatric symptom severity failed to reach significance. Discussion: Controlling for TBI and seizure status, these findings implicate specific nodes within frontal, limbic, and sensorimotor networks that may maintain functional neurological symptoms and possibly distinguish FS from ES. This study provides class II evidence of differences in neural responses to psychosocial stress between ES and FS after TBI.

AB  - Recently, business sectors have focused on offering a wide variety of services through utilizing different modern technologies such as super apps in order to fulfill customers' needs and create a satisfactory user experience. Accordingly, studying the user experience has become one of the most popular trends in the research field due to its essential role in business prosperity and continuity. Thus, many researchers have dedicated their efforts to exploring and analyzing the user experience across social media, blogs, and websites, employing a variety of research methods such as machine learning to mine users' reviews. However, there are limited studies concentrated on analyzing super app users' experiences and specifically mining Arabic users' reviews. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze and discover the most important topics that affect the user experience in the super app environment by mining Arabic business sector users' reviews in Saudi Arabia using biterm topic modeling, CAMeL sentiment analyzer, and doc2vec with k-means clustering. We explore users' feelings regarding the extracted topics in order to identify the weak aspects to improve and the strong aspects to enhance, which will promote a satisfactory user experience. Hence, this paper proposes an Arabic text annotation framework to help the business sector in Saudi Arabia to determine the important topics with negative and positive impacts on users' experience. The proposed framework uses two approaches: topic modeling with sentiment analysis and topic modeling with clustering. As a result, the proposed framework reveals four important topics: delivery and payment, customer service and updates, prices, and application. The retrieved topics are thoroughly studied, and the findings show that, in most topics, negative comments outweigh positive comments. These results are provided with general analysis and recommendations to help the business sector to improve its level of services.

AB  - The skeletons of marine sponges are ancient biocomposite structures in which mineral phases are formed on 3D organic matrices. In addition to calcium- and silicate-containing biominerals, iron ions play an active role in skeleton formation in some species of bath sponges in the marine environment, which is a result of the biocorrosion of the metal structures on which these sponges settle. The interaction between iron ions and biopolymer spongin has motivated the development of selected extreme biomimetics approaches with the aim of creating new functional composites to use in environmental remediation and as adsorbents for heavy metals. In this study, for the first time, microporous 3D spongin scaffolds isolated from the cultivated marine bath sponge Hippospongia communis were used for electro-assisted deposition of iron oxides such as goethite [alpha-FeO(OH)] and lepidocrocite [gamma-FeO(OH)]. The obtained iron oxide phases were characterized with the use of scanning electron microscopy, FTIR, and X-ray diffraction. In addition, mechanisms of electro-assisted deposition of iron oxides on the surface of spongin, as a sustainable biomaterial, are proposed and discussed.

AB  - A new sandwich-type Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method was developed based on goat IgG as capturing antibody and rabbit IgG as detecting antibody targeting soluble antigenic fish proteins in foods as detection targets. The assay has provided a relatively lower limit of quantitation (LoQ) for fish proteins with LoQ 0.5 ng/ml and appears highly sensitive. The analysis of 24 different substances, both raw and boiled, revealed no cross-reactivity above the cut-off point of the limit of quantitation. Recoveries of the SB spiked food matrixes were in the range of 83-131%. Assay precision testing proved that repeatability (<5%) and reproducibility (<11%) had an acceptable level of variation. The sandwich ELISA was capable of detecting all tested commercially important fish. As a potential analytical tool, the newly developed immunoenzymatic method is suitable for detecting undeclared fish residues in real food samples available in the market, thereby will help to reduce the incidents of fish allergies.

AB  - Edible scarab beetles are important repositories for nutritive and bioactive compounds, but this information remains largely unexplored. This study explored the nutritional and therapeutic properties of two edible scarab beetles from three different locations (Embu, Murang'a and Nairobi Counties) in Kenya. Morphological and molecular characterization of the wild collected larvae revealed two important edible beetle species (Cetonia aurata L. and Oryctes rhinoceros L.). The larvae of both species are excellent source of crude proteins (44% for O. rhinoceros and 63% for C. aurata). The larvae of O. rhinoceros were rich in minerals, particularly calcium (15.75-22.65 mg/g) and potassium (13.62-22.88 mg/g). The anti-radical activity of C. aurata larvae ranged between 91% and 92% across the various target sites. Lysine was the most important and abundant amino acid in both larvae (>5 mg/g). The larvae of C. aurata and O. rhinoceros are a good source of unsaturated fatty acids like Methyl-8Z, 11Z, 14Z-eicosatrienoate (32 mg/g) and Methyl-9Z-octadecenoate (9.47-120.84 mg/g). The entomochemicals of phenolic nature derived from the beetle larvae portray a unique opportunity to supply and improve high quality nutritious food with enhanced ability to get-rid of free radicals, thus promoting good health and well-being of the consumers. Future development of foods supplemented with scarab beetle larvae derived products must consider the preservation of potential benefits of not only nutrients, but also nutraceuticals.

AB  - Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) suppressed spermatogenesis leading to male reproductive toxicity, while the precise mechanism remains uncertain. Here, this study explored the role of miR-450b-3p in male reproductive toxicity induced by SiNPs. In vivo study, we found that SiNPs caused apoptosis of spermatocytes, decreased quantity and quality of sperms, up-regulated the cytoskeleton proteins (Layilin, Talin, and Vinculin), activated the Hippo pathway (Rho A, Yap, and p73), downregulated the expression of miR-450b-3p, damaged the compactness and density of desmosomes between spermatocytes and the basal of the testis. Moreover, in vitro study, we confirmed that SiNPs increased the expressions of cytoskeleton proteins, activated the Hippo pathway, and suppressed miR-450b-3p expressions. Meanwhile, miR-450b-3p mimic inhibited the up-regulation of cytoskeleton proteins, suppressed the activation of the Hippo pathway, and relieved the adhesion and traction stress. Eventually, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to validate the traction stress and adhesion between GC-2spd cells enhanced by deregulation of miR-450b-3p. Taken together, we concluded that SiNPs suppressed spermatogenesis via inhibiting miR-450b-3p, in turn up-regulating the expression of cytoskeleton proteins, then inducing apoptosis via activating the Hippo pathway and enhancing the traction force and adhesion between GC-2spd cells. This work provides novel evidence for the study of reproductive toxicity and risk assessment of SiNPs.

AB  - Simple Summary Seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) are currently exposed to a multitude of anthropogenic pressures worldwide. The illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fisheries and trade of these flagship species undermine the efforts to manage and protect their wild populations. Here we aim to validate a forensic tool to identify the geographic origin of seahorses and contribute to the ongoing fight against the illegal capture and trade of these organisms. The elemental fingerprints of long-snouted seahorse (Hippocampus guttulatus) bony structures, including the subdermal bony plates that cover their body, revealed that they can be successfully employed to confirm their geographic origin. The results of this first study using seahorses raised in captivity indicate that this tool may also allow to discriminate between different populations of wild specimens and enhance the traceability of traded specimens. The global market of dried seahorses mainly supplies Traditional Chinese Medicine and still relies on blurry trade chains that often cover less sustainable practices targeting these pricey and endangered fish. As such, reliable tools that allow the enforcement of traceability, namely to confirm the geographic origin of traded seahorses, are urgently needed. The present study evaluated the use of elemental fingerprints (EF) in the bony structures of long-snouted seahorses Hippocampus guttulatus raised in captivity in two different locations (southern Portugal and Northern Spain) to discriminate their geographic origin. The EF of different body parts of H. guttulatus were also evaluated as potential proxies for the EF of the whole body, in order to allow the analysis of damaged specimens and avoid the use of whole specimens for analysis. The contrasting EF of H. guttulatus raised in the two locations allowed their reliable discrimination. Although no single body part exactly mimicked the EF of the whole body, seahorse trunks, as well as damaged specimens, could still be correctly allocated to their geographic origin. This promising forensic approach to discriminate the geographic origin of seahorses raised in captivity should now be validated for wild conspecifics originating from different locations, as well as for other species within genus Hippocampus.

AB  - Early life stress (ELS) can cause long-term changes by epigenetic factors, especially histone acetylation modification, playing a crucial role, affect normal cognition, mood, and behavior, and increase susceptibility to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adulthood. It has been found that paeoniflorin (PF) can cross the blood-brain barrier to exert anti -PTSD effects on adult PTSD rats. However, whether PF can alleviate the harmful effects caused by ELS in adulthood has not yet been reported. Therefore, to explore the relationship between ELS and PTSD susceptibility in adulthood and its mechanism, in this study, SPS was used as a stressor of ELS, and the mathematical tool Z-normalization was employed as an evaluation criterion of behavioral resilience susceptibility. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of PF on histone acetylation in the hippocampus and amygdala of ELS rats in adulthood, using changes in HATs/HDACs as the entry point, meanwhile, the epigenetic marks (H3K9 and H4K12) in the key brain regions of ELS (hippocampus and amygdala) were evaluated, and the effects of PF on behavioral representation and PTSD susceptibility were observed. This study found that ELS lead to a series of PTSD-like behaviors in adulthood and caused imbalance of HATs/HDACs ratio in the hippocampus and amygdala, which confirms that ELS is an important risk factor for the development of PTSD in adulthood. In addition, paeoniflorin may improve ELS-induced PTSD-like behaviors and reduce the susceptibility of ELS rats to develop PTSD in adulthood by modulating the HATs/HDACs ratio in the hippocampus and amygdala.

AB  - Ultrasound technology is widely studied for advanced manufacturing. In the present paper, measurement, analysis of ultrasound-induced cavitation and characterization of energy distribution in horn-type ultrasonic probe (20 kHz) are presented. Mapping was made with variation in ultrasound power (USP) [150-500 W], using ultrasonic cavitation energy (UCE) sensor in a cylindrical process vessel of two capacities (1 and 3 L) and energy profiles plotted as 3D graphical representation for different conditions (d(p), H-s, V-s) applicable to any given generic process. The results indicate maximum UCE at center of the vessel, coinciding with ultrasound probe axis. There is about 8-16.7% reduction of UCE due to the presence of leather for 3-L and 1-L beaker for various USPs. However, average UCE increases with an increase in USP 150 to 500 W for 3-L beaker, with and without leather. Ultrasound absorption coefficient (alpha) in goat leather has been calculated to be in the range of 9.5-10 and 19.5-10.4 (m(2)) Sabins, respectively, for 3-L and 1-L beaker experiments. In 1-L beaker, distance from US probe tip to leather surface at d = 3 and 4 cm provides better UCE: 8.8 and 6.3 W/cm(2), respectively, and corresponding better enhancement factor in %Exhaustion: 32.3 and 28.7 in leather dyeing with ultrasound, compared to control. Prediction model of UCE from ultrasound power density, independent of configuration and regression model for various USPs was proposed, found to be comparable with experimental values. This analysis could be useful in design and development of ultrasound system for scale-up in a broader perspective and for leather in specific.

AB  - Female and male glial fibrillary acidic protein-thymidine kinase (GFAP-TK) transgenic rats were made ethanol dependent via a six-week chronic intermittent ethanol vapor (CIE) and ethanol drinking (ED) procedure. During the last week of CIE, a subset of male and female TK rats was fed valcyte to ablate dividing progenitor cells and continued the diet until the end of this study. Following week six, all CIE rats experienced two weeks of forced abstinence from CIE-ED, after which they experienced relapse to drinking, extinction, and reinstatement of ethanol seeking sessions. CIE increased ED in female and male rats, with females having higher ethanol consumption during CIE and relapse sessions compared with males. In both sexes, valcyte reduced the levels of Ki-67-labeled progenitor cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and did not alter the levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Valcyte increased ED during relapse, increased lever responses during extinction and, interestingly, enhanced latency to extinguish ethanol-seeking behaviors in males. Valcyte reduced the reinstatement of ethanol-seeking behaviors triggered by ethanol cues in females and males. Reduced seeking by valcyte was associated with the normalization of cytokines and chemokines in plasma isolated from trunk blood, indicating a role for progenitor cells in peripheral inflammatory responses. Reduced seeking by valcyte was associated with increases in tight junction protein claudin-5 and oligodendrogenesis in the dentate gyrus and reduction in microglial activity in the dentate gyrus and mPFC in females and males, demonstrating a role for progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus in dependence-induced endothelial and microglial dysfunction. These data suggest that progenitor cells born during withdrawal and abstinence from CIE in the dentate gyrus are aberrant and could play a role in strengthening ethanol memories triggered by ethanol cues via central and peripheral immune responses.

AB  - Tissue-engineered skeletal muscle is a promising novel therapy for the treatment of volumetric muscle loss (VML). Our laboratory has developed tissue-engineered skeletal muscle units (SMUs) and engineered neural conduits (ENCs), and modularly scaled them to clinically relevant sizes for the treatment of VML in a large animal (sheep) model. In a previous study, we evaluated the effects of the SMUs and ENCs in treating a 30% VML injury in the ovine peroneus tertius muscle after a 3-month recovery period. The goal of the current study was to expand on our 3-month study and evaluate the SMUs and ENCs in restoring muscle function after a 6-month recovery period. Six months after implantation, we found that the repair groups with the SMU (VML+SMU and VML+SMU+ENC) restored muscle mass to a level that was statistically indistinguishable from the uninjured contralateral muscle. In contrast, the muscle mass in the VML-Only group was significantly less than groups repaired with an SMU. Following the 6-month recovery from VML, the maximum tetanic force was significantly lower for all VML injured groups compared with the uninjured contralateral muscle. However, we did demonstrate the ability of our ENCs to effectively regenerate nerve between the distal stump of the native nerve and the repair site in 14 of the 15 animals studied. Impact StatementVolumetric muscle loss (VML) is a clinically relevant problem for which current treatment options are lacking and for which tissue-engineered skeletal muscle presents a promising novel therapeutic option. However, the fabrication of tissues of clinically relevant sizes is necessary for advancement of the technology to the clinic. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of our scaled-up tissue-engineered skeletal muscle to treat VML in a large animal (sheep) model after a 6-month recovery.

AB  - During aging, microglia - the resident macrophages of the brain - exhibit altered phenotypes and contribute to age-related neuroinflammation. While numerous hallmarks of age-related microglia have been elucidated, the progression from homeostasis to dysfunction during the aging process remains unresolved. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we undertook complementary cellular and molecular analyses of microglia in the mouse hippocampus across the adult lifespan and in the experimental aging model of heterochronic parabiosis. Single-cell RNA-Seq and pseudotime analysis revealed age-related transcriptional heterogeneity in hippocampal microglia and identified intermediate states of microglial aging that also emerge following heterochronic parabiosis. We tested the functionality of intermediate stress response states via TGF beta 1 and translational states using pharmacological approaches in vitro to reveal their modulation of the progression to an activated state. Furthermore, we utilized single-cell RNA-Seq in conjunction with in vivo adult microglia-specific Tgfb1 conditional genetic knockout mouse models to demonstrate that microglia advancement through intermediate aging states drives transcriptional inflammatory activation and hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline.

AB  - Colostrum provides newborns with nutrients and immunoglobulins that play a major role in the immune system. In this survey, the immunoglobulin G (IgG) content, gross composition, mineral content, and fatty acid composition were determined in the colostrum of Valle del Belice ewes with the aim of evaluating the effect of lambing of season. In total, we analysed 60 bulk tank colostrum samples taken after lambing during two seasons (summer and winter). The IgG content and Brix mean values were 40.35 g/L and 21.02%, respectively. The colostrum fat, protein, casein, and lactose percentages were 8.01, 12.10, 8.51, and 3.13%, respectively. The lambing season significantly influenced the pH and somatic cell count, with higher values observed in winter than in summer. The most common fatty acids were palmitic (27.75 vs. 24.84 g/100 g), oleic (24.57 vs. 18.15 g/100 g), myristic (12.55 vs. 12.16 g/100 g) and stearic (7.02 vs. 6.16 g/100 g) detected in the summer and winter seasons, respectively. The winter season significantly increased the polyunsaturated fatty acid values (11.18 vs. 6.41). Additionally, the lambing season determined different mineral composition levels in the colostrum, particularly copper (8.50 vs. 5.35 mu mol L-1) and manganese (3.35 vs. 0.80 mu mol L-1), which were higher in the summer. Based on IgG content, the quality of the colostrum was excellent.

AB  - The brain forms robust associations between odors and emotionally salient memories, making odors especially effective at triggering fearful or traumatic memories. Using Pavlovian olfactory fear conditioning (OFC), a variant of the traditional tone-shock paradigm, this study explored the changes involved in its processing. We assessed the expression of neuronal plasticity markers phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (pCREB) and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (pMAPK) 24 h and 14 days following OFC, in newborn neurons (EdU+) and in brain regions associated with olfactory memory processing; the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, amygdale, and hippocampus. Here, we show that all proliferating neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb were colocalized with pCREB at 24 h and 14 days post-conditioning, and the number of proliferating neurons at both time points were statistically similar. This suggests the occurrence of long-term potentiation within the neurons of this pathway. Finally, OFC significantly increased the density of pCREB- and pMAPK-positive immunoreactive neurons in the medial and cortical subnuclei of the amygdala and the posterior piriform cortex, suggesting their key involvement in its processing. Together, our investigation identifies changes in neuroplasticity within critical neural circuits responsible for olfactory fear memory.

AB  - Inherited endosymbiotic bacteria from the genera Rickettsia, Wolbachia, and Spiroplasma cause the death of male offspring in ladybirds (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae). As a rule, bacteria are transmitted through the cytoplasm of the mother's egg to offspring, vertically. In addition to vertical transfer, there is increasing evidence of horizontal transfer of symbionts between unrelated insect taxa. Insect parasites such as mites can be potential vectors of endosymbiotic bacteria. The parasitic mite Coccipolipus hippodamiae (McDaniel & Morrill, 1969) (Acarina: Podapolipidae) occurs in natural populations of Coccinellidae. In this work, the ability of C. hippodamiae to become infected with Wolbachia and Spiroplasma from hosts and to spread bacteria among coccinellid beetles was proven for the first time.

AB  - Among pro-tumor transcriptional complexes, activating protein-1 (AP-1) controls the expression of key oncogenes in cancer. Therefore, avenues for chemical inhibition approach of the AP-1 transcriptional complex are warranted in cancer therapeutics. The biological role of novel tripeptides enriched goat urine DMSO fraction (GUDF) were evaluated by in vitro DNA damage and cell-based assays. Tripeptides enriched GUDF were treated upon HCT-116 cells to estimate the nature of intracellular tripeptides that are responsible for antiproliferative effects. Here, we report a novel vertical tube gel electrophoresis (VTGE) assisted intracellular metabolite purification assay. Identified tripeptides were subjected to molecular docking and simulation to evaluate inhibitory role upon AP-1 (c-Jun:c-Fos:DNA) complex. GUDF enriched with tripeptides showed appreciable DNA instability up to 90% and 70% proliferation arrest in HCT-116 cells. LC-HRMS analysis of intracellular metabolites of GUDF treated HCT-116 cells revealed the abundance of tripeptides such as Glu-Glu-Arg, Gly-Arg-Pro, Gln-Lys-Arg, Glu-Glu-Lys, Trp-Trp-Val. Among the identified intracellular tripeptides, Glu-Glu-Arg (- 9.1 kcal/mol) showed strong binding to AP-1 response element specifically heptamer 5 ' TGAGTCA3 '. Tripeptide Glu-Glu-Arg displayed significant fluctuations with RMSF 13.6 angstrom which is about 3 times more than the control within the AP-1 response element. This study reports on a novel tripeptide Glu-Glu-Arg in the intracellular compartment of HCT-116 cells treated by GUDF. Here, proliferation arrest in HCT-116 cells is well supported by the molecular docking and simulation data that strongly suggest the ability of Glu-Glu-Arg to inhibit AP-1 complex. In future, biological relevance of Glu-Glu-Arg may be explored as an anticancer candidate.

AB  - The intricate system of connections between the eye and the brain implies that there are common pathways for the eye and brain that get activated following injury. Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) related encephalopathy is a consequence of brain injury caused by oxygen and blood flow deprivation that may result in visual disturbances and neurodevelopmental disorders in surviving neonates. We have previously shown that the tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonist/modulator improves neuronal survival and long-term neuroprotection in a sexually differential way. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that; 1) TrkB agonist therapy improves the visual function in a sexually differential way; 2) Visual function detected by electroretinogram (ERG) correlates with severity of brain injury detected by magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging following neonatal HI in mice. To test our hypotheses, we used C57/BL6 mice at postnatal day (P) 9 and subjected them to either Vannucci's rodent model of neonatal HI or sham surgery. ERG was performed at P 30, 60, and 90. MRI was performed following the completion of the ERG. ERG in these mice showed that the a-wave is normal, but the b-wave amplitude is severely abnormal, reducing the b/a wave amplitude ratio. Inner retina function was found to be perturbed as we detected severely attenuated oscillatory potential after HI. No sex differences were detected in the injury and severity pattern to the retina as well as in response to 7,8-DHF therapy. Strong correlations were detected between the percent change in b/a ratio and percent hemispheric/hippocampal tissue loss obtained by MRI, suggesting that ERG is a valuable noninvasive tool that can predict the long-term severity of brain injury.

AB  - The dynamic protective capacity of (poly)phenols, attributed to their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has been consistently reported. Due to their capacity to alter gut microbiome composition, further actions of (poly)phenols may be exerted through the modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we investigated the protective effect of a (poly)phenol-rich grape and blueberry extract (MemophenolTM), on the microbiota-gut-brain axis in a model of chronic low-grade inflammation (0.5 mg/kg/wk lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 8 weeks). Dietary supplementation of male C57BL/6 J mice with MemophenolTM prevented LPS-induced increases in the microbe-derived uremia-associated molecules, indoxyl sulfate (IS) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). These changes coincided with shifts in gut microbiome composition, notably Romboutsia and Desulfovibrio abundance, respectively. In the brain, LPS exposure disrupted the marginal localisation of the endothelial tight junction ZO-1 and downregulated ZO-1 mRNA expression to an extent closely correlated with TMAO and IS levels; a process prevented by MemophenolTM intake. Hippocampal mRNA sequencing analysis revealed significant downregulation in regulatory pathways of neurodegeneration with MemophenolTM intake. These findings may indicate a novel protective role of the (poly)phenolrich grape and blueberry extract on the endothelial tight junction component ZO-1, acting through modulation of gut microbial metabolism.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially its sporadic form (sAD), is of multifactorial nature. Brain insulin resistance and disrupted zinc homeostasis are two key aspects of AD that remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of dietary zinc deficiency and supplementation on memory, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and insulin signaling in intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (icv-STZ)-induced sAD in rats. The memory performance was evaluated by Morris water maze. The expression of hippocampal protein and mRNA levels of targets related to synaptic plasticity and insulin pathway was assessed by Western blot and real-time quantitative PCR. We found memory deficits in icv-STZ rats, which were fully recovered by zinc supplementation. Western blot analysis revealed that icv-STZ treatment significantly reduced hippocampal PSD95 and p-GSK3 beta, and zinc supplementation restored the normal protein levels. mRNA levels of BDNF, PSD95, SIRT1, GLUT4, insulin receptor, and ZnT3 were found to be reduced by icv-STZ and reestablished by zinc supplementation. Our data suggest that zinc supplementation improves cognitive deficits and rescues the decline in key molecular targets of synaptic plasticity and insulin signaling in hippocampus caused by icv-STZ induced sAD in rats.

AB  - Androgens modulate multiple key aspects of male reproduction, from morphology to mating behavior. Across animals the seasonal patterns of androgens are tightly linked to many of the species' life-history traits and their evolution. One popular framework to address this issue has been the Challenge Hypothesis, which proposed a testosterone-mediated trade-off between mating and parental care in males. Given the lack of empirical support, especially in birds, this hypothesis has been recently revisited (Challenge Hypothesis 2.0), integrating aspects such as male-female interactions and the diversity of reproductive systems in birds. Ratites constitute the most basal avian group (Palaeognathae: ratites together with Tinamiformes) and have certain characteristics that make them unique. They are flightless and generally have promiscuous mating systems with communal nests and maleonly parental care (nest building, incubation and chick rearing). Furthermore, male testosterone concentrations remain high during the entire parental care period. Here we review the reproductive biology of ratites, integrating information on seasonal variations in parental care, social interactions and androgen levels across the group, in light of the Challenge Hypotheses and the Challenge Hypothesis 2.0 (there are no seasonal hormonal data for Tinamiformes, therefore they are not included in this review). We also discuss the constraints that could explain the lack of experimental approaches in behavioral endocrinology across ratites. I hope this review will motivate further research on this basal group of birds and further our understanding of the evolution of the mechanisms in the endocrine system that underly reproductive behavior across birds.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) and electromagnetic fields (EMF) have been extensively studied for their roles in neurobiology, particularly in regulating cerebral functions and synaptic plasticity. This study investigates the impact of EMFs on NO modulation and its subsequent effects on neurodevelopment, building upon prior research examining EMF exposure's consequences on Wistar albino rats. Rats were exposed perinatally to either tap water, 1 g/L of L-arginine (LA) or 0.5 g/L of N-methylarginine (NMA). Half of the rats in each group were also exposed to a 7-Hz square-wave EMF at three separate intensities (5, 50 and 500 nT) for 2-14 days following birth. Animals were allowed to develop, and their brains were harvested later in adulthood (mean age = 568.17 days, SD = 162.73). Histological analyses were used to elucidate structural changes in key brain regions. All brains were stained with Toluidine Blue O (TBO), enabling the visualization of neurons. Neuronal counts were then conducted in specific regions of interest (e.g. hippocampus, cortices, amygdala and hypothalamus). Histological analyses revealed significant alterations in neuronal density in specific brain regions, particularly in response to EMF exposure and pharmacological interventions. Notable findings include a main EMF exposure effect where increased neuronal counts were observed in the secondary somatosensory cortex under low EMF intensities (p < 0.001) and sex-specific responses in the hippocampus, where a significant increase in neuronal counts was observed in the left CA3 region in female rats exposed to EMF compared to unexposed females (t(18) = 2.371, p = 0.029). Additionally, a significant increase in neuronal counts in the right entorhinal cortex was seen in male rats exposed to EMF compared to unexposed males (t(18) = 2.216, p = 0.040). These findings emphasize the complex interaction among sex, EMF exposure and pharmacological agents on neuronal dynamics across brain regions, highlighting the need for further research to identify underlying mechanisms and potential implications for cognitive function and neurological health in clinical and environmental contexts.

AB  - This study investigates the changes in hippocampal proteomic profiles during demyelination and remyelination using the cuprizone model. Employing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for protein profiling, we observed significant alterations in the expression of ketimine reductase mu-crystallin (CRYM) and protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor (PDIA3) following exposure to and subsequent withdrawal from cuprizone. Immunohistochemical staining validated these protein expression patterns in the hippocampus, revealing that both PDIA3 and CRYM were downregulated in the hippocampal CA1 region during demyelination and upregulated during remyelination. Additionally, we explored the potential protective effects of CRYM and PDIA3 against cuprizone-induced demyelination by synthesizing cell-permeable Tat peptide-fusion proteins (Tat-CRYM and Tat-PDIA3) to facilitate their crossing through the blood-brain barrier. Our results indicated that administering Tat-CRYM and Tat-PDIA3 mitigated the reduction in proliferating cell and differentiated neuroblast counts compared to the group receiving cuprizone alone. Notably, Tat-PDIA3 demonstrated significant effects in enhancing myelin basic protein expression alongside phosphorylation of CREB in the hippocampus, suggesting its potential therapeutic role in the prevention or treatment of demyelination, and by extension, in conditions such as multiple sclerosis.

AB  - Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic disorder associated with intellectual disability. To study this syndrome, several mouse models have been developed. Among the most common is the Ts65Dn model, which mimics most of the alterations observed in DS. Ts65Dn mice, as humans with DS, show defects in the structure, density, and distribution of dendritic spines in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Fasudil is a potent inhibitor of the RhoA kinase pathway, which is involved in the formation and stabilization of dendritic spines. Our study analysed the effect of early chronic fasudil treatment on the alterations observed in the hippocampus of the Ts65Dn model. We observed that treating Ts65Dn mice with fasudil induced an increase in neural plasticity in the hippocampus: there was an increment in the expression of PSA-NCAM and BDNF, in the dendritic branching and spine density of granule neurons, as well as in cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the subgranular zone. Finally, the treatment reduced the unbalance between excitation and inhibition present in this model. Overall, early chronic treatment with fasudil increases cell plasticity and eliminates differences with euploid animals.

AB  - Background Neocortex development has been extensively studied in altricial rodents such as mouse and rat. Identification of alternative animal models along the "altricial-precocial" spectrum in order to better model and understand neocortex development is warranted. The Greater cane rat (GCR, Thyronomys swinderianus) is an indigenous precocial African rodent. Although basic aspects of brain development in the GCR have been documented, detailed information on neocortex development including the occurrence and abundance of the distinct types of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the GCR are lacking.Methods GCR embryos and fetuses were obtained from timed pregnant dams between gestation days 50-140 and their neocortex was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining using characteristic marker proteins for NPCs, neurons and glia cells. Data were compared with existing data on closely related precocial and altricial species, i.e. guinea pig and dwarf rabbit.Results The primary sequence of neuro- and gliogenesis, and neuronal maturation is preserved in the prenatal GCR neocortex. We show that the GCR exhibits a relatively long period of cortical neurogenesis of 70 days. The subventricular zone becomes the major NPC pool during mid-end stages of neurogenesis with Pax6 + NPCs constituting the major basal progenitor subtype in the GCR neocortex. Whereas dendrite formation in the GCR cortical plate appears to initiate immediately after the onset of neurogenesis, major aspects of axon formation and maturation, and astrogenesis do not begin until mid-neurogenesis. Similar to the guinea pig, the GCR neocortex exhibits a high maturation status, containing neurons with well-developed dendrites and myelinated axons and astrocytes at birth, thus providing further evidence for the notion that a great proportion of neocortex growth and maturation in precocial mammals occurs before birth.Conclusions Together, this work has deepened our understanding of neocortex development of the GCR, of the timing and the cellular differences that regulate brain growth and development within the altricial-precocial spectrum and its suitability as a research model for neurodevelopmental studies. The timelines of brain development provided by this study may serve as empirical reference data and foundation in future studies in order to model and better understand neurodevelopment and associated alterations.

AB  - Simple Summary In recent years, the shortage of cow stocks and the reduction of cow breeders in China have caused a shortage of cattle resources and a high price of calves, which has become a bottleneck restricting the further development of China's beef cattle industry. At present, there are few studies on the decision-making behavior of cow breeding in China. In order to explore the factors that affect the decision-making behavior on cow breeding by beef cattle farmers, this paper uses field survey data to make an empirical analysis through the Logit ISM model. The results show that the age of the breeder, the breeding year, the planting area of forage, market expectations, the loan amount, the breeding method policy publicity and policy subsidies are significant factors affecting the decision-making behavior of beef cattle farmers on cow breeding. The beef cattle industry is an important part of herbivorous animal husbandry and an important industry to enrich the dietary structure of residents and promote the income of farmers and herdsmen. The cow is an important foundation to support the healthy development of the beef cattle industry, which is related to the stability of cattle sources and the sustainable development of the industry. However, in recent years, the shortage of cows in our country has led to the shortage of cattle resources and the high price of calves, which has restricted the further development of our beef cattle industry. In order to explore the factors that affect the decision-making behavior behind cow breeding and to find the right policy to mobilize the enthusiasm for cow breeding, based on the field survey of five provinces (cities and regions), including Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, this paper conducts an empirical analysis through the Logit ISM model. The results show that market expectation is the surface factor that directly affects the decision-making behavior of cow breeding. The influencing factors of the middle layer are policy propaganda, policy subsidies, breeding years, and feeding methods. The deep root factors are the age of the breeder, the amount of loan, and whether to plant feed crops. Based on this, this paper proposes that we should actively promote the importance of cow breeding, strengthen policy support for cow breeding, formulate scientific and reasonable subsidy policies for cows, innovate financial support methods to solve the problem of fund shortage of farmers, and develop forage resources and reduce the breeding cost of cows.

AB  - The integrity of the structure and function of the endometrium is essential for the maintenance of fertility. However, the repair mechanisms of uterine injury remain largely unknown. Here, we showed that the disturbance of mechanical cue homeostasis occurs after uterine injury. Applying a multimodal approach, we identified YAP as a sensor of biophysical forces that drives endometrial regeneration. Through protein activation level analysis of the combinatorial space of mechanical force strength and of the presence of particular kinase inhibitors and gene silencing reagents, we demonstrated that mechanical cues related to extracellular matrix rigidity can turn off the Rap1a switch, leading to the inactivation of ARHGAP35and then induced activation of RhoA, which in turn depends on the polymerization of the agonist protein F-actin to activate YAP. Further study confirmed that mechanotransduction significantly accelerates remodeling of the uterus by promoting the proliferation of endometrial stromal cells in vitro and in vivo. These studies provide new insights into the dynamic regulatory mechanisms behind uterine remodeling and the function of mechanotransduction.

AB  - This report presents the proceedings from a workshop titled "Microbiome, Metabolism and Immunoregulation of Asthma" that was held virtually May 13 and 14, 2021. The workshop was jointly sponsored by the American Thoracic Society (Assembly on Allergy, Immunology, and Inflammation) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. It convened an interdisciplinary group of experts with backgrounds in asthma immunology, microbiome science, metabolomics, computational biology, and translational pulmonary research. The main purpose was to identify key scientific gaps and needs to further advance research on microbial and metabolic mechanisms that may contribute to variable immune responses and disease heterogeneity in asthma. Discussions were structured around several topics, including 1) immune and microbial mechanisms of asthma pathogenesis in murine models, 2) the role of microbes in pediatric asthma exacerbations, 3) dysregulated metabolic pathways in asthma associated with obesity, 4) metabolism effects on macrophage function in adipose tissue and the lungs, 5) computational approaches to dissect microbiome-metabolite links, and 6) potential confounders of microbiome-disease associations in human studies. This report summarizes the major points of discussion, which included identification of specific knowledge gaps, challenges, and suggested directions for future research. These include questions surrounding mechanisms by which microbiota and metabolites shape host health versus an allergic or asthmatic state; direct and indirect influences of other biological factors, exposures, and comorbidities on these interactions; and ongoing technical and analytical gaps for clinical translation.

AB  - Sunset Yellow, a synthetic orange azo food dye was examined in this study for its impact on the Wistar rat brain sub-regions. The dye was administered orally to weanling rats at the Acceptable Daily Intake level (4 mg/kg/bw) for 40 days, and brain sub-regions viz., frontal cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus were examined for biochemical and histopathological changes. The results showed a significant decrease in tissue protein levels, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activity, as well as a significant increase in lipid peroxide levels in all brain sub-regions. Glutathione-S-transferase and Glutathione Reductase activities decreased, while Glutathione peroxidase activity increased. The biogenic amine levels and Acetylcholinesterase activity were also altered, with the frontal cortex and hippocampus being the most affected. Additionally, the dye caused histopathological damage in all brain sub-regions examined. This study indicates that the ADI level of Sunset Yellow may adversely affect brain tissue by causing oxidative damage.

AB  - Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) represent a subpopulation of tumor cells that can self-renew and generate tumor heterogeneity. Targeting BCSCs may ameliorate therapy resistance, tumor growth, and metastatic progression. However, the origin and molecular mechanisms underlying their cellular properties are poorly understood. The transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) promotes mammary stem/progenitor cell (MaSC) expansion and maintenance but also confers stem-like traits to differentiated tumor cells. Here, we describe the rapid generation of experimentally induced BCSCs by TAZ-mediated reprogramming of human mammary epithelial cells, hence allowing for the direct analysis of BCSC phenotypes. Specifically, we establish genetically well-defined TAZ-dependent (TAZ(DEP)) and -independent (TAZ(IND)) cell lines with cancer stem cell (CSC) traits, such as self-renewal, variable resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, and tumor seeding potential. TAZ(DEP) cells were associated with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition, embryonic, and MaSC signature genes. In contrast, TAZ(IND) cells were characterized by a neuroendocrine transdifferentiation transcriptional program associated with Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Mechanistically, we identify Cyclin D1 (CCND1) as a critical downstream effector for TAZ-driven tumorigenesis. Overall, our results reveal a critical TAZ-CCND1-CDK4/CDK6 signaling axis, suggesting novel therapeutic approaches to eliminate both BCSCs and therapy-resistant cancer cells.

AB  - Objective The maintenance of tight junction integrity contributes significantly to epithelial barrier function. If barrier function is destroyed, cell permeability increases and the movement of pathogens is promoted, further increasing the susceptibility to secondary infection. Here, we examined the protective effects of wogonin on rhinovirus (RV)-induced tight junction disruption. Additionally, we examined the signaling molecules responsible for anti-inflammatory activities in human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells. Methods and results Primary HNE cells grown at an air-liquid interface and RPMI 2650 cells were infected apically with RV. Incubation with RV resulted in disruption of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, E-cadherin, claudin-1, and occludin) in the HNE cells. Cell viability of wogonin-treated HNE cells was measured using the MTT assay. Pretreatment with wogonin decreased RV-induced disruption of tight junctions in HNE cells. Furthermore, wogonin significantly decreased RV-induced phosphorylation of Akt/NF-kappa B and ERK1/2. Additionally, RV-induced generation of reactive oxygen species and RV-induced up-regulation of the production of inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-6 were diminished by wogonin in HNE cells. Conclusion Wogonin inhibits HRV-induced tight junction disruption via the suppression of inflammatory responses and phosphorylation of Akt/NF-kappa B and ERK1/2 in HNE cells. These finds will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

AB  - BackgroundDeep partial-thickness burns have a significant impact on both the physical and mental health of patients. Our previous study demonstrated human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) could enhance the healing of severe burns in small animal burn models, such as rats. Furthermore, our team has developed a deep partial-thickness burn model in Bama miniature pigs, which can be utilized for assessing drug efficacy in preclinical trials for wound healing. Therefore, this study further determine the optimal dosage of hUCMSCs in future clinical practice by comparing the efficacy of low-to-high doses of hUCMSCs on deep partial-thickness burn wounds in Bama miniature pigs.Materials and methodsThe male Bama miniature pigs (N = 8, weight: 23-28 kg and length: 71-75 cm) were used to establish deep partial-thickness burn models, which used a continuous pressure of 1 kg and contact times of 35 s by the invented electronic burn instrument at 100 degrees C to prepare 10 round burn wounds with diameter of 5 cm according to our previous report. And then, 0 x 10<^>7, 1 x 10<^>7, 2 x 10<^>7, 5 x 10<^>7 and 1 x 10<^>8 doses of hUCMSCs were respectively injected into burn wounds of their corresponding groups. After treatment for 7, 14 and 21 days, the burned wound tissues were obtained for histological evaluation, including HE staining for histopathological changes, immunohistochemistry for neutrophil (MPO+) infiltration and microvessel (CD31+) quantity, as well as Masson staining for collagen deposition. The levels of inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-10 and angiogenesis factors angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as well as collagen type-I/type-III of the wound tissues were quantified by ELISA.ResultsAll of doses hUCMSCs can significantly increase wound healing rate and shorten healing time of the deep partial-thickness burn pigs in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, all of doses hUCMSCs can significantly promote epithelialization and decreased inflammatory reaction of wound, including infiltration of inflammatory cells and levels inflammatory factors. Meanwhile, the amounts of microvessel were increased in all of doses hUCMSCs group than those in the burn group. Furthermore, the collagen structure was disordered and partially necrotized, and ratios of collagen type-I and type-III were significantly decreased in burn group (4:1 in normal skin tissue), and those of all hUCMSCs groups were significantly improved in a dose-dependent manner. In a word, 1 x 10<^>8 dose of hUCMSCs could regenerate the deep partial-thickness burn wounds most efficaciously compared to other dosages groups and the burn group.ConclusionThis regenerative cell therapy study using hUCMSCs demonstrates the best efficacy toward a high dose, that is dose of 1 x 10<^>8 of hUCMSCs was used as a reference therapeutic dose for treating 20 cm2 deep partial-thickness burns wound in future clinical practice.

AB  - Monitoring of species, particularly remnant populations requiring urgent conservation is often hampered by the lack of reliable tools for individual identification (using images or their spoor). Here, we develop rapid monitoring tools for individual animals of the Mountain bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci), a critically endangered subspecies of the bongo only found in Kenya. We developed and tested an individual identification system using camera trap footage, as well as a quantitative tool to identify bongo spoor in the field, both useable by naive observers. We implemented an information content approach to assess the importance of different visual elements in 61 individual bongos to optimise our identification system. We tested the reliability of the system with 15 naive observers. We conclude that an optimal identification system should rely on three main visual features (stripe pattern, facial markings and horns appearance). We show that reliability amongst observers is high (kappa = 0.64). We also developed a field scheme to identify footprint and spoor sign. Measurements of bongo footprints were compared with those of waterbuck (Kobus ellypsiprimnus), a syntopic antelope. Confusion occurs between spoor and footprints of both species. We find that differences in the aspect ratio of bongo and waterbuck footprints can identify the two species, 1.22 (+/- 0.08) for bongo and 1.49 (+/- 0.10) for waterbuck. The acquisition of reliable tools ensures monitoring activities are less dependent on individual expertise, which will allow consistent monitoring of bongo remnant populations in the future. The methods we used to develop these monitoring tools can help managers and field workers in the study of this and similar rare species where monitoring is a challenge.

AB  - Freezing behavior is used as a measure of a rodent's ability to learn during fear conditioning. However, it is possible that the expression of other behaviors may compete with freezing, particularly in rodent populations that have not been thoroughly studied in this context. Rearing and grooming are complex behaviors that are frequently exhibited by mice during fear conditioning. Both behaviors have been shown to be stress-sensitive, and the expression of these behaviors is dependent upon strain background. To better understand how genetic background impacts behavioral responses during fear conditioning, we examined freezing, rearing, and grooming frequencies prior to fear conditioning training and across different stages of fear conditioning testing in male mice from eight inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ, SWR/J, BTBR T + ltpr3Tf/J, SM/J, LP/ J, 129S1/SvlmJ) that exhibited diverse freezing responses. We found that genetic background determined rearing and grooming expression throughout fear conditioning, and their patterns of expression across stages of fear conditioning were strain dependent. Using publicly available SNP data, we found that polymorphisms in Dab1, a gene that is implicated in both grooming and learning phenotypes, separated the strains with high contextual grooming from the others using a hierarchical clustering analysis. This suggested a potential genetic mechanism for the observed behavioral differences. These findings demonstrate that genetic background determines behavioral responses during fear conditioning and suggest that shared genetic substrates underlie fear conditioning behaviors.

AB  - Isoflurane, a widely used inhalation anesthetic in clinical practice, is associated with an increased risk of neuronal injury. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal homeostasis under stress conditions; however, its role during isoflurane exposure remains poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of HSP90 inhibition and explore the regulatory mechanisms underlying these effects during isoflurane exposure. We found that the HSP90 inhibitor 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17 AAG) has great protective effects in mitigating isoflurane-induced ferroptosis of mouse hippocampus and cultured neuronal cells. We focused on the activity of the crucial protein GPX4 in ferroptosis and found that 17 AAG exerted protective effects, preserving the physiological GPX4 activity under isoflurane exposure; further, 17 AAG restored the protein level of GPX4. Further, we observed that the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) pathway was activated; 17 AAG also mediated GPX4 degradation under isoflurane exposure. Additionally, it interfered with the formation of complexes between HSP90 and Lamp-2a, inhibiting CMA activity, followed by the blockade of GPX4 degradation, further affecting the isoflurane-induced ferroptosis. Based on these findings, we proposed HSP90 inhibition as a protective mechanism against isoflurane-induced ferroptosis in neurons.

AB  - Microcystins (MCs) are toxic to the central nervous system of mammals. However, the direct toxicity of MCs on mammalian brain cells and the involved molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Here, we incubated primary astrocytes, the major glial cell-type in the brain, with 0-12.5 mu M concentrations of MC-LR for 48 h, and the impairment was evaluated. We found that MC-LR caused significant increases in the cell viability at the range of 0.05-1 mu M concentrations with the highest density at 0.1 mu M concentration. Treatment with 0.1 mu M MC-LR induced YAP nuclear translocation and decreased the ratio of p-YAP to YAP. It also decreased mRNA levels of the upstream regulator (AMOT), and enhanced expressions of YAP interacted genes (Egfr, Tead1, and Ctgf) in primary astrocytes. Overexpression of AMOT significantly attenuated the increase of MC-LR-induced astrocyte proliferation and the expression of YAP downstream genes. These results indicate that Hippo signaling contributed to MC-LR-caused astrocyte proliferation. Further, reactive astrogliosis was observed in the mice brain after MC-LR exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations (20 or 100 mu g/L) through drinking water for 16 weeks. Pathological observations revealed that 100 mu g/L MC-LR exposure caused neuronal damages with characteristics of shrunken or vacuolation in the region of the cerebral cortex, striatum and cerebellum. These results were accompanied with increased oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Our data reveal the potential astrocytic mechanisms in MC-induced neurotoxicity and raise an alarm for neurodegenerative disease risk following daily exposure to MC-LR.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element that, in excess, may initiate adverse health effects. Recent evidence suggested that environmental exposure to Mn may produce thyroid hormone imbalances leading to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. The aim of this review was to summarize available evidence regarding Mn exposure and consequent adverse thyroid effects, including potential implications for neurodevelopmental impairment in children. Medline, EMBASE, and Scopus were systematically searched using two concepts: Mn exposure and thyroid function. A total of 31 studies (17 human studies, 14 toxicological studies) fulfilled eligibility criteria. Evidence for effects attributed to Mn on the thyroid from human studies is inconclusive. No apparent studies were identified to directly characterize Mn thyroid-mediated effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although limited evidence from animal studies provides some support for the effects of Mn on thyroid-related hormones, it is unclear whether such hormonal imbalance is a result of a direct or indirect biological mechanism of action. Toxicokinetic data demonstrated that Mn accumulates in thyroid tissue and might interfere with thyroid function. Currently, there are limited data on biological mechanisms of action for the effects of Mn on the thyroid. Although evidence to date is suggestive of Mn thyroid-related activity, the lack of adequate studies precludes a causal interpretation.

AB  - With increasing maternal cannabis use, there is a need to investigate the lasting impact of prenatal exposure to & UDelta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychotropic compound in cannabis, on cognitive/memory function. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), which relies on polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to function, plays a crucial role in regulating prefrontal cortical (PFC) and hippocampal network-dependent behaviors essential for cognition and memory. Using a rodent model of prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE), we report that male and female offspring display long-term deficits in various cognitive domains. However, these phenotypes were associated with highly divergent, sex-dependent mechanisms. Electrophysiological recordings revealed hyperactive PFC pyramidal neuron activity in both males and females, but hypoactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIPP) in males, and hyperactivity in females. Further, cortical oscillatory activity states of theta, alpha, delta, beta, and gamma bandwidths were strongly sex divergent. Moreover, protein expression analyses at postnatal day (PD)21 and PD120 revealed primarily PD120 disturbances in dopamine D1R/D2 receptors, NMDA receptor 2B, synaptophysin, gephyrin, GAD67, and PPAR & alpha; selectively in the PFC and vHIPP, in both regions in males, but only the vHIPP in females. Lastly, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS), we identified region-, age-, and sex-specific deficiencies in specific neural PUFAs, namely docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA), and related metabolites, in the PFC and hippocampus (ventral/dorsal subiculum, and CA1 regions). This study highlights several novel, long-term and sex-specific consequences of PCE on PFC-hippocampal circuit dysfunction and the potential role of specific PUFA signaling abnormalities underlying these pathological outcomes.

AB  - It is well documented that the stress of separation of mother and baby can lead to short-term physiological instability as well as neurological, sociological or psychological consequences that may last a lifetime. Objective: The goal was to estimate the effect of kangaroo mother care (KMC) on physiological and biochemical parameters of preterm infant stress and maternal stress in neonatal intensive care. Methods: The investigation involved 112 preterm infants. Two groups were compared according to the mean duration of KMC during 12 days of study: the KMC group (mean duration more than 90 min daily) and the control group (less than 90 min). Results: Kangaroo mother care for more than 90 min on average per day in preterm infants is associated 12 days after the intervention with lower mean cortisol levels (p = 0.02), greater weight gain and less need for parenteral nutrition in preterm infants, as well as less postpartum depression (p = 0.02) and lower cortisol levels (p = 0.002) in the mothers of preterm infants. Conclusions: This study suggests that KMC can be used to improve the stress of preterm infants and their mothers, and that the greater weight gain observed in these preterm infants could contribute to a shorter average hospital stay and lower healthcare expenditure.

AB  - Background Heatstroke (HS) is a serious disease caused by central nervous system (CNS) injuries, such as delirium, convulsion, and coma. Currently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have demonstrated novel neuroprotective effects; therefore, this research explores the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of MSCs against HS injury. Methods HS rat models were induced in a 40 degrees C and 65% humidity environment until the rectal temperature reached 42 degrees C. The verified HS injury model rats were divided into the HS and MSCs-treated groups. Each rat in the treated group was infused with 1x10(6) MSCs suspended in 0.3 ml physiological saline via the tail vein. The HS- or MSCs-treated rats were further divided into early-stage (3d) and late-stage (28d). HS rat models were induced by a high-temperature and high-humidity environment at a specific time, the mortality was analyzed, and an automatic biochemical analyzer measured levels of liver and kidney function indicators in the blood. The neurons' morphologic changes were observed through Nissl staining, and neurological deficit scores were performed. Moreover, the levels of inflammatory factors in brain tissue were measured using a multi-cytokine detection platform, and the expression of BDNF, phosphorylated TrkB and P38 were detected by the Western Bolt. Results MSCs injection significantly reduced mortality and alleviated liver and kidney function. Moreover, the neurological deficit and neuronic edema of the hippocampus caused by HS at 3d and 28d were significantly ameliorated by MSCs administration. Specifically, the injection of MSCs inhibited high levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-17A caused by HS but elevated the levels of IL-10 and IL-13 in the early period (3d); while in the later period (28d), MSCs significantly increased the levels of IL-10 and IL-13 continuously and inhibited the high level of IL-17A. Furthermore, MSCs injection increased the expressions of BDNF and phosphorylated TrkB (BDNF receptor), meanwhile inhibiting the expression of phosphorylated P38 (inflammatory factor) in the brains of HS rats in the early period (3d) but had no significant influence on the later period (28d). Conclusion These results suggested that MSCs injection may provide therapeutic effects for HS in rats by improving liver and kidney function and reducing CNS damage. Moreover, MSCs injection inhibited the brain inflammatory response of HS rats, and the BDNF-TrkB and P38/MAPK signal pathways may be involved, providing a potential mechanism for HS therapy by MSCs administration.

AB  - High-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD) consumption can induce cognitive dysfunction and gut microbiota disorder. In the present study, the effects of the polysaccharides from the fruits of Lycium barbarum L. (LBPs) on HFFD-induced cognitive deficits and gut microbiota dysbiosis were investigated. The results showed that intervention of LBPs (200 mg/kg/day) for 14 weeks could significantly prevent learning and memory deficits in HFFD-fed mice, evidenced by a reduction of latency and increment of crossing parameters of platform quadrant in Morris water maze test. Moreover, oral administration of LBPs enhanced the expression of postsynaptic density protein 95 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor and reduced the activation of glial cells in hippocampus. Besides, LBPs treatment enriched the relative abundances of Allobaculum and Lactococcus and reduced the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in gut bacterial community of HFFD-fed mice, accompanied by increased levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as well as expression of associated G protein-coupled receptors. Furthermore, LBPs intervention prevented insulin resistance, obesity and colonic inflammation. Finally, a significant correlation was observed among neuroinflammation associated parameters, gut microbiota and SCFAs through Pearson correlation analysis. Collectively, these findings suggested that the regulation of gut microbiota might be the potential mechanism of LBPs on preventing cognitive dysfunction induced by HFFD.

AB  - The oxidative status of seminal fluid is a critical factor in producing high-quality sperm doses for artificial insemination. This study aimed to investigate the impact of seasonal variations on oxidative stress biomarkers and ROMO1 (Reactive Oxygen Modulator 1) gene expression in Barbari and Sirohi bucks. Four ejaculates of adult breeding Barbari and Sirohi bucks, six from each breed, were collected fortnightly using an artificial vagina during the summer and winter seasons for the study. The redox status of fresh semen samples during the summer and winter seasons was assessed to ascertain oxidative stress in different seasons by evaluating the levels of SOD, CAT, GSH, MDA, and TAC. Spermatozoa were separated from the semen by centrifugation, and ROMO1 gene expression was analysed in both seasons, with GAPDH serving as the housekeeping gene. The results revealed significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of SOD and MDA in summer compared to the winter season, whereas the catalase activity, reduced glutathione, and mean total antioxidant capacity (TAC) concentration were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in winter than summer in both breeds. While no significant difference was observed for SOD, CAT, GSH, MDA, and TAC between the two breeds. ROMO1, a key protein regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in mitochondria, especially in metabolically active cells like sperm, showed significantly (p < 0.05) lower expression in winter compared to the summer season. This suggests that the elevated ROMO1 gene expression during summer might influence the antioxidant defence mechanisms in seminal plasma. This study shows that the elevation of ROMO1 gene expression during the summer season influences the antioxidant defence mechanism in the seminal plasma. In conclusion, the findings highlight the importance of considering seasonal factors in managing reproductive health and optimising sperm quality for artificial insemination in goats.

AB  - Simple Summary Monitoring animal condition is integral for maintaining a healthy flock, increasing ewe productivity, refining animal nutrition, and identifying suitable animals for slaughter. Accurate determination of the body compositions (the amount of fat, muscle, and bone) of ewes can be used to evaluate their conditions, which provides key information to make management decisions. Farmers currently rely on live weight (LW) and body condition score (BCS) to evaluate the health statuses of ewes. This research proposed the use of visual imaging to determine body dimensions, which are then used in combination with LW to predict the body compositions of ewes. The results showed a correlation between fat, muscle, and bone weight determined by computerized tomography (CT) and the fat, muscle, and bone weight estimated by the live weight and body parameters calculated using the image processing application. The results showed an optimal fat of 9% of LW for ewes during the production cycle. If the percentage of fat is less than or more than 9%, farmers have to take action to improve the conditions of the animals to ensure the best performance during weaning and ewe and lamb survival during the next lambing. Farmers are continually looking for new, reliable, objective, and non-invasive methods for evaluating the conditions of ewes. Live weight (LW) and body condition score (BCS) are used by farmers as a basis to determine the condition of the animal. Body composition is an important aspect of monitoring animal condition. The body composition is the amount of fat, muscle, and bone; knowing the amount of each is important because the information can be used for better strategic management interventions. Experiments were conducted to establish the relationship between body composition and body parameters at key life stages (weaning and pre-mating), using measurements automatically determined by an image processing application for 88 Coopworth ewes. Computerized tomography technology was used to determine the body composition. Multivariate linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), and regression tree (RT) statistical analysis methods were used to develop a relationship between the body parameters and the body composition. A subset of data was used to validate the predicted model. The results showed a correlation between fat, muscle, and bone determined by CT and the fat, muscle, and bone weight estimated by the live weight and body parameters calculated using the image processing application, with r(2) values of 0.90 for fat, 0.72 for muscle, and 0.50 for bone using ANN. From these results, farmers can utilize these measurements to enhance nutritional and management practices.

AB  - Background: Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is a prevalent cause of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, up to 30% of individuals with TLE present negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. A comprehensive grasp of the similarities and differences in brain activity among distinct TLE subtypes holds significant clinical and scientific importance. Objective: To comprehensively examine the similarities and differences between TLE with HS (TLE-HS) and MRInegative TLE (TLE-N) regarding static and dynamic abnormalities in spontaneous brain activity (SBA). Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether these alterations correlate with epilepsy duration and cognition, and to determine a potential differential diagnostic index for clinical utility. Methods: We measured 12 SBA metrics in 38 patients with TLE-HS, 51 with TLE-N, and 53 healthy volunteers. Voxel-wise analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc comparisons were employed to compare these metrics. The six static metrics included amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional amplitude of lowfrequency fluctuations (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), degree centrality (DC), and global signal correlation (GSCorr). Additionally, six corresponding dynamic metrics were assessed: dynamic ALFF (dALFF), dynamic fALFF (dfALFF), dynamic ReHo (dReHo), dynamic DC (dDC), dynamic VMHC (dVMHC), and dynamic GSCorr (dGSCorr). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of abnormal indices was employed. Spearman correlation analyses were also conducted to examine the relationship between the abnormal indices, epilepsy duration and cognition scores. Results: Both TLE-HS and TLE-N presented as extensive neural network disorders, sharing similar patterns of SBA alterations. The regions with increased fALFF, dALFF, and dfALFF levels were predominantly observed in the mesial temporal lobe, thalamus, basal ganglia, pons, and cerebellum, forming a previously proposed mesial temporal epilepsy network. Conversely, decreased SBA metrics (fALFF, ReHo, dReHo, DC, GSCorr, and VMHC) consistently appeared in the lateral temporal lobe ipsilateral to the epileptic foci. Notably, SBA alterations were more obvious in patients with TLE-HS than in those with TLE-N. Additionally, patients with TLE-HS exhibited reduced VMHC in both mesial and lateral temporal lobes compared with patients with TLE-N, with the hippocampus displaying moderate discriminatory power (AUC = 0.759). Correlation analysis suggested that alterations in SBA indicators may be associated with epilepsy duration and cognitive scores. Conclusions: The simultaneous use of static and dynamic SBA metrics provides evidence supporting the characterisation of both TLE-HS and TLE-N as complex network diseases, facilitating the exploration of mechanisms underlying epileptic activity and cognitive impairment. Overall, SBA abnormality patterns were generally similar between the TLE-HS and TLE-N groups, encompassing networks related to TLE and auditory and occipital visual functions. These changes were more pronounced in the TLE-HS group, particularly within the mesial and lateral temporal lobes.

AB  - Prefrontal (PFC) and hippocampal (HPC) sequences of neuronal firing modulated by theta rhythms could represent upcoming choices during spatial memory -guided decision -making. How the PFC-HPC network dynamically coordinates theta sequences to predict specific goal locations and how it is interrupted in memory impairments induced by amyloid beta (Ab) remain unclear. Here, we detected theta sequences of firing activities of PFC neurons and HPC place cells during goal -directed spatial memory tasks. We found that PFC ensembles exhibited predictive representation of the specific goal location since the starting phase of memory retrieval, earlier than the hippocampus. High predictive accuracy of PFC theta sequences existed during successful memory retrieval and positively correlated with memory performance. Coordinated PFCHPC sequences showed PFC-dominant prediction of goal locations during successful memory retrieval. Furthermore, we found that theta sequences of both regions still existed under Ab accumulation, whereas their predictive representation of goal locations was weakened with disrupted spatial representation of HPC place cells and PFC neurons. These findings highlight the essential role of coordinated PFC-HPC sequences in successful memory retrieval of a precise goal location.

AB  - The diversity observed in canine breed phenotypes, together with their risk for heritabily disorders of relevance to dogs and humans, makes the species an ideal subject for studies aimed at understanding the genetic basis of complex traits and human biomedical models. Dog10K is an ongoing international collaboration that aims to uncover the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity, disease, behavior, and domestication history of dogs. To best present and make the extensive data accessible and user friendly, we have established the Dog10K (http://dog10k.kiz.ac.cn/) database, a comprehensive-omics resource summarizing multiple types of data. This database integrates single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from 1987 canine genomes, de-novo mutations (DNMs) from 43 dog breeds with >40x sequence, RNA-seq data of 105057 single nuclei from hippocampus, 74067 single cells from leukocytes and 30 blood samples from published canid studies. We provide clear visualization, statistics, browse, searching, and downloading functions for all data. We have integrated three analysis tools, Selscan, LiftOver and AgeConversion, to aid researchers in custom exploration of the comprehensive-omics data. The Dog10K database will serve as a foundational platform for analyzing, presenting and utilizing canine multi-omics data.

AB  - This paper demonstrated the growth ability of twelve algae-microbial consortia (AC) isolated from organic wastes when a pig slurry-derived wastewater (NFP) was used as growth substrate in autotrophic cultivation. Nutrient recovery, biochemical composition, fatty acid and amino acid profiles of algae consortia were evaluated and compared. Three algae-microbial consortia, i.e., a Chlorella-dominated consortium (AC_1), a Tetradesmus and Synechocystis co-dominated consortium (AC_10), and a Chlorella and Tetradesmus co-dominated consortium (AC_12) were found to have the best growth rates (mu of 0.55 +/- 0.04, 0.52 +/- 0.06, and 0.58 +/- 0.03 d(-1), respectively), which made them good candidates for further applications. The ACs showed high carbohydrates and lipid contents but low contents of both proteins and essential amino acids, probably because of the low N concentration of NFP. AC_1 and AC_12 showed optimal omega 6:omega 3 ratios of 3.1 and 3.6, which make them interesting from a nutritional point of view.

AB  - More than 20 years have elapsed since the September 11, 2001 (9/11) terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC), Pentagon and at Shanksville, PA. Many persons continue to suffer a variety of physical and mental health conditions following their exposures to a mixture of incompletely characterized toxicants and psychological stressors at the terrorist attack sites. Primary care and specialized clinicians should ask patients who may have been present at any of the 9/11 sites about their 9/11 exposures, especially patients with cancer, respiratory symptoms, chronic rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, psychiatric symptoms, and substance use disorders. Clinicians, especially those in the NY metropolitan area, should know how to evaluate, diagnose, and treat patients with conditions that could be associated with exposure to the 9/11 attacks and its aftermath. As such, this issue of Archives contains a series of updates to clinical best practices relevant to medical conditions whose treatment is covered by the WTC Health Program. This first paper in the 14-part series describes the purpose of this series, defines the WTC Health Program and its beneficiaries, and explains how relevant Clinical Practice Guidelines were identified. This paper also reminds readers that because physical and mental health conditions are often intertwined, a coordinated approach to care usually works best and referral to health centers affiliated with the WTC Health Program may be necessary, since all such Centers offer multidisciplinary care.

AB  - Our study investigated the innate immune response to Toxoplasma gondii infection by assessing microglial phenotypic changes and sickness behavior as inflammatory response markers post-ocular tachyzoite instillation. Disease progression in Swiss albino mice was compared with the previously documented outcomes in BALB/c mice using an identical ocular route and parasite burden (2 x 10(5) tachyzoites), with saline as the control. Contrary to expectations, the Swiss albino mice displayed rapid, lethal disease progression, marked by pronounced sickness behaviors and mortality within 11-12 days post-infection, while the survivors exhibited no apparent signs of infection. Comparative analysis revealed the T. gondii-infected BALB/c mice exhibited reduced avoidance of feline odors, while the infected Swiss albino mice showed enhanced avoidance responses. There was an important increase in microglial cells in the dentate gyrus molecular layer of the infected Swiss albino mice compared to the BALB/c mice and their respective controls. Hierarchical cluster and discriminant analyses identified three microglial morphological clusters, differentially affected by T. gondii infection across strains. The BALB/c mice exhibited increased microglial branching and complexity, while the Swiss albino mice showed reduced shrunken microglial arbors, diminishing their morphological complexity. These findings highlight strain-specific differences in disease progression and inflammatory regulation, indicating lineage-specific mechanisms in inflammatory responses, tolerance, and resistance. Understanding these elements is critical in devising control measures for toxoplasmosis.

AB  - Young shoots are a completely new and rapidly growing group of foodstuffs. Also known as "vegetable confetti", they are a useful addition to commonly consumed meals and often serve a decorative purpose, especially when paired with traditional dishes. Most users are unaware of their invaluable properties as a source of bioactive compounds and add them simply as a dish garnish. Hence, the aim of this study is to evaluate and compare selected health quality parameters of the young shoots of rare oilseed plants (Nigella sativa L., Carthamus tinctorius L., and Camelina sativa L.), which have not been studied in the literature. They are examined for proximate composition (dry matter, total protein, crude fat, ash, digestible carbohydrates, dietary fiber), antioxidative properties (vitamin C, total carotenoids, and total polyphenol content), the content of sixteen selected minerals (calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, barium, iron, lithium, beryllium, nickel, gallium, indium, bismuth, silver) as well as antioxidant activity at two harvest dates. The ready-to-eat young shoots in the phase of intensive growth are characterized by a very high content of the examined components and antioxidant properties, which differ depending on the harvest date and plant species. Significantly higher contents of protein, fat, and some minerals have been found in the young shoots from the first harvest compared to those from the second harvest. The antioxidant properties of the young shoots generally increase with maturity. It was not possible, however, to conclusively assess which species of young shoots show the highest health quality.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of water stress on plants production. We propose a mathematical model for the dynamics growth of plants that takes into account the concentration of available water in the soil, water stress, plant production and plants compensation. Sensitivity analysis of the model has been performed in order to determine the impact of related parameters on the dynamics growth of plants. We present the theoretical analysis of the model with and without water stress. More precisely, we show that the full model is well-posedness. For each model, we compute the trivial equilibria and derive two thresholds parameters that determine the outcome of water stress within a plantation. Further, we perform numerical simulation on the case of banana-plantain simulations to support the theory. We found that the Hopf bifurcation occurs for a specific value of the water absorption rate of unstressed plants. The impact of the water stress on the banana-plantain production is also numerically investigated. After, the role of the water stress on the plant production is numerically investigated. We found that the water stress can cause about 68.16% of loss of banana-plantain production within a plantation with 1600 rejets initially planted. This suggests that climate change plays a detrimental role on banana-plantains production.

AB  - Camelids are the only mammals that can produce functional heavy-chain antibodies (HCAbs). Although HCAbs were discovered over 30 years ago, the antibody gene repertoire of Bactrian camels remains largely underexplored. To characterize the diversity of variable genes of HCAbs (VHHs), germline and rearranged VHH repertoires are constructed. Phylogenetics analysis shows that all camelid VHH genes are derived from a common ancestor and the nucleotide diversity of VHHs is similar across all camelid species. While species-specific hallmark sites are identified, the non-canonical cysteines specific to VHHs are distinct in Bactrian camels and dromedaries compared with alpacas. Though low divergence at the germline repertoire between wild and domestic Bactrian camels, higher expression of VHHs is observed in some wild Bactrian camels than that of domestic ones. This study not only adds our understanding of VHH repertoire diversity across camelids, but also provides useful resources for HCAb engineering.Copyright (c) 2022, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Genetics Society of China.

AB  - Mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFM or EF-Tu) is part of the mitochondrial translation machinery. It is reported that TUFM expression is reduced in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting that TUFM might play a role in the pathophysiology. In this study, we found that TUFM protein level was decreased in the hippocampus and cortex especially in the aged APP/PS1 mice, an animal model of AD. In HEK cells that stably express full-length human amyloid-beta precursor protein (HEK-APP), TUFM knockdown or overexpression increased or reduced the protein levels of beta-amyloid protein (A beta) and beta-amyloid converting enzyme 1 (BACE1), respectively. TUFM-mediated reduction of BACE1 was attenuated by translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) or alpha-[2-[4-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-2-thiazolyl] hydrazinylidene]-2-nitro-benzenepropanoic acid (4EGI1), and in cells overexpressing BACE1 constructs deleting the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). TUFM silencing increased the half-life of BACE1 mRNA, suggesting that RNA stability was affected by TUFM. In support, transcription inhibitor Actinomycin D (ActD) and silencing of nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) failed to abolish TUFM-mediated regulation of BACE1 protein and mRNA. We further found that the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant TEMPO diminished the effects of TUFM on BACE1, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) played an important role. Indeed, cellular ROS levels were affected by TUFM knockdown or overexpression, and TUFM-mediated regulation of apoptosis and Tau phosphorylation at selective sites was attenuated by TEMPO. Collectively, TUFM protein levels were decreased in APP/PS1 mice. TUFM is involved in AD pathology by regulating BACE1 translation, apoptosis, and Tau phosphorylation, in which ROS plays an important role.

AB  - Diabetic encephalopathy is one of the complications of diabetes, closely related to the degeneration and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BHD) is a classic traditional Chinese medicine prescription, which has the functions of benefit qi, activing blood circulation and dredging collaterals. To investigate the protective effect and mechanism of BHD on hippocampal neurons in diabetes, a high glucose (HG) induced PC12 cell injury model was established, cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected. The protein expression levels were detected by western blot. Rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus were fed high-fat-sugar diet and low dose of streptozotocin for 4 weeks to observe the body weight, fasting blood glucose, etc. The pathological changes of hippocampal CA1 region were observed through hematoxylin-eosin staining, and the expression of related proteins was detected. The results showed that, after BHD intervention, the degree of apoptosis of PC12 cells injured by HG was significantly reduced, and the cell proliferation was significantly increased. In model group, blood glucose increased significantly, weight loss, oral glucose tolerance was abnormal, while BHD group reversed the above changes. Most nerve cells in BHD group had relatively intact structure and less morphological changes. Immunohistochemistry showed that compared with the model group, the expression of Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) in BHD group increased, while the expression of Bax (BCL2-associated X) and caspase-3 decreased. The expression of p-PI3K (phosphorylated phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase), p-AKT (phosphorylated protein kinase B) and Bcl-2 decreased in model and HG group, while the expression of Bax, Caspase-3, and Cleaved Caspase-3 increased. After BHD intervention, p-PI3K, p-AKT, Bcl-2 expression increased, while Bax, Caspase-3 and Cleaved Caspase-3 expression decreased. In conclusion, BHD may play a protective role on diabetic hippocampal neurons by regulating mitochondria related apoptosis protein and up-regulating PI3K-AKT/Bcl-2 signaling pathway.

AB  - Levoglucosan (LGA) is a promising chemical platform derived from the pyrolysis of biomass that offers access to a variety of value-added products. We report an efficient route to produce LGA via the pretreatment of biomass with niobium compounds (oxalate, chloride and oxide) followed by fast pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) at temperatures of 350-600 degrees C. Catalytic pretreatment reduces the quantity of lignin in the biomass, concentrates the cellulose and enhance LGA formation during fast pyrolysis. The pretreatment also removes alkaline metals, preventing competitive side reactions. The effect of several parameters such as catalyst weight, time, temperature, and solvent, with the optimal pretreatment conditions determined to be 3 (wt.%) niobium oxalate for 1 h at 23 degrees C in water. Pretreatment increased the LGA yields by 6.40-fold for sugarcane bagasse, 4.15-fold for elephant grass, 4.13-fold for rice husk, 2.86-fold for coffee husk, and 1.86-fold for coconut husk as compared to the raw biomasses. These results indicate that biomass pretreatment using niobium derivates prior fast pyrolysis can be a promising technique for biomass thermochemical conversion in LGA and others important pyrolytic products.

AB  - Aims: Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects approximately 322 million people worldwide and is a common comorbidity in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). A possible pathophysiological mechanism correlating both diseases is the increased oxidative stress in brain regions due to hyperglycemia. Myrsine coriacea (Primulaceae) is popularly known as "capororoca" and studies have been shown that this plant exhibits several pharmacological properties attributed to myrsinoic acid A (MAA) and B (MAB). Indeed, previous results have been shown its effects on the central nervous system, leading us to explore possible psychotropic effects. Main methods: The effects of treatment with hydroalcoholic extract of the barks from Myrsine coriacea (HEBMC, 150 mg/kg, o.g.), MAA (5 mg/kg, o.g.), and MAB (3 mg/kg, o.g.) were evaluated in streptozotocin (75 mg/kg, i. p.)-induced diabetic female rats. After 28 days of treatments, rats were submitted to the forced swim test (FST) and open field test (OFT). Also, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) levels were evaluated in the hippocampus (HIP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of these rats. Key findings: The treatment with MAA or MAB increased the latency of first immobility in diabetic rats, and the HEBMC administration decreased the immobility time, and increase the climbing in FST. However, only MAB treatment reduces the immobility time, increases the climbing, and swimming in FST, and increases the crossing of diabetic animals in the OFT. Besides, this behavioral improvement promoted by MAB administration was accompanied by reducing in oxidative stress in the HIP and PFC, but not reducing hyperglycemia in diabetic rats. Significance: The results suggest that MAB's antioxidant effect in the HIP of diabetic animals may be essential to its antidepressant-like effect.

AB  - Continuum robots offer significant advantages over traditional ones in some specific scenarios, such as urban search and rescue, minimally invasive surgery, and inspection of cluttered environments. However, motions and/or operations of existing continuum robots always suffer from those limitations in varying curvature interaction scenarios because of the homogeneity and singleness of the structural stiffness. Herein, inspired by the mechanism of an elephant trunk for regulating local stiffness, a three-segment continuum robot constructed by tensegrity structure, which relies on a stiffness tunable material, with its Young's modulus switchable between 1.79 and 271.62 MPa to achieve the robotic stiffness programmable characteristics, is proposed. For predicting the robotic configuration with varying stiffness distribution, a mechanical model based on the framework of the finite element method is derived. Theoretical predictions reveal that the curvature of each segment can be regulated by programming stiffness of the smart materials; therefore, the customizable design can offer an effective route for real-time robotic interactions. By evaluating motion characteristics, stiffness performance, and conformal interaction capability, the experimental results demonstrate that the robot can freely regulate the configuration on-demand, which may provide a foundation for the application of continuum robots with programmable stiffness for interacting with unstructured environments.

AB  - During studies carried out in the period from 2020 to 2021 on the territory of Dagestan, new information about the distribution of six rare bat species was obtained. Trapping confirmed the habitat of Myotis alcathoe in the northern part of the Eastern Caucasus. New findings of M. emarginatus (and of the former) were made exclusively in the foothills of Central Dagestan and are mostly represented by large brood colonies. In two species of the genus Barbastella, the wintering places and distribution in Dagestan (which covers a vast territory from the southern borders of the republic to the latitude of Kizilyurt in the north) were established. In Rhinolophus mehelyi, a sharp decrease in the number in the famous Karabudakhkent Cave was noted. New findings of Tadarida teniotis confirm its wide distribution on the territory of the republic. This species was found for the first time at an altitude of 3763 m above sea level; thus, a new record for the altitude limit of its habitat was established. For the species M. emarginatus, B. barbastellus, and T. teniotis, the characteristics of echolocation signals are given.

AB  - Binge eating, the defining feature of binge eating disorder (BED), is associated with a number of adverse health outcomes as well as a reduced quality of life. Animals, like humans, selectively binge on highly palatable food suggesting that the behaviour is driven by hedonic, rather than metabolic, signals. Given the links to both reward processing and food intake, this study examined the contribution of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) to bingelike eating in rats. Separate groups were given intermittent (12 h) or continuous (24 h) access to 10% sucrose and food over 28 days, with only the 12 h access group displaying excessive sucrose intake within a discrete period of time (i.e., binge eating). Importantly, this group also exhibited alterations in ECS transcripts and endocannabinoid levels in brain reward regions, including an increase in cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) mRNA in the nucleus accumbens as well as changes in endocannabinoid levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. We then tested whether different doses (1 and 3 mg/kg) of a CB1R antagonist, Rimonabant, modify binge-like intake or the development of a conditioned place preference (CPP) to sucrose. CB1R blockade reduced binge-like intake of sucrose and blocked a sucrose CPP, but only in rats that had undergone 28 days of sucrose consumption. These findings indicate that sucrose bingeing alters the ECS in reward-related areas, modifications that exacerbate the effect of CB1R blockade on sucrose reward. Overall, our results broaden the understanding of neural alterations associated with bingeing eating and demonstrate an important role for CB1R mechanisms in reward processing. In addition, these findings have implications for understanding substance abuse, which is also characterized by excessive and maladaptive intake, pointing towards addictive-like properties of palatable food.

AB  - Epilepsy (EP) is a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal, sudden neuronal discharges. Seizures increase extracellular glutamate levels, causing excitotoxic damage. Glutamate transporter type 1 (GLT-1) and its human homologue excitatory amino acid transporter-2 (EAAT2) clear 95% of extracellular glutamate. Studies on neurodegenerative diseases suggest that trichostatin A (TSA), a broad-spectrum histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, can increase GLT-1/EAAT2 transcription. However, the precise mechanism by which TSA modulates GLT-1/EAAT2 levels remains unclear. This research demonstrated that TSA increases GLT-1/EAAT2 expression through histone acetylation, exerting substantial antiepileptic effects. Our results identify a promising therapeutic strategy for EP involving the modulation of glutamate transporters to mitigate seizures. Future research should explore the specific mechanisms underlying the effects of TSA and its potential clinical applications. Acute and chronic EP models were induced using kainic acid (KA) to assess the effects of TSA on the seizure threshold and frequency. Electrophysiological recordings of the hippocampus were used to evaluate the impact of TSA on neuronal excitability. RNA-Seq was used to analyse changes in glutamate transporter-related gene expression. Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR were used to assess the influence of TSA on HDAC expression. To validate the role of GLT-1/EAAT2 in the antiepileptic effects of TSA, the impact of the GLT-1/EAAT2 inhibitor dihydrokainic acid (DHK) on the effects of TSA was assessed. Glutamate release was measured, and microdialysis was used to determine the glutamate content in the cerebrospinal fluid. Finally, metabolomics analysis was used to explore changes in amino acid levels in the hippocampus following TSA treatment to further confirm the antiepileptic potential of TSA. TSA effectively inhibited seizures in both acute and chronic models. It reduced the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents (PSCs) and the frequency of spontaneous excitatory PSCs in the hippocampus without affecting inhibitory PSCs. Transcriptome analysis was used to identify glutamate transmission-related targets and revealed significant upregulation of the GLT-1 and EAAT2 genes in the hippocampus, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Acetylation-induced upregulation of GLT-1/EAAT2 was observed, and inhibition of these transporters by DHK reduced the seizure-mitigating effects of TSA, underscoring the role of GLT-1/EAAT2 in clearing glutamate and its contribution to the observed antiepileptic effects of TSA. Our findings highlight the crucial role of GLT-1/EAAT2 in mediating the impact of TSA on glutamatergic transmission and seizure activity. These insights pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for EP involving the modulation of glutamate transporters.

AB  - Simple Summary A major problem in the swine meat industry is significant weight loss due to pigs overheating. Our approach to solving this problem is breeding swine based on their ability to survive in high temperatures. We determined in this study that genetically there is a difference between the most successful animal in hot conditions and the most successful animal in cooler conditions. This can be applied to selection of breeding animals for swine companies. Additionally, we found a few genes that may be related to this heat resistance, but more studies need to be completed to validate this finding. The purpose of this study was to perform a genome-wide association study to determine the genomic regions associated with heat stress tolerance in swine. Phenotypic information on carcass weight was available for 227,043 individuals from commercial farms in North Carolina and Missouri, U.S. Individuals were from a commercial cross of a Duroc sire and a dam resulting from a Landrace and Large White cross. Genotypic information was available for 8232 animals with 33,581 SNPs. The pedigree file contained a total of 553,448 animals. A threshold of 78 on the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) was used to signify heat stress. A two-trait analysis was used with the phenotypes heat stress (Trait One) and non-heat stress (Trait Two). Variance components were calculated via AIREML and breeding values were calculated using single step GBLUP (ssGBLUP). The heritability for Traits One and Two were calculated at 0.25 and 0.20, respectively, and the genetic correlation was calculated as 0.63. Validation was calculated for 163 genotyped sires with progeny in the last generation. The benchmark was the GEBV with complete data, and the accuracy was determined as the correlation between the GEBV of the reduced and complete data for the validation sires. Weighted ssGBLUP did not increase the accuracies. Both methods showed a maximum accuracy of 0.32 for Trait One and 0.54 for Trait Two. Manhattan Plots for Trait One, Trait Two, and the difference between the two were created from the results of the two-trait analysis. Windows explaining more than 0.8% of the genetic variance were isolated. Chromosomes 1 and 14 showed peaks in the difference between the two traits. The genetic correlation suggests a different mechanism for Hot Carcass Weight under heat stress. The GWAS results show that both traits are highly polygenic, with only a few genomic regions explaining more than 1% of variance.

AB  - RUNX1T1 (Runt-related transcription factor 1, translocated to 1) plays a wide-ranging and diverse role in cellular development, including hematopoiesis and adipogenesis. However, little is known about the function of RUNX1T1 in the skeletal muscle development. Here, we assessed the impact of RUNX1T1 on the proliferation and myogenic differentiation of goat primary myoblasts (GPMs). It was observed that RUNX1T1 is highly expressed during the early stages of myogenic differentiation and the fetal stage. Moreover, the knockdown of RUNX1T1 promotes the proliferation and inhibits myogenic differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis of GPMs. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that significantly differentially expressed genes in RUNX1T1 knockdown cells were enriched in the calcium signaling pathway. Additionally, we discovered that RUNX1T1 regulates alternative splicing (AS) events involved in myogenesis. We also show that silencing RUNX1T1 blocked the Ca2+-CAMK signaling pathway and reduced the expression levels of muscle-specific isoforms of recombinant rho associated coiled coil containing crotein kinase 2 (ROCK2) during myogenic differentiation, partially explaining why RUNX1T1 deficiency leads to the impairment of myotube formation. These findings suggest that RUNX1T1 is a novel regulator of myogenic differentiation that regulates the calcium signaling pathway and AS of ROCK2. Overall, our results highlight the critical role of RUNX1T1 in myogenesis and broaden our understanding of myogenic differentiation.

AB  - Maternal hyperhomocysteinemia (HCY) is a common pregnancy complication caused by high levels of the homocysteine in maternal and fetal blood, which leads to the alterations of the cognitive functions, including learning and memory. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of these alterations in a rat model of maternal HCY. The behavioral tests confirmed the memory impairments in young and adult rats following the prenatal HCY exposure. Field potential recordings in hippocampal slices demonstrated that the long-term potentiation (LTP) was significantly reduced in HCY rats. The whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in hippocampal slices demonstrated that the magnitude of NMDA receptor-mediated currents did not change while their desensitization decreased in HCY rats. No significant alterations of glutamate receptor subunit expression except GluN1 were detected in the hippocampus of HCY rats using the quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot methods. The immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the number of synaptopodin-positive spines is reduced, while the analysis of the ultrastructure of hippocampus using the electron microscopy revealed the indications of delayed hippocampal maturation in young HCY rats. Thus, the obtained results suggest that maternal HCY disturbs the maturation of hippocampus during the first month of life, which disrupts LTP formation and causes memory impairments.

AB  - The Arabian Camelus dromedarius contains significant concentration of eye lens zeta-crystallin. This enzyme is also present in other life forms including humans, however in lower catalytic amounts. The recombinant camel zeta-crystallin was expressed in the E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS strain and purified using HisTrap column. The K-m of the enzyme for 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (9,10-PQ) substrate and NADPH cofactor was determined to be 11.66 and 50.93 mu M, respectively. The V-max for 9,10-PQ and NADPH was obtained as 23.19 and 19.98 mu M min(-1), respectively. The optimum activity of the purified enzyme was found to be at pH 6.0 and at 55 degrees C. Different physico-chemical parameters were analysed including instability index (II), aliphatic index (AI) and the GRAVY index to establish proper characterization. The sequence of the recombinant zeta-crystallin was subjected to homology modelling using SWISS-MODEL webserver followed by validation of the modelled target structure. The evaluation of the modelled zeta-crystallin was performed by several parameters including Ramachandran plot, Z-score values followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The cumulative analysis of the physico-chemical, quantitative, qualitative and the essential dynamics of simulation of zeta-crystallin and its complexes with 9,10-PQ and NADPH helped in verifying the acceptable quality and stability of the zeta-crystallin structure.

AB  - As the average human lifespan lengthens, the impact of neurodegenerative disease increases, both on the individual suffering neurodegeneration and on the community that supports those individuals. Studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms of neurodegeneration have relied heavily on observational studies of humans and experimental studies in animals, such as mice, in which aspects of brain structure and function can be manipulated to target mechanistic steps. An animal model whose brain is structurally closer to the human brain, that lives much longer than rodents, and whose husbandry is practical may be valuable for mechanistic studies that cannot readily be conducted in rodents. To demonstrate that the long-lived Seba's short-tailed fruit bat, Carollia perspicillata, may fit this role, we used immunohistochemical labeling for NeuN and three calcium-binding proteins, calretinin, parvalbumin, and calbindin, to define hippocampal formation anatomy. Our findings demonstrate patterns of principal neuron organization that resemble primate and human hippocampal formation and patterns of calcium-binding protein distribution that help to define subregional boundaries. Importantly, we present evidence for a clear prosubiculum in the bat brain that resembles primate prosubiculum. Based on the similarities between bat and human hippocampal formation anatomy, we suggest that Carollia has unique advantages for the study of brain aging and neurodegeneration. A captive colony of Carollia allows age tracking, diet and environment control, pharmacological manipulation, and access to behavioral, physiological, anatomical, and molecular evaluation.

AB  - Breast cancer is the leading cause of death among women worldwide. Despite the recent treatment options like surgery, chemotherapy etc. the lethality of breast cancer is alarming. Natural compounds are considered a better treatment option against breast carcinoma because of their lower side effects and specificity in targeting important proteins involved in the aberrant activation of pathways in breast cancer. A recently discovered compound called Juglanthraquinone C, which is found in the bark of the Juglans mandshurica Maxim (Juglandaceae) tree has shown promising cytotoxicity in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, not much data is available on the molecular mechanisms followed by this compound. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism followed by Juglanthraquinone C against breast cancer. We used the network pharmacology technique to analyse the mechanism of action of Juglanthraquinone C in breast cancer and validated our study by applying various computational tools such as UALCAN, cBioportal, TIMER, docking and simulation. The results showed the compound and breast cancer target network shared 31 common targets. Moreover, we observed that Juglanthraquinone C targets multiple deregulated genes in breast cancer such as TP53, TGIF1, IGF1R, SMAD3, JUN, CDC42, HBEGF, FOS and signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt pathway, TGF-b signaling pathway, MAPK pathway and HIPPO signaling pathway. A docking examination revealed that the investigated drug had a high affinity for the primary target TGIF1 protein. A stable protein-ligand combination was generated by the best hit molecule, according to molecular dynamics modeling. The main aim of this study was to examine Juglanthraquinone C's significance as a prospective breast cancer treatment and to better understand the molecular mechanism this substance uses in breast cancer since there is a need to discover new therapeutics to decrease the load on current therapeutics which also are currently ineffective due to several side effects and development of drug resistance.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - This study found that resveratrol pretreatment attenuated porcine intestinal epithelial cell damage caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88 in vitro and the protective effects of resveratrol were associated with SIRT-1 signaling. ETEC K88 is a main intestinal pathogen for post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) in piglets. With the strict ban on antibiotics in animal feed, people are seeking effective antibiotic substitutes to protect the intestinal system against harmful pathogenic bacteria. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of resveratrol, a natural plant polyphenol, on ETEC K88-induced cellular damage in porcine enterocytes and underlying mechanisms. Intestinal porcine epithelial cell line 1 (IPEC-1) cells, pretreated with or without resveratrol (30 mu M, 4 h), were challenged with ETEC K88 (MOI = 1 : 10) for 3 h. The results showed that ETEC K88 infection induced severe damage and dysfunction in IPEC-1 cells, as evidenced by a reduced cell viability, decreased tight junctions, mitochondrial dysfunction, and autophagy. It is noteworthy that IPEC-1 cells pre-treated with resveratrol improved their capacity for resistance to most of these abnormal phenotypes caused by ETEC K88 infection. Furthermore, we found that the activation of SIRT-1 signaling was associated with the benefits of resveratrol, as demonstrated by EX-527, an inhibitor of SIRT-1, which reversed most of the protective effects of resveratrol. In conclusion, these results indicated that resveratrol could protect intestinal epithelial cells against ETEC K88 infection by activating SIRT-1 signaling. These findings provide new insights into the role of resveratrol in maintaining intestinal physiological functions.

AB  - Recent mechanistic and structural studies have challenged the classical tauopathy classification approach and revealed the complexity and heterogeneity of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and primary tauopathies such as corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), progressing beyond distinct tau isoforms. In this multi-tau tracer study, we focused on the new second-generation tau PET tracers PI2620, MK6240 and RO948 to investigate this tau complexity in AD, CBD, and PSP brains using post-mortem radioligand binding studies and autoradiography of large and small frozen brain sections. Saturation binding studies indicated multiple binding sites for H-3-PI2620 in AD, CBD and PSP brains with different binding affinities (K-d ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 nM) and binding site densities (following the order: B(max)AD > BmaxCBD > BmaxPSP). Competitive binding studies complemented these findings, demonstrating the presence of two binding sites [super-high affinity (SHA): IC50(1) = 8.1 pM; and high affinity (HA): IC50(2) = 4.9 nM] in AD brains. Regional binding distribution studies showed that H-3-PI2620 could discriminate between AD (n = 6) and control cases (n = 9), especially in frontal cortex and temporal cortex tissue (p < 0.001) as well as in the hippocampal region (p = 0.02). H-3-PI2620, H-3-MK6240 and H-3-RO948 displayed similar binding behaviour in AD brains (in both homogenate competitive studies and one large frozen hemispherical brain section autoradiography studies) in terms of binding affinities, number of sites and regional patterns. Our small section autoradiography studies in the frontal cortex of CBD (n = 3) and PSP brains (n = 2) showed high specificity for H-3-PI2620 but not for H-3-MK6240 or H-3-RO948. Our findings clearly demonstrate different binding properties among the second-generation tau PET tracers, which may assist in further understanding of tau heterogeneity in AD versus non-AD tauopathies and suggests potential for development of pure selective 4R tau PET tracers.

AB  - Specialized metabolites not only play important roles in biotic and abiotic stress adaptation of tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) but also contribute to the unique flavor of tea, the most important nonalcoholic beverage. However, the molecular networks and major genes that regulate specialized metabolites in tea plants are not well understood. Here, we constructed a population-level pan-transcriptome of the tea plant leaf using second-leaf transcriptome data from 134 accessions to investigate global expression differences in the population, expression presence or absence variations (ePAVs), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pure Camellia sinensis var. assamica (CSA) and pure Camellia sinensis var. sinensis (CSS) accessions. Next, we used a genome-wide association study, a quantitative trait transcript study, and a transcriptome-wide association study to integrate genotypes, accumulation levels of specialized metabolites, and expression levels of pan-transcriptome genes to identify candidate regulatory genes for flavor-related metabolites and to construct a regulatory network for specialized metabolites in tea plants. The pan-transcriptome contains 30 482 expressed genes, 4940 and 5506 of which were newly annotated from a de novo transcriptome assembly without a reference and a genome reference-based assembly, respectively. DEGs and ePAVs indicated that CSA and CSS were clearly differentiated at the population transcriptome level, and they were closely related to abiotic tolerance and secondary metabolite synthesis phenotypes of CSA and CSS based on gene annotations. The regulatory network contained 212 specialized metabolites, 3843 candidate genes, and 3407 eQTLs, highlighting many pleiotropic candidate genes, candidate gene-rich eQTLs, and potential regulators of specialized metabolites. These included important transcription factors in the AP2/ERF-ERF, MYB, WD40, and bHLH families. CsTGY14G0001296, an ortholog of AtANS, appeared to be directly related to variation in proanthocyanins in the tea plant population, and the CsTGY11G0002074 gene encoding F3'5'H was found to contribute to the biased distribution of catechins between pure CSAs and pure CSSs. Together, these results provide a new understanding of the metabolite diversity in tea plants and offer new insights for more effective breeding of better-flavored tea varieties.

AB  - Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) significantly elevates the risk of cognitive impairment. Didang Decoction (DDD), a classical Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula, has shown promise in alleviating diabetic symptoms and improving cognitive performance. Although historical TCM records suggest neuroprotective properties, the mechanistic basis for DDD's therapeutic effects on T2DM-associated cognitive dysfunction (TDACD) remains unexplored. Purpose: This work sought to clarify the chemical composition and mechanisms of action of DDD by pursuing three primary objectives: (1) identification of the major active constituents of DDD; (2) validating of the hypothesis that DDD ameliorates TDACD via regulation of the gut microbiota; and (3) investigating DDD's regulatory effects on hippocampal lipid metabolism and autophagy pathways. Methods: Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-Q exactive mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QE-MS/MS) was employed to analyze the chemical composition of DDD. Cognitive function was assessed through behavioral tests. Histopathological examinations and western blotting (WB) were conducted to assess the effects of DDD on the hippocampus of TDACD rats. 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing was conducted to characterize gut microbiota, composition, and proteomics was used to evaluate hippocampal proteins expression. Results: The major bioactive components of DDD were identified, including dihydrotanshinone I, aloe-emodin, chrysophanol, calycosin, sakuranetin, gallic acid, kaempferol, and rhein, emodin, etc. DDD increased neuronal density and synaptic function in the hippocampus of TDACD rats, hereby improving working memory and longterm memory. DDD boosted the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria, including Roseburia, [Eubacterium] coprostanoligenes group, Christensenellaceae R-7 group, and Alistipes, which were diminished in the TDACD group. Proteomics analysis indicated that DDD enhanced hippocampal energy metabolism and reduced neuronal damage in TDACD rats via pathways related to cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, as well as autophagy.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) accumulation and biomagnification in the barn owl (Tyto alba) food chain were investigated using bioindicator samples from three trophic levels: (1) soil and moss (atmospheric deposition indicators), (2) small mammal fur from regurgitated pellets (herbivores and omnivores), and (3) barn owl down feathers (apex predators). Spatial analysis identified regional Hg variation in soil, fur and feathers. Statistical models explored the effects of proximity to water bodies, wetlands and nearby pollution sources. The highest total Hg (THg) concentrations were found in feathers (170 +/- 160 mu g kg(-1), n = 246) and fur in regurgitated pellets (150 +/- 200 mu g kg(-1), n = 150), followed by soil (63 +/- 17 mu g kg(-1), n = 63). Bioaccumulation factors were 2.3 (soil to fur) and 2.7 (soil to feather). Biomagnification factor from fur to feathers was 1.8. Methyl Hg (MeHg), measured in a subset of samples, was 120 +/- 130 mu g kg(-1) in fur (n = 29) and 150 +/- 98 mu g kg(-1) in feathers (n = 42), with 75-97 % of THg in feathers as MeHg. Prey composition significantly influenced fur THg levels, with higher concentrations in diets with omnivorous prey (Apodemus flavicollis) compared to herbivorous prey (Microtus arvalis). These findings highlight the importance of diet in Hg monitoring and biomagnification studies.

AB  - Problem To manage population of dogs (Canis familiaris), the efficacy of recombinant proteins-based contraceptive vaccines to inhibit fertility has been evaluated in female beagle dogs. Method of study Female beagle dogs (n = 4) were immunized with physical mixture of Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant porcine ZP3 with promiscuous T cell epitope of tetanus toxoid (TT-KK-pZP3) and porcine ZP4 with promiscuous T cell epitope of bovine RNase (bRNase-KK-pZP4), or with a fusion protein encompassing dog ZP3 fragment and two copies of GnRH with appropriate promiscuous T cell epitopes (dZP3-GnRH(2)); control animals received only alum, the adjuvant. The immunized animals were followed-up for antibody titres by ELISA as well as for fertility status subsequent to mating with male dogs. Results Active immunization of female dogs following a three injections schedule at 4-week intervals with a physical mixture of TT-KK-pZP3 + bRNase-KK-pZP4 as well as dZP3-GnRH(2), led to generation of significant antibody titres against respective recombinant proteins. Active immunization with dZP3-GnRH(2) also led to generation of antibodies reactive with both dZP3 and GnRH. A booster dose on day 383 led to an increase in antibody titres and circulating antibodies against respective recombinant proteins could be observed on day 528. Antibodies in immune serum samples from dogs immunized with TT-KK-pZP3 + bRNase-KK-pZP4 or dZP3-GnRH(2) reacted with native canine ZP as assessed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Mating studies revealed a reduced number of pregnancies as well as a significant reduction in the number of pups born in the female dogs immunized with dZP3-GnRH(2) as compared to the adjuvanted control. Curtailment of pregnancy in dZP3-GnRH(2) immunized group was associated with antibody titres against dZP3-GnRH(2). However, immunization with recombinant TT-KK-pZP3 + bRNase-KK-pZP4 did not significantly decrease the number of pups born as compared to the adjuvanted control. Conclusion These studies revealed the potential of recombinant dZP3-GnRH(2)-based contraceptive vaccine to curtail fertility in female dogs. Large scale studies to establish the efficacy and safety of this recombinant protein for the management of community dog population are thus warranted.

AB  - The camel has played a role in human civilization since its inception and holds significant importance in the customs and agricultural practices of various nations. This study examined the prevalence of internal parasitic infestations in camels within the Al-Diwaniyah and Al-Najaf provinces of Iraq from December 2021 to September 2022. A total of 200 fecal samples were randomly collected from farm camels, revealing that these animals were affected by one or more types of intestinal parasites. Nematodes exhibited the highest prevalence at 56 %, followed by Protozoa at 28.5 %, Cestodes at 14.5 %, and Trematodes at 1 %. Among these parasites, Trichostrongylus spp. had the highest percentage at 33 %, followed by Moneizia benedeni (12.5 %), Fasciola hepatica (10.5 %), Strongyloides spp. (8 %), Giardia spp. (7 %), Nematodirus spp. (6 %), and Eimeria spp. (6 %). Furthermore, mixed-species or single-species infections in camels were observed, including Anoplcephala perfoliata (4 %), Haemonchus spp. (3.5 %), Dictyocaulus spp. (3 %), Trichuris trichura (2.5 %), Entamoeba spp. (2 %), and Balantidium coli (1 %). Additionally, nested PCR was employed to identify Trichostrongylus spp., with 45.4 % of camels testing positive for this particular parasite.

AB  - We previously demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection-induced immune stress could impair muscle growth in weaned piglets, but the precise mechanisms behind this remain elusive. Here, we found that chronic immune stress induced by LPS resulted in a significant reduction of 36.86% in the total muscle mass of piglets at 5 d post-treatment compared with the control group. At 1 d, prior to muscle mass loss, multiple alterations were noted in response to LPS treatment. These included a reduction in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, an increase in serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, compromised mitochondrial morphology, and an upregulation in the expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a critical protein involved in mitochondrial fission. We highlight a strong negative correlation between Bacteroidetes abundance and the levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, corroborated by in vivo intervention strategies in the musculature of both pig and mouse models. Mechanistically, the effects of Bacteroidetes on inflammation and muscle mass loss may involve the signaling pathway of the tauro-beta-muricholic acid-fibroblast growth factor 15. Furthermore, the induction of overexpression of inflammatory cytokines, achieved without LPS treatment through oral administration of recombinant human IL-6 (rhIL-6), led to increased levels of circulating cytokines, subsequently causing a decrease in muscle mass. Notably, pre-treatment with Mdivi-1, an inhibitor of Drp-1, markedly attenuated the LPS-induced elevation in reactive oxygen species levels and rescued the associated decline in muscle mass. Collectively, these data indicate that LPS-induced muscle mass loss was linked to the reduction of Bacteroidetes abundance, increased inflammation, and the disruption of mitochondrial morphology. These insights offer promising avenues for the identification of potential therapeutic targets aimed at mitigating muscle mass loss.

AB  - MADS-box genes encode transcription factors that affect plant growth and development. Camellia chekiangoleosa is an oil tree species with ornamental value, but there have been few molecular biological studies on the developmental regulation of this species. To explore their possible role in C. chekiangoleosa and lay a foundation for subsequent research, 89 MADS-box genes were identified across the whole genome of C. chekiangoleosa for the first time. These genes were present on all the chromosomes and were found to have expanded by tandem duplication and fragment duplication. Based on the results of a phylogenetic analysis, the 89 MADS-box genes could be divided into either type I (38) or type II (51). Both the number and proportion of the type II genes were significantly greater than those of Camellia sinensis and Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating that C. chekiangoleosa type II genes experienced a higher duplication rate or a lower loss rate. The results of both a sequence alignment and a conserved motif analysis suggest that the type II genes are more conserved, meaning that they may have originated and differentiated earlier than the type I genes did. At the same time, the presence of extra-long amino acid sequences may be an important feature of C. chekiangoleosa. Gene structure analysis revealed the number of introns of MADS-box genes: twenty-one type I genes had no introns, and 13 type I genes contained only 1 similar to 2 introns. The type II genes have far more introns and longer introns than the type I genes do. Some MIKCC genes have super large introns (>= 15 kb), which are rare in other species. The super large introns of these MIKCC genes may indicate richer gene expression. Moreover, the results of a qPCR expression analysis of the roots, flowers, leaves and seeds of C. chekiangoleosa showed that the MADS-box genes were expressed in all those tissues. Overall, compared with that of the type I genes, the expression of the type II genes was significantly higher. The CchMADS31 and CchMADS58 genes (type II) were highly expressed specifically in the flowers, which may in turn regulate the size of the flower meristem and petals. CchMADS55 was expressed specifically in the seeds, which might affect seed development. This study provides additional information for the functional characterization of the MADS-box gene family and lays an important foundation for in-depth study of related genes, such as those involved in the development of the reproductive organs of C. chekiangoleosa.

AB  - Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a major food and feed pollutant that endangers public health. Previous studies have shown that exposure to AFB1 causes neurotoxicity in the body. However, the mechanism of neurotoxicity caused by AFB1 is not well understood, and finding a workable and practical method to safeguard animals from AFB1 toxicity is essential. This study confirmed that AFB1 caused endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and apoptosis in hippocampal neurons using C57BL/6 J mice and HT22 cells as models. In vitro experiments showed that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) plays a significant role in the cytotoxicity of AFB1. Finally, we assessed how hesperetin protecting against the neurotoxicity caused by AFB1. Our findings demonstrated that AFB1 increased the levels of BAX and Cleaved-Caspase3 proteins, while decreasing the levels of BCL2 protein in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. The AFB1 increased the expression of AHR and activated nuclear translocation. It also elevated the expression levels of Chop, GRP78, p-IRE1/ Xbp1s, and p-PERK/p-EIF2a. Importantly, we also discovered for the first time that blocking AHR in HT22 cells dramatically reduced the level of ER stress and apoptosis caused by AFB1. In vivo and in vitro studies, supplementation of hesperetin effectively reversed AFB1-induced cytotoxicity. We have demonstrated that hesperetin effectively restored the imbalance in the GSH/GST system in HT22 cells treated with AFB1. Furthermore, we observed that elevated GSH levels facilitated the formation of AFB1-GSH complexes, which enhanced the excretion of AFB1. Therefore, hesperetin improves ER stress-induced apoptosis by reducing AFB1 activation of AHR.

AB  - Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common complication of antineoplastic drugs, particularly paclitaxel (PTX). It can affect the quality of patients' lives and increase the risk of developing mood disorders. Although several drugs are recommended, they yielded inconclusive results in clinical trials. The aim of the present work is to investigate whether the palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) would reduce PTX-induced CIPN and associated mood disorders. Moreover, the role PPAR-alpha and the endocannabinoid system will also be investigated. CIPN was induced by intraperitoneally injection of PTX (8 mg/kg) every other day for a week. PEA, 30 mg/kg, was orally administrated in a bioavailable form (i.e., ultramicronized PEA, um-PEA) one hour after the last PTX injection, for 7 days. In the antagonism experiments, AM281 (1 mg/kg) and GW6471 (2 mg/kg) were administrated 30 min before um-PEA. Our results demonstrated that um-PEA reduced the development of hypersensitivity with the effect being associated with the reduction in spinal and hippocampal pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as antidepressive and anxiolytic effects. Moreover, the PPAR-alpha and CB1 receptor antagonists blocked the behavioral and antinociceptive effects of um-PEA. Our findings suggest that um-PEA is a promising adjunct in CIPN and associated mood disorders through the activation of PPAR-alpha, which influences the endocannabinoid system.

AB  - Memories encoded in the dentate gyrus (DG) - CA3 circuit of the hippocampus are routed from CA1 to anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for consolidation. Although CA1 parvalbumin inhibitory neurons (PV INs) orchestrate hippocampal-cortical communication, we know less about CA3 PV INs or DG - CA3 principal neuron - IN circuit mechanisms that contribute to evolution of hippocampal-cortical ensembles during memory consolidation. Using viral genetics to selectively mimic and boost an endogenous learning-dependent circuit mechanism, DG cell recruitment of CA3 PV INs and feed-forward inhibition (FFI) in CA3, in combination with longitudinal in vivo calcium imaging, we demonstrate that FFI facilitates formation and maintenance of context-associated neuronal ensembles in CA1. Increasing FFI in DG - CA3 promoted context specificity of neuronal ensembles in ACC over time and enhanced long-term contextual fear memory. In vivo LFP recordings in mice with increased FFI in DG - CA3 identified enhanced CA1 sharp-wave ripple - ACC spindle coupling as a potential network mechanism facilitating memory consolidation. Our findings illuminate how FFI in DG - CA3 dictates evolution of ensemble properties in CA1 and ACC during memory consolidation and suggest a teacher-like function for hippocampal CA1 in stabilization and re-organization of cortical representations.

AB  - We learn from our experience but the underlying neuronal mechanisms incorporating past information to facilitate learning is relatively unknown. Specifically, which cortical areas encode history-related information and how is this information modulated across learning? To study the relationship between history and learning, we continuously imaged cortex-wide calcium dynamics as mice learn to use their whiskers to discriminate between two different textures. We mainly focused on comparing the same trial type with different trial history, that is, a different preceding trial. We found trial history information in barrel cortex (BC) during stimulus presentation. Importantly, trial history in BC emerged only as the mouse learned the task. Next, we also found learning-dependent trial history information in rostrolateral (RL) association cortex that emerges before stimulus presentation, preceding activity in BC. Trial history was also encoded in other cortical areas and was not related to differences in body movements. Interestingly, a binary classifier could discriminate trial history at the single trial level just as well as current information both in BC and RL. These findings suggest that past experience emerges in the cortex around the time of learning, starting from higher-order association area RL and propagating down (i.e., top-down projection) to lower-order BC where it can be integrated with incoming sensory information. This integration between the past and present may facilitate learning.

AB  - Objective The individual cascades of the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway and the molecular mechanism of aging have not been fully clarified. In the current study, we explored the effect of DNA polymerase delta 1 (POLD1) on the IGF-1 signaling pathway in cell aging.Methods First, we analyzed the relationship between IGF-1 and POLD1 expression in aging. To investigate the effect of IGF-1 on POLD1 expression and aging, the 2BS cells were incubated with youngage or old-age human serum, IGF-1 protein, or linsitinib. Next, the effect of IGF-1 on aging was examined in the 2BS cells with increased or decreased POLD1 expression to clarify the molecular mechanism.Results In this study, we found that IGF-1 expression increased and POLD1 expression decreased with aging in human serum and hippocampal tissues of SAMP8 mice, and a negative relationship between IGF-1 and POLD1 expression was observed. Furthermore, the cells cultured with old-age human serum or IGF-1 showed lower POLD1 expression and more pronounced senescence characteristics, and the effect could be reversed by treatment with linsitinib or overexpression of POLD1, while the effect of linsitinib on cell aging could be reversed with the knockdown of POLD1.Conclusion Taken collectively, our findings demonstrate that IGF-1 promotes aging by binding to IGF1R and inhibiting the expression of POLD1. These findings offer a new target for anti-aging strategies.

AB  - Background: Cadmium is widely reported to interfere with the proper functioning of cells by disrupting cellular redox balance, causing apoptosis, and leading to hepatocellular damage, neurotoxicity, pulmonary edema, cancer, and cardiac and neurodegenerative diseases. Treatment of Cd toxicity with drugs brings undesirable side effects, making it necessary to remove Cd from the body safely without harmful effects. Objective: This study aimed to determine how Cd causing malfunctioning of cells could be treated with antioxidant-rich avocado and papaya fruit juices. This work fixated on elucidating and comparing the effects of avocado and papaya fruit juice on Cd-dependent impairment in memory and spatial learning. In addition, various markers of tissue damage, such as the concentration of biomarkers in liver and kidney tissue, the expression of antioxidant enzymes and Cd-induced lipid peroxidation, were analyzed. Methodology: in silico studies of the phytochemical constituents of avocado and papaya (ligands) were docked against antioxidant enzymes Catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) as macromolecules showed strong hydrogen binding with significant binding capacities. To develop the Cd in vivo model, rats were administered CdCl2 (200 ppm) in drinking water for 7 weeks. After induction of Cd toxicity, rats were post-treated with avocado and papaya (10% w/v each) in a standard diet. After post-treatment, memory and learning were assessed using the Morris water maze behavioural test. Biochemical tests for liver and kidney biomarkers were monitored. To determine the level of ROS, lipid peroxidation was determined by Malondialdehyde (MDA) assay. Gene expression of SOD, CAT and GPx were determined via qRT-PCR. Results: This study demonstrated that Cd accumulation in the liver, kidney and hippocampal tissues was reduced after treatment with avocado and papaya. SOD, CAT and GPX gene expression were upregulated after avocado and papaya juice treatment. Moreover, a comparative analysis between avocado and papaya fruit juices clarified that papaya has more active potential for improving memory and learning, upregulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes, and reducing lipid peroxidation in the liver, kidney, and hippocampus. Conclusion: This study suggests that a diet containing papaya and avocado can help treat the lethal effects caused by Cd. Because their active constituents can improve health at the cellular and molecular levels.

AB  - Mutants with simultaneous germline mutations were obtained in all three F5H genes and all three FAD2 genes (one to eleven mutated alleles) in order to improve the feed value of the seed meal and the fatty acid composition of the seed oil. In mutants with multiple mutated F5H alleles, sinapine in seed meal was reduced by up to 100%, accompanied by a sharp reduction in the S-monolignol content of lignin without causing lodging or stem break. A lower S-lignin monomer content in stems can contribute to improved stem degradability allowing new uses of stems. Mutants in all six FAD2 alleles showed an expected increase in MUFA from 8.7% to 74% and a reduction in PUFA from 53% to 13% in the fatty acids in seed oil. Remarkably, some full FAD2 mutants showed normal growth and seed production and not the dwarfing phenotype reported in previous studies. The relation between germline mutation allele dosage and phenotype was influenced by the still ongoing activity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, leading to new somatic mutations in the leaves of flowering plants. The correlations between the total mutation frequency (germline plus new somatic mutations) for F5H with sinapine content, and FAD2 with fatty acid composition were higher than the correlations between germline mutation count and phenotypes. This shows the importance of quantifying both the germline mutations and somatic mutations when studying CRISPR/Cas9 effects in situations where the CRISPR/Cas9 system is not yet segregated out.

AB  - A radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) is a major adverse event following radiotherapy of malignant tumors. RIBI would affect cognitive function, leading to a series of complications and even death. However, the pathogenesis of RIBI is still unclear, and it still lacks specific therapeutic drugs. The gut-brain bidirectional communication may be mediated by various microbiota and metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics are closely related to physiological health. The theory of the gut-brain axis provides us with a new idea to improve the gut microenvironment by supplementing probiotics against RIBI. Here, Lactobacillus reuteri microcapsules (LMCs) were prepared, which were predominantly irregular spheres with a rough surface under a scanning electron microscope and a narrow size distribution ranging from 20 to 700 mu m. The transmission electron microscopy images showed that the structure of microcapsules containing Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) was a core and shell structure. The survival of L. reuteri in microcapsules was significantly more than that of free L. reuteri in the simulated stomach environment of pH 1.2. 16S rDNA sequencing showed that LMCs observably increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in RIBI mice. More importantly, compared with the RIBI model mice, the behavior of RIBI mice treated with LMCs was significantly improved. In addition, LMCs greatly alleviated the pathological damage of the hippocampus and intestines in the mice after irradiation and reduced the level of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in vivo. Generally, LMCs are a promising oral preparation, which provide new ideas and methods for the treatment of RIBI.

AB  - In this study, Fe based amorphous/nanocrystalline composite coatings with different coating thicknesses were deposited on a mild steel substrate by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) using a low Cr-containing gas atomised amorphous Fe73Cr2Si11B11C3 (at%) powder. The corrosion behaviour of the amorphous/nanocrystalline coatings of different thickness was investigated using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis in a freely aerated 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. The variation in microstructural characteristics of the coatings with various coating thicknesses and the effect of the surface morphology, porosity content, surface roughness and amorphous content in the coatings have been correlated with the corrosion behaviour of the coatings. The results demonstrate that the corrosion resistance of the plasma sprayed Fe based composite coatings is better than that of the steel substrate regardless of coating thickness. Moreover, the best corrosion resistance of the coating with a thickness level of 110 +/- 12 mu m is attributed to (i) its optimum presence of content of amorphous, porosity, and surface roughness, (ii) excellent film and charge transfer resistance, and (iii) higher protection ability of the rust as compared to the other coating thickness values.

AB  - Accurate runoff prediction in data-poor catchments is important for water resource management, flood mitigation, environmental protection, and other tasks. One possible solution is to transfer a runoff prediction model constructed by using a machine learning model for gauged catchments to data-poor catchments. However, the transfer of runoff prediction model must consider the comprehensive spatiotemporal similarities between the catchments; otherwise, the transfer performance can be massively uncertain. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of runoff prediction and eliminate the uncertainty in identifying the differences between catchment environments, this paper proposes a novel measurement approach of comprehensive spatiotemporal similarity. This approach measures the similarities among catchments by fully considering which of the various catchments' spatiotemporal attributes can better represent the geographical similarity. Then, according to the similarities between the catchments, a runoff prediction model trained in gauged catchments is transformed for the most similar data-poor catchments to predict the runoff and the transfer performance is analyzed. To this end, a runoff prediction model is built using a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network based on the CAMELS catchments data set. A framework to extract the comprehensive spatiotemporal features of catchments is designed using three autoencoders. The catchments' similarities can be measured, further, and their spatiotemporal attributes determined once a measurement model of comprehensive spatiotemporal similarity is constructed. Finally, the transfer performance of the GRU runoff prediction model based on comprehensive spatiotemporal and other geographical similarities is evaluated and analyzed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms comparable approaches.

AB  - A computational method is proposed to generate the full-scale dataset of the tridimensional position and connectivity of neurons in the CA1 region of the human hippocampus starting from high-resolution microscopy images and experimental data.
   The increasing availability of quantitative data on the human brain is opening new avenues to study neural function and dysfunction, thus bringing us closer and closer to the implementation of digital twin applications for personalized medicine. Here we provide a resource to the neuroscience community: a computational method to generate full-scale scaffold model of human brain regions starting from microscopy images. We have benchmarked the method to reconstruct the CA1 region of a right human hippocampus, which accounts for about half of the entire right hippocampal formation. Together with 3D soma positioning we provide a connectivity matrix generated using a morpho-anatomical connection strategy based on axonal and dendritic probability density functions accounting for morphological properties of hippocampal neurons. The data and algorithms are supplied in a ready-to-use format, suited to implement computational models at different scales and detail.

AB  - Iron deficiency (ID) during neurodevelopment is associated with lasting cognitive and socioemotional deficits and increased risk for neuropsychiatric disease throughout the lifespan. These neurophenotypical changes are underlain by gene dysregulation in the brain that outlasts the period of ID; however, the mechanisms by which ID establishes and maintains gene expression changes are incompletely understood. The epigenetic modification of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), or DNA hydroxymethylation, is one candidate mechanism because of its dependence on iron-containing TET enzymes. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of fetal-neonatal ID on regional brain TET activity, Tet expression, and 5hmC in the developing rat hippocampus and cerebellum and to determine whether changes are reversible with dietary iron treatment. Timed pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were fed iron-deficient diet (ID; 4 mg/kg Fe) from gestational day 2 to generate iron-deficient anemic (IDA) offspring. Control dams were fed iron-sufficient diet (IS; 200 mg/kg Fe). At postnatal day (P)7, a subset of ID-fed litters was randomized to IS diet, generating treated IDA (TIDA) offspring. At P15, the hippocampus and cerebellum were isolated for subsequent analysis. TET activity was quantified by ELISA from nuclear proteins. Expression of Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3 was quantified by qPCR from total RNA. Global %5hmC was quantified by ELISA from genomic DNA. ID increased DNA hydroxymethylation (p = 0.0105), with a corresponding increase in TET activity (p < 0.0001) and Tet3 expression (p < 0.0001) in the P15 hippocampus. In contrast, ID reduced TET activity (p = 0.0016) in the P15 cerebellum, with minimal effect on DNA hydroxymethylation. Neonatal dietary iron treatment resulted in partial normalization of these changes in both brain regions. These results demonstrate that the TET/DNA hydroxymethylation system is disrupted by developmental ID in a brain region-specific manner. Differential regional disruption of this epigenetic system may contribute to the lasting neural circuit dysfunction and neurobehavioral dysfunction associated with developmental ID.

AB  - These studies aimed to determine if shearing ewes at the second or last third of gestation modify the uterine and placentome blood flow, placentome size, and maternal progesterone concentration. Pregnant ewes were assigned to four groups of 12 ewes each according to the gestation period: mid-pregnancy sheared (on day 90 of pregnancy) or unshorn group; and late-pregnancy sheared group (on day 121 of pregnancy) or unshorn group. In both experimental periods, using spectral Doppler ultrasonography, placentomes and uterine artery blood flow and placentome size were evaluated 14 days before and 6 days after shearing. An additional measurement was performed 26 days after shearing in mid-pregnant ewes. Serum progesterone concentration was measured before shearing 4, 24, 72 h, and 22 days after shearing. The uterine artery's end-diastolic velocity (EDV) tended to be greater in the sheared than in the non-sheared ewes (p = 0.1). Peak systolic velocity (PSV) and EDV of placentome increased (p = 0.05 and p = 0.008, respectively) on day 26, accompanied by an increase in placentome area (p = 0.035) in mid-pregnant ewes. In late-pregnant ewes, uterine artery and placentome blood flow and size did not vary. Progesterone concentration varied with time but was not affected by shearing. In conclusion, shearing triggered an increase in placentome size and some changes in blood flow only when ewes were sheared during the second third of their pregnancy. Shearing ewes either the second or last third of gestation did not affect uterine artery blood flow and progesterone secretion.

AB  - BackgroundTandem repeats in mitochondrial DNA control region are known to different animal taxa, including bat species of the family Vespertilionidae. The long R1-repeats in the bat ETAS-domain are often presented in a variable copy number and may exhibit both inter-individual and intra-individual sequence diversity. The function of repeats in the control region is still unclear, but it has been shown that repetitive sequences in some animal groups (shrews, cats and sheep) may include parts of ETAS1 and ETAS2 conservative blocks of mitochondrial DNA.Methods and resultsAnalysis of the control region sequences for 31 Myotis petax specimens allowed the identification of the inter-individual variability and clarification of the composition of the R1-repeats. The copy number of the R1-repeats varies from 4 to 7 in individuals. The specimens examined do not exhibit a size heteroplasmy previously described for Myotis species. The unusual short 30 bp R1-repeats have been detected in M. petax for the first time. The ten specimens from Amur Region and Primorsky Territory have one or two copies of these additional repeats.ConclusionsIt was determined that the R1-repeats in M. petax control region consist of parts of the ETAS1 and ETAS2 blocks. The origin of the additional repeats seems to be related to the 51 bp deletion in the central part of the R1-repeat unit and subsequent duplication. Comparison of repetitive sequences in the control region of closely-related Myotis species identified the occurrence of incomplete repeats also resulting from the short deletions, but distinct from additional repeats of M. petax.

AB  - Glutamate is involved in fundamental functions, including neuronal plasticity and memory. Astrocytes are integral elements involved in synaptic function, and the GLT-1 transporter possesses a critical role in glutamate uptake. Here, we study the role of GLT-1, specifically located in astrocytes, in the consolidation, expression, reconsolidation and persistence of spatial object recognition memory in rats. Administration of dihydrokainic acid (DHK), a selective GLT-1 inhibitor, into the dorsal hippocampus around a weak training which only induces short-term memory, promotes long-term memory formation. This promotion is prevented by hippocampal administration of protein-synthesis translation inhibitor, blockade of Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) translation or Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) action, which are plasticity related proteins necessary for memory consolidation. However, DHK around a strong training, which induces long-term memory, does not affect memory consolidation. Administration of DHK before the test session impairs the expression of long-term memory, and this effect is dependent of Arc translation. Furthermore, DHK impairs reconsolidation if applied before a reactivation session, and this effect is independent of Arc translation. These findings reveal specific consequences on spatial memory stages developed under hippocampal GLT-1 blockade, shedding light on the intricate molecular mechanisms, governed in part for the action of glia.

AB  - Remdesivir is among theSARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2) drugs with great potential. However, its poor aqueous solubility restricts its therapeutic action. Therefore, the aim was to develop the nasal delivery of Remdesivir with solubilizing polymers, poloxamer 407, and beta-cyclodextrin, which resulted in significant solubility enhancement. In addition, this nanosuspension was developed for the first time for pulmonary delivery to enhance the in vivo performance of remdesivir. Remdesivir solubility and biocompatibility were greatly improved by polymeric encapsulation at the nanoscale. The nanosuspension was prepared by the modified precipitation-ultra sonication process and showed a good particle size 500 nm +/- 20 nm, with polydispersity (0.226 +/- 0.02) and zeta potential (-16.0 +/- 2 mV). The nasal formulation was also assessed for in vitro dissolution and diffusion, in addition to toxicity investigations (Hemolysis, MTT assay). The conversion of remdesivir crystals to an amorphous form was verified by characterization studies (XRD and DSC). The morphology of the nano particles was determined by SEM method and found to be spherical and of uniform shape. FTIR study was performed to determine the drug compatibility with the polymers and was satisfactory. Histopathology study on goat nasal mucosa showed no adverse effects of the formulation on nasal tissues. Analysis using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed noticeably reduced levels of IL-4 mRNA expression (pro-inflammatory cytokines). In comparison to intravenous delivery, nasal delivery of remdesivir nanosuspension is patient-complaint and easy to use. The outcomes of this study demonstrate the potential for delivering remdesivir nanosuspension via the nasal route.

AB  - Fullerenes and fullerenols exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, making them promising candidates for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy. Unlike conventional anti-inflammatory drugs, these compounds have multitargeted effects, including their ability to inhibit amyloid fibril formation. However, few studies have explored their efficacy in high-validity AD models. Female APPswe/PS1E9 (APP/PS1) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates were orally administered with fullerene C-60 (0.1 mg/kg/day) or fullerenol C-60(OH)(24) (0.15 mg/kg/day) for 10 months starting at 2 months of age. Behavioral assessments were performed at 12 months of age. Amyloid plaque density and size were analyzed in the brain regions using Congo red staining. The expression of genes related to inflammation and plasticity was examined, and an in vitro assay was used to test the toxicity of fullerenol and its effect on amyloid beta peptide 42 (A beta 42)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Fullerenol reduced the maximum plaque size in the cortex and hippocampus, decreased the small plaque density in the hippocampus and thalamus, and prevented an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cell density in the mutants. Both treatments improved cognitive and emotional behaviors and reduced Il1 beta and increased Sirt1 expression. In vitro, fullerenol was non-toxic across a range of concentrations and reduced A beta 42-induced ROS production in brain endothelial cells and astrocytes. Long-term administration of fullerene or fullerenol improved behavioral and molecular markers of AD in APP/PS1 mice, with fullerenol showing additional benefits in reducing amyloid burden.

AB  - Scaffold-free spheroids constitute a promising therapeutic strategy for bone defect repair because of their tissue homology. However, applying mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) spheroids for bone defect repair remains challenging due to the lack of organ-specific functionality. Black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNS) were incorporated into MSC spheroids to enhance their bone regeneration capacity. Here, we propose a synergic bone microtissue construction strategy based on reprogramming MSCs with YAP1 gene overexpression, amplifying the osteoinductive effect of BPNS. Results demonstrated that either BPNS incorporation or YAP1 overexpression in MSC spheroids promoted osteogenesis and matrix formation in engineered bone microtissues. Furthermore, bone microtissues reprogrammed with synergistic YAP1 overexpression and incorporating BPNS could significantly enhance their osteogenic differentiation, further accelerating bone regeneration in rat calvarial defect models. Meanwhile, the reprogrammed bone microtissues established a bone-regenerative microenvironment by facilitating vascularization and macrophage polarization. In summary, these findings demonstrate that reprogrammed bone microtissues with YAP1 overexpression and BPNS incorporation within MSC spheroids amplified BPNS-mediated osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of MSC spheroids, indicating that the direct reprogramming of MSC spheroids may offer a promising strategy for further functionalizing spheroids for bone regeneration application.

AB  - Simple Summary: The extracellular matrix (ECM) is involved in many physiological processes that occur in the ovary and affect reproduction in animals and humans. The ECM has been shown to significantly affect folliculogenesis, ovulation, and corpus luteum formation. This is mainly due to the involvement of ECM in intercellular signaling. In the present study, we report the gene expression profile of porcine granulosa cells during their primary in vitro culture. The genes presented are related to ECM formation but also to cadherins and integrins that influence intercellular dialogue. During the study, it was shown that most of the genes were upregulated. A detailed understanding of the expression of genes such as POSTN, CHI3L1, CAV-1, IRS1, DCN in in vitro culture of granulosa cells may provide a basis for further studies on the molecular mechanisms occurring within the ovary. Knowledge of ECM-related gene expression within granulosa cells can also be used to study the recently discovered stemness of these cells. Moreover, the presented data may serve for the development of assisted reproduction techniques, which, especially in vitro, are becoming increasingly common.
   The extracellular matrix (ECM) in granulosa cells is functionally very important, and it is involved in many processes related to ovarian follicle growth and ovulation. The aim of this study was to describe the expression profile of genes within granulosa cells that are associated with extracellular matrix formation, intercellular signaling, and cell-cell fusion. The material for this study was ovaries of sexually mature pigs obtained from a commercial slaughterhouse. Laboratory-derived granulosa cells (GCs) from ovarian follicles were cultured in a primary in vitro culture model. The extracted genetic material (0, 48, 96, and 144 h) were subjected to microarray expression analysis. Among 81 genes, 66 showed increased expression and only 15 showed decreased expression were assigned to 7 gene ontology groups "extracellular matrix binding ", "extracellular matrix structural constituent ", "binding, bridging ", "cadherin binding ", "cell adhesion molecule binding ", "collagen binding " and "cadherin binding involved in cell-cell adhesion ". The 10 genes with the highest expression (POSTN, ITGA2, FN1, LAMB1, ITGB3, CHI3L1, PCOLCE2, CAV1, DCN, COL14A1) and 10 of the most down-regulated (SPP1, IRS1, CNTLN, TMPO, PAICS, ANK2, ADAM23, ABI3BP, DNAJB1, IGF1) were selected for further analysis. The results were validated by RT-qPCR. The current results may serve as preliminary data for further analyses using in vitro granulosa cell cultures in assisted reproduction technologies, studies of pathological processes in the ovary as well as in the use of the stemness potential of GCs.

AB  - RNS60 is a physically modified saline solution hypothesized to contain oxygen nanobubbles. It has been reported to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury in a pig model of acute myocardial infarction. We investigated the effects of RNS60 during cardiac hypoxia in mice and as an additive to cardioplegic solution in rat hearts. ApoE(-/-)LDLr(-/-) mice were treated by intravenous injection of RNS60 or saline as a control while monitoring the ECG and post-hypoxic serum release of troponin T and creatine kinase activity. Hearts infused with Custodiol containing 10% RNS60 or saline as the control were subjected to 4 h of 4 degrees C preservation, followed by an assessment of myocardial metabolites, purine release, and mechanical function. RNS60 attenuated changes in the ECG STU area during hypoxia, while the troponin T concentration and creatine kinase activity were significantly higher in the serum of the controls. During reperfusion after 4 h of cold ischemia, the Custodiol/RNS60-treated hearts had about 30% lower LVEDP and better dp/dt(max) and dp/dt(min) together with a decreased release of purine catabolites vs. the controls. The myocardial ATP, total adenine nucleotides, and phosphocreatine concentrations were higher in the RNS60-treated hearts. This study indicates that RNS60 enhances cardioprotection in experimental myocardial hypoxia and under conditions of cardioplegic arrest. Improved cardiac energetics are involved in the protective effect, but complete elucidation of the mechanism requires further study.

AB  - Simple Summary While the clinical effectiveness of medium-acting bovine follicle stimulating hormone (bFSH) is well-established for superovulation (SOV) protocols in cattle, the use of long-acting bovine recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (brFSH) remains the golden target. The application of a bFSH with prolonged half-life could improve substantially the results obtained regarding the ovarian superstimulation response and the quality and quantity of the embryos produced. Moreover, the management schemes may be improved by reducing the number of FSH applications needed during the SOV protocol. The development of a new extra-long-acting bovine single-chain recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (bscrFSH) provides interesting advantages to the SOV protocols as the present study shows, by improving the results obtained compared to the use of the conventional follicle stimulating hormone from purified pig pituitary extract (NIH-FSH-p). Over the last few years, several commercial FSH products have been developed for cattle superovulation (SOV) purposes in Multiple Ovulation and Embryo Transfer (MOET) programs. The SOV response is highly variable among individuals and remains one of the main limiting factors in obtaining a profitable number of transferable embryos. In this study, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from different origins was included in two SOV protocols, (a) FSH from purified pig pituitary extract (NIH-FSH-p; two doses/day, 12 h apart, four consecutive days); and (b) extra-long-acting bovine recombinant FSH (bscrFSH; a single dose/day, four consecutive days), to test the effects of bscrFSH on the ovarian response, hormone profile levels, in vivo embryo production and the pluripotency gene expression of the obtained embryos. A total of 68 healthy primiparous red Angus cows (Bos taurus) were randomly distributed into two experimental groups (n = 34 each). Blood sample collection for progesterone (P4) and cortisol (C) level determination was performed together with ultrasonographic assessment for ovarian size, follicles (FL) and corpora lutea (CL) quantification in each SOV protocol (Day 0, 4, 8, and 15). Moreover, FSH profiles were monitorised throughout both protocols (Day 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 15). In vivo embryo quantity and quality (total structures, morulae, blastocysts, viable, degenerated and blocked embryos) were recorded in each SOV protocol. Finally, embryo quality in both protocols was assessed by the analysis of the expression level of crucial genes for early embryo development (OCT4, IFNt, CDX2, BCL2, and BAX). P4 and cortisol concentration peaks in both SOV protocols were obtained on Day 15 and Day 8, respectively, which were statistically different compared to the other time-points (p < 0.05). Ovarian dimensions increased from Day 0 to Day 15 irrespective of the SOV protocol considered (p < 0.05). Significant changes in CL number were observed over time till Day 15 irrespective of the SOV protocol applied (p < 0.05), being non- significantly different between SOV protocols within each time-point (p > 0.05). The number of CL was higher on Day 15 in the bscrFSH group compared to the NIH-FSH-p group (p < 0.05). The number of embryonic structures recovered was higher in the bscrFSH group (p = 0.025), probably as a result of a tendency towards a greater number of follicles developed compared to the NIH-FSH-p group. IFNt and BAX were overexpressed in embryos from the bscrFSH group (p < 0.05), with a fold change of 16 and 1.3, respectively.
   However, no statistical differences were detected regarding the OCT4, CDX2, BCL2, and BCL2/BAX expression ratio (p > 0.05). In conclusion, including bscrFSH in SOV protocols could be an important alternative by reducing the number of applications and offering an improved ovarian response together with better embryo quality and superior performance in embryo production compared to NIH-FSH-p SOV protocols.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Rhus genus is commonly known as sumac and widely used in the folk medicine. Rhus virens is a plant commonly used to treat diabetes or pain in the northern territory of Mexico. Even though R. virens is used in the folk medicine there is still a lack of evidence about the pharmacological effect of this species.
   Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to determine the antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect of R. virens through a bio-guided chemical separation.
   Materials and methods: The aqueous, methanolic, and hexane extract of R. virens were obtained and tested in the formalin test, TPA-induced ear edema, and DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assay. Also, possible interaction of pain pathways was studied using naloxone, bicuculline, L-NAME, ODQ, and glibenclamide in the formalin test in mice.
   Results: Rhus virens methanolic extract (30 mg/kg, p.o.) produced higher antinociceptive activity in both the early and late phases of the formalin test (35.0 and 52.9%, respectively). Also, pre-administration with naloxone, bicuculline, L-NAME, ODQ and glibenclamide prevented the antinociceptive effect of R. virens in the early phase of the formalin test. Meanwhile, only naloxone and bicuculline prevented the antinociceptive effect on the late phase of the formalin test. Chemical separation of methanolic extract allowed to isolate 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-glucopyranose (PGG), it was tested in the formalin test, producing an antinociceptive effect on the late phase of the formalin test. On the other hand, topical application of the derivatives of R. virens methanolic extract produced an anti-inflammatory effect in the TPA-induced ear edema, being PGG an anti-inflammatory molecule. Lastly, radical scavenging activity was higher in the extracts of higher polarity, comparable to the standard used Camellia sinensis.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, R. virens produce an antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and free-radical scavenging activity. The antinociceptive effect could be related to the opioidergic, GABAergic, and NO-GMPc-K + ATP channels pathways. These effects could be partially produced by the presence of PGG.

AB  - Luteolin has been reported to exhibit therapeutic effect on depressive-like behaviors in mice. Nevertheless, the therapeutic effect of luteolin on the depression-related dry eye disorder remains inconclusive. In this study, C57 mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress in a dry environment (relative humidity in the cage < 40%). The behavioral test and phenol red cotton thread test were employed to select the mice with both dry eye and depression-like behavior. The mechanism of luteolin on depression-related dry eye disorder was assessed by the Sirt1 selective inhibitor EX-527. Luteolin alleviated depressive-like behaviors induced by CUMS, increased tear secretion and restored corneal defects in mice. The secretions of pro-inflammatory factors IL-18, IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-alpha were decreased in hippocampi and corneal tissues by Luteolin treatment. Luteolin treatment up-regulated Sirt1 expression and down-regulated Ac-NF-KB, NLRP3, Ac-Caspase-1, GSDMD-N, Cleaved IL-18, and Cleaved IL-18 expressions. In addition, the selective inhibition of Sirt1 could weaken the therapeutic effect of luteolin on depression-related dry eye disorder. The beneficial effect of luteolin through Sirt1/NF-KB/NLRP3 signaling pathway might be a therapeutic strategy for the depression -related dry eye disorder.

AB  - This study aimed to identify the possible advantages of administering butorphanol (BUT), associated with ketamine/xylazine (KX) sedation or not, for semen collection using electroejaculation (EE) in rams. Fifteen rams received four treatments in a cross-over design using a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. The treatments were 1) control; 2) received KX; 3) received BUT; and 4) received both treatments. The re-sponses to the procedures regarding heart rate, respiratory frequency, and rectal temperature were recorded, glucose and creatine kinase were measured, and semen quality was determined. More pulses were required when BUT was administered (P = 0.0067), but rams vocalized fewer times (P = 0.046). The administration of KX also tended to reduce the respiratory frequency (P = 0.068) and rectal temperature (P = 0.089), with no other effects. The administration of BUT reduced the heart rate (P < 0.0001), and there was an interactive effect between the administration of BUT and time on the heart rate (P < 0.0001), respiratory frequency (P = 0.01), and rectal temperature (P = 0.047). The administration of BUT reduced the heart rate increase immediately after EE (P < 0.0001). The respiratory frequency following EE was greater when BUT was administered (P < 0.0001), but the administration of BUT reduced the rectal temperature at the same time (P = 0.002). Glucose concentration was greater when BUT was administered (P < 0.0001). The only significant effect on the ejaculate characteristics was from the interaction between KX and BUT on sperm concentration (P = 0.004). The administration of KX alone increased sperm concentration (P = 0.035), but when BUT was added to KX, sperm concentration decreased (P = 0.002). Moreover, sperm concentration was greater when only BUT was administered than when KX and BUT were administered simultaneously (P = 0.037). The addition of BUT markedly decreased most negative responses more effectively than sedation with KX alone. In conclusion, BUT appears to be an interesting alternative to reduce the welfare concerns raised by the use of EE in rams; however, its possible effects on the ejaculate characteristics when associated with other anesthesia/ sedation drugs require further study.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Functional restoration by the re-establishment of cellular or neural connections remains a major challenge in targeted cell therapy and regenerative medicine. Recent advances in magnetically powered microrobots have shown potential for use in controlled and targeted cell therapy. In this study, a magnetic neurospheroid (Mag-Neurobot) that can form both structural and functional connections with an organotypic hippocampal slice (OHS) is assessed using an ex vivo model as a bridge toward in vivo application. The Mag-Neurobot consists of hippocampal neurons and superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs); it is precisely and skillfully manipulated by an external magnetic field. Furthermore, the results of patch-clamp recordings of hippocampal neurons indicate that neither the neuronal excitabilities nor the synaptic functions of SPION-loaded cells are significantly affected. Analysis of neural activity propagation using high-density multi-electrode arrays shows that the delivered Mag-Neurobot is functionally connected with the OHS. The applications of this study include functional verification for targeted cell delivery through the characterization of novel synaptic connections and the functionalities of transported and transplanted cells. The success of the Mag-Neurobot opens up new avenues of research and application; it offers a test platform for functional neural connections and neural regenerative processes through cell transplantation.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of milrinone supplementation as a phosphodiesterase 3A inhibitor during in vitro maturation (IVM) to coordinate the cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation of porcine oocytes and subsequent development of porcine cloned embryos. Brilliant cresyl blue (BCB)-stained (BCB +) oocytes, classified as well-developed, and BCB- oocytes were used in parthenogenesis (PA) and cloning, and their preimplantation development was compared. In PA embryos, BCB + oocytes had significantly higher rates of development than BCB- oocytes in terms of maturation (87.5 vs. 71.3%), cleavage (88.6 vs. 76.3%), and blastocyst development (34.3 vs. 25.3%) and also had higher cell numbers (46.9 vs. 38.9%), respectively (p < 0.05). In cloned embryos, the BCB + group also had a significantly higher blastocyst formation rate than the BCB- group (30.6 vs. 20.1%; p < 0.05). Supplementation with 75 mu M milrinone during IVM of BCB- oocytes showed improvement in maturation and blastocyst development rates, which may be due to the coordinated maturation of the cytoplasm with the nucleus as an effect of milrinone. Moreover, the analysis of nuclear reprogramming via the examination of the expression levels of the reprogramming-related genes POU5F1, DPPA2, and NDP52IL in milrinone-supplemented BCB- oocytes showed higher expression levels than that in non-treated BCB- oocytes. These findings demonstrate that milrinone is useful in improving developmental competence in less competent oocytes during IVM and for proper nuclear reprogramming in the production of porcine cloned embryos by coordinating cytoplasmic and nucleus maturation.

AB  - The complement system is a central component of innate immunity, responsible for recognition and killing of bacteria by tagging invaders through opsonisation, thereby promoting phagocytosis, and by direct lysis. Complement activity is routinely measured using functional assays that utilise erythrocytes as targets. The classical pathway haemolytic assay (CH50) with antibody sensitised sheep erythrocytes as target is used worldwide in clinical and research laboratories to measure complement activity in human and rodent sera. While there are no particular limitations in the human assay, measuring complement in mouse serum is more difficult and usually requires large amounts of serum, which is challenging to collect in experiments. In particular, it is challenging to measure the activities of individual mouse complement proteins. To overcome this hurdle, we have developed protocols that employ human sera depleted of single complement proteins as the source of the other complement proteins and test mouse serum to restore the relevant component. This simple haemolytic assay is a useful tool for confirming natural or engineered complement deficiencies and complement dysregulation in mouse models.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide. Patient mortality has been successfully reduced by nearly half in the last four decades, mainly due to advances in minimally invasive surgery techniques and interventional cardiology methods. However, a major hurdle is still the translational gap between preclinical findings and the conversion into effective therapies, which is partly due to the use of model systems that fail to recapitulate key aspects of human physiology and disease. Large animal models such as pigs and non-human primates are highly valuable because they closely resemble humans but are costly and time intensive. Here, we provide a method for long-term ex vivo culture of non-human primate (NHP) myocardial tissue that offers a powerful alternative for a wide range of applications including electrophysiology studies, drug screening, and gene function analyses.

AB  - Chronic ethanol exposure can increase the risk of depression. The alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor is a key factor in depression and its treatment. The study was conducted to investigate the depressive-like behavior induced by chronic ethanol exposure in mice and to explore the mechanism in cells. To establish the chronic ethanol exposure mouse model, male C57BL/6 N mice were administered 10% (m/V) and 20% (m/V) ethanol as the only choice for drinking for 60 days, 90 days and 180 days. Depressive-like behavior in mice was confirmed by the forced swimming test (FST). Ethanol-induced changes in the mouse hippocampus were indicated by Western blotting, qPCR and Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining. We confirmed that 90- and 180-day ethanol exposure can lead to depressive-like mouse behavior, cell apoptosis, neuronal degeneration, a reduction in GluA1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, and an increase in IL-6 and IL-1 beta in the mouse hippocampus. GluA1 silencing and overexpression models of SH-SY5Y cells were established for further investigation. The cells were treated with 100 mM and 200 mM ethanol for 24 h. Ethanol exposure decreased cell viability and the expression of BDNF and increased the cell apoptosis rate and the expression of BAX, cleaved caspase-3, IL-1 beta and IL-6. GluA1 silencing aggravated ethanol-induced changes in cell viability and apoptosis and the expression of BDNF, BAX and cleaved caspase-3, and GluA1 overexpression attenuated these changes. Neither the silencing nor overexpression of GluA1 had an effect on ethanol-induced increases in IL-1 beta and IL-6. Our results indicated that chronic ethanol exposure induced depressive-like behavior in male C57BL/6 N mice by downregulating GluA1 expression.

AB  - Background: Acrylamide (ACR) is a widely used compound that is known to be neurotoxic to both experimental animals and humans, causing nerve damage. The widespread presence of ACR in the environment and food means that the toxic risk to human health can no longer be ignored. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a natural polyphenolic compound extracted from the perilla plant, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and other properties. It has also been demon strated to possess promising potential in neuroprotection. However, its role and potential mechanism in treating ACR induced neurotoxicity are still elusive. Purpose: This study explores whether RA can improve ACR induced neurotoxicity and its possible mechanism. Methods: The behavioral method was used to study RA effect on ACR exposed mice's neurological function. We studied its potential mechanism through metabolomics, Nissl staining, HE staining, immunohistochemical analysis, and Western blot. Results: RA pretreatment reversed the increase in mouse landing foot splay and decrease in spontaneous activity caused by 3 weeks of exposure to 50 mg/kg/d ACR. Further experiments demonstrated that RA could prevent ACR induced neuronal apoptosis, significantly downregulate nuclear factor-kappa B and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression, and inhibit NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome activation, thereby reducing inflammation as confirmed by metabolomics results. Additionally, RA treatment prevented endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) caused by ACR exposure, as evidenced by the reversal of significant P-IRE1 alpha,TRAF2,CHOP expression increase. Conclusion: RA alleviates ACR induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting ERS and inflammation. These results provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism of ACR induced neurotoxicity and propose a potential new treatment method.

AB  - Ethnopharmacology relevance: Ayahuasca is a beverage obtained from the decoctions of Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) Morton and Psychotria viridis Ruiz & Pav., used throughout the Amazon as a medicinal beverage for healing and spiritual exploration. The Banisteriopsis caapi extract consists of harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine (THH); which inhibit the isoforms of monoamine oxidase A and B. In the central nervous system (CNS), it can increase the norepinephrine (NE) concentration, produced in the Locus coeruleus (LC), reducing inflammation that is associated with some neurological disease, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Aim of the study: evaluate the effects of treatment with B. caapi extract on the neuroinflammatory profile in animals with selective LC lesions. Material and methods: male Wistar rats with LC lesions induced by 6-hydroxydopamine were treated with B. caapi extract. Subsequently, behavioral tests were conducted, including the elevated plus maze, rotarod, and open field. Tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH+) neurons and IBA-1 positive microglia were quantified from the LC inflammatory markers and free radical products were assessed. Results: Both 6-Hydroxydopamine hydrochloride and the Banisteriopsis caapi extract causes reduction of LC neurons, at the concentration and frequency used. The LC depletion and the treatment of B. caapi extract interfere with locomotion. B. caapi extract and the LC lesion increased the number and activation of inflammatory cells, such as microglia. B. caapi extract decreases IL-10 in the hippocampus and BDNF gene expression. Conclusion: This study suggests that B. caapi extract (at the concentration and frequency used) promotes noradrenergic neuron depletion and creates a proinflammatory environment in the CNS.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Koreans consume more pork meat among the various meats, and as the consumption of pork meat increases, the amount of slaughtering is also increasing. Accordingly, the Korean government is sizing up and modernizing slaughterhouses to expedite the slaughter and to increase the safety of livestock products. The labor-intensive slaughter industry is undergoing major changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which will speed up the automation of slaughterhouses. Various automation devices are also being introduced in Korea, and currently the Korean government is introducing a pork meat yield grading machine to increase the accuracy of judgments based on the increasing slaughter volume. However, because such equipment is quite expensive, it is not easy to introduce, and a detailed study on the utility of the related equipment and an economic feasibility analysis has not been conducted. Therefore, in this study, we tried to prove the validity of the introduction of the equipment through the effectiveness study and economic analysis of the automatic meat yield grading machine, and a plan to increase the economic effect was considered.
   Currently, the pork industry is incorporating in-line automation with the aim of increasing the slaughtered pork carcass throughput while monitoring quality and safety. In Korea, 21 parameters (such as back-fat thickness and carcass weight) are used for quality grading of pork carcasses. Recently, the VCS2000 system-an automatic meat yield grading machine system-was introduced to enhance grading efficiency and therefore increase pork carcass production. The VCS2000 system is able to predict pork carcass yield based on image analysis. This study also conducted an economic analysis of the system using a cost-benefit analysis. The subsection items of the cost-benefit analysis considered were net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and benefit/cost ratio (BC ratio), and each method was verified through sensitivity analysis. For our analysis, the benefits were grouped into three categories: the benefits of reducing labor costs, the benefits of improving meat yield production, and the benefits of reducing pig feed consumption through optimization. The cost-benefit analysis of the system resulted in an NPV of approximately 615.6 million Korean won, an IRR of 13.52%, and a B/C ratio of 1.65.

AB  - Epidermal melanin unit integrity is crucial for skin homeostasis and pigmentation. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) is a pivotal player in cell growth, wound healing, and maintaining skin homeostasis. However, its influence on skin pigmentation is relatively unexplored. This study investigates the impact and underlying mechanisms of EGFR inhibitors on skin pigmentation. We evaluated EGF and EGFR expression in various skin cells using quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. EGF and EGFR were predominantly expressed in epidermal keratinocytes, and treatment with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) gefitinib and PD153035 significantly increased stem cell factor (SCF) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression in cultured keratinocytes. Enhanced melanocyte migration and proliferation were observed in co-culture, as evidenced by time-lapse live imaging and single-cell tracking assays. Furthermore, topical application of gefitinib to guinea pig dorsal skin induced increased pigmentation and demonstrated efficacy in mitigating rhododendrol-induced leukoderma. Suppression of EGF signaling indirectly enhanced skin pigmentation by upregulating SCF and ET-1 in epidermal keratinocytes. This novel mechanism highlights the pivotal role of EGF signaling in regulating skin pigmentation, and topical EGFR-TKI therapy at an appropriate dose may be a promising approach for depigmentation disorder management.

AB  - Circadian clocks control many vital aspects of physiology from the sleep-wake cycle to metabolism. The circadian clock operates through transcriptional-translational feedback loops. The normal circadian signaling relies on a 'master clock', located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which synchronizes peripheral oscillators. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling has the ability to reset the phase of peripheral clocks. It has been shown that maternal exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs) can lead to modification of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function, impact stress-related behaviors, and result in a hypertensive state via GR activation. We previously demonstrated altered circadian rhythm signaling in the adrenal glands of offspring exposed to the synthetic GC, dexamethasone (Dex). Results from the current study show that prenatal exposure to Dex affects circadian rhythm gene expression in a brain region-specific and a sex-specific manner within molecular oscillators of the amygdala, hippocampus, paraventricular nucleus, and prefrontal cortex, as well as the main oscillator in the SCN. Results also show that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) exhibited dysregulated circadian rhythm gene expression in these same brain regions compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), although the pattern of dysregulation was markedly different from that seen in adult offspring prenatally exposed to GCs.

AB  - Depression is a global disease that places a significant burden on human health. Neuroinflammation and disturbance of glutamate metabolism in brain regions, such as the hippocampus, play vital roles in the development of depression. Previous studies have shown that cyanidin chloride (Cycl) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties with neuroprotective effects in peripheral tissues. However, the effects of Cycl on depression and the possible mechanism by which this compound targets brain regions remain less elucidated. We investigated the role of Cycl in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression and examined the influence of the drug on central inflammation and the expression of excitatory amino acid transporters in the hippocampus. We found that prophylactic i.p. application of Cycl at 20 or 40 mg/kg for 5 days significantly reduced the immobility time assessed by the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST) in LPS-challenged mice, suggesting an effective antidepressant activity of the drug. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining in the hippocampus revealed that Cycl inhibited the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha and IL-6, and suppressed the hyperactivity of microglia induced by LPS, indicating an anti-inflammatory role in the hippocampus. Moreover, treatment with Cycl also recovered the downregulated expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) and excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), two members in the excitatory amino acid transporter family. The role of Cycl was also verified in cultured BV2 and U251 cells. In conclusion, the present in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that Cycl exerts potent antidepressant action in an LPS-induced depression model and the underlying mechanism is associated with reduced hippocampal inflammation, improved function, and attenuated induced

AB  - We investigated the immediate molecular consequences of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) using a novel proteomics approach. We simulated TBIs using an innovative laboratory apparatus that employed a 5.1 kg dummy head that held neuronal cells and generated a <= 4000 g-force acceleration upon impact. A Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) assay was then employed to monitor protein solubility changes in a system-wide manner. Dynamic impacts led to both a reduction in neuron viability and massive solubility changes in the proteome. The affected proteins mapped not only to the expected pathways, such as those of cell adhesion, collagen, and laminin structures, as well as the response to stress, but also to other dense protein networks, such as immune response, complement, and coagulation cascades. The cellular effects were found to be mainly due to the shockwave rather than the g-force acceleration. Soft materials could reduce the impact's severity only until they were fully compressed. This study shows a way of developing a proteome-based meter for measuring irreversible shockwave-induced cell damage and provides a resource for identifying protein biomarkers of TBIs and potential drug targets for the development of products aimed at primary prevention and intervention.

AB  - While many studies were done about green facades' thermal performance, limited studies were done about green facades for productive farming. Most focused only on one facade or building. According to that, this research questioned what the potentials of farming on facades and roofs in an entire neighbourhood are and what could such a farming system looks like, and what it costs. To address these questions, a literature review about urban farming and possible crops was done. A neighbourhood of 22 multi-floor residential buildings in Nablus\Palestine, was chosen as a case study, and two parametric tools, one for analysis (AGRI|gen\Analysis) and another for design (AGRI|gen\design) were developed and implemented. The study found that in the chosen neighbourhood, existing facades can provide about 28,500 m(2) of farming area, but only half of the facades and all of the roofs were suitable for daylight-based farming. Tomatoes and cucumbers can be farmed on 25% and 33% of the facades, respectively, to fulfil about 350% and 237% of tomatoes and cucumbers consumption by the same neighbourhood simultaneously. Roofs were found to be more suitable for high DLI-requiring plants like sweet peppers as they can produce more than 315 times the local consumption. In terms of design, a modular adaptive facade system was designed to fit the neighbourhood to enhance the farming possibilities. The facade system needed about 40,824 modular units of which 73.3%, 10.1%, 8.7%, and 8% of them were LED, PV, Sensor, and fan units respectively, with an average system cost of about $55.2\m(2) and a total cost of $1.7M. Finally, a comparison between the system and a proposed vertical farm building in the same region was done, and then related recommendations by the researcher were suggested. This research highlights the potential for productive farming on facades and roofs, which could contribute to sustainable and resilient cities.

AB  - In this study, nanosized vanadate-substituted hydroxyapatites doped with 1 mol% and 2 mol% Eu3+ ions were obtained via the precipitation method. To evaluate the structure and morphology of the obtained compounds, the XRPD (X-ray powder diffraction) technique, Rietveld refinement, SEM-EDS (scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive spectrometry) and TEM (transmission electron microscopy) techniques as well as FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectroscopy were performed. Moreover, the chemical formula was confirmed using the ICP-OES (Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy spectroscopy). The calculated average grain size for powders was in the range of 25 to 90 nm. The luminescence properties of vanadium-substituted hydroxyapatite were evaluated by recording emission spectra and excitation spectra as well as luminescence kinetics. The crucial step of this research was the evaluation of the biocompatibility of the synthesized nanomaterials. Therefore, the obtained compounds were tested toward sheep red blood cells and normal human dermal fibroblast to confirm the nontoxicity and biocompatibility of new nanosized Eu3+ ion-doped vanadate-hydroxyapatite. Moreover, the final step of the research allowed us to determine the time dependent ion release to the simulated body fluid environment. The study confirmed cytocompatibility of vanadium hydroxyapatite doped with Eu3+ ions.

AB  - The adult rodent hippocampus is capable of maintaining its capacity to generate new neurons in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG). Interestingly, proliferative cells have also been described in the hilus. The involvement of the hilar neurogenesis process in hippocampal physiology is unknown. Thyroid hormones (THs) are necessary for the survival of postmitotic progenitor cells, neuroblasts, and immature granule neurons in the SGZ. In contrast, evidence concerning the role of THs in the hilar neurogenesis process is limited. The present study characterized the mitotic activity, cell survival, and neuronal differentiation of hilar neurogenesis under physiological and hypothyroid conditions and compared them with those of the granular layer (GL) and the SGZ of the DG in adult Wistar rats. We found that, under physiological conditions, the hilus harbors fewer proliferative cells than the neurogenic zone (GL/SGZ) does, with a rate of cell survival of 18.9% and a rate of differentiation into granular neurons of 19%. Interestingly, hypothyroidism provokes decreased cell proliferation and an increased rate of cell survival without affecting neuronal differentiation. These effects induced by hypothyroidism in the hilus were different or inclusive, contrary to those observed in the neurogenic zone.

AB  - Simple Summary Gentle touch has been repeatedly shown to have a positive effect on livestock. The purpose of this study was to determine potential changes in physiological indicators in lambs subjected to gentle stroking. A total of 40 lambs of two breeds were assigned to two control groups (n = 20) and two experimental groups (n = 20). Lambs from the experimental groups received treatment (the gentle stroking procedure). Analyses consisted of determining the following parameters: heart rate (HR), saturation (S) and biochemical analysis. An increase in cortisol levels and a decrease in total protein levels indicate a disruption of homeostasis. At the same time, a significant increase in glycogen and a significant decrease in glucose and heart rate values suggest reduced stress levels. The results obtained in the experimental groups suggest that interactions with humans, even of a positive nature, can be a source of stress, but this is a transient and adaptive reaction. Interactions with humans can be a source of stress, but long-term and positive ones will lead to positive changes and easier handling of animals.Abstract The aim of the study was to determine changes in physiological indicators in lambs subjected to gentle stroking. The study included 40 three-week-old lambs (20 females of the synthetic prolific-meat (BCP) line and 20 females of the Swiniarka (SW) breed). The animals were assigned to two control groups (n = 20) and two experimental groups (n = 20). Lambs from the experimental groups received treatment. Analyses consisted of determining the following parameters: heart rate (HR), saturation (S) and biochemical analysis. In the groups of sheep subjected to gentle massage, the analyses revealed a significant increase in the levels of cortisol, CAT, GST, GPx, among others, and a significant decrease in the levels of total protein, SOD, TAC, uric acid and Na+. At the same time, indicators of reduced stress levels were revealed, i.e., a significant increase in glycogen levels and a significant decrease in glucose and HR values. These results suggest that the introduction of gentle touch can induce positive states in lambs, and that the stress response may be transient and adaptive. Nevertheless, it is important to note that these interactions can be a source of stress, even if the behavioral response does not necessarily indicate stress.

AB  - Maternal separation (MS) leads to changes in maternal behavior. Maternal exercise could be a potent modifier of maternal behavior (MB). Regular physical exercise is widely recommended but is frequently modified during pregnancy, so we tested whether stopping, starting, reducing, or maintaining the running intensity during pregnancy can protect dams from MS-induced behavior and memory alterations, as well as influence mother-pup bonding. Female rats were divided into six groups: non-exercised mothers that were not submitted to MS (Control); non-exercised mothers submitted to MS (MS); mothers that ran (physical exercise) only before pregnancy and were submitted to MS (PRE+MS); mothers that started to run at the beginning of pregnancy submitted to MS (GEST+MS); mothers that ran before pregnancy and reduced the running intensity during pregnancy and were submitted to MS (RED+MS); and, mothers that ran at the same intensity before and during pregnancy and were submitted to MS (EQUAL+MS). We performed MS from PND 1 to 10, three hours per day. We assessed MB for 30 min after MS from PND 1 to 5. We assessed object recognition (OR) memory before and during pregnancy and after weaning. We assessed maternal preference (MP) one week after weaning. We measured hippocampal lipid peroxidation and catalase levels 24 h after the ending of all tests. PRE+MS leads to detraining and memory deficits at the end of pregnancy and after weaning. MS, PRE+MS, and RED+MS increased the time spent in the nest. GEST+MS mothers preferred contact with their male and female offspring after weaning. GEST+MS prevents OR deficit after weaning. PRE+MS showed increased lipid peroxidation after weaning. MS increased catalase levels; all exercised groups prevented this effect.

AB  - To identify potentially transplantable organs in a pool of marginal kidneys, 33 porcine slaughterhouse kidneys were perfused for 4 h with whole blood. During the normothermic perfusion, plasma, urine, and tissue samples were taken. Several biomarkers for tubule injury, endothelial activation, and inflammatory response were evaluated for a potential correlation with macroscopic appearance, histology, and filtration activity. Generally, biomarker levels increased during perfusion. TLR-4, EDN-1, and NGAL were not associated with any classification. In contrast, a steeper increase in NAG and IL-6 in plasma correlated with a poor macroscopic appearance at 4 h, indicating a higher inflammatory response in the kidneys with worse macroscopy early on, potentially due to more damage at the tubules. Although long-term effects on the graft could not be assessed in this setting, early observation under machine perfusion with whole blood was feasible. It allowed the assessment of kidneys under conditions comparable to reperfusion. This setting could give surgeons further insight into the quality of marginal kidneys and an opportunity to pre-treat them.

AB  - Ras protein activator like 2 (RASAL2) has a cancer-related function, but plays inconsistent roles in different malignancies. This project was designed to determine the role of RASAL2 in carcinogenesis in gastric cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas data revealed high levels of RASAL2 in gastric cancer tissue, which was confirmed in clinical specimens of gastric cancer via real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting assays. High RASAL2 was correlated with a reduced survival rate in gastric cancer patients. In gastric cancer cell lines, the silencing of RASAL2 restrained cellular proliferation, invasion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, while enhancing chemosensitivity to cisplatin. Mechanistically, the silencing of RASAL2 was found to inhibit the activation of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a pro-oncogenic protein in gastric cancer, and decrease the expression of YAP1 target genes. The re-expression of constitutively active YAP1 substantially reversed RASAL2-silencing-produced antitumor effects. Moreover, treatment with YAP1 inhibitors could diminish RASAL2-overexpression-evoked oncogenic effects in gastric cancer cells. Additionally, gastric cancer cells with RASAL2 silencing exhibited a reduced ability to form xenograft tumors in nude mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the silencing of RASAL2 has noteworthy antitumor effects in gastric cancer cells via the suppression of YAP1 activation. This project underscores a vital role of the RASAL2/YAP1 axis in gastric progression and indicates that targeting this oncogenic axis may be applied as a potential therapeutic option for gastric cancer.

AB  - The effective and long-term treatment of cartilage defects is an unmet need among patients worldwide. In the past, several synthetic and natural biomaterials have been designed to support functional articular cartilage formation. However, they have mostly failed to enhance the terminal stage of chondrogenic differentiation, leading to scar tissue formation after the operation. Growth factors substantially regulate cartilage regeneration by acting on receptors to trigger intracellular signaling and cell recruitment for tissue regeneration. In this study, we investigated the effect of recombinant insulin-like growth factor 1 (rIGF-1), loaded in fibrin microbeads (FibIGF1), on cartilage regeneration. rIGF-1-loaded fibrin microbeads were injected into full-thickness cartilage defects in the knees of goats. The stability, integration, and quality of tissue repair were evaluated at 1 and 6 months by gross morphology, histology, and collagen type II staining. The in vivo results showed that compared to plain fibrin samples, particularly at 6 months, FibIGF1 improved the functional cartilage formation, confirmed through gross morphology, histology, and collagen type II immunostaining. FibIGF1 could be a promising candidate for cartilage repair in the clinic.

AB  - This study discusses the properties of mare milk as a potential food matrix to produce functional dairy products. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cold storage on the viability of microflora in fermented and unfermented mare's milk, containing live monocultures of probiotic bacteria, during storage at low temperatures. Three fermented beverages were produced, differentiated by the bacterial flora used for production (Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12), as well as one unfermented beverage (using 40% commercial kumis and 7% LA-5). The unfermented beverage was mare's milk supplemented with a BB-12 monoculture, which was chilled immediately after adding the inoculum. The population of BB-12 remained above 6 log CFU/g until the 21st day of storage at 5 +/- 1 degrees C, while for LA-5, it remained viable only up to 14 days of storage. The BB-12 population was high and stable for 21 days in both fermented and unfermented beverages. The results confirm the good quality of the final product (appropriate pH and high population of individual bacterial strains); not only are appropriate culture conditions important, but the use of suitable probiotic bacteria and the optimization of the starter concentrations should also be considered. There is considerable potential for further research and future commercialization of mare's dairy products, such as yogurt and potentially other dairy products.

AB  - Oxidative stress is considered to be a major cause of numerous intestinal diseases, and taxifolin (TA) possesses a variety of pharmacological properties that promote health and prevent disease. This study intends to determine the ability of TA to alleviate oxidative stress induced by diquat (DIQ) in porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPECJ2 cells). After being pretreated with 150 mu M TA for 24 h, IPEC-J2 cells were treated with 0.5 mM DIQ for 6 h to cause oxidative stress. The results demonstrated that TA pretreatment increased cell viability and proliferation, significantly inhibited the DIQ-induced reductions in cell proliferation and cell viability, and ameliorated the intestinal barrier by up-regulating the expression levels of Claudin1 and Occludin. Furthermore, TA pretreatment weakened the DIQ-induced inflammatory response through reducing the gene expression of proinflammatory factors (IL-6 and IL-8) and increasing the antioxidant gene expression level, possibly through activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that TA is a potent antioxidant that attenuates cytotoxicity and inflammation, protects cellular barrier integrity, and improves antioxidant function in DIQstimulated IPEC-J2 cells. This research explores the role of TA in mitigating intestinal oxidative stress damage and its potential as an eco-friendly feed additive in pig farming.

AB  - Background/Aims: Early life exposures to marine contaminants can adversely impact child health but modes of action are unclear. Human milk contains extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can transport biologically relevant cargo from mother to infant, including microRNAs (miRNAs), and may partly mediate the effects of pollutants on child health. However, the role of marine pollutants on miRNA expression in milk EVs is unexplored. Methods: We isolated EV RNA from 333 milk samples collected between 2 and 74 days postpartum from a Faroese birth cohort born 1997-2000 and sequenced 2083 miRNAs using a targeted library preparation method. We quantified five perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pesticide metabolite p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and the sum of three major polychlorinated biphenyls (Sigma PCBs) in maternal serum at 34 weeks of gestation and maternal hair total mercury (Hg) at birth. We used negative binomial regressions to estimate associations between individual pollutants and 418 reliably expressed EV-miRNAs adjusted for potential confounders. We performed sparse principal components (PCs) analysis to derive the first four components of the EV-miRNA data and examined associations between pollutants and PCs using Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). Results: We observed no associations between pollutants and individual EV-miRNA expression after controlling the false discovery rate at 0.1. However, BKMR suggested that Hg was positively associated with PC1 and negatively associated with PC3, while Sigma PCBs was negatively associated with PC3, and two PFAS were associated with PC4. Exploration of PC loadings followed by pathway analyses suggested that miRNAs in PC1 (miR-200b3p, miR-664a-3p, miR-6738-5p, miR-429, miR-1236-5p, miR-4464, and miR-30b-5p) may be related to Hg neurotoxicity, while remaining PCs require further research. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that groups of milk EV-miRNAs may better serve as environmental biomarkers than individual miRNAs. Future studies are needed to elucidate the role of milk EV-miRNAs in child health following prenatal exposures.

AB  - For wide flange box sections, conventional Euler-Bernoulli beam theory with maintaining the cross-section planarity may lead to underestimation of axial stresses. Axial stresses in cross-section flanges may have a non-uniform distribution due to shear pliability, decreasing in value from the flange-web junction to the middle area of the flange. This phenomenon leads to the introduction of an effective flange width with a uniform distribution of original maximum stress. Furthermore, the introduction of flange curvature makes it even more complex due to the varying lever arm of each flange part with respect to the neutral bending axis. Because of this, in some cases, it is hard to predict where the flange's highest normal stress value will appear. In this paper, the shear lag effect on wide curved box sections is analyzed through parametric numerical analysis using the FEA software Dlubal RFEM 5, together with visual programming performed in Rhino Grasshopper. This study investigates the interaction of the shear lag effect and plane section hypothesis, which can be simplistically represented as a reduction in the impact of shear lag and the activation of a larger part of the flange of a wide-flange beam in the structural system of a continuous beam. The results suggest that for higher flange curvature and higher width to length ratio, this effect is more prominent.

AB  - Livestock workers experience an increased burden of bioaerosol-induced respiratory disease including a high prevalence of rhinosinusitis. Dairy operations generate bioaerosols spanning the inhalable size fraction (0-100 mu m) containing bacterial constituents such as endotoxin. Particles with an aerodynamic diameter between 10 and 100 mu m are known to deposit in the nasopharyngeal region and likely affect the upper respiratory tract. We evaluated the effectiveness of a hypertonic saline nasal lavage in reducing inflammatory responses in dairy workers from a high-volume dairy operation. Inhalable personal breathing zone samples and pre-/post-shift nasal lavage samples from each participant over five consecutive days were collected. The treatment group (n = 5) received hypertonic saline while the control group (n = 5) received normotonic saline. Personal breathing zone samples were analyzed for particulate concentrations and endotoxin using gravimetric and enzymatic methods, respectively. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha) were measured from nasal lavage samples using a multiplex assay. Inhalable dust concentrations ranged from 0.15 to 1.9 mg/m(3). Concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, specifically IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, were significantly higher in the treatment group compared to the control group (p < 0.02, p < 0.04, and p < 0.01, respectively). Further analysis of IL-10 anti-inflammatory indicates a positive association between hypertonic saline administration and IL-10 production. This pilot study demonstrates that hypertonic saline nasal lavages were successful in upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines to support larger interventional studies.

AB  - AOS alleviates inflammatory responses; however, whether it exerts an effect on the rumen or regulates rumen inflammatory reaction remains unknown. In this study, firstly, the ovine ruminal epithelial cells (ORECs) were treated with 0, 200, 400, 600, and 800 mu g/mL AOS, hoping to explore whether AOS hurt cell health. The results showed that compared with the AOS-0 group, the AOS-400 group could significantly increase (p < 0.05) cell viability, reduce (p < 0.05) reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interleukin (IL)-6 content, and have no adverse effect on cells. Secondly, we used LPS to construct an in vitro inflammatory model of rumen epithelial cells and then explored the protective role of AOS on rumen epithelial cells. The study was divided into three groups: the control group (CON), LPS, and LPS + AOS. The results demonstrated that the LPS + AOS group significantly increased the cell viability and reduced the ROS level in comparison with the LPS group (p < 0.05). Pretreatment with AOS also repressed (p < 0.05) the secretion of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and immunoglobulin (Ig)A from ORECs in the culture medium following LPS. In terms of tight junction (TJ) proteins, AOS treatment also significantly increased (p < 0.05) the zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and Occludin expression. The apoptosis rate, Caspase3, Caspase9, BAD, and BCL-2/BAX were decreased (p < 0.05) after AOS treatment, and the expression of BCL-2 was increased (p < 0.05). In addition, the expressions of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) were inhibited (p < 0.05) with the addition of AOS. At the protein level, pretreatment of AOS decreased (p < 0.05) the expression of MyD88 and the phosphorylation level of inhibitor kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha) after the LPS challenge. Taken together, our results indicated that AOS could alleviate the LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammatory response of rumen epithelial cells through the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, which may be a promising strategy for treating apoptosis and inflammation in sheep breeding.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF), caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV), is one of the most important infectious diseases that cause high morbidity and mortality in pigs and substantial economic losses to the pork industry of affected countries due to the lack of effective vaccines. The need to develop alternative robust antiviral countermeasures, especially anti-ASFV agents, is of the utmost urgency. This study shows that fangchinoline (FAN), a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid found in the roots of Stephania tetrandra of the family Menispermaceae, significantly inhibits ASFV replication in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) at micromolar concentrations (IC50 = 1.66 mu M). Mechanistically, the infection of ASFV triggers the AKT/mTOR/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. FAN significantly inhibits ASFV-induced activation of such pathways, thereby suppressing viral replication. Such a mechanism was confirmed using an AKT inhibitor MK2206 as it inhibited AKT phosphorylation and ASFV replication in PAMs. Altogether, the results suggest that the AKT/mTOR pathway could potentially serve as a treatment strategy for combating ASFV infection and that FAN could potentially emerge as an effective novel antiviral agent against ASFV infections and deserves further in vivo antiviral evaluations.

AB  - Background: Fractalkine (CX3CL1) is a key chemokine, affects neuronal cell communication and involves in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Microvesicles (MVs) participate in neuronal cells' cross-talk in physiological and pathological states. Microvesicles released in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may provide a valuable footprint of brain changes. Little information is available regarding the release of fractalkine-positive MVs (CX3CL1+ -MVs) in the nervous system.Methods: We induced cognitive impairment by bilateral injection of amyloid-beta (A beta) into the cerebral ventricles. We analyzed the CSF by flow cytometry in two experiments (trained and untrained) to elucidate the presence of CX3CL1+ -MVs. The hippocampal TNF-alpha as an inflammatory factor was assessed by immunohistochemistry.Results: The A beta induced spatial memory impairment after two weeks, verified by a decrease in the escape latency in Morris water maze test. It caused an increase in the anxiety-like behaviors demonstrated by a decrease in entries into the open arms of elevated plus maze test. The A beta increased the percent of the positive area for TNF-alpha staining. Histological evaluation of the hippocampus confirmed the tissue injuries. The CSF levels of CX3CL1+ -MVs, increased 2 and 7 days after A beta injection. The A beta increased the TNF-alpha staining and provided an inflammatory context to facilitate the MVs release. The rise of CX3CL1+ -MVs was transient and subsided after two weeks. Both trained and untrained experiments showed a similar rise pattern of CX3CL1+ -MVs.Conclusion: Increase of fractalkine-positive microvesicles preceded the cognitive impairment, more studies are required to approve the CX3CL1+ -MVs as a potential biomarker in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the nervous system that affects older adults. Its main clinical manifestations include memory loss, cognitive dysfunction, abnormal behaviour, and social dysfunction. Neuroinflammation is typical in most neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. Therefore, suppressing inflammation may improve AD symptoms. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of Acanthopanax senticosus saponins (ASS) in an AD model induced by streptozotocin (STZ). Here, we characterised a rat model of STZ-induced AD with the parallel deterioration of memory loss and neuroinflammation. Following the end of the treatment with ASS (50 mg/kg for 14 consecutive days), behavioural tests (Morris water maze test, Y-maze test) were performed on the rat, and the molecular parameters (DAPK1, Tau5, p-Tau, NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and NLRP3) of the rat hippocampus were also assessed. We demonstrated that ASS, which has potent anti-inflammatory effects, can reduce neuroinflammation and prevent cognitive impairment. In the water maze test, ASS-treated groups exhibited significantly increased average escape latency (p < 0.05), the percentage of stay in the target quadrant (p < 0.05), and the number of times each group of rats crossed the platform (p < 0.05) compared to the negative control. And ASS could reduce the phosphorylation of the Tau protein (p < 0.001) and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1, p < 0.001) in the hippocampal tissue, improving cognitive impairment in STZ-treated rats by suppressing the inflammatory response; the molecular analysis showed a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory markers like NLRP3, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappa B (p < 0.001). It was also discovered that the NF-kappa B inhibitor SN50 had the same effect. Therefore, the present study used ASS through its anti-inflammatory effects to prevent and treat AD. This study highlights the potential efficacy of ASS in alleviating cognitive dysfunction in AD.

AB  - In mammals, the circadian system controls various physiological processes to maintain metabolism, behavior, and immune function during a daily 24 h cycle. Although driven by a cell-autonomous core clock in the hypothalamus, rhythmic activities are entrained to external cues, such as environmental lighting conditions. Exposure to artificial light at night (ALAN) can cause circadian disruption and thus is linked to an increased occurrence of civilization diseases in modern society. Moreover, alterations of circadian rhythms and dysregulation of immune responses, including inflammasome activation, are common attributes of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer', Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. Although there is evidence that the inflammasome in the hippocampus is activated by stress, the direct effect of circadian disruption on inflammasome activation remains poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to analyze whether exposure to constant light (LL) affects inflammasome activation in the mouse hippocampus. In addition to decreased circadian power and reduced locomotor activity, we found cleaved caspase 1 significantly elevated in the hippocampus of mice exposed to LL. However, we did not find hallmarks of inflammasome priming or cleavage of pro-interleukins. These findings suggest that acute circadian disruption leads to an assembled "ready to start" inflammasome, which may turn the brain more vulnerable to additional aversive stimuli.

AB  - According to various reports, current methods of sperm freezing destroy the integrity of the sperm plasma membrane and acrosome. This study aimed to determine the changes in the existence and location of three proteins, namely fertilin beta, IZUMO1, and P34H, in ram spermatozoa. By using frozen-thawed spermatozoa, ejaculated fresh spermatozoa, and testicular and epididymal spermatozoa (obtained from caput, corpus, and caudal regions), the localizations of the mentioned proteins were performed using signal labeling with indirect immunofluorescence, and the quantification of these proteins was compared using Western blot analyses. Moreover, protein localization and signal labeling in fresh and frozen-thawed spermatozoa subjected to in vitro capacitation and acrosome reaction were compared. Using chlortetracycline (CTC) staining, as expected, it was detected that after incubating for 4 hours under capacitating conditions related to the control sample (0 hour), capacitated and acrosome-reacted sperm were increased (p < 0.001). Frozen-thawed samples had a lower density and expression than the ejaculate samples. Expression was not obtained, except for IZUMO1, from samples that underwent in vitro capacitation/acrosome reactions. Expression of IZUMO1 was seen as an increasing band formation from the equatorial region through the acrosome, after in vitro capacitation. However, after the acrosome reaction, the band formation was only on the equatorial region. Region-specific differences of proteins at the kDa level were obtained using Western blot analysis and possible isoforms specific to ram spermatozoa or proteins with similar epitopes were expressed. Considering the changes in surface proteins in frozen-thawed sperm, it is suggested that fertilin beta and P34H can be used as fertility or freezability markers.

AB  - The ADAMTS superfamily is composed of secreted metalloproteases and structurally related non-catalytic ADAMTS-like proteins. A subset of this superfamily, including ADAMTS6, ADAMTS10 and ADAMTSL2, are involved in elastic fiber assembly and bind to fibrillin and other matrix molecules that regulate the extracellular bioavailability of the potent growth factor TGF beta. Fibrillinopathies, that can also result from mutation of these ADAMTS/L proteins, have been linked to disrupted TGF beta homeostasis. ADAMTS6 and ADAMTS10 are homologous metalloproteases with poorly characterized substrates where ADAMTS10 is thought to process fibrillin-2 and ADAMTS6 latent TGF beta-binding protein (LTBP)-1. In order to understand the contribution of ADAMTS6, and these other members of the ADAMTS/L family, to TGF beta homeostasis, we have analyzed the effects of ADAMTS6, ADAMTS10 and ADAMTSL2 expression on TGF beta activation. We found that their expression increases TGF beta activation in a dose dependent manner, following stimulation with mature TGF beta 1. For ADAMTS6, the catalytically active protease is required for effective TGF beta activation, where ADAMTS6 cleaves LTBP3 as well as LTBP1, and binds to the large latent TGF beta complexes of LTBP1 and LTBP3. Furthermore, ADAMTS6 expression increases the mechanotension of cells which results in inactivation of the Hippo Pathway, resulting in an increased translocation of YAP/TAZ complex to the nucleus. Together these findings suggest that when the balance of TGF beta is perturbed ADAMTS6 can influence TGF beta activation via two mechanisms. It directly cleaves the latent TGF beta complexes and also acts indirectly, along with ADAMTS10 and ADAMTSL2, by altering the mechanotension of cells. Together this increases activation of TGF beta from large latent complexes which may contribute to disease pathogenesis.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Oil-Camellia (Camellia oleifera), belonging to the Theaceae family Camellia, is an important woody edible oil tree species. The Camellia oil in its mature seed kernels, mainly consists of more than 90% unsaturated fatty acids, tea polyphenols, flavonoids, squalene and other active substances, which is one of the best quality edible vegetable oils in the world. However, genetic research and molecular breeding on oil-Camellia are challenging due to its complex genetic background. Here, we successfully report a chromosome-scale genome assembly for a hexaploid oil-Camellia cultivar Changlin40. This assembly contains 8.80 Gb genomic sequences with scaffold N50 of 180.0 Mb and 45 pseudochromosomes comprising 15 homologous groups with three members each, which contain 135 868 genes with an average length of 3936 bp. Referring to the diploid genome, intragenomic and intergenomic comparisons of synteny indicate homologous chromosomal similarity and changes. Moreover, comparative and evolutionary analyses reveal three rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) events, as well as the possible diversification of hexaploid Changlin40 with diploid occurred approximately 9.06 million years ago (MYA). Furthermore, through the combination of genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches, a complex regulatory network was constructed and allows to identify potential key structural genes (SAD, FAD2 and FAD3) and transcription factors (AP2 and C2H2) that regulate the metabolism of Camellia oil, especially for unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis. Overall, the genomic resource generated from this study has great potential to accelerate the research for the molecular biology and genetic improvement of hexaploid oil-Camellia, as well as to understand polyploid genome evolution.

AB  - Neurogenesis is the process of generating new neurons from neural stem cells (NSCs) and plays a crucial role in neurological diseases. The process involves a series of steps, including NSC proliferation, migration and differentiation, which are regulated by multiple pathways such as neurotrophic Trk and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) signalling. Despite the discovery of numerous compounds capable of modulating individual stages of neurogenesis, it remains challenging to identify an agent that can regulate multiple cellular processes of neurogenesis. Here, through screening of bioactive compounds in dietary functional foods, we identified a flavonoid chrysin that not only enhanced the human NSCs proliferation but also facilitated neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth. Further mechanistic study revealed the effect of chrysin was attenuated by inhibition of neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase-B (TrkB) receptor. Consistently, chrysin activated TrkB and downstream ERK1/2 and AKT. Intriguingly, we found that the effect of chrysin was also reduced by FGFR1 blockade. Moreover, extended treatment of chrysin enhanced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, as well as FGF1 and FGF8. Finally, chrysin was found to promote neurogenesis in human cerebral organoids by increasing the organoid expansion and folding, which was also mediated by TrkB and FGFR1 signalling. To conclude, our study indicates that activating both TrkB and FGFR1 signalling could be a promising avenue for therapeutic interventions in neurological diseases, and chrysin appears to be a potential candidate for the development of such treatments.
   In this study, we found a dietary flavonoid, chrysin, cooperatively activated tropomyosin receptor kinase-B and FGFR1 signalling with up-regulation of their endogenous ligands to promote human neurogenesis. image

AB  - Lignosus rhinocerotis is rich in polysaccharide with diverse bioactivities. This study developed a pre-column derivatization reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method for analyzing monosaccharides in Lignosus rhinocerotis polysaccharides (LRP). LRP underwent hydrolysis, derivatization, and separation on a Cosmosil 5C18-MS-II column at 254 nm. Baseline separation of eight standard monosaccharides was achieved within 45 min. Calibration curves, precision, and accuracy were validated. Quantitative analysis revealed LRP as a heteropolysaccharide containing mannose, ribose, rhamnose, glucose, galactose, xylose, and arabinose, with 100.28-111.02% recovery. This optimized RP-HPLC offers a simple, reproducible, and accurate tool for LRP monosaccharides analysis, facilitating in understanding its structure-function relationship.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most economically important pathogens in the global swine industry over the past three decades. There is no licensed antiviral medication that can effectively control this infection. In the present study, the structure of SP-1 isolated and purified from Sargassum weizhouense was analyzed, and its antioxidant capacity and antiviral effect in MARC-145 cells against PRRSV were investigated. The results showed that SP-1 is a novel polysaccharide which mainly is composed of -> 4)-beta-D-ManpA-(1 ->, -> 4)-alpha-L-GulpA-(1 -> and a small amount of -> 4)-beta-D-GalpA-(1 ->. PRRSV adsorption, replication, and release were all suppressed by SP-1. SP-1 therapy down-regulated mRNA expression of the CD163 receptor while increasing the antioxidant gene expression of Nrf2, TXNIP, and HO-1; increasing the protein expression of NQO1 and HO-1; and drastically reducing the protein expression of p-p65. The findings indicated that SP-1 reduces PRRSV adsorption, replication, and release through blocking the expression of the crucial CD163 receptor during infection. Meanwhile, SP-1 exerts antioxidant effects in PRRSV-infected cells through the activation of the Nrf2-HO1 signaling pathway.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the impact of Clostridium butyricum probiotic feed additive on sow and piglet performances, together with alterations in the lipidomic and metabolomic profiles of sow milk. Sixty-four Landrace x Yorkshire crossbred sows and 794 piglets were included. Sows were divided into two groups; i.e., (i) conventional gestation diet (control; n = 35) and (ii) conventional diet added with 10 g/sow/day of probiotic C. butyricum spores (treatment; n = 29) from one week before the estimated farrowing day until weaning (29.6 +/- 4.8 days). The sow and piglet performances and incidence of piglet diarrhea were recorded. Changes in gross chemical composition, fatty acid and non-volatile polar metabolite profiles of sow colostrum, transient milk and mature milk were evaluated. The results showed that relative backfat loss in the treatment group (-2.3%) was significantly lower than in control group (11.6%), especially in primiparous sows (p = 0.019). The application of C. butyricum probiotics in sows significantly reduced the incidence of diarrhea in piglets (p < 0.001) but no other effect on piglet performance was found. Lipidomic and metabolomic analyses revealed variations in sow colostrum and milk biomolecular profiles, with indicative compounds significantly altered by feeding with the C. butyricum probiotics. In conclusion, the use of C. butyricum probiotics in sows may improve sow body condition and reduce diarrhea incidence in piglets, with underlying changes in milk composition that warrant further investigation. These findings support the potential of C. butyricum as a beneficial feed additive in swine production.

AB  - Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) is a novel clinical condition characterized by memory, learning, and motor function deficits. Oxidative stress and inflammation are potential factors contributing to chemotherapy's adverse effects on the brain. Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) has been proven effective in neuroinflammation and reversal of memory impairment. The research aims to evaluate the memory protective effect of sEH inhibitor and dual inhibitor of sEH and COX and compare its impact with herbal extracts with known nootropic activity in an animal model of CICI. In vitro sEH, the inhibitory activity of hydroalcoholic extracts of Sizygium aromaticum, Nigella sativa, and Mesua ferrea was tested on murine and human sEH enzyme as per the protocol, and IC50 was determined. Cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg), methotrexate (5 mg/kg), and fluorouracil (5 mg/kg) combination (CMF) were administered intraperitoneally to induce CICI. The known herbal sEH inhibitor, Lepidium meyenii and the dual inhibitor of COX and sEH (PTUPB) were tested for their protective effect in the CICI model. The herbal formulation with known nootropic activity viz Bacopa monnieri and commercial formulation (Mentat) were also used to compare the efficacy in the CICI model. Behavioral parameter such as cognitive function was assessed by Morris Water Maze besides investigating oxidative stress (GSH and LPO) and inflammatory (TNFa, IL-6, BDNF and COX-2) markers in the brain. CMF-induced CICI, which was associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain. However, treatment with PTUPB or herbal extracts inhibiting sEH preserved spatial memory via ameliorating oxidative stress and inflammation. S. aromaticum and N. sativa inhibited COX2, but M. Ferrea did not affect COX2 activity. Lepidium meyenii was the least effective, and mentat showed superior activity over Bacopa monnieri in preserving memory. Compared to untreated animals, the mice treated with PTUPB or hydroalcoholic extracts showed a discernible improvement in cognitive function in CICI.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The pseudorabies virus (PRV) causes severe and fatal acute respiratory disease in pigs. During PRV proliferation, the enzyme deoxyuridine 5 '-triphosphate nucleotide hydrolase (dUTPase) plays a pivotal role in maintaining a low dUTP/dTTP ratio, thereby ensuring the accuracy of viral DNA replication. However, its structure and catalytic mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report the crystal structure of PRV dUTPase at a 2.24 & Aring; resolution and demonstrate an unprecedented dimeric architecture, with a conserved enzyme activity center of the herpesvirus family. The enzyme activity center is located in a cavity between the two domains, forming a pocket for binding substrate dUMP and magnesium ions. Remarkably, the exquisite interface of the dimer is primarily composed of four antiparallel beta-sheets, which form 11 hydrogen bonds between the residues P33-V36 and R242-A248 to maintain protein stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that dUTPase exists as a dimer in the herpesvirus family. These findings not only present a novel fold dimeric structure but also deepen the scope of our comprehension of structural diversity in dUTPase family.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Jiawei-Xiaoyao Pill (JWX), a classic formula in traditional Chinese medicine, is derived from Xiaoyao Pill by adding significant amounts of Gardeniae Fructus (GF) and Moutan Cortex (MC). It is frequently used for the treatment of depression. JWX has been demonstrated to uniquely elicit rapid antidepressant-like effects within the prescribed dosage range. To date, GF has been shown to have rapid antidepressant-like effects, but a much higher dose is required than its proportion in JWX. It is assumed that the synergism of GF with a minimum number of other herbs in JWX serves as a refined formula that exerts these rapid antidepressant-like effects. Identification of a refined formula is important for prioritizing the herbs and ingredients to optimize the quality control of JWX. However, such a refined formula for JWX has not been identified yet. Aim of the study: Here we aimed to identify a refined formula derived from JWX for optimized rapid antidepressant-like effects. Since the neuroinflammation mechanism involving in depression treatment has not been previously investigated for JWX, we tested the mechanism for both JWX and the refined formula. Materials and methods: Individual herbs (MC; ASR, Angelica Sinensis Radix; ; Bupleuri Radix; ; Paeonia Radix Alba) ) that show antidepressant-like responses were mixed with GF at the proportional dosage in JWX to identify the refined formula. Rapid antidepressant-like effects were assessed by using NSF (Novelty Suppressed Feeding Test) and other behavioral tests following a single administration. The identified formula was further tested in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive model, and the molecular signaling mechanisms were investigated using Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, and pharmacological inhibition of mTOR signaling. Scopolamine (Scop) was used as a positive control for induction of rapid antidepressant effects. Results: A combination of GF, MC and ASR (GMA) at their dosages proportional to JWX induced behavioral signs of rapid antidepressant-like responses in both normal and LPS-treated mice, with the antidepressant-like effects sustained for 5 d. Similar to JWX or Scop, GMA rapidly reduced the neuroinflammation signaling of Iba-1-NF-& kcy;B, & kcy;B, enhanced neuroplasticity signaling of CaMKII-mTOR-BDNF, and attenuated the upregulated expressions of the NMDAR sub-units GluN1 and GluN2B in the hippocampus of LPS-treated mice. GMA, JWX and Scop rapidly restored the number of BDNF-positive cells reduced by LPS treatment in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Furthermore, rapamycin, a selective inhibitor of mTOR, blunted the rapid antidepressant-like effects and hippocampal BDNF signaling upregulation by GMA. Conclusion: GMA may serve as a refined formula from JWX, capable of inducing rapid antidepressant-like effects. In the LPS-induced depression model, the effects of GMA were mediated via rapidly alleviating neuroinflammation and enhancing neuroplasticity.

AB  - Amyloid plaques, one of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are classified into diffuse (associated with cognitive impairment) and dense-core types (a common finding in brains of people without Alzheimer's disease (non-AD) and without impaired cognitive function) based on their morphology. We tried to determine the usability of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture parameters of homogeneity and heterogeneity for the differentiation of amyloid plaque images obtained from AD and non-AD individuals. Images of amyloid-beta (A beta) immunostained brain tissue samples were obtained from the Aging, Dementia and Traumatic Brain Injury Project. A total of 1,039 plaques were isolated from different brain regions of 69 AD and non-AD individuals and used for further GLCM analysis. Images of A beta stained plaques show higher values of heterogeneity parameters and lower values of homogeneity parameters in AD patients, and vice versa in non-AD patients. Additionally, GLCM analysis shows differences in A beta plaque texture between different brain regions in non-AD patients and correlates with variables that characterize patient's dementia status. The present study shows that GLCM texture analysis is an efficient method to discriminate between different types of amyloid plaques based on their morphology and thus can prove as a valuable tool in the neuropathological investigation of dementia.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) caused by the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is the most devastating disease in the global pig industry due to its high mortality rate in piglets. The host factors critical for PEDV replication are poorly understood. Here, we designed a pooled African green monkey genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (VeroCKO) library containing 75,608 single guide RNAs targeting 18,993 protein-coding genes. Subsequently, we use the VeroCKO library to identify key host factors facilitating PEDV infection in Vero E6 cells. Several previously unreported genes associated with PEDV infection are highly enriched post-PEDV selection. We discovered that knocking out the tripartite motif 2 (TRIM2) and the solute carrier family 35 member A1 (SLC35A1) inhibited PEDV replication. Virtual screening and molecular docking approaches showed that chem-80,048,685 (M2) s ignificantly inhibited PEDV attachment and late replication by impeding SLC35A1. Furthermore, we found that knocking out SLC35A1 in Vero E6 cells upregulated a disintegrin and metalloprotease protein-17 (ADAM17) by splicing porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) ectodomains to reduce PEDV-infection in a CMP-Sialic Acid (CMP-SA) cell entry-independent manner. These findings provide a new perspective for a better understanding of host-pathogen interactions and new therapeutic targets for PEDV infection.

AB  - Simple Summary In intelligent agriculture, non-contact, automatic body size measurement is widely used for livestock. However, the common measurement methods based on the whole point cloud are complex and prone to errors because of the positions of the cattle. To measure the body sizes of livestock more accurately, a cattle body measuring system is proposed. The system includes a new algorithm called dynamic unbalanced octree grouping (DUOS), based on PointNet++, and an efficient method of body size measurement based on segmentation results. The network divides the cow into the following seven parts: body length, withers height, hip height, thoracic circumference, abdominal circumference, and cannon circumference. Compared with some of the other models, the system has higher segmentation accuracy and lower measurement errors. The system can be widely applied in the non-contact body measurement of livestock; in addition, it can increase efficiency and reduce costs. It also has broad prospects in the intelligent livestock industry.Abstract The common non-contact, automatic body size measurement methods based on the whole livestock point cloud are complex and prone to errors. Therefore, a cattle body measuring system is proposed. The system includes a new algorithm called dynamic unbalanced octree grouping (DUOS), based on PointNet++, and an efficient method of body size measurement based on segmentation results. This system is suitable for livestock body feature sampling. The network divides the cow into seven parts, including the body and legs. Moreover, the key points of body size are located in the different parts. It combines density measurement, point cloud slicing, contour extraction, point cloud repair, etc. A total of 137 items of cattle data are collected. Compared with some of the other models, the DUOS algorithm improves the accuracy of the segmentation task and mean intersection by 0.53% and 1.21%, respectively. Moreover, compared with the manual measurement results, the relative errors of the experimental measurement results are as follows: withers height, 1.18%; hip height, 1.34%; body length, 2.52%; thoracic circumference, 2.12%; abdominal circumference, 2.26%; and cannon circumference, 2.78%. In summary, the model is proven to have a good segmentation effect on cattle bodies and is suitable for cattle body size measurement.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this work was to synthesize a new amide derivative of betulinic acid-N-[1-(1-adamantyl)ethyl]-3-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-28-amide, containing in the structure the pharmacophoric 1-(1-adamantyl)ethylamine group (active substance of the antiviral drug Rimantadine) and to evaluate its antiviral action in vitro and in vivo. Methods: modification of betulinic acid was carried out by the interaction of betulinic acid with 1-(adamantan-1-yl)ethan-1-amine hydrochloride through the stage of in situ (without isolation) production of the corresponding betulinic acid chloride with thionyl chloride in a solution of dimethylformamide in the presence of potash. At the initial stage of the study, the antiviral activity of the drug was determined in vitro in 96-well immunological plates with a freshly obtained culture of peripheral blood lymphocytes from a cow with leukemia, onto which different concentrations of the studied substance were layered in one row of wells, and rimantadine hydrochloride in another row with a dilution factor of 1 : 2 (from 1000 to 0.48 mu g/mL) and subjected to 24 h incubation in a thermostat, followed by direct immunofluorescence reaction (DIF). Then an in vivo experiment was conducted on agouti guinea pigs (n = 25). Animals of the experimental groups (n = 5) were infected intraperitoneally with a cell suspension of lymphocytes isolated from a cow sick with leukemia, and then the substance was administered subcutaneously: group 1-once 2 h before infection at a dose of 40 mu g/mg; group 2-twice at the same dose (2 h before and on the 7th day after infection); group 3-three times at the same dose (2 h before and on the 7th and 14th days after inoculation of the viral suspension); Group 4 did not receive the drug (positive control). Animals of the control group (n = 5) were administered physiological saline. Results and Discussion: The structure of the synthesized N-[1-(1-adamantyl)ethyl]-3-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-28-amide was proven using 1H, 13C NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry. It was found that the minimum inhibitory dose of the substance was 31.2 mu g/mL, as evidenced by the absence of specific luminescence of the antigen-antibody complex on 3-4 pluses in the in vitro experiment taking into account the DIF. At the same time, rimantadine did not have an inhibitory effect on the bovine leukemia virus. Based on the results of in vivo diagnostic studies in direct and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and PCR, it was shown that the drug demonstrated the highest anti-leukemic activity in the 2nd and 3rd groups of guinea pigs, in which after 2-3-fold administration of the test substance, positive samples were noted in only 20% of animals by the 150th day from the start of the experiment. Conclusions: Based on the diagnostic studies, it can be concluded that the compound N-[1-(1-adamantyl)ethyl]-3-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-28-amide had a pronounced inhibitory effect on the bovine leukemia virus both in a freshly obtained culture of peripheral blood lymphocytes from a cow with leukemia and in the body of guinea pigs experimentally infected with BLV. The positive results obtained suggest its possible use in the field of veterinary medicine, virology and pharmacology for the prevention of the development and treatment of the clinical and hematological form of lymphoid leukemia in animals spontaneously infected with the bovine leukemia virus.

AB  - Excess dietary fructose is a major public health concern, yet little is known about its influence on offspring development and later-life disease when consumed in excess during pregnancy. To determine whether increased maternal fructose intake could have long-term consequences on offspring health, we investigated the effects of 10% w/v fructose water intake during preconception and pregnancy in guinea pigs. Female Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs were fed a control diet (CD) or fructose diet (FD; providing 16% of total daily caloric intake) ad libitum 60 days prior to mating and throughout gestation. Dietary interventions ceased at day of delivery. Offspring were culled at day 21 (D21) (weaning) and at 4 months (4 M) (young adult). Fetal exposure to excess maternal fructose intake significantly increased male and female triglycerides at D21 and 4 M and circulating palmitoleic acid and total omega-7 through day 0 (D0) to 4 M. Proteomic and functional analysis of significantly differentially expressed proteins revealed that FD offspring (D21 and 4 M) had significantly increased mitochondrial metabolic activities of beta-oxidation, electron transport chain (ETC) and oxidative phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species production compared to the CD offspring. Western blotting analysis of both FD offspring validated the increased protein abundances of mitochondrial ETC complex II and IV, SREBP-1c and FAS, whereas VDAC1 expression was higher at D21 but lower at 4 M. We provide evidence demonstrating offspring programmed hepatic mitochondrial metabolism and de novo lipogenesis following excess maternal fructose exposure. These underlying asymptomatic programmed pathways may lead to a predisposition to metabolic dysfunction later in life.

AB  - RAD18 is a conserved eukaryotic E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes genome stability through multiple pathways. One of these is gap-filling DNA synthesis at active replication forks and in post-replicative DNA. RAD18 also regulates homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA breaks; however, the current literature describing the contribution of RAD18 to HR in mammalian systems has not reached a consensus. To investigate this, we examined three independent RAD18-null human cell lines. Our analyses found that loss of RAD18 in HCT116, but neither hTERT RPE-1 nor DLD1 cell lines, resulted in elevated sister chromatid exchange, gene conversion, and gene targeting, i.e., HCT116 mutants were hyper-recombinogenic (hyper-rec). Interestingly, these phenotypes were linked to RAD18's role in PCNA K164 ubiquitination, as HCT116 PCNAK164R/+ mutants were also hyper-rec, consistent with previous studies in rad18-/- and pcnaK164R avian DT40 cells. Importantly, the knockdown of UBC9 to prevent PCNA K164 SUMOylation did not affect hyper-recombination, strengthening the link between increased recombination and RAD18-catalyzed PCNA K164 ubiquitination, but not K164 SUMOylation. We propose that the hierarchy of post-replicative repair and HR, intrinsic to each cell type, dictates whether RAD18 is required for suppression of hyper-recombination and that this function is linked to PCNA K164 ubiquitination.

AB  - The potential therapeutic benefit of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) encapsulated in an injectable hydrogel for stimulating intervertebral disc (IVD) regeneration has been assessed by a number of translational and preclinical studies. However, previous work has been primarily limited to small animal models and short-term outcomes of only a few weeks. Long-term studies in representative large animal models are crucial for translation into clinical success, especially for permanent stabilization of major defects such as disc herniation. An injectable chitosan carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel scaffold loaded with ASCs was evaluated regarding its intraoperative handling, crosslinking kinetics, cell viability, fully-crosslinked viscoelasticity, and long-term therapeutic effects in an ovine model. Three IVDs per animal were damaged in 10 sheep. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was the source for autologous ASCs. Six weeks after IVD damage, two of the damaged IVDs were treated via ASC-loaded hydrogel injection. After 12 months following the implantation, IVD disc height and histological and cellular changes were assessed. This system was reliable and easy to handle intraoperatively. Over 12 months, IVD height was stabilized and degeneration progression significantly mitigated compared to untreated, damaged IVDs. Here we show for the first time in a large animal model that an injectable chitosan carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel system with encapsulated ASCs is able to affect long-term stabilization of an injured IVD and significantly decrease degeneration processes as compared to controls.

AB  - Background and aim The appearance of alterations in normal metabolic activity has been increasingly considered a risk factor for the development of sporadic and late-onset neurodegenerative diseases. In this report, we induced chronic metabolic stress by feeding of a high-fat diet (HFD) in order to study its consequences in cognition. We also studied the effects of a loss of function of isoforms 1 and 3 of the c-Jun N-terminal Kinases (JNK), stress and cell death response elements. Methods Animals were fed either with conventional chow or with HFD, from their weaning until their sacrifice at 9 months. Before sacrifice, body weight, intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance test (IP-GTT and IP-ITT) were performed to evaluate peripheral biometrics. Additionally, cognitive behavioral tests and analysis of spine density were performed to assess cognitive function. Molecular studies were carried out to confirm the effects of metabolic stressors in the hippocampus relative to cognitive loss. Results Our studies demonstrated that HFD in Jnk3(-/-) lead to synergetic responses. Loss of function of JNK3 led to increased body weight, especially when exposed to an HFD and they had significantly decreased response to insulin. These mice also showed increased stress in the endoplasmic reticulum and diminished cognitive capacity. However, loss of function of JNK1 promoted normal or heightened energetic metabolism and preserved cognitive function even when chronically metabolically stressed. Conclusions Downregulation of JNK3 does not seem to be a suitable target for the modulation of energetic-cognitive dysregulations while loss of function of JNK1 seems to promote a good metabolic-cognitive profile, just like resistance to the negative effects of chronic feeding with HFD.

AB  - Reactive astrocytes are associated with neuroinflammation and cognitive decline in diverse neuropathologies; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We used optogenetic and chemogenetic tools to identify the crucial roles of the hippocampal CA1 astrocytes in cognitive decline. Our results showed that repeated optogenetic stimulation of the hippocampal CA1 astrocytes induced cognitive impairment in mice and decreased synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP), which was accompanied by the appearance of inflammatory astrocytes. Mechanistic studies conducted using knockout animal models and hippocampal neuronal cultures showed that lipocalin-2 (LCN2), derived from reactive astrocytes, mediated neuroinflammation and induced cognitive impairment by decreasing the LTP through the reduction of neuronal NMDA receptors. Sustained chemogenetic stimulation of hippocampal astrocytes provided similar results. Conversely, these phenomena were attenuated by a metabolic inhibitor of astrocytes. Fiber photometry using GCaMP revealed a high level of hippocampal astrocyte activation in the neuroinflammation model. Our findings suggest that reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus are sufficient and required to induce cognitive decline through LCN2 release and synaptic modulation. This abnormal glial-neuron interaction may contribute to the pathogenesis of cognitive disturbances in neuroinflammation-associated brain conditions.

AB  - COVID-19 causes more than million deaths worldwide. Although much is understood about the immunopathogenesis of the lung disease, a lot remains to be known on the neurological impact of COVID-19. Here, we evaluated immunometabolic changes using astrocytes in vitro and dissected brain areas of SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters. We show that SARS-CoV-2 alters proteins of carbon metabolism, glycolysis, and synaptic transmission, many of which are altered in neurological diseases. Real-time respirometry evidenced hyperactivation of glycolysis, further confirmed by metabolomics, with intense consumption of glucose, pyruvate, glutamine, and alpha ketoglutarate. Consistent with glutamine reduction, the blockade of glutaminolysis impaired viral replication and inflammatory response in vitro. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in vivo in hippocampus, cortex, and olfactory bulb of intranasally infected animals. Our data evidence an imbalance in important metabolic molecules and neurotransmitters in infected astrocytes. We suggest this may correlate with the neurological impairment observed during COVID-19, as memory loss, confusion, and cognitive impairment.

AB  - The ability to abstract information to guide decisions during navigation across changing environments is essential for adaptation and requires the integrity of the hippocampal-prefrontal circuitry. The hippocampus encodes navigational information in a cognitive map, but it remains unclear how cognitive maps are trans-formed across hippocampal-prefrontal circuits to support abstraction and generalization. Here, we simulta-neously record hippocampal-prefrontal ensembles as rats generalize navigational rules across distinct environments. We find that, whereas hippocampal representational maps maintain specificity of separate environments, prefrontal maps generalize across environments. Furthermore, while both maps are struc-tured within a neural manifold of population activity, they have distinct representational geometries. Prefron-tal geometry enables abstraction of rule-informative variables, a representational format that generalizes to novel conditions of existing variable classes. Hippocampal geometry lacks such abstraction. Together, these findings elucidate how cognitive maps are structured into distinct geometric representations to support abstraction and generalization while maintaining memory specificity.

AB  - Depression and anxiety disorders have their pathophysiologies linked to inflammation and oxidative stress. In this context, celecoxib (CLX) and etoricoxib (ETR) inhibit cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), an enzyme expressed by cells involved in the inflammatory process and found in the brain. Studies have been using CLX as a possible drug in the treatment of depression, although its mechanisms at the central nervous system level are not fully elucidated. In this study, the effects of CLX and ETR on behavioral, oxidative, and inflammatory changes induced by systemic exposure to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were evaluated in adult male swiss mice. For ten days, the animals received intraperitoneal injections of LPS at 0.5 mg/kg. From the sixth to the tenth day, one hour after LPS exposure, they were treated orally with CLX (15 mg/kg), ETR (10 mg/kg), or fluoxetine (FLU) (20 mg/kg). Twenty-four hours after the last oral administration, the animals underwent evaluation of locomotor activity (open field test), predictive tests for depressive-like behavior (forced swim and tail suspension tests), and anxiolytic-like effect (elevated plus maze and hole board tests). Subsequently, the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum were dissected for the measurement of oxidative and nitrosative parameters (malondialdehyde, nitrite, and glutathione) and quantification of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-6). LPS induced depressive and anxious-like behavior, and treatment with CLX or ETR was able to reverse most of the behavioral changes. It was evidenced that nitrosative stress and the degree of lipid peroxidation induced by LPS were reduced in different brain areas after treatment with the drugs, as well as the endogenous defense system against free radicals was strengthened. CLX and ETR also significantly reduced LPS-induced cytokine levels. These data are expected to expand information on the role of inflammation in depression and anxiety and provide insights into possible mechanisms of COX-2 inhibitors in psychiatric disorders with a neurobiological basis in inflammation and oxidative stress.

AB  - Serotonin(5-HT)ergic projections run from the raphe nuclei to dopamin(DA)ergic cells in substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) and to the terminal fields of DA neurons in nucleus accumbens, caudateputamen and neocortex. In the present studies, we assessed the effect of the 5-HT1A receptor (R) antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclohexanecarbox-amide maleate (WAY-100635) on motor and exploratory behaviors and on D2/3R binding in the rat brain with in vivo imaging methods. D2/3R binding was determined in the same animals after systemic application of WAY-100635 (0.4 mg/kg) and 0.9% saline (SAL), respectively, with [I-123]IBZM as SPECT ligand. Anatomical information for the delineation of the target regions was obtained with dedicated small animal MRI. Immediately after treatment with WAY-100635 or SAL, motor/exploratory behaviors were assessed for 30 min in two different batches of animals in an open field. WAY-100635 reduced D2/3R binding in caudateputamen, thalamus, frontal cortex, parietal cortex and ventral hippocampus relative to SAL. Network analysis of regional binding data after WAY-100635 yielded positive connections between (1) caudateputamen and substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area, (2) caudateputamen and ventral hippocampus, (3) substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area and parietal cortex, (4) thalamus and dorsal hippocampus and (5) frontal cortex and parietal cortex, which were not present after SAL. Moreover, WAY-100635 decreased parameters of motor activity (overall activity, ambulation duration and frequency) but increased the duration of grooming behavior relative to SAL. The effect on exploration was time-dependent with an early increase and a subsequent decrease of behavioral parameters (rearing duration and frequency, frequency of head-shoulder motility). For WAY-100635, findings imply a region-specificity as well as a time-dependency of DAergic action.

AB  - Serendipita indica (S.i.) exhibits mycorrhizal fungus-like characteristics, while it is unclear how S.i. improves root growth of tea seedlings at low phosphorus (P) levels. This study investigated the effects of S.i. on biomass production, auxin and cytokinin levels, root P levels, soil Olsen-P levels, soil phosphatase activities, and root P transporter (PT) gene expression in tea (Camellia sinensis) seedlings at normal (50 mM P) and low (0.5 mM P) P levels. S.i. colonized tea roots. S.i. inoculation significantly increased shoot and root biomass production at low and normal P levels, as well as root indolebutyric acid, isopentenyladenine, and trans-zetin levels at low P levels. Furthermore, S.i. inoculation significantly raised root P and soil Olsen-P levels at low and normal P levels, accompanied with an increase in soil acid and neutral phosphatase activities at low P levels. S.i. inoculation increased root CsPT1 expression at low P levels. In summary, S.i. can be considered as a biostimulant to improve tea growth and root P acquisition at low P levels.

AB  - We evaluated the effects of supplementation with catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) antioxidants, isolated or combined, on the freezability of collared peccary sperm. Semen aliquots from ten individuals were diluted in Tris-yolk with or without the presence of antioxidants CAT (200 or 400 IU/mL) and SOD (150 or 300 IU/mL) alone or in combination (CAT: 200 IU/mL + SOD: 150 IU/mL), and then cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C). After 1 week, samples were thawed and evaluated for kinetic parameters, membrane functionality and integrity, mitochondrial activity, chromatin integrity, sperm morphology, sperm cell binding capacity and intracellular oxidative levels. Regardless of the use of antioxidants, the treatments did not differ in any of the evaluated parameters, except for the treatment with 300 IU/mL SOD, which showed the highest percentage of static cells (69.1 +/- 4.4%) when compared to the group without antioxidant (51.6 +/- 3.3%). In general, all samples maintained around 50% of functional membranes, 40% of intact membranes with mitochondrial activity, more than 99% of cells with condensed chromatin, as well as more than 70% of morphologically normal cells. Regarding the binding capacity, the minimum and maximum values found ranged from 33.8 to 194 spermatozoa bound to the perivitelline membrane. Finally, regardless of the presence of antioxidants, all thawed groups showed similar levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In conclusion, supplementation with CAT or SOD antioxidants, at the tested concentrations, does not bring benefits to freezability, and the increase in SOD concentration resulted in negative effects on sperm motility in collared peccary semen.

AB  - Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant mental health problem, with prolonged usage potentially resulting in tolerance, addiction and cognitive decline, including learning and memory deficiency. At present, pharmacotherapy serves as the primary treatment approach for OUD. However, despite its status as a cornerstone of treatment, pharmacotherapy has certain limitations, thereby mandating the exploration of alternative modalities. This study evaluated the efficacy of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) in multiple cognitive domains in morphine-withdrawn rats. To induce morphine dependence, the rats were administered 10 mg/kg morphine for 10 consecutive days. taVNS was administered to the left ear of each rat and continued for 2 weeks. After electrical stimulation, various cognitive and emotional functions were assessed through related behavioural tasks, including open field, Y-maze, novel object recognition and elevated plus maze tests. GFAP, Iba1 and BDNF expression levels in the hippocampus were determined via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Our investigation revealed that taVNS ameliorated the impairment of working and recognition memory induced by morphine in behavioural tests. Additionally, it exerts an anxiolytic effect. Moreover, taVNS counteracted the decreased concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and elevated levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) caused by morphine. Nonetheless, taVNS applied only at a frequency of 100 Hz has the potential to lower Iba1 levels independently of prior exposure to morphine. taVNS has been shown to exert a neuroprotective effect on morphine-withdrawn rats. This outcome indicates that taVNS can be employed as a supplementary therapy with other pharmacological interventions for OUD.

AB  - Wayfinding skills decay in old age, more so for wayfinding in an allocentric than an egocentric reference frame. This study investigates whether wayfinding deficits of schoolchildren mimic those of older adults. Schoolchildren were tested on two wayfinding tasks: one could only be mastered in an allocentric, and the other only in an egocentric reference frame. The results were compared with those from a previous study of young and older adults who had been tested on the same two wayfinding tasks. It was found that wayfinding performance improved somewhat from school age to young adulthood and that this improvement proceeded more or less in parallel for the allocentric and the egocentric tasks. It was further found that wayfinding performance decayed from young to older adulthood and that this decay was more dramatic for the allocentric than for the egocentric task. This pattern of findings does not support the hypothesis that the wayfinding performance of schoolchildren mimics that of older adults.

AB  - Excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and neuro-inflammation underlie the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative brain disorders. Although L-glutamate is the prime excitatory neurotransmitter involved in diverse brain functions, however, overabundance at synapse can activate cell death mechanisms. Previous studies indicate that arbutin affords relief in metabolic, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal disorders. Recently, arbutin showed benefits in animal models of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease that further expanded its therapeutic potential against brain disorders. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of arbutin against monosodium L-glutamate (MSG) neurotoxicity in rats. Wistar rats (male, 180-200 g) were administered MSG (4 mg/kg) and arbutin (50 and 100 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 21 days. Cognitive functions were assessed using elevated plus maze and novel object recognition task. Biochemical parameters of oxidative stress, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and intracellular cation-levels (Na+, Ca2+, K+) were determined using whole brain. Administration of MSG augmented cation-levels, oxidative stress, inflammation, AChE, and LDH activities, and decreased GABA levels in the brain. Arbutin (50 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly decreased these biochemical disturbances in the brain of MSG administered rats. Behavioural results showed that MSG triggered cognitive deficits in rats that were significantly attenuated by arbutin. Histopathological findings in hippocampus and cortex revealed neuroprotective outcome of arbutin treatments against MSG. MK-801 and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L NAME) enhanced memory and neuroprotective effects in rats treated with arbutin and MSG. Arbutin may afford therapeutic advantages in neurodegenerative brain disorders by suppressing the excitotoxic pathways.

AB  - Plants are constantly exposed to various biological and non-biological stresses that endanger their lives. Drought stress is one of the abiotic stresses that have a great impact on the yield and life of plants and is one of the main causes of reduced crop yields. Reducing the effects of environmental stresses such as drought using methods such as irrigation, fertilizer application and appropriate planting methods is limited. Therefore, genetic modification of plants is an important effort to minimize the effect of environmental stresses. in this research, Twenty disinfected camelina seeds were cultured on the MS medium containing 3% sucrose, 0.8% agar and pH 5.8 under a laminar hood. After 14 days, the cotyledon explants (about 1 cm) were separated from the seedlings and placed on the callus induction medium. The MS callus induction medium containing 0.5 mg / l kinetin, 2 mg / l-2,4 D, 3% sucrose, 0.8% agar and pH 5.8. Samples were subcultured every two weeks to the same medium and calli were formed after 4 weeks. Then the calli were transferred to the medium containing a concentration of 30% PEG. To study gene expression, first callus samples were treated with liquid nitrogen and to study the effect of drought stress on gene expression, this sample was sent to Zagros Bioidea Company located in the Razi University Incubator. Gene expression was performed through microarray technology. The results showed that seven different genes whose expression increased by almost six times the control value can be mentioned, including Cold-acclimation protein (CAP160), NAC10, Abscisic acid (ABA), ABF4, CRK3, lysM domain receptor-like kinases (LYKs) and Basic/helix-loop-helix(bHLH130-like). Drought tolerance is not a genetically simple trait, but a quantitative and complex trait with various aspects that require the use of molecular methods to investigate the relevant mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate the expression of different genes of callus tissues of the Camelina plant under stress and non-stress conditions by microarray method.

AB  - Fluoride exposure during pregnancy commonly compromises fetal neurodevelopment and largely results in a broad spectrum of cognitive deficiencies in the adult offspring. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be fully elucidated. Herein, we investigate the impacts of fluoride on neural excitability and apoptosis, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function, as well as possible underlying mechanisms. Our results indicated that exposure to a high sodium fluoride (100 mg/L) during pregnancy in the mouse can cause the cognitive deficits of their offspring, accompanied by a decrease in the expression of Tet-eleven translocation protein 1 (TET1), an enzyme responsible for DNA hydroxymethylation. Additionally, there is a reduction in the dendritic spine density and the expression of postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) in the hippocampal regions of male offspring. Furthermore, in vitro fluoride treatment significantly exacerbates neuronal apoptosis and reduces the frequency of spikes in spontaneous action potential. More significantly, we also found that TET1 could directly bind to the promotor region of Bcl2, altering its DNA hydroxymethylation and Bcl2 expression. Intriguingly, Tet1 knock-out mice exhibited cognitive deficits similar to those observed in male animals exposed to high levels of fluoride. Furthermore, the down-regulation of TET1 protein, along with the consequent alteration in Bcl2 hydroxymethylation and increased neuronal apoptosis, are likely mechanisms underlying the impact of prenatal fluoride exposure on the neurodevelopment of male offspring. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which fluoride exposure induces neurodevelopmental impairment of the male offspring.

AB  - Midlife metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with cognitive impairment in late life. The mechanism of delayed MetS-related cognitive dysfunction (MetSCD) is not clear, but it has been linked to systemic inflammation and chronic cerebral microangiopathy. Currently there is no treatment for late life MetSCD other than early risk factor modification. We investigated the effect of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor 4-[[trans-4-[[(tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]dec-1-ylamino)carbonyl]amino]cyclohexyl]oxy]-benzoic acid (t-AUCB) on cognitive performance, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and central and peripheral inflammation in the high-fat diet (HFD) model of MetS in mice. At 6 weeks of age, male mice were randomly assigned to receive either HFD or standard chow (STD) for 6 months. Mice received either t-AUCB or vehicle for 4 weeks. Cognitive performance was evaluated, followed by CBF measurement using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). At the end of the study, blood was collected for measurement of eicosanoids and inflammatory cytokines. The brains were then analyzed by immunohistochemistry for glial activation markers. The HFD caused a significant impairment in novel object recognition. Treatment with t-AUCB increased plasma levels of 14,15-EET, prevented this cognitive impairment and modified hippocampal glial activation and plasma cytokine levels, without affecting CBF in mice on HFD. In conclusion, sEH inhibition for four weeks prevents cognitive deficits in mice on chronic HFD by modulating inflammatory processes without affecting CBF.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction is one of the complications of diabetes. Unfortunately, there is no effective methods to block its progression currently. One of the pathophysiological mechanisms is synaptic protein damage and neuronal signal disruption because of glucose metabolism disorder. Dystroglycan protein, located in the post-synaptic membrane of neurons, links the intracellular cytoskeleton with extracellular matrix. Abnormal expression of dystroglycan protein affects neuronal biological functions and leads to cognitive impairment. However, there are no relevant studies to observe the changes of beta-dystroglycan protein in diabetes rat brain and in primary neurons under high glucose exposure. Our data demonstrated the alterations of cognitive abilities in the diabetic rats; beta-dystroglycan protein degradation occurred in hippocampal and cortical tissues in diabetic rat brain. We further explored the mechanisms underlying of this phenomenon. When neurons are exposed to high glucose environment in long-term period, microRNA-132 (miR-132) would be down-regulated in neurons. Matrix Metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) mRNA, as a target of miR-132, could be up-regulated; higher expression and overlay activity of MMP-9 protein could increase beta-DG protein degradation. In this way, beta-DG degradation may affect structure and functions among the synapses, which related to cognition decline. It may provide some theoretical basis for elucidating the molecular mechanism of diabetes-induced cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Two emaciated male northern elephant seal (NES) Mirounga angustirostris pups were admitted to The Marine Mammal Center (Sausalito, California, USA) and treated for malnutrition. Complete blood counts showed a progressive moderate to marked leukocytosis characterized by a predominance of large monomorphic mononuclear cells of probable lymphoid origin, frequently with flower-shaped nuclei. Both seals were euthanized due to suspected lymphoid neoplasia. At necropsy, most lymph nodes in both pups were markedly enlarged, some with distinct white nodules, the spleens were diffusely enlarged, and the intestinal mucosae were thickened. Histopathologic features consistent with disseminated large cell lymphoma were identified to varying degrees of severity in lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver, tonsils, spleen, liver, intestines, kidneys, lower urinary tract, and several other organs. Immunohistochemical staining of neoplastic cells was most consistent with B lymphocyte origin, with most cells staining positively for Pax 5 and CD20 with admixed small CD3-positive T lymphocytes and CD204-positive macrophages. PCR and sequencing identified a novel gammaherpesvirus, herein called miroungine gammaherpesvirus 3, from affected tissues. This virus is in a Glade outside of named genera that utilize hosts in the suborder Caniformia. The present study is the first description of diffuse large B cell lymphoma with leukemic manifestation and concomitant detection of a novel gammaherpesvirus in free-living NESs. Further research regarding the prevalence of this new gammaherpesvirus and its associated pathogenesis in this species is indicated.

AB  - Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are a promising target for research due to their small size and the resulting plasmonic properties, which depend, among other things, on the chosen reducer. This is important because removing excess substrate from the reaction mixture is problematic. However, Au NPs are an excellent component of various materials, enriching them with their unique features. One example is hydrogels, which provide a good, easily modifiable base for multiple applications such as cosmetics. For this purpose, various compounds, including hyaluronic acid (HA) and its derivatives, are distinguished by their high water-binding capacity and many characteristics resulting from their natural origin in organisms, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, and tissue regeneration. In this work Au NPs were synthesized using a green chemistry method, either by using onion extract as a reductant or chemically reducing them with sodium citrate. A complete characterization of the nanoparticles was carried out using the following methods: Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Electrophoretic (ELS), and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) as well as Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Their antioxidant activity was also tested using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH). The results showed that the synthesized nanoparticles enrich the hydrogels with antioxidant properties and new surface properties (depending on the reducing agent, they can be more hydrophilic or hydrophobic). Preliminary observations indicated low cytotoxicity of the nanomaterials in both liquid form and as a hydrogel component, as well as their lack of penetration through pig skin. The cosmetic properties of hydrogel masks were also confirmed, such as increasing skin hydration.

AB  - Glucose, the primary energy substrate for fetal oxidative processes and growth, is transferred from maternal to fetal circulation down a concentration gradient by placental facilitative glucose transporters. In sheep, SLC2A1 and SLC2A3 are the primary transporters available in the placental epithelium, with SLC2A3 located on the maternal-facing apical trophoblast membrane and SLC2A1 located on the fetal-facing basolateral trophoblast membrane. We have previously reported that impaired placental SLC2A3 glucose transport resulted in smaller, hypoglycemic fetuses with reduced umbilical artery insulin and glucagon concentrations, in addition to diminished pancreas weights. These findings led us to subject RNA derived from SLC2A3-RNAi (RNA interference) and NTS-RNAi (non-targeting sequence) fetal pancreases to qPCR followed by transcriptomic analysis. We identified a total of 771 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Upregulated pathways were associated with fat digestion and absorption, particularly fatty acid transport, lipid metabolism, and cholesterol biosynthesis, suggesting a potential switch in energetic substrates due to hypoglycemia. Pathways related to molecular transport and cell signaling in addition to pathways influencing growth and metabolism of the developing pancreas were also impacted. A few genes directly related to gluconeogenesis were also differentially expressed. Our results suggest that fetal hypoglycemia during the first half of gestation impacts fetal pancreas development and function that is not limited to beta cell activity.

AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are one of the most widely used nanomaterials. The level of exposure to nanosilver is constantly raising, and a growing body of research highlights that it is harmful to the health, especially the nervous system, of humans. The potential pathways through which nanosilver affects neurons include the release of silver ions and the associated induction of oxidative stress. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity of nanosilver, in this study we exposed male Wistar rats to 0.5 mg/kg body weight of AgNPs coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), or citrate, or to AgNO3 as a source of silver ions for 28 days and assessed the expression of antioxidant defense markers in the hippocampus of the exposed animals after 1 week of spatial memory training. We also evaluated the influence of AgNPs coating on neurosteroidogenesis in the rat hippocampus. The results showed that AgNPs disrupted the antioxidant system in the hippocampus and induced oxidative stress in a coating-dependent manner, which could potentially be responsible for neurodegeneration and cognitive disorders. The analysis of the influence of AgNPs on neurosteroids also indicated coating-dependent modulation of steroid levels with a significant decrease in the concentrations of progesterone and 17 alpha-progesterone in AgNPs(BSA), AgNPs(PEG), and Ag+ groups. Furthermore, exposure to AgNPs or Ag+ resulted in the downregulation of selected genes involved in antioxidant defense (Cat), neurosteroid synthesis (Star, Hsd3b3, Hsd17b1, and Hsd17b10), and steroid metabolism (Ar, Er1, and Er2). In conclusion, depending on the coating material used for their stabilization, AgNPs induced oxidative stress and modulated the concentrations of steroids as well as the expression of genes involved in steroid synthesis and metabolism.

AB  - BackgroundFetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with deficits in the developing brain, including neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction. Endothelial colony forming cells (ECFC) can mediate improved vascular stability, and have demonstrated potential to enhance vascular development and protection. This investigation examined whether ECFCs from human umbilical cord blood (UCB) enhanced NVU development in FGR and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) fetal sheep.MethodsTwin-bearing ewes had surgery performed at 88-90 days' gestation, inducing FGR in one fetus. At 113 days, ECFCs (1 x 10(7) cells) cultured from human UCB were administered intravenously to fetal sheep in utero. At 127 days, ewes and their fetuses were euthanised, fetal brains collected, and NVU components analysed by immunohistochemistry.ResultsTwenty-four fetal lambs, arranged in four groups: AGA (n = 7), FGR (n = 5), AGA + ECFC (n = 6), and FGR + ECFC (n = 6), were included in analyses. FGR resulted in lower body weight than AGA (P = 0.002) with higher brain/body weight ratio (P = 0.003). ECFC treatment was associated with increased vascular density throughout the brain in both AGA + ECFC and FGR + ECFC groups, as well as increased vascular-astrocyte coverage and VEGF expression in the cortex (P = 0.003, P = 0.0006, respectively) and in the subcortical white matter (P = 0.01, P = 0.0002, respectively) when compared with the untreated groups.ConclusionsECFC administration enhanced development of NVU components in both the AGA and FGR fetal brain. Further investigation is required to assess how to optimise the enhanced angiogenic capabilities of ECFCs to provide a therapeutic strategy to protect the developing NVU against vulnerabilities associated with FGR.

AB  - Insects have developed sophisticated detoxification systems to protect them from plant secondary metabolites while feeding on plants to obtain necessary nutrients. As an important enzyme in the system, glycosyltransferase 1 (GT1) conjugates toxic compounds to mitigate their harm to insects. However, the evolutionary link between GT1s and insect plant feeding remains elusive. In this study, we explored the evolution of GT1s across different insect orders and feeding niches using publicly available insect genomes. GT1 is widely present in insect species; however, its gene number differs among insect orders. Notably, plant-sap-feeding species have the highest GT1 gene numbers, whereas blood-feeding species display the lowest. GT1s appear to be associated with insect adaptations to different plant substrates in different orders, while the shift to non-plant feeding is related to several losses of GT1s. Most large gene numbers are likely the consequence of tandem duplications showing variations in collinearity among insect orders. These results reveal the potential relationships between the evolution of GT1s and insect adaptation to plant feeding, facilitating our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying insect-plant interactions.

AB  - The Hippo pathway, a highly conserved signaling cascade that functions as an integrator of molecular signals and biophysical states, ultimately impinges upon the transcription coactivator Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP). Hippo-YAP signaling has been shown to play key roles both at the early embryonic stages of implantation and gastrulation, and later during neurogenesis. To explore YAP's potential role in neurulation, we used self-organizing neuruloids grown from human embryonic stem cells on micropatterned substrates. We identified YAP activation as a key lineage determinant, first between neuronal ectoderm and nonneuronal ectoderm, and later between epidermis and neural crest, indicating that YAP activity can enhance the effect of BMP4 stimulation and therefore affect ectodermal specification at this developmental stage. Because aberrant Hippo-YAP signaling has been implicated in the pathology of Huntington's Disease (HD), we used isogenic mutant neuruloids to explore the relationship between signaling and the disease. We found that HD neuruloids demonstrate ectopic activation of gene targets of YAP and that pharmacological reduction of YAP's transcriptional activity can partially rescue the HD phenotype.

AB  - Sow farrowing is a critical stage in pig farming, and predicting its onset can improve sow health and piglet survival. This study proposes a method based on optical flow estimation and time-series forecasting to predict sow farrowing onset. The RAFT optical flow algorithm is applied to visible-light videos of sows in late pregnancy to extract activity levels and generate time-series data. The reliability of the activity extraction algorithm is validated through correlation and trend analysis, showing strong inter-sow correlations with an average Pearson coefficient of 0.819. An in-depth analysis of sow_16 reveals a significant increase in activity 24 h before farrowing. Using these data, the CLA-PTNet model, incorporating CNN, LSTM, and attention mechanisms, is developed for continuous farrowing onset prediction. Experimental results demonstrate high predictive accuracy, with average MAE, RMSE, and R2 values of 5.42 min, 5.97 min, and 0.99, respectively, across four test sows. The method effectively captures activity pattern changes before farrowing, enabling precise predictions. This study offers an innovative, non-invasive solution for predicting sow farrowing onset, with significant application potential in farming practices.

AB  - Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a broad spectrum of motor and non-motor symptoms. The neuropathological characteristics of idiopathic PD are the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum, and the propagation of aggregates of misfolded a-synuclein in the brain following a specific pattern (Braak et al., 2006). The relationship of this pattern with motor and cognitive symptoms is still equiv-ocal. Therefore, we investigated longitudinally the spatio-temporal patterns of atrophy propagation in PD, their inter-individual variability and associations with clinical symp-toms. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of 37 PD patients and 27 controls were acquired at up to 15 time-points per subject, and over observation periods of up to 8.8 years (mean: 3.7 years). MR images were analyzed by Deformation-based Morphometry to measure region volumes and their longitudinal changes. Differences of these regional volume data be-tween patients and controls and their associations with clinical symptoms were calculated.At baseline, group differences in the regional volumes were found mainly in areas of the sensory, motor and orbitofrontal cortices, areas in the frontal operculum, inferior frontal sulcus, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and in the substantia nigra, among others.The longitudinal analysis yielded more widespread and more pronounced group differences, with significantly accelerated volume decreases in PD patients in the occipital and temporal lobes, the inferior parietal lobule, as well as in the insula, putamen and nucleus basalis Meynert. The white matter was less affected than the gray matter. Worse clinical scores (MMSE, PDQ-39, UPDRS-III) were in particular associated with volume decreases of cortical areas, amygdala and basal forebrain nuclei, but not of the basal ganglia. The observed longitudinal patterns of accelerated volume decrease in PD patients largely coincide with the pattern of a-synuclein pathology in PD stages 3-5 as proposed by Braak and colleagues. Thus, longitudinal DBM appears to depict already in-vivo the progression of neuropathological changes.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy related to hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) is a surgically remediable epilepsy with a relatively high prevalence and psychiatric comorbidities. Depressive disorders may occur in up to 25% of MTLE-HS patients suggesting a common molecular mechanism underlying both conditions.
   Objective: To compare the gene expression comprising serotonin 5HT(1A) and 5HT(2A), noradrenaline (NA) ADRA1A, and ADRA2A receptors in the hippocampus of MTLE-HS patients with and without major depression.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study allocated 31 patients in three groups: MTLE-HS without psychiatric diagnosis (MTLE-HS group), MTLE-HS with major depression (MTLE-HS-D group) and a control group consisting of healthy volunteers without any neurological or psychiatric disorders. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared among groups. Gene expression of receptors were analyzed using general linear mixed models (GLMM), with an unstructured matrix, normal link.
   Results: The three groups showed a similar distribution regarding age, gender (p > 0.16), history of initial precipitating injury, family history of epilepsy, monthly frequency of seizures, side of hippocampal sclerosis, interictal spike distribution and anti-seizure medications did not differ between MTLE-HS and MTLE-HS-D groups (p > 0.05). We observed a greater expression of the 5HT1A receptor in the control group when compared to the MTLE-HS (P = .004) and MTLE-HS-D (P = .007). Nevertheless, we did not observe any difference when MTLE-HS and MTLE-HS-D groups were compared to the controls for the ADRA1A (P =.931; P = .931), ADRA2A (P = .120; P = .121) and 5HT2A (P = .638; P = .318, respectively) gene expression.
   Conclusion: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy related to hippocampal sclerosis and MTLE-HS-D patients showed a lowered expression of the 5HT1A receptors when compared with the controls adjusted for age and schooling. Data suggest that temporal lobe epilepsy plasticity may affect serotonin receptors, which may lead to more frequent cases of major depression in this population. More studies comprising wider samples are necessary to confirm these results; they also should investigate serotonin reuptake drugs as an adjuvant therapeutic option for MTLE-HS disorder.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Septic-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a key manifestation of sepsis. Nevertheless, specific treatment for SAE is still lacking. Catalpol is an active component derived from Rehmanniae Radix, and has been demonstrated to be a potential neuroprotective agent. However, its effect on SAE still needs to be fully explored. Aim: To address the benefits of catalpol on post-sepsis cognitive deterioration and related mechanisms. Materials and methods: Novel object recognition test, temporal order task, histopathology, and immunochemistry were applied to address the benefits of catalpol on LPS-triggered post-sepsis cognitive decline in mice. Xuebijing injection (10 ml/kg) has been utilized as a positive control in the above animal studies. After treatment, the catalpol content in the hippocampus was determined using LC-MS/MS. Finally, the mechanisms of catalpol were further assessed in BV2 and PC12 cells in vitro using Western blot, RT-PCR, flow cytometry, molecular docking tests, thermal shift assay, transmission electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence analysis. Results: Behavior tests showed that catalpol therapy could lessen the cognitive impairment induced by LPS damage. HE, Nissl, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and Golgi staining further reflected that catalpol treatment could restore lymphocyte infiltration, blood-brain barrier (BBB) degradation, and the decreasing complexity of dendritic trees. According to LC-MS/MS analysis, catalpol had a 136 ng/mg concentration in the hippocampus. In vitro investigation showed that catalpol could inhibit microglia M1 polarization via blocking NF-kappa B phosphorylation, translocation and then reducing inflammatory cytokine release in BV2 microglia cells. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release up-regulation and TrkB pathway activation were observed in the catalpol treatment group in vivo and in vitro. The effect of catalpol on enhancing BDNF expression was inhibited by the specific inhibitor of TrkB (GNF-5837) in PC12 cells. Further molecular docking tests showed that catalpol formed weak hydrophobic bonds with TrkB. Besides, thermal shift assay also reflected that catalpol incubation caused a considerable change in the melting temperature of the TrkB. Conclusion: Catalpol alleviates LPS-triggered post-sepsis cognitive impairment by reversing neuroinflammation via blocking the NF-kappa B pathway, up-regulating neurotrophic factors via the activation of TrkB pathway, and preserving BBB integrity.

AB  - Contrasting pollination syndromes in closely related species suggest that floral trait divergence is associated with differences in pollination system, but empirical observations are required to confirm syndrome-based predictions. We present a comparative study of two closely related Erica species with contrasting pollination syndromes from the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Erica cylindrica has narrowly tubular pale and strongly scented flowers and is known to be hawkmoth-pollinated. The closely related Erica infundibuliformis has bright flower colours and appears to lack scent, traits that are suggestive of pollination by long-tongued nemestrinid flies (rhinomyiophily). Floral trait measurements revealed that both species exhibit predominantly upright flower orientation and elongated floral tubes, although tube length of E. infundibuliformis is consistently greater than that of E. cylindrica. For both species, petals are brighter than floral tube surfaces, but flowers of E. cylindrica lack the strong UV reflectance found in E. infundibuliformis. Nectar of E. infundibuliformis is more concentrated and produced in larger volumes. Scent composition, but not evening scent emission rates, differed between the species: scent of E. cylindrica is dominated by aromatic compounds, whereas scent of E. infundibuliformis is dominated by (E)-ocimene and other terpenoid compounds and is emitted at higher rates during the day than the evening. Pollinator observations contradicted trait-based predictions: although a single nemestrinid fly captured in the vicinity of E. infundibuliformis did carry Erica pollen, almost all other diurnal flower visitors were nectar-robbing Hymenoptera which did not carry Erica pollen. Contrary to predictions, at two sites and over two flowering seasons, flowers were consistently visited in the evenings by several species of settling moths and hawkmoths which carried pollen, almost exclusively of Erica, on their proboscides. Our findings thus suggest that, despite objective differences in key floral traits between the closely related hawkmoth-pollinated E. cylindrica and E. infundibuliformis, moths are also important pollinators of E. infundibuliformis. A bimodal pollination system involving predominant pollination by moths and occasional visits by long-proboscid flies could partially reconcile findings with predictions. Our study further suggests that hawkmoth pollination assumed and emphasises the importance of nocturnal pollinator observations.

AB  - Plant growth is complex, and involves many processes and its understanding is essential to maximize the crop's potential. The use of modeling is an essential tool to characterize the plant's growth and development, in addition, generates strategies for future plantings, adapting the management. Therefore, this study aimed to apply and make considerations based on parameters of the Logistic and Gompertz models to the fresh plants mass, of three sunflower cultivars, sown in three seasons, and select the best model for the cultivars. The data used came from nine uniformity trials with the sunflower cultivars Aguara 6, Nusol 4510, and Rhino and were adjusted according to the accumulated growing degree days, using the Logistic and Gompertz models. Parameters were estimated using the methods of ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalized least squares (GLS). In the presence of violations, the power method was used to structure the variance. Fit quality of the models to the data was assessed by the adjusted determination coefficient, Akaike information criterion, and Schwarz's Bayesian criterion. Logistic and Gompertz models fitted the data, converging on interpretable parameters, both by OLS and GLS methods. The insertion of the power structure into the models resulted in a better fit for the data. The cultivars Aguara 6 and Nusol 4510 are best described by the Logistic model and present a higher positive growth phase in the first trial. The sunflower cultivar Rhino is best described by the Gompertz model and presents a reduction in the positive growth phase in the first trial.

AB  - Begomoviruses infect food, fiber, and vegetable crop plants, including tomato, potato, bean, cotton, cucumber, and pumpkin, and damage many economically important crop plants worldwide. Tomato leaf curl Sudan virus (ToLCSDV) is the most widespread tomato-infecting begomovirus in Saudi Arabia. Using phage display technology, this study isolated two camel-derived nanobodies against purified ToLCSDV virions from a library of antigen-binding fragments (VHH or nanobody) of heavy-chain antibodies built from an immunized camel. The isolated nanobodies also cross-reacted with purified tomato yellow leaf curl virus virions and showed significant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reactivity with extracts from plants with typical begomovirus infection symptoms. The results can pave the way to developing diagnostics for begomovirus detection, design, and characterization of novel nanomaterials based on virus-like particles, in addition to nanobody-mediated begomovirus resistance in economically important crops, such as tomato, potato, and cucumber.

AB  - Camellia oleifera Abel ('Huashuo') is an important woody oil species with high economic value. Low yield is the main factor restricting the rapid development of the tea-oil industry. The dynamics of sugars, oil, endogenous hormones, and the genes involved in these pathways, as well as the correlation with oil synthesis-related factors in Huashuo, were investigated. The results showed that oil content was positively correlated with sucrose and starch content but was negatively correlated with reducing sugar content. Pyruvate kinase (PK) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) of the glycolysis pathway could be beneficial for oil biosynthesis. Higher levels of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), stearoyl-ACP desaturase (SAD), and WRINKLED1 (WRI1), as well as lower levels of omega-6 fatty acid desaturase 2 (FAD2) and lipoxygenase 5 ( LOX5) could be responsible for the oil production. The higher expression of gibberellin 20 oxidase (GA20ox), lower expression of gibberellic acid insensitive (GAI), and the increase in 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) at the mRNA level could contribute to oil accumulation. The results of this study could provide a reference for increasing the yield of plants related to Huashuo.

AB  - Simple Summary Gobies form a group of small fish that are extremely adaptable to their environment. However, genomic resources for Gobiidae species are scarce. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to generate the whole genome data for the shimofuri goby (Tridentiger bifasciatus). In addition to providing basic genomic information, the mitochondrial whole genome, microsatellite markers, and single-copy homologous genes are also explored. The PSMC model is used to provide the historical population dynamics of the shimofuri goby. The results of this study provide a reference for the assembly of a complete genome map and biological research of the shimofuri goby. The shimofuri goby (Tridentiger bifasciatus) is a small and highly adaptable goby, distributed along the coasts of China, the Sea of Japan, and the west coastal and estuarine areas of the Northwest Pacific. Next-generation sequencing was used to generate genome-wide survey data to provide essential characterization of the shimofuri goby genome and for the further mining of genomic information. The genome size of the shimofuri goby was estimated to be approximately 887.60 Mb through K-mer analysis, with a heterozygosity ratio and repeat sequence ratio of 0.47% and 32.60%, respectively. The assembled genome was used to identify microsatellite motifs (Simple Sequence Repeats, SSRs), extract single-copy homologous genes and assemble the mitochondrial genome. A total of 288,730 SSRs were identified. The most frequent SSRs were dinucleotide repeats (with a frequency of 61.15%), followed by trinucleotide (29.87%), tetranucleotide (6.19%), pentanucleotide (1.13%), and hexanucleotide repeats (1.66%). The results of the phylogenetic analysis based on single-copy homologous genes showed that the shimofuri goby and Rhinogobius similis can be clustered into one branch. The shimofuri goby was originally thought to be the same as the chameleon goby (Tridentiger trigonocephalus) due to their close morphological resemblance. However, a complete mitochondrial genome was assembled and the results of the phylogenetic analysis support the inclusion of the shimofuri goby as a separate species. PSMC analysis indicated that the shimofuri goby experienced a bottleneck event during the Pleistocene Glacial Epoch, in which its population size decreased massively, and then it began to recover gradually after the Last Glacial Maximum. This study provides a reference for the further assembly of the complete genome map of the shimofuri goby, and is a valuable genomic resource for the study of its evolutionary biology.

AB  - Introduction: Heat stress is harmful to the health of humans and animals, more and more common, as a consequence of global warming, while the mechanism that heat stress modulates skeletal development remains unknown. Hence, we conducted a model of heat stress in vitro.Methods: We used Hu sheep myoblasts as the research object, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot (WB) were conducted to detect the expression of mRNA and protein in heat-stressed myoblasts. The would-healing assay was used to detect the migration of myoblasts. The mitochondria were observed by a transmission electron microscope.Results: mRNA and protein expression of HSP60 was significantly enriched in the heat-stressed myoblasts during proliferation and differentiation (p < 0.05). In our study, we indicated that heat stress enriched the intracellular ROS of the myoblasts (p < 0.001), leading to an increase in autophagy in the myoblasts to induce apoptosis. The results demonstrated that the protein expression of LC3B-1 and BCL-2 was significantly increased in myoblasts under heat stress during proliferation and differentiation (p < 0.05). Additionally, heat stress inhibited mitochondrial biogenesis and function and reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential and downregulated the expression of mtCo2, mtNd1 and DNM1L (p < 0.05) in myoblasts during proliferation and differentiation. Consequently, heat stress inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of the myoblasts, in accordance with the downregulation of the expression of PAX7, MYOD, MYF5, MYOG and MYHC (p < 0.05). Moreover, heat stress also inhibited the cell migration of the myoblasts.Discussion: This work demonstrates that heat stress inhibits proliferation and differentiation, and accelerates apoptosis by impairing mitochondrial function and promoting autophagy, which provides a mechanism to understand heat stress affects the development of the skeletal muscle.

AB  - The intercropping of tea plants with Chinese chestnut has been recognized as an advanced and eco-friendly cultivation method that enhances the self-resistance of tea plants. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between plant hormones and CsAFS1 based on previous findings and to reveal the mechanism by which CsAFS1 enhances the resistance of tea plants intercropped with Chinese chestnut. In this study, an alpha-farnesene synthase (AFS) was identified in tea plants intercropped with Chinese chestnut through transcriptome sequencing. This gene was actively expressed during cold and under exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellic acid (GA) induction. The gene was cloned, and the bioinformatics analysis revealed that its encoded protein was clustered within the same evolutionary branch as camellia proteins, and hence it was named CsAFS1. The promoter analysis revealed multiple cis-acting elements responsive to cold, JA, MeJA, and SA. After transformation of CsAFS1 into tobacco plants, the transgenic tobacco plants exhibited growth similar to that of wild-type tobacco plants, but with longer and denser glandular trichomes. Aphid and cold stress were used as representative examples of biotic and abiotic stresses in transgenic tobacco plants, respectively. Enhanced resistance to aphid and cold stress was associated with increased levels of osmoregulatory substances and protective enzyme activities, upregulated expression of stress-related genes, and reduced reactive oxygen species production. CsAFS1 was also found to respond rapidly to MeJA and SA, and significant changes in terpenoid content, for example, nerolidol, were observed. These findings suggested that CsAFS1 enhanced stress resistance by boosting antioxidant enzyme activity, the level of osmoregulatory substances, and secondary metabolites, hormone signaling, and systemic acquired resistance, making tea plants or tea plantations much healthier. This study provided a theoretical foundation for understanding stress regulation in tea plants and for breeding stress-resistant varieties.

AB  - BackgroundCamellia huana, an endangered plant species with a high ornamental and medicinal value, is designated as a Class I protected plant in China. In the natural state, the flowers of C. huana have golden color and fragrance; however, our study group found that the outer layer of the petals of one C. huana plant was mutated and showed red color. Plant petals show a variety colors due to the synthesis and accumulation of pigments. However, thus far, few studies have investigated the formation and differences in flower color in C. huana. Carotenoids are the main color-forming components in C. huana flowers. C. huana petals also contain volatile compounds that impart a distinct fragrance to the flowers. In the present study, to better understand the regulatory mechanisms of carotenoids and volatile compounds in the petals of C. huana flowers of different colors, we used flowers obtained at different developmental periods of C. huana as the experimental materials and conducted metabolome and transcriptome analyses.ResultsThe results showed that C. huana is rich in volatile compounds. A total of 372 metabolites were detected in C. huana, which mainly included 72 terpenoids, 67 heterocyclic compounds, nitrogen-containing compounds, esters, aromatic hydrocarbons, 39 alcohols, and others; terpenoids, heterocyclic compounds, and esters were the predominant volatiles. Forty carotenoids were identified by carotenoid content analysis, and 10 genes were involved in carotenoid biosynthesis were screened for their significant differential expression, namely 15-cis-phytoene synthase (crtB), prolycopene isomerase (crtISO, crtH), beta-carotene 3-hydroxylase (crtZ), beta-carotene isomerase (DWARF27), 9-cis-beta-carotene 9(y),10(y)-cleaving dioxygenase (CCD7), zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP, ABA1), 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), xanthoxin dehydrogenase (ABA2), abscisate beta-glucosyltransferase (AOG), and (+)-abscisic acid 8(y)-hydroxylase (CYP707A). A total of 12,089 differential genes were screened by transcriptome analysis.ConclusionsThe results of this study enriched the transcriptome data and provided new insights into the mechanisms of color and odor formation in the flowers of C. huana.

AB  - Fluoride (F) is vital for the growth of tea plants (Camellia sinensis); however, high levels in the leaves can pose a potential threat to human health. Previous studies have shown that F-export genes (FEXs) regulate efflux from the cells in tea plants, but the specific regulatory network remains unclear. In this study, the Calmodulin-Binding Transcription Activator (CAMTA) protein was functionally characterized based on yeast one-hybrid screening assays and previous transcriptomics studies, which showed that it is mainly localized in the nucleus and binds to the G-box (CACGTC) cis-element in the promoter of Fluoride Export Gene 1 (FEX1) as a transcription inhibitor. In addition, yeast-two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that Calmodulin 1 (CAM1) could interact with CAMTA to form a protein complex that suppressed FEX1 expression. Furthermore, subcellular examination indicated that CAM1 was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting that it might be activated by binding Ca2+ directly in the cytoplasm, subsequently leading to a physical interaction with CAMTA. Finally, silencing of CAMTA and CAM1 in tea plants by using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides increased the expression level of FEX1 and decreased the intracellular concentration of F. Thus, our study identifies a CAM1-CAMTA-FEX1 module that regulates F export in tea leaves, and hence provides new insights for breeding low-F tea varieties.
   CAM1 interacts with CAMTA in tea plants to form a complex that binds with the promoter of FEX1 to suppress its expression and thereby reduce efflux of fluoride from cells.

AB  - Tea has historically been one of the most popular beverages, and it is currently an economically significant crop cultivated in over 50 countries. The Northwestern Caucasus is one of the northernmost regions for industrial tea cultivation worldwide. The domestication of the tea plant in this region took approximately 150 years, during which plantations spreading from the Ozurgeti region in northern Georgia to the southern city of Maykop in Russia. Consequently, tea plantations in the Northern Caucasus can serve as a source of unique genotypes with exceptional cold tolerance. Tea plants are known to be recalcitrant to Agrobacterium-mediated transfection. Research into optimal transfection and regeneration methodologies, as well as the identification of tea varieties with enhanced transformation efficiency, is an advanced strategy for improving tea plant culture. The aim of this study was to search for the optimal Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transfection protocol for the Kolkhida tea variety. As a result of optimizing the transfection medium with potassium phosphate buffer at the stages of pre-inoculation, inoculation and co-cultivation, the restoration of normal morphology and improvement in the attachment of Agrobacterium cells to the surface of tea explants were observed by scanning electron microscopy. And an effective method of high-efficiency Agrobacteria tumefaciens-mediated transfection of the best local tea cultivar, Kolkhida, was demonstrated for the first time.

AB  - Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) released from vehicular emissions and oil refineries deposit on the phyllosphere, compromising the quality of leaf-based food products by posing many health issues. Nevertheless, the tea phyllosphere harbours a variety of endophytes that are highly effective at degrading polyaromatic hydrocarbons, anthracene, and pyrene. The present study attempts to analyse the pyrene and anthracene degrading capability of phyllosphere endophytic fungi that inhabit Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze leaves. The frequency of occurrence of endophytic fungi in different leaf tissue layers was examined using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The best pyrene and anthracene degrading strains were selected based on the High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) results, and further kinetic assays. Light microscopy and SEM observations highlighted a heterogeneous endophytic fungal distribution among leaf tissue layers; the upper epidermis had the highest fungal distribution compared to other leaf layers. HPLC results revealed that Phyllosticta capitalensis, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Colletotrichum siamense, Pseudopestalotiopsis chinensis, and Daldinia eschscholtzii, have higher pyrene and anthracene degradation respectively and their PAH degradation kinetics follow the first-order kinetic model. The best anthracene and pyrene degrader, P. capitalensis showed the lowest half-life. The present investigation highlights the potential of P. capitalensis, the best pyrene and anthracene degrader that can remediate PAHs deposited on the phyllosphere of tea leaves.

AB  - Camellia is a large genus in the tea family of Theaceae. In this genus, several species serve different purposes, such as, medicinal and ornamental plants and beverage production. Thus, country-wide cultivation of various species of Camellia genus sought to alleviate poverty and promote economic development in many regions. However, studies on evaluating its genetic resources as a foundation for the conservation and development of this plant are yet to start. Currently, using DNA barcoding often serves as a highly reliable approach to identifying and characterizing numerous plants. In the presented study, a total of 10 Camellia accessions collected from Dong Bua village, Tam Quan commune, District Tam Dao, and Vinh Phuc province, Vietnam, underwent study during 2020-2022 at Ho Chi Minh City University of Food Industry, Vietnam. Evaluation of two DNA barcoding regions, namely, rbcL and trnH-psbA, transpired for their ability to distinguish the Camellia accessions belonging to different species in Vietnam. The results revealed a significant difference in the DNA sequences of the rbcL and trnH-psbA regions among the Camellia species. In addition, the trnH-psbA barcode region also showed higher effectiveness versus the rbcL region in recognizing various species of Camellia. The results authenticated the potential of DNA barcoding in the management, conservation, and development of the genetic resources of Camellia in Vietnam.

AB  - Tea plants are widely grown all over the world because they are an important economic crop. The purity and authenticity of tea varieties are frequent problems in the conservation and promotion of germplasm resources in recent years, which has brought considerable inconvenience and uncertainty to the selection of parental lines for breeding and the research and cultivation of superior varieties. However, the development of core SNP markers can quickly and accurately identify the germplasm, which plays an important role in germplasm identification and the genetic relationship analysis of tea plants. In this study, based on 179,970 SNP loci from the whole genome of the tea plant, all of 142 cultivars were clearly divided into three groups: Assam type (CSA), Chinese type (CSS), and transitional type. Most CSA cultivars are from Yunnan Province, which confirms that Yunnan Province is the primary center of CSA origin and domestication. Most CSS cultivars are distributed in east China; therefore, we deduced that east China (mainly Zhejiang and Fujian provinces) is most likely the area of origin and domestication of CSS. Moreover, 45 core markers were screened using strict criteria to 179,970 SNP loci, and we analyzed 117 well-Known tea cultivars in China with 45 core SNP markers. The results were as follows: (1) In total, 117 tea cultivars were distinguished by eight markers, which were selected to construct the DNA fingerprint, and the remaining markers were used as standby markers for germplasm identification. (2) Ten pairs of parent and offspring relationships were confirmed or identified, and among them, seven pairs were well-established pedigree relationships; the other three pairs were newly identified. In this study, the east of China (mainly Zhejiang and Fujian provinces) is most likely the area of origin and domestication of CSS. The 45 core SNP markers were developed, which provide a scientific basis at the molecular level to identify the superior tea germplasm, undertake genetic relationship analysis, and benefit subsequent breeding work.

AB  - To clarify the histopathological characteristics of Camellia oleifera that were infected by Colletotrichum fructicola, this study utilized frozen tissue sections, whole-stain clearing and transmission electron microscopy to observe the time of transformation from biotrophic to necrotrophic when Co. fructicola infects leaves, as well as the colonization and expansion of the pathogenic fungus at different stages on the leaves. The Co. fructicola conidia produced germ tubes 2 h post-inoculation, and appressoria began to form 4 h after inoculation. There were two ways that pathogens can use to invade the leaves of Ca. oleifera. One was to directly penetrate the host cuticle, while the other involved invasion from the stomata of the host using germ tubes or hyphae. A few infection vesicles could then be observed in the leaf tissue, and the infection vesicles produce thicker septal primary hyphae after 24 h of infection. When the infection reached the 40 h point, the fungus started to produce secondary hyphae with smaller diameter than that of the primary hyphae and gradually expanded into the adjacent cells. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that when the secondary hyphae entered the mesophyll cells, the contents in the cells were digested and a cavity gradually formed, indicating that the cells had been killed. Thus, the appearance of the secondary hyphae marked the point at which Co. fructicola entered into a destructive necrotrophic stage.

AB  - This research was conducted to determine the change of main growth parameters and growth pattern of camelina depending on the sowing time and genotype. The research was carried out during 2017 and 2018 and the treatments (1, 11, 21 and 31 May & PI-650142 and PI-304269 genotypes) were arranged in split-plot design and 3 replications. It was determined that NAR, LAI, RGR and DM were affected by the sowing times. In addition, NAR, LAI and RGR were significantly affected by genotypes at all growth stages, whereas DM was affected only in the pre-flowering stage. Depending on the sowing times and genotype, NAR was found 0.014-0.016, 1.65-1.96 and 4.10-15.51 mg mm(-2) day(-1) in pre-flowering, flowering and post-flowering periods, respectively, while LAI was found 0.22-0.29, 0.23-0.33 and 0.100.23 mm(2) mm(-2), respectively. In pre-flowering, flowering, post-flowering and harvest period RGR was found 2.3-2.6, 3.3-4.4, 2.2-3.3 and 0.6-0.7 mg g(-1) day(-1) g(-1) day(-1), respectively, while DM was 0.233-0.283, 0.410-0.553, 0.646-0.944 and 0.939-1.003 g per plant, respectively. Also, depending on the sowing time, the seed yield was determined as 190.85-810.07 kg ha(-1) for the PI-650142 genotype and 190.94-360.65 kg ha(-1) for the PI-304269 genotype. Consequently, it can be suggested that PI-650142 genotype can be used for general sowing once date is adjusted to 1 May in conditions of Samsun. This could be contributed to optimum temperature and day length during the flowering, seed formation and filling stage.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a highly infectious pathogen in the global pig industry that causes significant economic losses. Owing to its rapid mutation, effective antiviral treatments or vaccines are still lacking. Therefore, it is essential to identify potential host factors that interact with PRRSV-encoded proteins. In this study, a porcine alveolar macrophage cDNA library was used to identify host proteins that interact with PRRSV nonstructural protein 1 beta (Nsp1 beta) via a yeast two-hybrid system. A total of 34 potential host factors were identified, with Thanatos-associated protein 11 (THAP11) strongly interacting with Nsp1 beta. These interactions were further analyzed via Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Co-localization of Nsp1 beta with THAP11, poly(rC)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1), thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), and cathepsin D (CTSD) was observed, and co-IP assays confirmed the Nsp1 beta-THAP11 interaction. The overexpression of THAP11 reduced PRRSV N protein accumulation, indicating an antiviral effect, whereas the silencing of THAP11 increased PRRSV replication. Furthermore, THAP11 promoted the degradation of Nsp1 beta by increasing K48- and K63-linked ubiquitination, thereby restricting PRRSV replication. These findings suggest that THAP11 exerts an antiviral effect by interacting with and degrading Nsp1 beta via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, providing insights for future PRRSV defence strategies.

AB  - The impact of seasonality on the aroma quality of tea has been documented in various tea types, but not specifically in oolong tea. This study is the first to explore the complex relationships between seasonality, volatile compounds, and aroma quality in oolong tea. Using Headspace Solid-Phase Microextraction Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics, we analyzed 266 samples of Tieguanyin oolong tea. The data identified linalool, linalool oxides (trans-linalool oxide (furanoid) and trans-linalool oxide (pyranoid)), and their metabolites (diendiol I; hotrienol) as key seasonal discriminants. Four out of the top ten key differential compounds for distinguishing aroma scores were metabolites from fatty acid degradation, namely trans-3-hexenyl butyrate, trans-2-hexenyl hexanoate, hexyl hexanoate, and hexyl 2-methyl butyrate. Approximately one-fifth of the seasonal discriminant volatile compounds were significant in influencing aroma quality. Overall, the impact of seasonality on the aroma quality of finished Tieguanyin oolong tea is marginal. These findings enhance our understanding of the interplay between seasonal variations, volatile composition, and aroma quality in oolong tea.

AB  - Mimicry is the phenomenon in which one species (the mimic) closely resembles another (the model), enhancing its own fitness by deceiving a third party into interacting with it as if it were the model. In plants, mimicry is used primarily to gain fitness by withholding rewards from mutualists or deterring herbivores cost-effectively. While extensive work has been documented on putative defence mimicry, limited investigation has been conducted in the field of chemical mimicry.In this study, we used field experiments, chemical analyses, behavioural assays, and electrophysiology, to test the hypothesis that the birthwort Aristolochia delavayi employs chemical mimicry by releasing leaf scent that closely resembles stink bug defensive compounds and repels vertebrate herbivores.We show that A. delavayi leaf scent is chemically and functionally similar to the generalized defensive volatiles of stink bugs and that the scent effectively deters vertebrate herbivores, likely through the activation of TRPA1 channels via (E)-2-alkenal compounds.This study provides an unequivocal example of chemical mimicry in plants, revealing intricate dynamics between plants and vertebrate herbivores. Our study underscores the potency of chemical volatiles in countering vertebrate herbivory, urging further research to uncover their potentially underestimated importance.

AB  - The intestinal tract of herbivorous arthropods provides a microhabitat for a group of protistan and fungal endosymbionts known as trichomycetes. Many hosts are the aquatic immature stages of insects. One understudied group is mosquito larvae with only six trichomycete species reported from the mosquito gut, but Smittium culicis Manier and Zancudomyces culisetae Y. Wang, Tretter, Lichtw. & M.M. White are globally distributed and common in these insects. Mosquitoes are mostly found in standing freshwater habitats, but there are species that are found in brackish water pools common in salt marshes. No trichomycetes are reported from salt marsh mosquitoes. A new species, Legerioides culicicola, is described from mosquito larvae from freshwater sources in Nova Scotia (NS) and Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada, and Smittium gronthidium Strongman & M.M. White is reported for the first time in this host. Smittium culicis is reported from salt marsh mosquitoes from collections in the same provinces in Eastern Canada. Information on the prevalence of mosquito trichomycetes is presented for sites in NS and PEI.

AB  - Besides aroma and taste, the color of dry tea leaves, tea infusion, and infused tea leaves is also an important index for tea quality. Shading can significantly increase the chlorophyll content of tea leaves, leading to enhanced tea leaf coloration. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we revealed that the expressions of chlorophyll synthesis genes were significantly induced by shading, specially, the gene encoding protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (CsPOR). Indoor control experiment showed that decreased light intensity could significantly induce the expression of CsPOR, and thus cause the increase of chlorophyll content. Subsequently, we explored the light signaling pathway transcription factors regulating chlorophyll synthesis, including CsPIFs and CsHY5. Through expression level and subcellular localization analysis, we found that CsPIF3-2, CsPIF7-1, and CsHY5 may be candidate transcriptional regulators. Transcriptional activation experiments proved that CsHY5 inhibits CsPORL-2 transcription. In summary, we concluded that shading might promote the expression of CsPORL-2 by inhibiting the expression of CsHY5, leading to high accumulation of chlorophyll in tea leaves. The results of this study provide insights into the mechanism regulating the improvements to tea plant quality caused by shading.

AB  - Simple Summary Mastitis is one of the most challenging diseases of dairy animals, with a high impact on animal production and welfare. The development of mastitis vaccines requires deep understanding of host-pathogen interaction mechanisms in the mammary gland. In the present study, we investigated the immunomodulatory effect of selected Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, representing gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial mastitis pathogens, on the phenotype and function of milk immune cells in a whole milk stimulation assay. The analysis of stimulation-induced shape change, change in the expression of cell surface markers, phagocytosis, apoptosis, ROS production, and NETosis revealed selective modulating effects of the TLR ligands LPS and Pam3CSK4 on camel milk immune cells. These results may have implications for the use of synthetic TLR agonists as immunomodulatory adjuvants of the immune response to intra-mammary vaccines against mastitis pathogens. (1) Toll-like receptors (TLR) are a family of pattern recognition receptors that sense distinct molecular patterns of microbial origin. Although the immune cell composition of camel milk has been recently described, host-pathogen interaction studies in the camel mammary gland are still scarce. The present study aimed to use a whole milk stimulation assay for investigating the modulatory effect of selected Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands on the phenotype and function of milk immune cells. (2) Methods-camel milk samples (n = 7) were stimulated in vitro with the TLR4 ligand LPS or the TLR2/1 ligand Pam3CSK4, and separated milk cells were evaluated for stimulation-induced shape change, the expression of cell surface markers, phagocytosis, apoptosis, ROS production, and NETosis. Stimulation with PMA was used as a control stimulation. (3) Results-all stimulants induced shape change in milk cells, change in the expression of several cell markers, and increased cell apoptosis and NETosis. In addition, stimulation with Pam3CSK4 and PMA was associated with enhanced ROS production, while only PMA stimulation resulted in enhanced bacterial phagocytosis by milk immune cells. (4) Conclusions-our data indicates selective modulating effects of the TLR ligands LPS and Pam3CSK4 on camel milk phagocytes. These results may have implications for the use of synthetic TLR agonists as immunomodulatory adjuvants of the immune response to intra-mammary vaccines against mastitis pathogens.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and can be used as a modulator and/or predictor of treatment responsiveness. Understanding the mitochondrial effects of antidepressants is important to connect mitochondria with their therapeutic and/or adverse effects. Pig brain-isolated mitochondria were used to evaluate antidepressant-induced changes in the activity of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, monoamine oxidase (MAO), mitochondrial respiratory rate, and ATP. Bupropion, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, and trazodone were tested. All tested antidepressants showed significant inhibition of complex I and IV activities at high concentrations (50 and 100 & mu;mol/L); complex II + III activity was reduced by all antidepressants except bupropion. Complex I-linked respiration was reduced by escitalopram >> trazodone >> sertraline. Complex II-linked respiration was reduced only by bupropion. Significant positive correlations were confirmed between complex I-linked respiration and the activities of individual ETC complexes. MAO activity was inhibited by all tested antidepressants, with SSRIs causing a greater effect than trazodone and bupropion. The results indicate a probable association between the adverse effects of high doses of antidepressants and drug-induced changes in the activity of ETC complexes and the respiratory rate of mitochondria. In contrast, MAO inhibition could be linked to the antidepressant, procognitive, and neuroprotective effects of the tested antidepressants.

AB  - The presence of l-theanine in tea enhances its sensory attributes and mitigates the bitterness caused by polyphenols and caffeine. The low l-theanine content in summer and autumn teas, which is < 1% of their dry weight, is a key factor in their inferior taste. Our study successfully enhanced l-theanine levels in tea plants by irrigating them with endophytic bacteria. The Pseudomonas knackmussii isolated from tea plants is notable for its outstanding ability to synthesize l-theanine, using ethylamine to produce 201.4 mu M of l-theanine. Our study identified the key gene responsible for the biosynthesis of l-theanine in P. knackmussii to be CDF86904.1 (l-glutamine synthetase, GS). We found that P. knackmussii can penetrate nearly all tea plant tissues and has excellent colonization ability. Additionally, irrigation of Baiye No.1 tea seedlings with both ethylamine and endophytes for 7 days resulted in top leaves exhibiting an l-theanine content of 58.5 mg/g dry weight. This represents a notable increase compared to 37.8 mg/g dry weight with only ethylamine and 15.4 mg/g dry weight with solely water. Surprisingly, after irrigating the tea plants with a combination of endophytic bacteria and ethylamine, the l-theanine content of the third tea leaf was 131.7 mg/g dry weight after 14 days. This study reveals the significant potential of endophytic bacteria in tea plants to increase l-theanine content, providing empirical evidence for improving tea quality and demonstrating important theoretical and practical significance in tea production.

AB  - Camellia pleurocarpa (Gagnep.) Sealy, a species of yellow camellia indigenous to Vietnam, was investigated for its essential oil properties in this study. Hydrodistillation of its leaves yielded a complex mixture rich in sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. Chemical analysis identified 50 constituents, with notable compounds including spathulenol (13.26%), phytol (9.94%), and alpha-selinene (5.34%). The essential oil exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against three Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus; one Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and one yeast Candida albicans, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 16 to 32 mu g/mL and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 7.26 to 16.23 mu g/mL. Furthermore, it demonstrated larvicidal potential against Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, with LC50 values ranging from 13.49 to 28.95 mu g/mL and LC90 values ranging from 28.29 to 53.24 mu g/mL. These findings underscore the promising antimicrobial and mosquito larvicidal properties of C. pleurocarpa essential oil, suggesting its potential as a natural alternative in combating microbial infections and controlling mosquito-borne diseases. This study represents the first comprehensive report on the chemical compositions and bioactivities of C. pleurocarpa essential oil.

AB  - Cycads represent one of the most ancient lineages of living seed plants. Identifying genomic features uniquely shared by cycads and other extant seed plants, but not non-seed-producing plants, may shed light on the origin of key innovations, as well as the early diversification of seed plants. Here, we report the 10.5-Gb reference genome of Cycas panzhihuaensis, complemented by the transcriptomes of 339 cycad species. Nuclear and plastid phylogenomic analyses strongly suggest that cycads and Ginkgo form a clade sister to all other living gymnosperms, in contrast to mitochondrial data, which place cycads alone in this position. We found evidence for an ancient whole-genome duplication in the common ancestor of extant gymnosperms. The Cycas genome contains four homologues of the fitD gene family that were likely acquired via horizontal gene transfer from fungi, and these genes confer herbivore resistance in cycads. The male-specific region of the Y chromosome of C. panzhihuaensis contains a MADS-box transcription factor expressed exclusively in male cones that is similar to a system reported in Ginkgo, suggesting that a sex determination mechanism controlled by MADS-box genes may have originated in the common ancestor of cycads and Ginkgo. The C. panzhihuaensis genome provides an important new resource of broad utility for biologists.
   The study assembled a chromosome-level genome of Cycas panzhihuaensis, the last major lineage of seed plants for which a high-quality genome assembly was lacking. The study closes an important gap in our understanding of genome structure and evolution in seed plants.

AB  - Pollen grains of 23 species distributed in 15 genera and represented by 64 specimens were analysed using light and scanning electron microscopy to characterise the neotropical genera of Hippomaneae. Five of these species are palynologically characterised for the first time. Hippomaneae pollen is shed in monads, being small to large, isopolar, oblate-spheroidal to prolate, with an amb ranging from circular, three-lobed to distinctly three-lobed, tricolporate, very long colpi (except for Hura crepitans in which is long), margo psilate (rugulate only in Colliguaja brasiliensis), narrow to wide, and endoapertures circular, lalongate to very lalongate, with costae. Sexine thicker than the nexine. Sexine is psilate-perforate except for Algernonia brasiliensis, C. brasiliensis, Gymnanthes multiramea, G. schottiana, Microstachys corniculata, Pleradenophora membranifolia, and Sebastiania brasiliensis where it is microreticulate. Only in M. corniculata the sexine is separated from the nexine at the mesocolpus, forming a cavea. Although the Hippomaneae are considered stenopalynous in the literature, our results showed variation between species and genera groups, reinforcing the relevance of pollen morphology in the systematics of this tribe.

KW  - Ceratocaryum
AB  - Faecal mimicry by seeds is a recently discovered phenomenon in plants. Here we demonstrate that seeds of Ceratocaryum pulchrum (Restionaceae) are dispersed and buried by dung beetles, making it the second species, after its sister species C. argenteum, known to exhibit this mode of dispersal. Seeds of C. pulchrum are similar in size, shape and scent to those of C. argenteum and the dung of various mammalian herbivores. The distribution range of C. pulchrum entirely overlaps with that of C. argenteum, but they flower and release seeds six months apart. Several dung beetle species, including both of those associated with C. argenteum, were found to be attracted to C. pulchrum seeds. Seeds were buried in situ by the tunnelling species Copris victorini. Since seeds of both plant species attract several generalist dung beetles, this suggests that speciation in these two species has not been due to evolution for different or specific dispersers but may instead be related to exploitation of temporal niche opportunities.

   The application of yellow tea components in confectionery indicates a new direction in functional foods' design process as it influences the antioxidant activity, sensory value and health promoting value of the final product.
   Chocolate and tea leaves are considered the most valuable sources of highly bioactive polyphenols due to their potential anti-cancer properties and beneficial effects on the cardiovascular and nervous systems. The objective of the present study was the development of a sensory profiling modality that is correlated with the taste of the chocolate enriched with yellow tea phytochemicals. The additive concentration was optimized in white chocolate and the designed product was evaluated using the sensory profiling method. It was shown that the yellow tea extract in chocolate had a significant effect on the taste and color of the product. Addition of 2.0% yellow tea powdered extract increased the value of color acceptance and caused an intensification of the aromas, particularly the leafy taste, compared to the control samples. The next step of the study was to determine the influence of tea addition in white, milk and dark chocolate subjected to 6 months of storage. The designed chocolates were tested for their activity as antioxidants (DPPH, ABTS and ORAC assay) and cholinesterase inhibitors (AChE, BChE assay). It was confirmed that the yellow tea addition affected the activity of prepared chocolates with respect to radical scavenging activity and was highest for dark chocolate with yellow tea where the values were as follows: 4373 mg Tx/100 g (DPPH), 386 mg Tx/100 g (ABTS) and 4363 mu M Tx/100 g (ORAC). An increase in the anti-radical activity of chocolate with yellow tea was found after 3 months of storage, but the subsequent 3 months of storage resulted in its reduction. AChE values ranged from 0.118 to 0.730 [mu M eserine/g dw] and from 0.095 to 0.480 [mu M eserine/g dw] for BChE assay. Total capacity to inhibit AChE and BChE differed depending on the type of chocolate and was negatively influenced by the half-year storage. Summarizing tested values for individual samples were higher, with increasing content of cocoa liquor and yellow tea extract in the product. The results of the research show that the use of yellow tea in confectionery is promising and may appoint a new direction in functional foods.

AB  - The adaptation of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) to milkweed plants and their ability to sequester toxic cardenolides is a model system for plant-herbivore coevolution. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying cardenolide sequestration and its temporal dynamics remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the polar cardenolide ouabain passes through the isolated midgut epithelium of D. plexippus in vitro and is also absorbed into the body cavity of monarch caterpillars. Remarkably, the same pattern was observed in caterpillars of the related, but non-sequestering milkweed butterfly Euploea core, and even in the non-adapted Solanaceae specialist Manduca sexta, although uptake across gut epithelia occurred at a lower rate. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cardenolides begin to cross the epithelium in the anterior part of the intestine and can be detected in body tissues as soon as one minute after ingestion. Finally, we show that not all cardenolides are translocated into butterfly tissues during metamorphosis, and that the most apolar cardenolides are removed with the last caterpillar exuviae. As a result, adult butterflies contain no cardenolides less polar than the milkweed cardenolide calactin. We conclude that uptake by the intestinal epithelium is a very rapid process and that quantitative differences in cardenolide sequestration among lepidopteran caterpillars are only partially mediated by the gut epithelium, likely involving additional mechanisms such as metabolism or excretion. In addition, the translocation of cardenolides from the caterpillar is a selective process which may be due to the limited mobility of highly apolar cardenolides.

AB  - The coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (Linnaeus 1758) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae) (CRB), is endemic to tropical Asia where it damages both coconut and oil palm. A new invasion by CRB occurred on Guam in 2007 and eradication attempts failed using commonly applied Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) isolates. This and subsequent invasive outbreaks were found to have been caused by a previously unrecognized haplotype, CRB-G, which appeared to be tolerant to OrNV. The male-produced aggregation pheromone of the endemic, susceptible strain of O. rhinoceros (CRB-S) was previously identified as ethyl 4-methyloctanoate. Following reports from growers that commercial lures containing this compound were not attractive to CRB-G, the aim of this work was to identify the pheromone of CRB-G. Initial collections of volatiles from virgin male and female CRB-G adults from the Solomon Islands failed to show any male- or female-specific compounds as candidate pheromone components. Only after five months were significant quantities of ethyl 4-methyloctanoate and 4-methyloctanoic acid produced by males but not by females. No other male-specific compounds could be detected, in particular methyl 4-methyloctanoate, 4-methyl-1-octanol, or 4-methyl-1-octyl acetate, compounds identified in volatiles from some other species of Oryctes. Ethyl 4-methyloctanoate elicited a strong electroantennogram response from both male and female CRB-G, but these other compounds, including 4-methyloctanoic acid, did not. The enantiomers of ethyl 4-methyloctanoate and 4-methyloctanoic acid were conveniently prepared by enzymatic resolution of the commercially-available acid, and the enantiomers of the acid, but not the ester, could be separated by gas chromatography on an enantioselective cyclodextrin phase. Using this approach, both ethyl 4-methyloctanoate and 4-methyloctanoic acid produced by male CRB-G were shown to be exclusively the (R)-enantiomers whereas previous reports had suggested male O. rhinoceros produced the (S)-enantiomers. However, re-examination of the ester and acid produced by male CRB-S from Papua New Guinea showed that these were also the (R)-enantiomers. In field trapping experiments carried out in the Solomon Islands, both racemic and ethyl (R)-4-methyloctanoate were highly attractive to both male and female CRB-G beetles. The (S)-enantiomer and the corresponding acids were only weakly attractive. The addition of racemic 4-methyloctanoic acid to ethyl 4-methyloctanoate did significantly increase attractiveness, but the addition of (R)- or (S)-4-methyloctanoic acid to the corresponding ethyl esters did not. Possible reasons for the difference in assignment of configuration of the components of the CRB pheromone are discussed along with the practical implications of these results.

AB  - Aluminium exposure has been found to impair learning and memory abilities; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study we conducted a double luciferase reporter assay to determine whether miR-351-5p regulates cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) 3 mRNA. To this end, we overexpressed and inhibited miR-351-5p via stereotaxic microinjections of adeno-associated virus (AAV) into the hippocampus of Sprague Dawley rats in a sub-chronic aluminium exposure model to examine learning and memory ability using Morris water maze. Ultrastructural electron microscopy and Golgi staining were used to examine morphological changes in hippocampal neurons. In addition, we examined the levels of synaptic plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) and CPEB3 to determine the involvement of the miR-351-5P/CPEB3/PRPs pathway in aluminium neurotoxicity. Sub-chronic aluminium exposure reduced the spatial learning and memory ability of rats. Overexpression of AAV-miR-351-5P in the hippocampus aggravated the impairment of spatial learning and memory abilities of aluminium-treated rats, whereas inhibition of AAV-miR-351-5p expression alleviated it. Western blotting suggested that sub-chronic aluminium exposure increased miR-351-5p levels and reduced the expression of CPEB3 and PRPs in the hippocampus. Treatment with an AAV-miR-351-5p inhibitor partially recovered CPEB3 and PRPs. Double luciferase reporter assay results showed that CPEB3 was a direct target of miR-351-5p, while electron microscopy suggested that aluminium could damage mitochondria and synapses in the CA1 of the hippocampus. Golgi staining results indicated that aluminium could reduce the number of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons. Inhibition of miR-351-5p restored the synaptic structure and growth of dendritic spines in the hippocampus. The involvement of the miR-351-5P/CPEB3/RPPs pathway in aluminium neurotoxicity was confirmed. Our findings suggest that inhibition of miR-351-5p can alleviate learning and memory impairments by increasing CPEB3 and PRPs.

AB  - Overexposure to manganese (Mn) can induce cognitive deficits, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Microglial dysfunction and autophagic dysfunction have been implicated in Mn neurotoxicity. The neuroprotective effects of resveratrol (RSV) have been studied extensively, but the potential protective effects of RSV against Mn-induced cognitive dysfunction have not been evaluated. We investigated the effects of RSV on Mn-induced changes in PGC-1 alpha, microglial M1/M2 polarization, and autophagy in vivo and in vitro. Kunming mice were treated with saline, MnCl2, RSV, or MnCl2 + RSV. The results showed that RSV improved cognitive dysfunction, suppressed release of inflammatory cytokines, promoted M2 microglial polarization, and increased autophagy in the hippocampi of Mn-treated mice. Furthermore, we also showed that Mn treatment significantly decreased the expression of PGC-1 alpha, ULK1, BDNF, and activated NF-kappa B signaling. These effects were reversed by RSV pretreatment. In addition, RSV inhibited STAT6 acetylation, but did not affect ULK1 acetylation. Knockdown of PGC-1 alpha using LV-PGC-1 alpha shRNA reversed RSV-induced increases in the expression levels of PGC-1 alpha, ULK1, LC3-II, and mitigated the RSV-induced decrease in the expression level of p62, in Mn-treated BV2 cells. Resveratrol-induced M2 polarization and autophagic flux were abolished by LV-PGC-1 alpha shRNA pretreatment. These results showed that RSV exerted neuroprotective effects against Mn-induced learning and memory impairment partially through PGC-1 alpha-mediated microglial M1/M2 polarization and autophagy.

AB  - Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) is a glutathione-independent ferroptosis inhibitory factor. FSP1 has been found to play a crucial role in the regulation of mitochondrial function and ferroptosis. However, its function in porcine early embryonic development remains unknown. In the present research, we found that FSP1 was expressed at different stages during porcine early embryo development. Compared with the control condition, inhibition of FSP1 reduced the cleavage rate at 24 h and 48 h and the blastocyst rate at 144 h. In addition, inhibiting FSP1 reduced the blastocyst diameter, total cell number, and proliferation capacity. Further analysis showed that inhibition of FSP1 significantly increased the levels of ferrous ions (Fe2+) and MDA but not GPX4. We also found that inhibition of FSP1 significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels, which in turn caused excessive accumulation of ROS and decreased the levels of GSH and the activity of the intracellular antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT in embryos. In conclusion, FSP1, an important regulator, participates in regulating the development and quality of porcine early embryos. Inhibition of FSP1 impairs blastocyst formation, induces glutathione-independent ferroptosis, and further leads to oxidative stress due to mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately affecting the developmental competence and impairing the quality of porcine early embryos.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is marked by intracellular tau aggregates in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and extracellular amyloid aggregates in the default network (DN). Here, we examined codependent structural variations between the MTL's most vulnerable structure, the hippocampus (HC), and the DN at subregion resolution in individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD). By leveraging the power of the approximately 40,000 participants of the UK Biobank cohort, we assessed impacts from the protective APOE 2 and the deleterious APOE 4 Alzheimer's disease alleles on these structural relationships. We demonstrate 2 and 4 genotype effects on the inter-individual expression of HC-DN co-variation structural patterns at the population level. Across these HC-DN signatures, recurrent deviations in the CA1, CA2/3, molecular layer, fornix's fimbria, and their cortical partners related to ADRD risk. Analyses of the rich phenotypic profiles in the UK Biobank cohort further revealed male-specific HC-DN associations with air pollution and female-specific associations with cardiovascular traits. We also showed that APOE 2/2 interacts preferentially with HC-DN co-variation patterns in estimating social lifestyle in males and physical activity in females. Our structural, genetic, and phenotypic analyses in this large epidemiological cohort reinvigorate the often-neglected interplay between APOE 2 dosage and sex and link APOE alleles to inter-individual brain structural differences indicative of ADRD familial risk.

AB  - Theanine, a tea plant (Camellia sinensis)-specific non-proteinogenic amino acid, is one of the most important components conferring the taste quality and health benefits of tea. It is primarily synthesized in roots of tea plants and transported to new shoots, where it is mainly distributed to the young stem; however, tea is predominantly produced from young leaves. To promote more theanine allocation to young leaves, the molecular mechanism underlying theanine distribution between stems and leaves requires elucidation. In this study, we found the ratios of stem-to-leaf theanine content in the new shoots of 11 tea plant cultivars ranged from 3.8 to 8.8. Analyses on transcriptome and gene expression demonstrated that the expression of CATIONIC AMINO ACID TRANSPORTER1 (CsCAT1), an amino acid transporter-encoding gene, was highly correlated with the ratios of theanine content in the stem and leaf (r = 0.97, P < 0.0001). Further analyses indicated that CsCAT1 localizes in the plasma membrane and has theanine transport activity. Moreover, CsCAT1 was predominantly expressed in the vascular ray cells in the stem. Finally, we found that repression of CsCAT1 increased theanine content in young leaves and the ratio of leaf-to-stem theanine content. These results indicate that CsCAT1 modulates theanine distribution between stem and leaf and provides a target for increasing theanine content in young leaves of tea plants.

AB  - Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first key enzyme in the metabolic pathway of phenylpropanoid. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is an important secondary metabolite in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway of plants. However, the role of the PAL gene in CGA biosynthesis in Vaccinium dunalianum Wight is still unclear. In this study, seven PAL genes (VdPAL1-VdPAL7) were cloned and analyzed through full-length transcriptome sequencing combined with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification in V. dunalianum. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the seven VdPAL genes contain complete open reading frames (1,860-2,148 bp) encoding hydrophilic proteins of 619-715 amino acids, with molecular weights ranging from 67.44 to 77.70 kDa. The VdPAL proteins contain the PLN02457 domain, with the secondary structures predominantly composed of alpha-helices and the tertiary structures exhibiting a characteristic "hippocampus" conformation. Phylogenetic analysis grouped these VdPAL genes into three subfamilies: VdPAL1, VdPAL3, and the VdPAL2/4/5/6/7 cluster. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis showed that the expression levels of the VdPAL1 and VdPAL4/5/6/7 genes were significantly higher in both tender and mature leaves, in flower buds, flowers, green and red fruits, and in green and red fruit stems than those of VdPAL2 and VdPAL3. In the same tissue type, except for VdPAL2, the expression levels of the other six PAL genes were significantly higher in young tissues compared with mature tissues. The PAL gene family mediates the biosynthesis of CGA in V. dunalianum, with the combined expression of VdPAL1/2/4/5/6/7 showing a positive correlation with the CGA content across the analyzed tissues. These results provide experimental evidence for understanding the composition, structural characteristics, and biological functions of the PAL genes in V. dunalianum.

AB  - Camellia oleifera Abel., recognized as a significant oil plant, is of immense potential health and economic value. Due to the self-incompatibility of C. oleifera, pollination relies on cross-pollination from other flowers. Additionally, the asynchronous flowering periods of individual plants result in low fruit set and yield, which limits the broader cultivation and utilization of this species. The study investigated the dynamic changes and regulatory patterns of different tissues within flower buds from flower bud development to flowering, employing a multi-faceted approach that included cellular dissection, analysis of hormone content, and transcriptome analysis. This study demonstrates that ABA and SA, rather than GA3, IAA, ZT, acts as potentially effective endogenous agents to promote flowering in the later stages of flower development, which is a critical period for the maturation of pollen and embryo sacs; while ZT plays a more significant role in the early stages of flower bud development. Transcriptome analysis indicated that C.oleifera primarily regulates the late stages of flower bud development via regulating genes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism in petals, monoterpene synthesis and ABC transporters in pistils and stamens. WGCNA identified four key modules associated with the development of stamens and pistils in the late stage of C.oleifera flower buds, and also screened out key core genes, including CoBMY7/8, CoTPP6/10, and CoG8H7/11, which are involved in the regulation of flowering time. These findings enhance our understanding of the developmental changes in stamens, pistils, and petals during the flower bud development of C. oleifera. Moreover, they provide a foundation for manipulating flowering time and improving fruit set by regulating the expression of key genes in future studies.

AB  - Trichomes are specialized structures derived from epidermal cells. Non-glandular trichomes primarily protect plants from herbivores and intense ultraviolet radiation by acting as a physical barrier. Recent research has highlighted the importance of homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip) IV transcription factors (TFs) in promoting trichome development. In this study, an HD-Zip III TF called PHAVOLUTA (BjPHVa) was identified as a negative regulator of non-glandular trichome initiation in Brassica juncea. Genome editing of BjPHVa resulted in a significant increase in trichome number in B. juncea. Co-expression networks revealed a strong association between trichome development and the HD-Zip family, which was supported by transcriptomic analysis findings. An R2R3-MYB TF, BjGL1a, a key regulator of trichome development, was found to be associated with BjPHVa-regulated trichome development. Knockdown of BjGL1a expression resulted in reduced trichome number in B. juncea. BjPHVa was observed to interact directly with BjGL1a while binding to the BjGL1a promoter, resulting in the inhibition of BjGL1a transcription. These results provide new insights into the identification of regulators involved in trichome development and offer new opportunities to enhance resistance to predicted stresses through genome editing targeting PHVa within Brassicaceae.

AB  - The conquest of land posed severe problems to plants which they had to cope with by adapting biosynthetic capacities. Adaptations to respond to UV irradiation, water loss, pathogen and herbivore defense, and the earth's pull were essential. Chemical compounds alleviating these problems can be synthesized by the phenylpropanoid pathway, the core of which are three enzymes: phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase, and 4-coumaric acid coenzyme A-ligase (4CL). The genomes of model organisms, Chara braunii as aquatic alga and the two bryophytes Physcomitrium patens and Marchantia polymorpha, were searched for sequences encoding PAL and 4CL and selected sequences heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli for biochemical characterization. Several possible isoforms were identified for both enzymes in Marchantia polymorpha and Physcomitrium patens, while only one or two isoforms could be retrieved for Chara braunii. Active forms of both enzymes were found in all three organisms, although the catalytic efficiencies varied in a wide range. l-Phenylalanine was accepted as best substrate by all PAL-like enzymes, despite annotations in some cases suggesting different activities. The substrate spectrum of 4CLs was more diverse, but caffeic and/or 4-coumaric acids generally were the best-accepted substrates. Our investigations show that PAL and 4CL, important enzymes for the formation of phenolic compounds, are present and active in extant charophytes and bryophytes as model organisms for the conquest of land.

AB  - The lycophyte Phylloglossum drummondii is the sole inhabitant of its genus in the Huperzioideae group and one of a small minority of plants which perform uridine to cytidine RNA editing. We assembled the P. drummondii chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes and used RNA sequence data to build a comprehensive profile of organellar RNA editing events. In addition to many C-to-U editing events in both organelles, we found just four U-to-C editing events in the mitochondrial transcripts cob, nad1, nad5 and rpl2. These events are conserved in related lycophytes in the genera Huperzia and Phlegmariurus. De novo transcriptomes for three of these lycophytes were assembled to search for putative U-to-C RNA editing enzymes. Four putative U-to-C editing factors could be matched to the four mitochondrial U-to-C editing sites. Due to the unusually few numbers of U-to-C RNA editing sites, P. drummondii and related lycophytes are useful models for studying this poorly understood mechanism.

AB  - Genetic reprogramming of differentiated cells is studied broadly in multicellular Viridiplantae as an adaptation to herbivory or damage; however, mechanisms underlying cell development and redifferentiation are largely unknown in red algae, their nearest multicellular relatives. Here we investgate cell reprogramming in the widely cultivated, edible seaweed Neopyropia yezoesis ("nori"), where vegetative cells in wounded blades differentiate and release as large numbers of asexual spores. Based upon physiological changes and transcriptomic dynamics after wound stress in N. yezoensis and its congener Neoporphyra haitanensis, another cultivar that does not differentiate spores after wounding, we propose a three-phase model of wound-induced spore development in N. yezoensis. In Phase I, propagation of ROS by RBOH and SOD elicites systematic transduction of the wound signal, while Ca2+ dependent signaling induces cell reprogramming. In Phase II, a TOR signaling pathway and regulation of cyclin and CDK genes result in cell divisions that spread inward from the wound edge. Once sporangia form, Phase III involves expression of proteins required for spore maturation and cell wall softening. Our analyses not only provide the first model for core molecular processes controlling cellular reprogramming in rhodophytes, but also have practical implications for achieving greater control over seeding in commercial nori farming.

AB  - Flavan-3-ols are abundant in the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) and confer tea with flavor and health benefits. We recently found that alternative splicing of genes is likely involved in the regulation of flavan-3-ol biosynthesis; however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics to construct metabolite-gene networks in tea leaves, collected over five different months and from five spatial positions, and found positive correlations between endogenous jasmonic acid (JA), flavan-3-ols, and numerous transcripts. Transcriptome mining further identified CsJAZ1, which is negatively associated with flavan-3-ols formation and has three CsJAZ1 transcripts, one full-length (CsJAZ1-1), and two splice variants (CsJAZ1-2 and -3) that lacked 3 ' coding sequences, with CsJAZ1-3 also lacking the coding region for the Jas domain. Confocal microscopy showed that CsJAZ1-1 was localized to the nucleus, while CsJAZ1-2 and CsJAZ1-3 were present in both the nucleus and the cytosol. In the absence of JA, CsJAZ1-1 was bound to CsMYC2, a positive regulator of flavan-3-ol biosynthesis; CsJAZ1-2 functioned as an alternative enhancer of CsJAZ1-1 and an antagonist of CsJAZ1-1 in binding to CsMYC2; and CsJAZ1-3 did not interact with CsMYC2. In the presence of JA, CsJAZ1-3 interacted with CsJAZ1-1 and CsJAZ1-2 to form heterodimers that stabilized the CsJAZ1-1-CsMYC2 and CsJAZ1-2-CsMYC2 complexes, thereby repressing the transcription of four genes that act late in the flavan-3-ol biosynthetic pathway.

AB  - This study prepared sulfonated Camellia oleifera shell biochar using Camellia oleifera shell agricultural waste as a carbon source, and evaluated its performance as a catalyst for preparing biodiesel. The biochar obtained from carbonizing Camellia oleifera shells at 500 degrees C for 2 h serves as the carbon skeleton, and then the biochar is sulfonated with chlorosulfonic acid. The sulfonic acid groups are mainly grafted onto the surface of Camellia oleifera shell biochar through covalent bonding to obtain sulfonic acid type biochar catalysts. The catalysts were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Nitrogen adsorption-desorption Brunel-Emmett-Taylor Theory (BET), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The acid density of the sulfonated Camellia oleifera fruit shell biochar catalyst is 2.86 mmol/g, and the specific surface area is 2.67 m(2)/g, indicating high catalytic activity. The optimal reaction conditions are 4 wt% catalyst with a 6:1 alcohol to oil ratio. After esterification at 70 degrees C for 2 h, the yield of biodiesel was 91.4%. Under the optimal reaction conditions, after four repeated uses of the catalyst, the yield of biodiesel still reached 90%. Therefore, sulfonated Camellia oleifera shell biochar is a low-cost, green, non-homogeneous catalyst with great potential for biodiesel production by esterification reaction in future development.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Dachaihu Decoction (DD), a classic Chinese herbal prescription, is composed of radix of Bupleurum chinense DC. (Chaihu), radix of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Huangqin), radix of Paeonia lactiflora Pall. (Baishao), rhizoma of Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit. (Banxia), fructus of Citrus aurantium L. (Zhishi), rhizoma of Zingiber officinale Rosc. (Shengjiang), fructus of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. (Dazao) and rhizoma of Rheum officinale Baill. (Dahuang). DD has the traditional effects of soothing the liver, relieving depression and clearing heat from the stomach, and is mainly used to treat heat stagnation in the liver and stomach.Aim of the study: Dachaihu decoction (DD), a classic prescription commonly used in clinical practice for the treatment of pancreatitis and cholecystitis. Although its pharmacological effects are clear, the efficacy components and mechanism of action remain intricate and difficult to clarify. Materials and methods: The action targets and components of the anti-inflammatory activity of DD were predicted by network pharmacology; the effective components and targets were verified by HPLC and qPCR; the efficacy markers of DD were further screened by in vitro experiments; the pharmacological value of DD and its components compatibility were evaluated by in vitro experiments.Results: The key targets MMP9, JAK2, MAP2K1 and NR3C1 were screened by network pharmacology; HPLC analysis showed that paeoniflorin, naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein and saikosaponin B2 were identified as potential efficacy markers of DD; molecular docking combined with qPCR verification suggested that baicalin, naringin, neohesperidin, hesperidin and baicalein and wogonoside had certain ability to regulate above targets; in vitro studies revealed that paeoniflorin, naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein and saikosaponin B2 could inhibit the release of NO, pancreatic lipase and alpha-glucosidase; after comprehensive comparison and analysis, naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein and saikosaponin B2 were selected as the efficacy markers of DD; in vivo studies indicated that DD and its efficacy markers (components compatibility) had definite therapeutic effects on guinea pigs with cholecystitis.Conclusions: The efficacy markers of DD including naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein and saikosaponin B2 can be used as components compatibility to exert anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, a method for obtaining the compatibility of efficacy markers by simplifying the prescription is initially established.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of INRA82 extender on ram semen quality preserved in cooled and frozen conditions in comparison with Tris-based extenders and to select the suitable extender for ram semen preservation.
   Methods: Semen samples were collected and pooled from Awassi rams (n=5) and divided into three aliquots. Each aliquot was diluted with one of the following extenders: 1) Tris-citrate glucose, 2) Tris-citrate fructose, and 3) INRA-82. For liquid storage, diluted samples were kept at 5 degrees C for 72 h. Progressive motility was measured at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h after cooling. Besides, viability, morphology, membrane, acrosome and DNA integrities were evaluated at 24 h post-cooling. For cryopreservation, diluted samples were cooled, equilibrated, loaded and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Thawed samples were evaluated in the same manner as cooled conditions.
   Results: Seminal characteristics were improved after cooling and thawing in samples diluted with INRA-82 compared to those diluted with Tris-citrate glucose or Tris-citrate fructose (P<0.05).
   Conclusions: Dilution of ram semen with INRA-82 improves semen parameters. Hence, INRA-82, as a stimulating diluent, can be successfully used to reserve viability and sustainability of cooled and cryopreserved ram semen.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) occurs frequently clinically as a complication following cardiovascular resuscitation resulting in neuronal damage specifically to the hippocampal CA1 region with consequent cognitive impairment. Apoptosis and oxidative stress were proposed as major risk factors associated with CIRI development. Previously, glycosides obtained from Cistanche deserticola (CGs) were shown to play a key role in counteracting CIRI; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of CGs on subsequent CIRI in rats. The model of CIRI was established for 2 hr and reperfusion for 24 hr by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. The MCAO rats were used to measure the antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects of CGs on CIRI. Neurological function was evaluated by the Longa neurological function score test. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was used to detect the area of cerebral infarction. Nissl staining was employed to observe neuronal morphology. TUNEL staining was used to detect neuronal apoptosis, while Western blot determined protein expression levels of factors for apoptosis-related and PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Data demonstrated that CGs treatment improved behavioral performance, brain injury, and enhanced antioxidant and anti-apoptosis in CIRI rats. In addition, CGs induced activation of PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway accompanied by inhibition of the expression of apoptosis-related factors. Evidence indicates that CGs amelioration of CIRI involves activation of the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway associated with increased cellular viability suggesting these glycosides may be considered as an alternative compound for CIRI treatment.

AB  - Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a prevalent upper respiratory condition that manifests in two primary subtypes: CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). While previous studies indicate a correlation between air pollution and CRS, the role of genetic predisposition in this relationship remains largely unexplored. We hypothesized that higher air pollution exposure would lead to the development of CRS, and that genetic susceptibility might modify this association. Methods: This cohort study involving 367,298 adult participants from the UK Biobank, followed from March 2006 to October 2021. Air pollution metrics were estimated at residential locations using land -use regression models. Cox proportional hazard models were employed to explore the associations between air pollution exposure and CRS, CRSwNP, and CRSsNP. A polygenic risk score (PRS) was constructed to evaluate the joint effect of air pollution and genetic predisposition on the development of CRS. Results: We found that the risk of CRS increased under long-term exposure to PM 2.5 [the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % CIs: 1.59 (1.26-2.01)], PM 10 [1.64 (1.26-2.12)], NO 2 [1.11 (1.04-1.17)], and NO x [1.18 (1.12-1.25)], respectively. These effects were more pronounced among participants with CRSwNP, although the differences were not statistically significant. Additionally, we found that the risks for CRS and CRSwNP increased in a graded manner among participants with higher PRS or higher exposure to PM 2.5 , PM 10 , or NO x concentrations. However, no multiplicative or additive interactions were observed. Conclusions: Long-term exposure to air pollution increases the risk of CRS, particularly CRSwNP underscoring the need to prioritize clean air initiatives and environmental regulations.

AB  - Background Genomic data have unveiled a fascinating aspect of the evolutionary past, showing that the mingling of different species through hybridization has left its mark on the histories of numerous life forms. However, the relationship between hybridization events and the origins of cyprinid fishes remains unclear.Results In this study, we generated de novo assembled genomes of 8 cyprinid fishes and conducted phylogenetic analyses on 24 species. Widespread allele sharing across species boundaries was observed within 7 subfamilies of cyprinid fishes. Based on a systematic analysis of multiple tissues, we found that the testis exhibited a conserved pattern of divergence between the herbivorous Megalobrama amblycephala and the carnivorous Culter alburnus, suggesting a potential link to incomplete reproductive isolation. Significant differences in the expression of 4 genes (dpp2, ctrl, psb7, and ppce) in the liver and intestine, accompanied by variations in enzyme activities, indicated swift divergence in digestive enzyme secretion. Moreover, we identified introgressed genes linked to organ development in sympatric fishes with analogous feeding habits within the Cultrinae and Leuciscinae subfamilies.Conclusions Our findings highlight the significant role played by incomplete reproductive isolation and frequent gene flow events, particularly those associated with the development of digestive organs, in driving speciation among cyprinid fishes in diverse freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Main conclusionEctopic expression of Camellia oleifera Abel. gibberellin 20-oxidase 1 caused a taller phenotype, promoted secondary cell wall deposition, leaf enlargement, and early flowering, and reduced chlorophyll and anthocyanin accumulation and seed enlargement phenotype in Arabidopsis.Plant height and secondary cell wall (SCW) deposition are important plant traits. Gibberellins (GAs) play important roles in regulating plant height and SCWs deposition. Gibberellin 20-oxidase (GA20ox) is an important enzyme involved in GA biosynthesis. In the present study, we identified a GA synthesis gene in Camellia oleifera. The total length of the CoGA20ox1 gene sequence was 1146 bp, encoding 381 amino acids. Transgenic plants with CoGA20ox1 had a taller phenotype; a seed enlargement phenotype; promoted SCWs deposition, leaf enlargement, and early flowering; and reduced chlorophyll and anthocyanin accumulation. Genetic analysis showed that the mutant ga20ox1-3 Arabidopsis partially rescued the phenotype of CoGA20ox1 overexpression plants. The results showed that CoGA20ox1 participates in the growth and development of C. oleifera. The morphological changes in CoGA20ox1 overexpressed plants provide a theoretical basis for further exploration of GA biosynthesis and analysis of the molecular mechanism in C. oleifera.

AB  - It is thought arboreal species avoid foraging on the ground due to perceived predation risk, making the study of when and where arboreal species use the ground key in understanding foraging versus safety tradeoffs. We used publicly available, opportunistic, camera-trap observations from surveys across Madagascar to examine whether arboreal lemur ground use was spatially and temporally related to fosa (Cryptoprocta ferox), a native predator, and human presence. We observed 14 species of diurnal lemur (n = 287 individual observations) and six species of nocturnal lemur (n = 105 individual observations). With static two-species occupancy models and kernel density estimation, we found diurnal and nocturnal lemur ground use was spatially and temporally related to fosa presence. Diurnal lemurs used the ground less at camera locations where fosa were present compared to camera locations where they were absent, particularly if those camera locations lacked other native carnivores. Nocturnal lemurs used the ground more at camera locations fosa were observed at within the past 5 days compared with camera locations where fosa were not observed at within the past 5 days. Despite humans and diurnal lemurs being active at the same time 80% of the diel cycle (temporal overlap & UDelta; = 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75-0.85), diurnal lemur spatial or temporal use of the ground and human presence were unrelated. Diurnal lemur temporal overlap with humans at camera locations where fosa were uncommon was higher (& UDelta; = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.71-0.86) compared with where fosa were common (& UDelta; = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.46-0.66). Future research on how arboreal lemurs navigate ground use in a multipredator landscape should include behavioral observations to better understand animal decision-making.

AB  - Physical or psychological stress experienced by a mother during gestation is often associated with serious behavioural and cognitive deficits in newborns. Investigations of protective agents, which could prevent the adverse outcomes of prenatal stress (PS), are warranted. Agmatine is a neurotransmitter putatively involved in the physiological response to stress, and exogenous administration of agmatine has been shown to produce a variety of neuroprotective effects. In this study, we aimed to assess whether prenatal agmatine exposure could ameliorate behavioural and cognitive deficits in female offspring born to prenatally stressed mice. Pregnant Swiss Webster (SW) mice were exposed to physical or psychological stress from the 11th to 17th days of gestation. Agmatine (37.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated 30 min before the induction of stress for seven consecutive days. The pups were assessed using a variety of behavioural tests and molecular assays on postnatal days 40 to 47. Agmatine attenuated impairments in locomotor activity, anxiety-like behaviour, and drug-seeking behaviour associated with both physical and psychological PS. Furthermore, agmatine reduced PS-induced impairments in passive avoidance memory and learning. Neither PS nor agmatine treatment affected the mRNA expression level of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Taken together, our findings highlight the protective effects of prenatally administered agmatine on PS-mediated behavioural and cognitive deficits of the offspring. Future studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, which could allow for more targeted prenatal treatments.

AB  - Background The aim of this study is to investigate role of Visfatin, one of the pro-inflammatory adipokines, in sepsis-induced intestinal injury and to clarify the potential mechanism. Methods C57BL/6 mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery to establish sepsis model in vivo. Intestinal epithelial cells were stimulated with LPS to mimic sepsis-induced intestinal injury in vitro. FK866 (the inhibitor of Visfatin) with or without XMU-MP-1 (the inhibitor of Hippo signaling) was applied for treatment. The expression levels of Visfatin, NF-kappa B and Hippo signaling pathways-related proteins were detected by western blot or immunohistochemistry. The intestinal cell apoptosis and intestinal injury were investigated by TUNEL staining and H&E staining, respectively. ELISA was used to determine the production of inflammatory cytokines. Results The expression of Visfatin increased in CLP mice. FK866 reduced intestinal pathological injury, inflammatory cytokines production, and intestinal cell apoptosis in sepsis mice. Meanwhile, FK866 affected NF-kappa B and Hippo signaling pathways. Additionally, the effects of FK866 on inflammatory response, apoptosis, Hippo signaling and NF-kappa B signaling were partly abolished by XMU-MP-1, the inhibitor of Hippo signaling. In vitro experiments also revealed that FK866 exhibited a protective role against LPS-induced inflammatory response and apoptosis in intestinal cells, as well as regulating NF-kappa B and Hippo signaling, whereas addition of XMU-MP-1 weakened the protective effects of FK866. Conclusion In short, this study demonstrated that inhibition of Visfatin might alleviate sepsis-induced intestinal injury through Hippo signaling pathway, supporting a further research on Visfatin as a therapeutic target.

AB  - BackgroundHabenaria species typically produce green or white flowers, bear nectar spurs, emit crepuscular-nocturnal scents, and are usually pollinated by crepuscular/nocturnal moths. However, the roles of floral traits in pollinator differentiation contributing to reproductive success in sympatric Habenaria species require further definition. In this study, we investigated flowering phenology, floral traits, pollinator behavior, and reproductive success of two co-occurring and co-blooming Habenaria species (H. ciliolaris and H. schindleri) in southeastern China. We also conducted intraspecific and interspecific hand pollinations to determine their respective breeding systems and the extent of interspecific post-pollination isolation.ResultsBoth species are self-compatible but rely on pollinators for sexual reproduction. Habenaria ciliolaris was pollinated by two species of nocturnal, settling moths (Thinopteryx nebulosa and Porsica sp.). They foraged for nectar upside down or from one side, carrying pollinaria on their eyes because the curved lateral lobes of the labellum block the movements of settling moths on these flowers. Habenaria schindleri was pollinated by two crepuscular hawkmoths (Eupanacra mydon and Hippotion rafflesi), which carried pollinaria between their palpi while hovering in front of flowers while taking nectar. The proboscis lengths of pollinators of both Habenaria species matched the spur lengths of their corresponding flowers. Habenaria ciliolaris experienced a high level of inbreeding depression. Interspecific pollination by applying pollen grains from H. schindleri to the stigmas of H. ciliolaris, resulted in a low level of seed set.ConclusionsDifferences in floral morphology and nectar volume/concentration appear to contribute to segregating members of the pollinator guild of some Habenaria species. These findings offer new insights to our understanding of the partitioning of pollinators between co-blooming congeners in the Orchidaceae.

AB  - Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz, a member of the Brassicaceae, has potential as a biofuel feedstock which is attributable to the production of fatty acids in its seeds, its fast growth cycle, and low input requirements. While a genome assembly is available for camelina, it was generated from short sequence reads and is thus highly fragmented in nature. Using long read sequences, we generated a chromosome-scale, highly contiguous genome assembly (644,491,969 bp) for the spring biotype cultivar 'Suneson' with an N50 contig length of 12,031,512 bp and a scaffold N50 length of 32,184,682 bp. Annotation of protein-coding genes revealed 91,877 genes that encode 133,355 gene models. We identified a total of 4,467 genes that were significantly up-regulated under cold stress which were enriched in gene ontology terms associated with "response to cold" and "response to abiotic stress". Coexpression analyses revealed multiple coexpression modules that were enriched in genes differentially expressed following cold stress that had putative functions involved in stress adaptation, specifically within the plastid. With access to a highly contiguous genome assembly, comparative analyses with Arabidopsis thaliana revealed 23,625 A. thaliana genes syntenic with 45,453 Suneson genes. Of these, 24,960 Suneson genes were syntenic to 8,320 A. thaliana genes reflecting a 3 camelina homeolog to 1 Arabidopsis gene relationship and retention of all three homeologs. Some of the retained triplicated homeologs showed conserved gene expression patterns under control and cold-stressed conditions whereas other triplicated homeologs displayed diverged expression patterns revealing sub- and neo-functionalization of the homeologs at the transcription level. Access to the chromosome-scale assembly of Suneson will enable both basic and applied research efforts in the improvement of camelina as a sustainable biofuel feedstock.

AB  - PremiseTrimerophytes are a plexus of early tracheophytes that form the base of the euphyllophyte clade and, thus, represent the link between the earliest land plants and modern-day ferns, sphenophytes, and seed plants. As the best-characterized trimerophyte, the genus Psilophyton occupies a key position in the euphyllophyte fossil record. We describe a new Psilophyton species that has implications for the evolution of plant-animal interactions. MethodsThe fossil material is preserved by permineralization in the Lower Devonian (Emsian) Battery Point Formation (Quebec, Canada) and was studied in serial sections using the cellulose acetate peel technique. ResultsPsilophyton diakanthon sp. nov. differs from other Psilophyton species in possessing fibers that form a discontinuous layer in the inner cortex and two distinct types of spinescent emergences whose anatomy and morphology are consistent with roles in anti-herbivore defense. ConclusionsPsilophyton diakanthon adds another species to an already diverse genus. Its two morphologically distinct types of spinescence suggest that herbivory was rampant in plant-animal interactions and demonstrate that anti-herbivory defenses had reached a previously unrecognized level of sophistication by 400 million years ago, in the Early Devonian.

AB  - Camellia sinensis L. is well known plant, belongs to the family Theaceae. In the present investigation, the pharmacognostic standardization of stem leaf and seed was carried out. Macroscopic, microscopic, preliminary phytochemical screening and fluorescence analysis of different morphological parts of C. sinensis L. were carried out. The aim of present study is not only to evaluate novel and attractive features of such an important plant but also to elaborate the quality of this common plant which is considered most popular drink in this region. The macroscopic and microscopic evaluation showing the analytical and diagnostic features of different morphological parts of the plants by sensory method is helpful for the authentication of the plant. Phytochemical screening assists in determining the primary and secondary metabolites like flavonoids, resins, tannins, alkaloids, glycosides, fixed oils, volatile oils, lignins, saponins, steroids, terpenes, carbohydrates, proteins, fats and amino acids. The investigation was made by the fluorescence analysis at both visible and UV light (i.e, 254 and 366 lambda max) which was not only useful in detecting the colored compounds visible to naked eye but also helpful in gaining the information about the chromophore group and conjugation system. It indicated that the purity and quality of the plant drug could be established by pharmacognostic evaluation method. The results shows the presence of primary metabolites in different quantity in various plant parts which are helpful for identification, therapeutic and pharmacological evaluation and even for the development of monograph as the food cum drug.

AB  - Cucumber fields were surveyed in the vicinity of Sargodha to map the spatial and temporal CMV disease distribution. Infected samples were collected for pathogenicity tests, biophysical properties and serological assays. After confirmation of virus; data of disease prevalence, incidence and severity was recorded which showed strong positive linear relationship. There was gradual increase in disease after each temporal assessment. Bhatti Town (BT) showed more than 90% disease prevalence followed by College of Agriculture (COA) and Adaptive Research Farm (ARF). This experiment also demonstrated the significant contribution of NPK solution, Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), benzothiadiazole (BTH) and elephant ear plant (EEP) extract in improving the cucumber performance against CMV disease. There was positive linear relationship between all disease parameters. All the treatments gave significant contribution for sustainable disease management. NPK was the efficient among rest of the treatments with more than 75% disease inhibition. The second most effective treatment was BTH followed by NAA and EEP with 63%, 55% and 39% disease control, respectively. The study provided useful information for estimation disease dynamics in varied spatio-temporal scales. It could be concluded that NPK and BTH are the suitable tools for sustainable management of CMV disease.

AB  - Sea buckthorn (Hippophae neurocarpa), a plant with both medicinal and edible properties, exhibits high content of serotonin with a unique brown color. Here, we assemble the 1002.54 Mb genome sequence of H. neurocarpa and find that it has evolved from two sequential polyploidizations with four sub-genomes. Based on in vitro enzyme activity and transient overexpression experiments, we confirm that the expression of both HnT5H1 and HnT5H2 genes from tandem duplication contributes to high accumulation of serotonin in sea buckthorn. Furthermore, we verify that the HnGLK1 gene plays a crucial role in continuous chlorophyll accumulation, driving the brown color formation of H. neurocarpa fruit. Collectively, the high-quality genome of H. neurocarpa offers valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying serotonin biosynthesis and abnormal coloration and serves as a valuable resource for further functional genomic studies and molecular breeding efforts in sea buckthorn.

AB  - The widespread Apiaceae family includes many well-known and economically important plants that are cultivated as food or spices. Many produce essential oils and are generally a source of secondary metabolites and compounds that have numerous applications in daily life. In this study, the chemical composition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ultrastructure and biological activity of the Mediterranean endemic species Cheaerophyllum coloratum L. are investigated, as literature data for this plant species are generally very scarce. The essential oil and hydrosol were extracted from the air-dried leaves by hydrodistillation and the chemical composition of both extracts was analysed by GC-MS in conjunction with headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) of VOCs from the hydrosol and the fresh plant material. In the composition of the essential oil, the oxygenated sesquiterpenes spathulenol and caryophyllene oxide were the most abundant components. In the fresh plant material, non-oxygenated sesquiterpenes dominated, with beta-caryophyllene and germacrene D being the main components. The hydrosol was dominated by monoterpenes, with the oxygenated monoterpene p-cymen-8-ol being the most abundant. Light and electron micrographs of the leaf of C. coloratum show secretory structures, and we hypothesize that glandular leaf trichomes, secretory epidermal cells and secretory canals are involved in the production of volatiles and their secretion on the leaf surface. Since the biological potential of C. coloratum is poorly investigated, we tested its cytotoxic activity on cancer and healthy cell lines and its antiviral activity on plants infected with tobacco mosiac virus (TMV). Our results dealing with the composition, ultrastructure and biological activity show that C. coloratum represent a hidden valuable plant species with a potential for future research.

AB  - The RADIALIS-like (RL) proteins are v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB)-related transcription factors (TFs), and are involved in many biological processes, including metabolism, development, and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the studies on the RL genes of Camellia sinensis are not comprehensive enough. Therefore, we undertook this study and identified eight CsaRLs based on the typical conserved domain SANT Associated domain (SANT) of RL. These genes have low molecular weights and theoretical pI values ranging from 5.67 to 9.76. Gene structure analysis revealed that six CsaRL genes comprise two exons and one intron, while the other two contain a single exon encompassing motifs 1 and 2, and part of motif 3. The phylogenetic analysis divided one hundred and fifty-eight RL proteins into five primary classes, in which CsaRLs clustered in Group V and were homologous with CssRLs of the Shuchazao variety. In addition, we selected different tissue parts to analyze the expression profile of CsaRLs, and the results show that almost all genes displayed variable expression levels across tissues, with CsaRL1a relatively abundant in all tissues. qRT-PCR (real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR) was used to detect the relative expression levels of the CsaRL genes under various abiotic stimuli, and it was found that CsaRL1a expression levels were substantially higher than other genes, with abscisic acid (ABA) causing the highest expression. The self-activation assay with yeast two-hybrid system showed that CsaRL1a has no transcriptional activity. According to protein functional interaction networks, CsaRL1a was well connected with WIN1-like, lysine histidine transporter-1-like, beta-amylase 3 chloroplastic-like, carbonic anhydrase-2-like (CA2), and carbonic anhydrase dnaJC76 (DJC76). This study adds to our understanding of the RL family and lays the groundwork for further research into the function and regulatory mechanisms of the CsaRLs gene family in Camellia sinensis.

AB  - Foodborne pathogens are a major cause of concern as they are responsible for food spoilage or microbial diseases, leading to economic loss to the food industry as well as health issues. The problem of increased resistance to available antimicrobial agents, and the ability of the microorganisms to form protective biofilms, strengthens their capacity to resist treatment. The antimicrobial, anti-biofilm and antioxidant activities and cytotoxicity of six South African plants, Carpobrotus edulis, Vachellia rehmanniana, Vachellia xanthophloea, Kigelia africana, Elephantorrhiza elephantina and Ochna pretoriensis, were investigated. Plants were selected based on traditional use against foodborne diseases or known antimicrobial activity. Serial microdilution and crystal violet assays were used to assess the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm potential of the extracts. Antioxidant activity of the extracts was determined against free radicals in vitro, and a tetrazolium-based cell viability assay was used to investigate cytotoxicity. Extracts were active against microorganisms implicated in causing foodborne diseases, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.02 to 2.5 mg/ml. Acetone extracts of V. xanthophloea and C. edulis had noteworthy MIC values of 0.02 mg/ml against Enterobacter cloacae. Most extracts selectively reduced biofilm growth by at least 50% against the foodborne pathogens. The acetone extract of V. xanthophloea had the most significant anti-biofilm activity against Salmonella Typhimurium. The methanol extract of V. xanthophloea and the acetone extract of C. edulis had good antioxidant activity. Leaf extracts of the selected plants have useful bioactivities coupled with low cytotoxicity, providing impetus for further studies on possible development of these plants as protective food additives against microbial attack or oxidation.

AB  - The proliferation and steroidogenesis of mammalian ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) are related to follicular development. Previous studies found that fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) regulated female fertility through the hypothalamicepituitaryegonad axis. However, FGF21 receptors are expressed on GCs, so we speculate that it might affect female reproduction by regulating their physiological activities. Here, we showed that FGF21, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1(FGFR1), and beta-klotho (KLB) were expressed in porcine GCs. ELISA assays showed that estradiol (E2) production was increased significantly when treating GCs with recombinant FGF21 (rFGF21). In addition, rFGF21 upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of E2 synthesis-related genes including StAR, CYP11A1, and CYP19A1 in porcine GCs. Correspondingly, FGF21 siRNA inhibited E2 levels and its synthesis-related gene expression. After rFGF21 treatment, CCK8 showed increased cell viability, and flow cytometry showed that the number of S phase increased, and cycle-related genes also increased. However, treatment with FGF21 siRNA to porcine GCs suppressed the cell cycle, viability, and EdU positive cell number. Consequently, FGF21/FGFR1/KLB forms a complex to activate the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and further promote the proliferation and E2 synthesis in porcine GCs. Collectively, these findings suggests that FGF21 regulates porcine ovarian folliculogenesis.

AB  - In almost all species of the genus Passiflora, the plants in the juvenile stage produce leaves with a different morphology when compared to adult plants. During the juvenile stage, Passiflora organensis typically has variegated leaves, and in adult plants leaves are non-variegated and have extrafloral nectaries. Studies have shown that variegation in plants is not just a color change, but has adaptive functions that can benefit plants. We show here that the variegated leaves observed in P. organensis in the juvenile stage occur due to a mechanism in which intercellular spaces are present between the epidermis and palisade parenchyma cells in the adaxial side of the leaves. We also show that both the green and the white-silverish sectors of the leaves contain well-developed chloroplasts, with no significant differences in the efficiency of Photosystem II. We hypothesize that leaf variegation in P. organensis represents an adaptation to protect juvenile plants from herbivores and environmental stresses.

AB  - Chitinases are believed to act as defense proteins when plants are exposed to heavy metal stress. Typical Class I chitinase genes were cloned from Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Rhizophora stylosa, Kandelia obovata, and Avicennia marina using the methods of reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. All four cDNA sequences of chitinase from the mangrove plants were 1092 bp in length and consisted of an open reading frame of 831 bp, encoding 276 amino acids. However, there were differences in the sequences among the four mangrove species. Four gene proteins have a signal peptide, are located in the vacuole, and belong to the GH19 chitinase family. The sequence of chitinase was highly similar to the protein sequences of Camellia fraternal chitinases. A real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the chitinase expressions of the above four mangrove species exposed to different concentrations of heavy metal at different times. The gene expression of chitinase was higher in Bruguiera gymnorrhiza leaves than in other mangrove plant species. With an increase in heavy metal stress, the expression level of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza increased continuously. These results suggest that chitinase plays an important role in improving the heavy metal tolerance of mangrove plants.

AB  - center dot Plants often protect themselves from their own bioactive defense metabolites by storing them in less active forms. Consequently, plants also need systems allowing correct spatiotemporal reactivation of such metabolites, for instance under pathogen or herbivore attack.
   center dot Via co-expression analysis with public transcriptomes, we determined that the model legume Medicago truncatula has evolved a two-component system composed of a beta-glucosidase, denominated G1, and triterpene saponins, which are physically separated from each other in intact cells.
   center dot G1 expression is root-specific, stress-inducible, and coregulated with that of the genes encoding the triterpene saponin biosynthetic enzymes. However, the G1 protein is stored in the nucleolus and is released and united with its typically vacuolar-stored substrates only upon tissue damage, partly mediated by the surfactant action of the saponins themselves. Subsequently, enzymatic removal of carbohydrate groups from the saponins creates a pool of metabolites with an increased broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.
   center dot The evolution of this defense system benefited from both the intrinsic condensation abilities of the enzyme and the bioactivity properties of its substrates. We dub this two-component system the saponin bomb, in analogy with the mustard oil and cyanide bombs, commonly used to describe the renowned beta-glucosidase-dependent defense systems for glucosinolates and cyanogenic glucosides.

AB  - Background and aimsIn 1997, Tsou described the special differentiation of the connective tissues of some species of Theaceae to produce single-celled powders with unique patterns called pseudopollen. The purpose of this study was to investigate the morphological structure of the pseudopollen of Camellia oleifera (Theaceae) and to study the morphology of pseudopollen in seven other Camellia species. MethodsScanning electron microscopy, paraffin section, light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, histochemistry. Key resultC. oleifera pseudopollen was similar to normal pollen in macroscopic morphology but different microscopically. The normal pollen was starch-rich and yellow, with mostly reticulate exine ornamentation. In contrast, the pseudopollen was a white powder, single-celled and rich in protein, with parallel unbranched ridge lines on the outer wall, and originated from the parenchyma of the connective tissues. There are also differences in the micro-characteristics of normal and pseudopollen among different species in Camellia. ConclusionThere are great differences in morphological structure between C. oleifera and other species in Camellia normal pollen and pseudopollen; these results may indicate that the pseudopollen can be used as a taxonomic basis for Camellia, and the macroscopic similarity between pseudopollen and pollen and histochemical characteristics of pseudopollen can be a pollination strategy.

AB  - As a preferred nitrogen form, ammonium (NH4+) transport via specific transporters is particularly important for the growth and development of tea plants (Camellia sinensis L). However, our understanding of the functions of the AMT family in tea plants is limited. We identified and named 16 putative AMT genes according to phylogenetic analysis. All CsAMT genes were divided into three groups, distributed on 12 chromosomes with only one segmental duplication repetition. The CsAMT genes showed different expression levels in different organs, and most of them were expressed mainly in the apical buds and roots. Complementation analysis of yeast mutants showed that CsAMTs restored the uptake of NH4+. This study provides insights into the genome-wide distribution and spatial expression of AMT genes in tea plants.

AB  - Theanine is the component endowing tea infusion with "umami" taste and antidepression benefits. Theanine is primarily synthesized and stored in root in winter and is transported via vascular tissues to the new shoot in spring. However, the mechanism underlying theanine storage in the root of tea plants remains largely unknown. Cationic amino acid transporter 2 (CsCAT2) in tea plants is homologous to glutamine permease 1 (GNP1), the specific glutamine transporter in yeast. In this study, we identified CsCAT2 as an H+-dependent theanine transporter with medium affinity for theanine. The result of subcellular localization showed that CsCAT2 was a tonoplast-localized transporter. Importantly, CsCAT2 highly expressed in the root in winter during theanine storage and reduced its expression in the root during theanine transport from root-to-shoot in spring. In addition, CsCAT2 expression in the roots of 5 varieties at four time points during December and April was significant negatively correlated with the capacity of theanine root-to-shoot movement. Taken together, these results suggested that CsCAT2 may mediate theanine storage in the vacuole of root cells and may negatively modulate theanine transport from root to shoot.

AB  - The proportions of the various muscle fiber types are important in the regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism, as well as animal meat production. Four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 3 (FHL3) is highly expressed in fast glycolytic muscle fibers and differentially regulates the expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms at the cellular level. Whether FHL3 regulates the transformation of muscle fiber types in vivo and the regulatory mechanism is unclear. In this study, muscle-specific FHL3 transgenic mice were generated by random integration, and lentivirus-mediated gene knockdown or overexpression in muscles of mice or pigs was conducted. Functional analysis showed that overexpression of FHL3 in muscles significantly increased the proportion of fast-twitch myofibers and muscle mass but decreased muscle succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity and whole-body oxygen consumption. Lentivirus-mediated FHL3 knockdown in muscles significantly decreased muscle mass and the proportion of fast-twitch myofibers. Mechanistically, FHL3 directly interacted with the Yin yang 1 (YY1) DNA-binding domain, repressed the binding of YY1 to the fast glycolytic MyHC2b gene regulatory region, and thereby promoted MyHC2b expression. FHL3 also competed with EZH2 to bind the repression domain of YY1 and reduced H3K27me3 enrichment in the MyHC2b regulatory region. Moreover, FHL3 overexpression reduced glucose tolerance by affecting muscle glycolytic metabolism, and its mRNA expression in muscle was positively associated with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, FHL3 is a novel potential target gene for the treatment of muscle metabolism-related diseases and improvement of animal meat production.

AB  - Background: Depression is a chronic and recurrent disorder with an unknown etiology. Efficacious antidepressant treatments with minimal side effects are urgently needed. Neuroinflammation may contribute to depression, as anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to alleviate depressive symptoms in clinical practice. Rutin, a naturally occurring flavonoid derived from plants, is abundant in many antidepressant herbs, including Hemerocallis citrina Baroni. Historical Chinese medical texts, including the renowned Compendium of Materia Medica, document H. citrina Baroni as possessing antidepressant properties. Rutin, one of its primary active constituents, is recognized for its anti-inflammatory effects. Despite this, little is known about its specific target and mechanism. Methods: In the present study, molecular docking, and surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) analysis were used to identify the special targets of rutin. Meanwhile, the potential antidepressant effects were evaluated in the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm, an animal model of depression. Then, Western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) as well as antagonists of PPAR-gamma were utilized to investigate the mechanism underlying the antidepressant effect of rutin. Results: Both molecular docking and SPRi analysis showed high docking scores and interactions between rutin and PPAR-gamma. In vivo, rutin promoted the nuclear translocation of PPAR-gamma in the hippocampus of mice, inhibited NF kappa B-mediated inflammatory pathways, and subsequently reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory factors (e.g., iNOS, IL-6), aligning with an antidepressant effect. However, this therapeutic effect was attenuated by GW9662, a specific antagonist of PPAR-gamma. Conclusion: As a result of activating PPAR-gamma and inhibiting NF kappa B pathway activation, rutin reduces neuroinflammation and exhibits an antidepressant effect. These findings shed light on the antidepressant mechanism of rutin and could be valuable for the development of new antidepressants.

AB  - Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant and biologically active catechin in tea leaves and has been widely utilized in the development of functional foods. EGCG is catalyzed by serine carboxypeptidase-like 1A (CsSCPL1A) acyltransferases in tea plants. Although CsSCPL family genes are regulated by several transcription factors (TFs), systematic studies on their regulation by MYB TFs are lacking. This study integrates targeted metabolomics, transcriptomics, DNA-protein, and protein-protein interaction analyses to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of EGCG biosynthesis-related genes CsSCPL4 and CsSCPL5-1 by R2R3-MYB TFs. CsMYB219 and CsMYB196 can specifically bind to CsSCPL4 and CsSCPL5-1 promoters and activate their expression. CsMYB196 also interacted with CsTT8a and CsTTG1 to activate the transcription activity of CsSCPL4 and CsSCPL5-1 promoters by forming a MYB/bHLH/WD40 (MBW) complex. Promoter truncation assays delineated MYB-responsive cis-elements in CsSCPL4 (-613 to -1 bp with enhancers at -1967 to -1622) and CsSCPL5-1 (-503 to -296 bp). Silencing of CsMYB219 and CsMYB196 by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assay significantly reduced the expression levels of CsSCPL4 and CsSCPL5-1 and EGCG content in tea leaves. Transient overexpression of CsMYB219 and CsMYB196 in tea leaves upregulated CsSCPL4 and CsSCPL5-1 expression and elevated EGCG content. These findings enhance our understanding of the regulatory network underlying EGCG biosynthesis in tea plants and provide a solid foundation for future genetic improvement of tea plant cultivars.

AB  - A contribution to the nomenclature of the genus Armeria is presented. Armeria alpina, , A. gracilis, , A. macropoda, , A. plantaginea, , Statice nebrodensis, , S. plantaginea, , and S. pungens, , recorded for Italy, are typified here based on specimens deposited at B, G, MA, and NAP, plus an illustration by Allioni. The current application of these names is confirmed in most cases, except for Statice plantaginea, , which is shown to be a heterotypic synonym of the Alpine endemic Armeria arenaria subsp. praecox, , and not of the western Mediterranean A. alliacea, , as previously thought. Accordingly, the latter species is excluded from the Italian flora.

AB  - Tea is one of the world's most common beverages obtained from the leaves of Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze plant. During 2022 to 2024, canker disease was noticed on the branches of C. sinensis. . The symptomatic diseased tea plants often showed splitting of bark tissue from supporting branches, yellow, early leaf drop, and plant death under severe conditions. In the present study, 30 diseased branches of tea plants collected from the tea gardens of Dooars and Assam regions of India were studied for the causal agent(s) responsible for canker disease. A total of 60 isolates of fungal species, 30 each Lasiodiplodia-like-like and Diaporthe-like-like species were obtained from symptomatic diseased samples. Micromorphological analysis and molecular phylogeny of multi-locus (ITS, tef-1 alpha and tub-2 ) sequence data revealed that these isolates were Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Diaporthe longicolla. . In the pathogenicity test, these isolates were found pathogenic on the tea cultivar TV20 through single and co- inoculation tests. Koch's postulates were also confirmed by re-isolating the fungal pathogens. To identify the potential management strategies against both canker-causing pathogens, synthetic fungicides and fungal antagonists were screened in the laboratory to generate preliminary data. Synthetic fungicides such as copper oxychloride, propiconazole, and carbendazim + mancozeb showed more than 78.8% inhibitory activities against both pathogens and efficacy increased up to 100% after the addition of 0.5% MAK ADJOL product (a petroleum- based oil formulation) as an adjuvant. Among Trichoderma spp. screened, T. harzianum and T. koningii showed higher antagonistic activity (more than 73%) against L. theobromae and D. longicolla. . Thus, these fungicides and microbial bioagents can be recommended as effective agents for the management of cankers after their field evaluation. This study provides the first account of complex association of L. theobromae and D. longicolla with tea canker disease in India.

AB  - Bark wings are projections commonly interpreted as plant protective structures against herbivory. Their location in stems has been typically thought to be random, something that here we dispute, using Piptadenia gonoacantha as a case study. We collected stem samples from several specimens in different developmental stages from natural populations in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. These stems were studied in detail under light microscopy to determine the formation of bark wings and their possible correlation with other anatomical features. Stems of P. gonoacantha are deeply lobed during primary growth, with each lobe containing a large vascular bundle, alternating with smaller vascular bundles in the interlobes. On top of these lobes, prickles develop, being composed of epidermal tissue and the cortex beneath. Some of the eight lobes merge and a phellogen is installed on top of them, which starts to produce a large sheath of phellem, which will become the conspicuous bark wings of Piptadenia. The phellogen switches on and off, leaving marks resembling growth rings. The bark wings in Piptadenia have very specific positioning, always in the front of five to eight major vascular bundles, indicating that bark wings appear always in very precise locations.

AB  - Tea is one of the most popular beverages, it has many health benefits and flavor properties due to the presence of numerous secondary metabolites. Camellia assamica is also a main source of tea, which is mainly planted in the regions of southwest China. In this study, a non-targeted and targeted metabolomics analysis and sensory evaluation on tea leaves with and without mistletoe (Viscum articulatum) was carried out using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RNA-seq-based transcriptomic analysis was conducted in parallel on the same samples, subsequently gene expression and metabolic differentiation were also investigated. Tea leaves with mistletoe presented much lower contents of (-)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-gallocatechin gallate and (-)-epicatechin gallate, but significantly higher levels of free amino acids including Arg, Asp, GABA and Gln than that without mistletoe. Transcriptomic analysis also confirmed the main differentially expressed genes (DEGs) containing phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis were down-regulated, but genes of amino acid biosynthesis were up-regulated. qRT-PCR analysis further revealed that the relative expression of CsCHS, CsC4H, CsANS, CsLAR, and CsF3H was hindered, while CsglyA and CsilvE expression was increased.

AB  - Significant variations in leaf colours, pigment contents, and main taste compounds in young shoots from albino tea plants (Camellia sinensis) influence tea flavour. However, the seasonal metabolic pattern and molecular regulatory mechanism of these metabolites remain largely elusive. Herein, we conducted morphological, biochemical, metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses between an albino tea cultivar 'Zhonghuang 3' ('ZH3') and a green strain 'Tai cha 15' ('TC15') at four-time points (April 12, May 31, July 14, and August 17) to elucidate dynamic changes in these compounds and predict the relationships among transcription factors (TFs), target genes (TGs), and metabolite abundance. Generally, leaf colours and pigment contents were significantly lighter and lower, respectively, in 'ZH3' than in 'TC15' from spring to summer, but were subsequently similar. Compared to 'TC15', 'ZH3' had a lower and broader phenol/ammonia ratio as well as stable caffeine content and showed more significantly different metabolites and differentially expressed genes. The relationship between pigments, main taste compounds, and their biosynthetic genes, as well as TFs and their TGs, had genetic specificity. These results suggested that the biosynthesis of these compounds was probably both season- and variety-dependent. In total, 12 models of the TF-TG-metabolite regulatory network were proposed to uncover the biosynthetic and regulatory mechanisms of these metabolites in tea plants. A high correlation was observed between some structural genes and TFs with the accumulation of these metabolites. These findings provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying accumulation of pigments and main taste compounds in tea plants.

AB  - The flowers of tea plants (Camellia sinensis), as well as tea leaves, contain abundant secondary metabolites and are big potential resources for the extraction of bioactive compounds or preparation of functional foods. However, little is known about the biosynthesis and transcriptional regulation mechanisms of those metabolites in tea flowers, such as terpenoid, flavonol, catechins, caffeine, and theanine. This study finely integrated target and nontarget metabolism analyses to explore the metabolic feature of developing tea flowers. Tea flowers accumulated more abundant terpenoid compounds than young leaves. The transcriptome data of developing flowers and leaves showed that a higher expression level of later genes of terpenoid biosynthesis pathway, such as Terpene synthases gene family, in tea flowers was the candidate reason of the more abundant terpenoid compounds than in tea leaves. Differently, even though flavonol and catechin profiling between tea flowers and leaves was similar, the gene family members of flavonoid biosynthesis were selectively expressed by tea flowers and tea leaves. Transcriptome and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the regulatory mechanism of flavonol biosynthesis was perhaps different between tea flowers and leaves. However, the regulatory mechanism of catechin biosynthesis was perhaps similar between tea flowers and leaves. This study not only provides a global vision of metabolism and transcriptome in tea flowers but also uncovered the different mechanisms of biosynthesis and transcriptional regulation of those important compounds.

AB  - Heterosis or hybrid vigor is the improved performance of a desirable quality in hybrid progeny. Hybridization between high-productive Assam type and high-quality Chinese type clone-cultivar is expected to develop elite tea plant progenies with high quality and productivity. Comparative transcriptomics analyses of leaves from the F1 hybrids and their parental clone-cultivars were conducted to explore molecular mechanisms related to catechin content using a high-throughput next-generation RNA-seq strategy and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The content of EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate) and C (catechin) was higher in 'Kiara-8' x 'Sukoi', 'Tambi-2' x 'Suka Ati', and 'Tambi-2' x 'TRI-2025' than the other hybrid and clone-cultivars. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and GO (Gene Ontology) analysis found that most pathways associated with catechins content were enriched. Significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) mainly associated with phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, and transcription factor (MYB, bHLH, LOB, and C2H2) pathways appeared to be responsible for the high accumulation of secondary metabolites in 'Kiara-8' x 'Sukoi', 'Tambi-2' x 'Suka Ati', and 'Tambi-2' x 'TRI-2025' as were detected in EGCG and catechin content. Several structural genes related to the above pathways have been obtained, which will be used as candidate genes in the screening of breeding materials.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Heliconia rostrata Ruiz and Pay. belongs to the family Heliconiaceae. Plant was traditionally used to cure jaundice, intestinal pain, diabetes and hypertension.
   Aim of the experiment: Present study evaluated hepatoprotective efficacy of ethanol (REE) and methanol (RME) extracts of H. rostrata rhizomes in HepG2 cell lines and rats. Antioxidant efficacy of extracts was determined using ex vivo and in vivo methods.
   Materials and methods: Before conducting efficacy studies, safety of REE and RME was established using toxicity studies which included Oral acute-fixed dose toxicity using OECD TG420, 28-days repeated dose oral toxicity by OECD TG407 and cytotoxicity studies by brine shrimp lethality (BSL) bioassay and MTT assay taking HepG2 cell line. Ex vivo (Extracts: 0-250 mu g/me and in vivo (Extracts: 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) antioxidant studies were performed on fresh goat liver and rats (N = 45) of either sex, respectively. In vitro hepatoprotective efficacy of extracts was evaluated against ethanol induced toxicity in HepG2 cell line. In vivo study was performed at 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day doses in rats by CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity study.
   Results: No mortality was observed during single and repeated dose toxicity studies. 50% lethal dose >2000 mg/kg, confirmed category 5 toxicity level of extracts, according to Globally Harmonized System. No signs of toxicity and treatment or dose related changes recorded in rats under repeated dose toxicity study. No-observed-adverse effect-level of 200 mg/kg/day was observed for both extracts. Median lethal concentration of REE and RME were 1291.30 and 1045.89 mu g/ml, respectively in BSL bioassay and 50% cytotoxicity concentration >1000 mu g/ml was obtained for both extracts from MTT assay. Calculated 50% inhibitory concentration and median effective dose of extracts obtained from different antioxidant assays in ex vivo and in vivo antioxidant studies, respectively indicated REE has more antioxidant efficacy than RME. In in vitro hepatoprotective efficacy study, extracts demonstrated dose dependent protection against ethanol induced hepatotoxicity. At 400 mu g/ml, REE and RME demonstrated percentage protection of 65.53% and 57.98%, respectively.
   Results of liver function test and histopathological evaluation of liver in in vivo hepatoprotective study confirmed dose dependent protection provided by the extracts against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity.
   Conclusion: Both REE and RME were found safe to be considered for therapeutic uses. Both REE and RME were found to exhibit antioxidant efficacy in ex vivo and in vivo models. Results ascertained that H. rostrata rhizomes possess significant hepatoprotective potency.

AB  - As the aging population grows, the need to understand age-related changes in health is vital. Two prominent behavioral changes that occur with age are disrupted sleep and impaired cognition. Sleep disruptions lead to perturbations in proteostasis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in mice. Further, consolidated sleep and protein synthesis are necessary for memory formation. With age, the molecular mechanisms that relieve cellular stress and ensure proper protein folding become less efficient. It is unclear if a causal relationship links proteostasis, sleep quality, and cognition in aging. Here, we used a mouse model of aging to determine if supplementing chaperone levels reduces ER stress and improves sleep quality and memory. We administered the chemical chaperone 4-phenyl butyrate (PBA) to aged and young mice, and monitored sleep and cognitive behavior. We found that chaperone treatment consolidates sleep and wake, and improves learning in aged mice. These data correlate with reduced ER stress in the cortex and hippocampus of aged mice. Chaperone treatment increased p-CREB, which is involved in memory formation and synaptic plasticity, in hippocampi of chaperone-treated aged mice. Hippocampal overexpression of the endogenous chaperone, binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), improved cognition, reduced ER stress, and increased p-CREB in aged mice, suggesting that supplementing BiP levels are sufficient to restore some cognitive function. Together, these results indicate that restoring proteostasis improves sleep and cognition in a wild-type mouse model of aging. The implications of these results could have an impact on the development of therapies to improve health span across the aging population.

AB  - Clustering of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) in the plasma membrane is increasingly implicated in creating highly localized Ca2+ signaling nanodomains. For example, neuronal LTCC activation can increase phosphorylation of the nuclear CREB transcription factor by increasing Ca2+ concentrations within a nanodomain close to the channel, without requiring bulk Ca2+ increases in the cytosol or nucleus. However, the molecular basis for LTCC clustering is poorly understood. The postsynaptic scaffolding protein Shank3 specifically associates with one of the major neuronal LTCCs, the Ca(V)1.3 calcium channel, and is required for optimal LTCC- dependent excitation-transcription coupling. Here, we co-expressed Ca(V)1.3 alpha 1 subunits with two distinct epitope-tags with or without Shank3 in HEK cells. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using the cell lysates revealed that Shank3 can assemble complexes containing multiple Ca(V)1.3 alpha 1 subunits under basal conditions. Moreover, Ca(V)1.3 LTCC complex formation was facilitated by Ca-V beta subunits (beta 3 and beta 2a), which also interact with Shank3. Shank3 interactions with Ca(V)1.3 LTCCs and multimeric Ca(V)1.3 LTCC complex assembly were disrupted following the addition of Ca2+ to cell lysates, perhaps simulating conditions within an activated Ca(V)1.3 LTCC nanodomain. In intact HEK293T cells, co-expression of Shank3 enhanced the intensity of membrane-localized Ca(V)1.3 LTCC clusters under basal conditions, but not after Ca2+ channel activation. Live cell imaging studies also revealed that Ca2+ influx through LTCCs disassociated Shank3 from Ca(V)1.3 LTCCs clusters and reduced the CaV1.3 cluster intensity. Deletion of the Shank3 PDZ domain prevented both binding to Ca(V)1.3 and the changes in multimeric Ca(V)1.3 LTCC complex assembly in vitro and in HEK293 cells. Finally, we found that shRNA knock-down of Shank3 expression in cultured rat primary hippocampal neurons reduced the intensity of surface-localized Ca(V)1.3 LTCC clusters in dendrites. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism contributing to neuronal LTCC clustering under basal conditions.

AB  - center dot Nepenthes pitchers are leaf-evolved biological traps containing high levels of CO2 within them. Extrafloral nectar (EFN) secreted by these pitchers has long been regarded as the major reward to visiting arthropods, but its chemical constituents and their role in prey capture are least explored. center dot In this study Nepenthes EFNs were isolated, and their sugars, amino acids, proteins, vitamin C and fatty acids were analysed using HPTLC-densitometry, UFLC, and biochemical assays. C:N ratio, minerals and volatiles of EFNs were determined by CHNS, ICP-OES and headspace-GC-MS, respectively; metabolic profiling was carried out using LC-MS. Peristome/lid EFNs and their active constituent were subjected to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition assays; the AChE inhibitor was characterized by bioactivity guided isolation and spectroscopy. center dot Here we demonstrate Nepenthes EFN as a sugar (glucose-fructose-sucrose) mix with high C:N ratio, minimal amino acids, proteins, and vitamin C. N. khasiana peristome and lid EFNs displayed strong AChE inhibition; the naphthoquinone derivative, (+)-isoshinanolone, was identified as the AChE inhibitor. Plumbagin, the major volatile naphthoquinone in Nepenthes, also showed strong AChE inhibition. Direct EFN- and (+)-isoshinanolone-feeding bioassays showed symptoms of cholinergic toxicity in ants. center dot Nepenthes EFN is a toxic bait which hinders neuronal activity in visiting arthropods. Their pitchers adopt various deceptive strategies for prey capture, and our study abolishes the notion that Nepenthes EFN is a reward to visiting ants and other arthropods. Moreover, our findings suggest that elevated CO2 levels within the pitchers play a crucial role in regulating the growth, metabolism, herbivory, and carnivory in Nepenthes.

We compared this new taxon with morphologically similar species by leaf characters (color and shape) and flower size. Colombia is the country with the largest number of Pentagonia species, likely because three important centers of diversification converge: the tropical Andes, the Choc & oacute; region, and the northwestern Amazon. A key to the 22 Pentagonia species occurring in Colombia is also presented.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is a globally renowned economic crop, with organs such as leaves and buds utilized for consumption. As a perennial foliage crop, tea plants have high-nitrogen consumption and demand but exhibit relatively low nitrogen use efficiency. Exploring the genetic factors involved in nitrogen assimilation in tea plants could lead to improvements in both tea yield and quality. Here, we first conducted transcriptome sequencing on two tissues (roots and young leaves) under two different nitrate levels (0.2 and 2.5mm KNO3) and at six time points (0, 15, and 45min; 2 and 6h and 2days). Differential gene expression patterns were observed for several genes that exhibited altered expression at 2h. Clustering and enrichment analyses, along with co-expression network construction, provided evidence for the crucial involvement of CsSNACA2 in nitrogen assimilation. CsSNACA2 overexpression elicited pronounced phenotypic changes in nitrogen-deficient plants. Furthermore, CsSNACA2 suppressed the expression of CsNR (encoding nitrate reductase) and CsCLCa (encoding a NO3-/H+ exchanger). Moreover, CsSNACA2 served as a downstream target of CsSPL6.1. In addition, we characterized Csi-miR156e and Csi-miR156k, which directly cleave CsSPL6.1. This study identified a transcription factor module participating in nitrogen assimilation in tea plants, providing a genetic foundation for future innovations in tea cultivar improvement. These results broaden our understanding of the genetic mechanisms governing nitrogen assimilation in dicotyledonous plants.

AB  - Plant acyl-CoA dominated acyltransferases (named BAHD) comprise a large appointed protein superfamily and play varied roles in plant secondary metabolism like synthesis of modified anthocyanins, flavonoids, volatile esters, etc. Tea (Camellia sinensis) is an important non-alcoholic medicinal and fragrancy plant synthesizing different secondary metabolites, including flavonoids. In the tea (C.A sinensis) cultivar Longjing 43 (LJ43), eight samples were performed into three groups for transcriptome analysis under three biological replications. Among the BAHD acyltransferase genes in tea cultivars, the expression of TEA031065 was highest in buds and young leaves following the RNA sequencing data, which was coincident with the tissue rich in catechins and other flavonoids. We then transformed this gene into wild-type Arabidopsis as an over-expression (OX) line 1 and line 2 in 1/2 MS media to verify its function. In the wild types (WT), the primary root length, number of secondary roots, and total root weight were significantly higher at 24%, 15%, and 53.92%, respectively, compared to the transgenic lines (OX1 and OX2). By contrast, the leaves displayed larger rosettes (21.58%), with higher total leaf weight (32.64%) in the transgenic lines than in the wild type (WT). This result is consistent with DCR mutant At5g23940 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, anthocyanin content in transgenic lines was also increased (21.65%) as compared to WT. According to the RNA sequencing data, a total of 22 growth regulatory genes and 31 structural genes with TFs (transcription factors) that are correlative with plant growth and anthocyanin accumulation were identified to be differentially expressed in the transgenic lines. It was found that some key genes involved in IAA (Auxin) and GA (Gibberellin) biosynthesis were downregulated in the transgenic lines, which might be correlated with the phenotype changes in roots. Moreover, the upregulation of plant growth regulation genes, such as UGT73C4 (zeatin), ARR15, GH3.5, ETR2, ERS2, APH4, and SAG113 might be responsible for massive leaf growth. In addition, transgenic lines shown high anthocyanin accumulation due to the upregulation of the (1) 3AT1 and (3) GSTF, particularly, GSTF12 genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. However, the TFs such as, CCoAMT, bHLH, WRKY, CYP, and other MYBs were also significantly upregulated in transgenic lines, which increased the content of anthocyanins in A. thaliana seedlings. In conclusion, a BAHD acyltransferase (TEA031065) was identified, which might play a vital role in tea growth and secondary metabolites regulation. This study increases our knowledge concerning the combined functionality of the tea BAHD acyltransferase gene (TEA031065).

AB  - The grey blight disease is a common disease of tea plants and camellias (Camellia spp.). It is caused by Pestalotiopsis-like fungi, which were mostly identified as species of Pestalotiopsis and Pseudopestalotiopsis. In this study, four strains of Neopestalotiopsis were isolated from brown and grey-white spots of leaves of Camellia oleifera and C. sasanqua in China. These strains belong to Neopestalotiopsis longiappendiculata and are characterized by morphology and multi-loci phylogenetic analysis (ITS-tef-tub2). This is the first report of N. longiappendiculata as agent of grey blight disease on Camellia spp. Pathogenicity tests indicated that N. longiappendiculata infects not only Camellia oleifera and Camellia sasanqua but also Eucalyptus polyanthemos and Euonymus japonicas. Given the broad host range and pathogenic nature, it is time to focus on management aspect to control the disease.

AB  - Tea is generally prepared by steeping the dried young leaves and buds of Camellia sinensis in a boiled water. Following water, tea is mostly consuming drink in the world. This research project was designed to evaluate different tea samples for various biological assays. Assays including antibacterial, antifungal, antileishmanial and antioxidant were carried out following standard procedures. Antimicrobial activities were include disc diffusion and micro broth dilution methods, while spectrophotometric method was used for antioxidant and anti-leishmanial assays. Our test samples exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus with MICs of 3.7 mu g ml(-1). Tapal and Tetly showed considerable inhibitory activities against R. solani with 64 +/- 3.6 and 76 +/- 45% inhibitions respectively at 10 mg ml(-1) concentrations. Likewise, Lipton and Tapal showed 76 +/- 54 and 76 +/- 57% inhibitory activity against A. niger at 10 mg ml(-1) concentrations. Tetly was most effective against L. tropica with IC50 of 293.9 mu g/ml. Considerable antioxidant and phenolic, flavonoids contents might be responsible for these pharmacological activities and health benefits associated with the use the selected tea brands.

AB  - Camellia genus (Theaceae) is comprised of world famous ornamental flowering plants. C. japonica L. and C. sasanqua Thunb are the most cultivated species due to their good adaptation. The commercial interest in this plant linked to its seed oil increased in the last few years due to its health attributes, which significantly depend on different aspects such as species and environmental conditions. Therefore, it is essential to develop fast and reliable methods to distinguish between different varieties and ensure the quality of Camellia seed oils. The present work explores the study of Camellia seed oils by species and location. Two standardized gas chromatography methods were applied and compared with that of data obtained from proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-NMR) for fatty acids profiling. The principal component analysis indicated that the proposed H-1-NMR methodology can be quickly and reliably applied to separate specific Camellia species, which could be extended to other species in future works.

AB  - Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum camelliae, poses a significant threat to the yield and quality of Camellia oleifera. Mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy, is crucial in maintaining mitochondrial quality and intracellular homeostasis. To date, an optimized experimental system for studying mitophagy in C. camelliae has yet to be established, and the role of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of C. camelliae remains unclear. Here, we characterized the function of CaEch1, a homolog of Magnaporthe oryza MoEch1, in the anthracnose fungus C. camelliae. Our findings indicate that mitochondria-localized CaEch1, plays a vital role for mitophagy in C. camelliae. Also, the CaEch11-29-GFP could serve as a reliable marker for monitoring mitophagy in C. camelliae. Additionally, the knockout of CaECH1 resulted in defects in fungal growth, conidiation, and appressorium formation. Pathogenicity assays further revealed that knockout of CaECH1 significantly reduced the virulence of C. camelliae. In summary, our research underscores the importance of CaEch1 in growth, conidiation, appressorium formation, and virulence in C. camelliae. This suggests its potential as a marker for mitophagy and provides valuable insights for developing new fungicides targeting anthracnose.

AB  - Background The levels of free amino acids (FAAs) and the timing of bud flush (TBF) are among the the most economic traits of tea plants (Camellia sinensis). Investigating the genetic variation characteristics of FAAs and their potential associations with TBF is critical for the breeding of new tea cultivars with high economic value. Methods In this study, we utilized the 'Emei Wenchun' (female) x 'Chuanmu 217' (male) filial 1 (F-1) genetic population (n = 208) and measured their FAA contents in the "one bud and two leaves" samples across two spring seasons and one summer season using high-performance liquid chromatography combined with the Waters AccQ-Tag method. The sprouting index (SPI) was observed over two springs to quantify the TBF trait. A genetic map previously constructed based on the same population was employed for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Results A total of 16 FAAs were measured, and the average total FAA contents were 28.1 and 25.4 mg/g (dry weight) in the two spring seasons and 14.29 mg/g in the summer season. Within the population, the coefficients of variation (CV) for the FAAs ranged from 23 to 41% within each season, and the correlation coefficients (r) varied from 0.15 to 0.35 across seasons. ANOVA analyses revealed that 13 out of the 16 FAAs exhibited significant genetic variation, with the estimated broad-sense heritability (h(2)) ranging between 10.33% and 57.10%. Interestingly, three FAAs and the total FAA contents showed significant positive correlations (r = 0.21-0.34, P < 0.01) with the SPI trait in both spring seasons. QTL mapping identified 13 FAA-associated QTLs distributed across eight linkage groups. Conclusion Within the F-1 population, the FAAs exhibited considerable variation across seasons, their heritabilities were generally low (most <= 50%). There was a weak but significant positive correlation between FAAs and TBF. Additionally, 13 FAA-associated QTLs were identified. The results of this study enhance our understanding of the genetic variation characteristics of FAAs and provide insights for breeding tea cultivars with both higher FAAs and earlier TBF.

AB  - Background The era of high throughput sequencing offers new paths to identifying species boundaries that are complementary to traditional morphology-based delimitations. De novo species delimitation using traditional or DNA super-barcodes serve as efficient approaches to recognizing putative species (molecular operational taxonomic units, MOTUs). Tea plants (Camellia sect. Thea) form a group of morphologically similar species with significant economic value, providing the raw material for tea, which is the most popular nonalcoholic caffeine-containing beverage in the world. Taxonomic challenges have arisen from vague species boundaries in this group. Results Based on the most comprehensive sampling of C. sect. Thea by far (165 individuals of 39 morphospecies), we applied three de novo species delimitation methods (ASAP, PTP, and mPTP) using plastome data to provide an independent evaluation of morphology-based species boundaries in tea plants. Comparing MOTU partitions with morphospecies, we particularly tested the congruence of MOTUs resulting from different methods. We recognized 28 consensus MOTUs within C. sect. Thea, while tentatively suggesting that 11 morphospecies be discarded. Ten of the 28 consensus MOTUs were uncovered as morphospecies complexes in need of further study integrating other evidence. Our results also showed a strong imbalance among the analyzed MOTUs in terms of the number of molecular diagnostic characters. Conclusion This study serves as a solid step forward for recognizing the underlying species boundaries of tea plants, providing a needed evidence-based framework for the utilization and conservation of this economically important plant group.

AB  - Background and Aims The functional specialization of microRNA and its target genes is often an important factor in the establishment of spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression that are essential to plant development and growth. In different plant lineages, understanding the functional conservation and divergence of microRNAs remains to be explored.Methods To identify small regulatory RNAs underlying floral patterning, we performed a tissue-specific profiling of small RNAs in various floral organs from single and double flower varieties (flowers characterized by multiple layers of petals) in Camellia japonica. We identified cja-miR5179, which belongs to a deeply conserved microRNA family that is conserved between angiosperms and basal plants but frequently lost in eudicots. We characterized the molecular function of cja-miR5179 and its target - a B-function MADS-box gene - through gene expression analysis and transient expression assays.Key Results We showed that cja-miR5179 is exclusively expressed in ovule tissues at the early stage of floral development. We found that cja-miR5179 targets the coding sequences of a DEFICIENS-like B-class gene (CjDEF) mRNA, which is located in the K motif of the MADS-box domain; and the target sites of miR5179/MADS-box were consistent in Camellia and orchids. Furthermore, through a petal transient-expression assay, we showed that the BASIC PENTACYSTEINE proteins bind to the GA-rich motifs in the cja-miR5179 promoter region and suppresses its expression.Conclusions We propose that the regulation between miR5179 and a B-class MADS-box gene in C. japonica has a deep evolutionary origin before the separation of monocots and dicots. During floral development of C. japonica, cja-miR5179 is specifically expressed in the ovule, which may be required for the inhibition of CjDEF function. This work highlights the evolutionary conservation as well as functional divergence of small RNAs in floral development.

AB  - Ciborinia camelliae Kohn is the causal agent of camellia flower blight. The pathogen infects only flowers of camellias, causing serious damage to the plant. Seventy-one strains were collected from six Italian regions and were characterized at the phenotypic and genetic level. Morphotypes were identified based on their phenotypic differences in culture media. The Italian population consisted of eleven morphotypes. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of twenty-two isolates belonging to the different morphotypes were sequenced. All morphotypes have identical ITS sequences. The closest match of the ITS with the strain ICMP 19812 of Ciborinia camelliae from New Zealand (Massey University Arboretum, Palmerston North, 100% sequence identity), and the morphological features confirmed the presence of a variable population of C. camelliae in six different Italian regions.

AB  - Menisci play an essential role in shock absorption, joint stability, load resistance and its transmission thanks to their conformation. Adult menisci can be divided in three zones based on the vascularization: an avascular inner zone with no blood supply, a fully vascularized outer zone, and an intermediate zone. This organization, in addition to the incomplete knowledge about meniscal biology, composition, and gene expression, makes meniscal regeneration still one of the major challenges both in orthopedics and in tissue engineering. To overcome this issue, we aimed to investigate the role of hypoxia in the differentiation of the three anatomical areas of newborn piglet menisci (anterior horn (A), central body (C), and posterior horn (P)) and its effects on vascular factors. After sample collection, menisci were divided in A, C, P, and they were cultured in vitro under hypoxic (1% O-2) and normoxic (21% O-2) conditions at four different experimental time points (T0 = day of explant; T7 = day 7; T10 = day 10; T14 = day 14); samples were then evaluated through immune, histological, and molecular analyses, cell morpho-functional characteristics; with particular focus on matrix composition and expression of vascular factors. It was observed that hypoxia retained the initial phenotype of cells and induced extracellular matrix production resembling a mature tissue. Hypoxia also modulated the expression of angiogenic factors, especially in the early phase of the study. Thus, we observed that hypoxia contributes to the fibro-chondrogenic differentiation with the involvement of angiogenic factors, especially in the posterior horn, which corresponds to the predominant weight-bearing portion.

AB  - Drought stress (DS) significantly hampers the growth and productivity of tea plants, necessitating effective strategies to enhance their resilience. This study comprehensively investigated the mechanisms of carbonyl volatiles-methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and cis-3-hexenyl acetate (cis-3-HAC) and signal peptide CLAVATA3/ EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED 25 (CLE25) promotion DS resistance using integrative metabolomics and proteomics strategy. Total pigment content decreased, while soluble sugar and proteins increased significantly under DS and further increased after foliar inducement of CLE25, MeJA, and cis-3-HAC. Gallated catechins and amino acids exhibited apparent decreased under DS, especially EGCG (24.6-13.4 mg g(-1)) and theanine (10.66-3.78 mg g(-1)), but significantly mitigated by CLE25 inducement. Antioxidant enzymes activity, such as catalase (CAT), jumped from 23.1 to 48.2 and further boosted to 118.8 Ug(-1)min(-1) FW with CLE25. Proteomic analysis revealed massive increased in stress tolerance proteins, particularly dehydrins and heat shock proteins, rising by >50.0 % with CLE25 inducement and the expression levels of peroxidase (POX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), alpha-galactosidase (alpha-GAL), carboxypeptidases (CPs), and transaldolase (TAL) exhibited higher after inducement. Furthermore, stress signaling-related proteins were in-depth explored, especially thioredoxin proteins; sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) was novelly verified in activating abscisic acid (ABA) responding. Differences among drought resistance mechanisms after carbonyl volatile and CLE25 treatments were comprehensively studied. The integration of metabolite and protein levels provided a comprehensive illustration of tea DS tolerance mechanisms and offered promising promotion strategies through foliar application of MeJA, cis-3-HAC, and CLE25.

AB  - Biosynthesis of specific secondary metabolites in plants involves fine regulation of gene expression. Camellia chekiangoleosa has important economic value: the seeds contain high-quality unsaturated fatty acids and the pericarp is rich in tea saponins. As an important posttranscriptional regulator, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in controlling secondary metabolism in C. chekiangoleosa is not fully studied. Here, we investigated the role of miRNAs and their targets in the secondary metabolic regulatory network by comprehensively analyzing small RNAs, transcriptomes, and degradomes from different tissues. We identified 168 known miRNAs and 74 novel miRNAs in the C. chekiangoleosa genome and revealed 15 tandem clusters containing 35 miRNAs. By establishing a gene regulatory network containing miRNAs, target genes, and transcription factors, we unravelled the multiplicity of miRNA tissue-specific regulation of gene expression, which may be tightly linked to the synthesis of secondary metabolites. Furthermore, we characterized a novel long-noncoding miRNA gene (cch-miR3633) that targeted a UDP-transferase gene (CchUGT94E5). We showed that, ectopic expression of CchUGT94E5 caused outgrowth of shoot branching and changes in cytokinin contents in Arabidopsis, indicating a potential role of regulating secondary metabolism. This work provides valuable information for the study of miRNA regulation of secondary metabolism.

AB  - Artemisinin-based combination therapies remain the sole deterrent against deadly disease malaria and Artemisia annua remains the only natural producer of artemisinin. In this study, the 1101 bp gene S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM): Artemisia annua jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (AaJMT), was characterised from A. annua, which converts jasmonic acid (JA) to methyl jasmonate (MeJA). From phylogenetic analysis, we confirmed that AaJMT shares a common ancestor with Arabidopsis thaliana, Eutrema japonica and has a close homology with JMT of Camellia sinensis. Further, the Clustal Omega depicted that the conserved motif I, motif III and motif SSSS (serine) required to bind SAM and JA, respectively, are present in AaJMT. The relative expression of AaJMT was induced by wounding, MeJA and salicylic acid (SA) treatments. Additionally, we found that the recombinant AaJMT protein catalyses the synthesis of MeJA from JA with a Km value of 37.16 mu M. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis of serine-151 in motif SSSS to tyrosine, asparagine-10 to threonine and glutamine-25 to histidine abolished the enzyme activity of AaJMT, thus indicating their determining role in JA substrate binding. The GC-MS analysis validated that mutant proteins of AaJMT were unable to convert JA into MeJA. Finally, the artemisinin biosynthetic and trichome developmental genes were upregulated in AaJMT overexpression transgenic lines, which in turn increased the artemisinin content.

AB  - The section Oleifera (Theaceae) has attracted attention for the high levels of unsaturated fatty acids found in its seeds. Here, we report the chromosome-scale genome of the sect. Oleifera using diploid wild Camellia lanceoleosa with a final size of 3.00 Gb and an N50 scaffold size of 186.43 Mb. Repetitive sequences accounted for 80.63% and were distributed unevenly across the genome. Camellia lanceoleosa underwent a whole-genome duplication event approximately 65 million years ago (65 Mya), prior to the divergence of C. lanceoleosa and Camellia sinensis (approx. 6-7 Mya). Syntenic comparisons of these two species elucidated the genomic rearrangement, appearing to be driven in part by the activity of transposable elements. The expanded and positively selected genes in C. lanceoleosa were significantly enriched in oil biosynthesis, and the expansion of homomeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) genes and the seed-biased expression of genes encoding heteromeric ACCase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and stearoyl-ACP desaturase could be of primary importance for the high oil and oleic acid content found in C. lanceoleosa. Theanine and catechins were present in the leaves of C. lanceoleosa. However, caffeine can not be dectected in the leaves but was abundant in the seeds and roots. The functional and transcriptional divergence of genes encoding SAM-dependent N-methyltransferases may be associated with caffeine accumulation and distribution. Gene expression profiles, structural composition and chromosomal location suggest that the late-acting self-incompatibility of C. lanceoleosa is likely to have favoured a novel mechanism co-occurring with gametophytic self-incompatibility. This study provides valuable resources for quantitative and qualitative improvements and genome assembly of polyploid plants in sect. Oleifera.

AB  - Premise Cleistogamous species constitute interesting study systems to resolve the longstanding question of how outcrossing is maintained given that seed production is ensured through selfing. In this work, we investigate the selective forces that allow the persistence of producing self-pollinated cleistogamous (CL) and chasmogamous (CH) flowers in Viola jaubertiana Mares & Vigin. Methods We monitored three populations at different elevation for two years, and studied the flowering phenology and the relative contribution of each flower morph to parental fitness. We tested whether allocation to CH and CL flowers differed across populations and if it covaried with herbivory and water stress conditions. We also performed hand-pollination and bagging experiments in CH flowers to estimate inbreeding depression and heterosis. Results The CH flowers open in winter under unfavorable conditions for pollination, show high pollen limitation and no-delayed selfing, and thus produce a low amount of seeds. Conversely, CL flowers appear in early spring, are physiologically cheaper to produce (i.e., dry weight is 3.4 times lower than that of CH flowers), and yield approximately 100 times more seeds than CH flowers. The CH flowers were favored under water stress and low herbivory. Crosses between populations showed up to 25% greater fitness than those within populations. Conclusions Despite the great pollen limitation in CH flowers, we suggest that the interaction among different environmental determinants and heterosis are probably sufficient forces to maintain chasmogamy in this long-lived species, reducing deleterious fixed mutations in the selfed lines.

AB  - Blister blight, caused by Exobasidium vexans Massee, is a serious tea disease and leads to massive damage to tea yield and quality. WRKY transcription factors play an important role in the regulation of biotic stresses. However, the biological and molecular functions of these transcription factors during blister blight in tea plants are not known. The present study isolated a disease resistance gene, CsWRKY14, from leaves of Camellia sinensis and analysed this gene using bioinformatics. The results demonstrated that CsWRKY14 comprised multiple cis-acting elements and involved in salicylic acid (SA) signal transduction pathway. Moreover, the CsWRKY14 protein belongs to the IIe subgroup of the WRKY family located in the nucleus. The expression of CsWRKY14 was more upregulated in the resistant cultivar 'Zhongcha 108' (ZC) compared to the susceptible cultivar 'Longjing changye' (LJ). Consistently, the endogenous levels of SA and the expression of SA signaling pathway-related genes (NPR1, PR1, PR2, and PR4) were higher in ZC than in LJ, which suggests that CsWRKY14 contributes to the increase of SA concentration and activates the expression level of SA-induced pathogen-associated genes. Histochemical analysis and enzymatic activity assay revealed that the resistant cultivar ZC exhibited less H2O2 accumulation and higher activities of antioxidant enzymes. CsWRKY14-silenced plants were more sensitive to E. vexans than wild plants and exhibited a decrease in the expression of SA pathway-related genes and the antioxidant enzyme activities. Our results suggest CsWRKY14 can be used as an effective genetic resource for tea breeding against blister blight.

AB  - After successfully performing Agrobacterium-mediated CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing in plants, isolation of the Cas9 T-DNA is essential for the stable inheritance of induced mutations. Here, we report a simple technique that allows the isolation of Cas9-free mutants, eliminating the need for outcrossing or other intricate methods. This method is based on the ability of Basta-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, which generally perish, to recover and grow once transplanted to Basta-free growth media. By growing gene-edited heterozygous populations of single-locus insertion Basta-resistant plants on Basta selection media, plants lacking the Cas9 T-DNA can be identified. These pale-looking plants lacking Cas9 are then rescued on media lacking the Basta to recover Cas9-free plants. The ability of seedlings to recover from Basta selection was also studied in camelina, canola, and wheat. All three crops showed different recovery rates, with wheat demonstrating the highest recovery once transplanted from Basta to normal growth media. In summary, our findings demonstrate that by harnessing the recovery capability of Basta-sensitive seedlings, we can effectively identify and rescue plants lacking the Cas9 T-DNA, enabling the isolation of Cas9-free mutants in Arabidopsis and potentially extending to other crops.

AB  - Cannabaceae species garner attention in plant research due to their diverse secretory structures and pharmacological potential associated with the production of secondary metabolites. This study aims to update our understanding of the secretory system in Hops (Humulus lupulus L.), an economically important species especially known for its usage in beer production. For that, stems, leaves, roots, and inflorescences were collected and processed for external morphology, anatomical, histochemical, ultrastructural and cytochemical analyses of the secretory sites. Our findings reveal three types of secretory structures comprising the secretory machinery of Hops: laticifer, phenolic idioblasts and glandular trichomes. The laticifer system is articulated, anastomosing and unbranched, traversing all plant organs, except the roots. Phenolic idioblasts are widely dispersed throughout the leaves, roots and floral parts of the species. Glandular trichomes appear as two distinct morphological types: capitate (spherical head) and peltate (radial head) and are found mainly in foliar and floral parts. The often-mixed chemical composition in the secretory sites serves to shield the plant from excessive UVB radiation, elevated temperatures, and damage inflicted by herbivorous animals or pathogenic microorganisms. Besides the exudate from peltate glandular trichomes (lupulin glands), latex and idioblast content are also likely contributors to the pharmacological properties of different Hop varieties, given their extensive presence in the plant body.

AB  - The secretory structures of Alismataceae have been described as secretory ducts, laticifer ducts, laticifer canals or schizogenous ducts. However, these terms are not found in the specialized literature, and ontogenetic analyses for the exact classification of these structures are missing. Accordingly, more studies regarding the secretory structures of Alismataceae are necessary to establish homology in the family or in the order. Thus, the aim of this study was to describe the anatomy, ontogeny, distribution in the organs and exudate composition of the secretory structures present in five Alismataceae species in order to determine whether the family has laticifers or secretory ducts. Samples of leaves, flowers and floral apices were processed for anatomical and histochemical analyses by light microscopy. The analysis indicated the presence of anastomosing secretory ducts in all species, occurring in both leaves and flowers. The exudate contains lipids, alkaloids, proteins and polysaccharides, including mucilage. The secretory duct structure, distribution and exudate composition suggest a defense role against herbivory and in wound sealing. The presence of secretory ducts in all species analyzed indicates a probable synapomorphy for the family.

AB  - Background Abiotic and biotic stresses induce oxidative processes in plant cells that this process starts with the production of ROSs which cause damage to the proteins. Therefore, plants have increased their antioxidant activity to defend against this oxidative stress to be able to handle stress better. In this research, 14 different tea accessions in a randomized complete block design with two replications were evaluated in two normal and drought stress conditions, and their antioxidant activity was measured by DPPH-free radicals' assay and gene expression analysis. Results The results of gene expression analysis showed that the 100 and 399 accessions and Bazri cultivar had high values for most of the antioxidant enzymes, ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase under drought stress conditions while the 278 and 276 accessions had the lowest amount of antioxidant enzymes in the same situation. Results showed that the IC50 of the BHT combination was 90.12 mu g/ ml. Also, The IC50 of accessions ranged from 218 to 261 mu g/ml and 201-264 mu g/ml at normal and drought stress conditions, respectively. The 100 and 399 accessions showed the lowest IC50 under normal and drought stress conditions, while 278 and 276 accessions had the highest value for IC50. The antioxidant activity of tea accession extracts under normal conditions was ranged from 25 to 69% for accessions 278 and 100, respectively. While, the antioxidant activities of extracts under drought stress condition was 12 to 83% for accessions 276 and 100, respectively. So, according to the results, 100 and 399 accessions exhibited the least IC50 and more antioxidant activity under drought stress conditions and were identified as stress-tolerant accessions. However, 278 and 276 accessions did not show much antioxidant activity and were recognized as sensitive accessions under drought stress conditions. Conclusions These results demonstrate that total phenol content, antioxidant activity, and the oxygen-scavenging system can be used as a descriptor for identifying drought-tolerant accessions.

AB  - In brief Phosphate plays a critical role in conceptus development, yet the mechanisms regulating utero-placental availability remain underinvestigated. This research characterized the spatiotemporal expression and endocrine regulation of XPR1, a phosphate exporter, in ovine utero-placental tissues, suggesting a potential role of XPR1 in the regulation of utero-placental phosphate availability.Abstract Phosphate is an essential regulator of conceptus development, but there is limited understanding of mechanisms regulating phosphate availability in utero-placental tissues. These experiments characterized the expression of xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 (XPR1), a phosphate exporter, in ovine utero-placental tissues. In Experiment 1, ewes were hysterectomized on day 1, 9, or 14 of the estrous cycle or day 30, 50, 70, 110, or 125 of pregnancy. Day of the estrous cycle did not affect XPR1 mRNA expression or protein localization. Expression of XPR1 mRNA decreased with day of gestation in placentomes, while XPR1 protein was detectable in uterine epithelia, blood vessels, endometrial stromal cells, myometrium, caruncular stroma, and syncytium of the placentome. In Experiment 2, ewes received daily injections of either corn oil vehicle (CO) or 25 mg progesterone (P4) in vehicle for the first 8 days of pregnancy and were hysterectomized on either day 9, 12, or 125. Endometrial stroma from P4-treated ewes had greater XPR1 immunoreactivity than CO-treated ewes on day 9. On day 125, endometria from P4-treated ewes had decreased expression of XPR1 mRNA compared to CO-treated ewes. Greater XPR1 protein immunoreactivity was present in uterine epithelia and stratum compactum stroma of P4-treated than CO-treated ewes. P4-treated ewes with a singleton fetus tended to have greater expression of XPR1 mRNA in placentomes than CO-treated ewes with a singleton fetus. Collectively, these results suggest a potential role of XPR1 in the regulation of phosphate availability in utero-placental tissues in ruminants.

AB  - Galloylated catechins are the dominant polyphenols in Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze. The mechanisms responsible for accumulation of these specialized metabolites in tea plants remains unclear. This paper presents an extended member of subgroup 5 of transcription factors R2R3-MYB, CsMYB34, as a critical gene specifically regulating galloylated catechin biosynthesis. CsMYB34 has a TT2-type motif [VIRTKATRCSKVFIP]. Its transcription levels were positively correlated with galloylated catechin content in 19 tea varieties, with correlation coefficients >= 0.79. Suppression of CsMYB34 expression caused a significant decrease in galloylated catechin content, as well as reduced expression levels of the key galloylated catechin biosynthesis gene CsSCPL4. Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H), electrophoretic mobile shift assay (EMSA) and dual-luciferase reporter system (DLR) showed that CsMYB34 interacts directly with the promoter region of CsSCPL4, thereby upregulating its transcription. This research indicates that the CsMYB34 transcription factor selectively modulates the biosynthetic pathway of galloylated catechins, thereby offering a plausible rationale for the observed elevated levels of these compounds in tea leaves.

AB  - Explosives are widespread, toxic and persistent environmental pollutants. 2,4-Dinitroanisole (DNAN) is being phased in to replace 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) in munitions. Here we demonstrate that only low levels of DNAN are detoxified in Arabidopsis, leaving it to remain as a substrate for monodehydroascorbate reductase 6 mediated chronic phytotoxicity. Enhancing the potential for environmental toxicity, DNAN is readily transported to the aerial tissues exposing this toxin to herbivores and the wider food chain.

AB  - Natural plants of Camellia (Theaceae) in Thailand are taxonomically revised with a key, a distribution map, descriptions, specimens examined, and figures of living plants and/ or dry specimens. Nine taxa comprising seven species and two varieties are recognized, including C. caudata, C. connata, C. furfuracea, C. kissi, C. kissi var. confusa, C. laotica, C. sinensis var. assamica, C. suddeeana, and C. taliensis. Camellia caudata and C. laotica are new records to Thailand, and C. connata and C. suddeeana are endemic to the country. Formerly recorded C. pleurocarpa and C. tenii are excluded from Thai flora because of misidentification, and C. oleifera and C. sinensis are merely cultivated in the country. Morphological descriptions of C. connata and C. laotica are improved based on additional collections examined.

AB  - The recent availability of a number of tea plant genomes has sparked substantial interest in using reverse genetics to explore gene function in tea (Camellia sinensis). However, a hurdle to this is the absence of an efficient transformation system, and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), a transient transformation system, could be an optimal choice for validating gene function in the tea plant. In this study, phytoene desaturase (PDS), a carotenoid biosynthesis gene, was used as a reporter to evaluate the VIGS system. The injection sites of the leaves (leaf back, petiole, and stem) for infiltration were tested, and the results showed that petiole injection had the most effective injection, without leading to necrotic lesions that cause the leaves to drop. Tea leaves were inoculated with Agrobacterium harboring a tobacco rattle virus plasmid (pTRV2) containing a CsPDS silencing fragment. The tea leaves exhibited chlorosis symptoms 7-14 days after inoculation, depending on the cultivar. In the chlorosis plants, the coat protein (CP) of tobacco rattle virus (TRV) was detected and coincided with the lower transcription of CsPDS and reduced chlorophyll content compared with the empty vector control, with 81.82% and 54.55% silencing efficiency of 'LTDC' and 'YSX', respectively. These results indicate that the VIGS system with petiole injection could quickly and effectively silence a gene in tea plants.

AB  - Magnesium (Mg2+), as the central atom of chlorophyll, is the most abundant divalent cation for plant growth and development in living cells. MRS2/MGT magnesium transporters play important roles in coping with magnesium stress, chloroplast development and photosynthesis. However, the molecular mechanism of MGT influencing tea plant leaf vein color remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that CsMGT10 may be a potential transporter influencing leaf vein color. CsMGT10 belongs to Clade A member of MRS2/MGT family. CsMGT10 has the highest expression level in leaves of tea plants. And it is mainly expressed in aboveground parts, especially in vascular bundles. Moreover, CsMGT10 localizes to the chloroplast envelope of tea plants with a high affinity to Mg2+. And the GMN motif is required for its magnesium transport function. Ectopic expression of CsMGT10 in Arabidopsis leaf variegation mutant var5-1 can restore green color of chlorosis leaf veins, and the contents of chlorophyll and carotenoid change significantly, proving its essential role in leaf vein greening. Furthermore, the chlorophyll and carotenoid of tea leaves treated with CsMGT10 antisense oligonucleotides also decrease significantly. Our findings indicate that CsMGT10 mainly acts as Mg2+ transporter in chloroplast envelope of leaf veins, which may play a key role in leaf vein greening of tea plants.

AB  - Proanthocyanidins (PAs) are polymeric phenolic compounds found in plants and used in many industrial applications. Despite strong evidence of herbivore and pathogen resistance-related properties of PAs, their in planta function is not fully understood. Determining the location and dynamics of PAs in plant tissues and cellular compartments is crucial to understand their mode of action. Such an approach requires microscopic localization with fluorescent dyes that specifically bind to PAs. Such dyes have hitherto been lacking. Here, we show that 4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (DMACA) can be used as a PA-specific fluorescent dye that allows localization of PAs at high resolution in cell walls and inside cells using confocal microscopy, revealing features of previously unreported wall-bound PAs. We demonstrate several novel usages of DMACA as a fluorophore by taking advantage of its double staining compatibility with other fluorescent dyes. We illustrate the use of the dye alone and its co-localization with cell wall polymers in different Populus root tissues. The easy-to-use fluorescent staining method, together with its high photostability and compatibility with other fluorogenic dyes, makes DMACA a valuable tool for uncovering the biological function of PAs at a cellular level in plant tissues. DMACA can also be used in other plant tissues than roots, however care needs to be taken when tissues contain compounds that autofluoresce in the red spectral region which can be confounded with the PA-specific DMACA signal.

AB  - Plant metabolites comprise a wide range of extremely important chemicals. In many cases, like savory spices, they combine distinctive functional properties-deterrence against herbivory-with an unmistakable flavor. Others have remarkable therapeutic qualities, for instance, the malaria drug artemisinin, or mechanical properties, for example natural rubber. We present a breakthrough in plant metabolite extraction technology. Using a neural network, we teach a computer how to recognize metabolite-rich cells of the herbal plant rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and automatically extract the chemicals using a microrobot while leaving the rest of the plant undisturbed. Our approach obviates the need for chemical and mechanical separation and enables the extraction of plant metabolites that currently lack proper methods for efficient biomass use. Computer code required to train the neural network, identify regions of interest, and control the micromanipulator is available as part of the Supplementary Material.

AB  - In this paper, we analyse consumer acceptance, preferences and attitudes to camel milk based on a cross-country study based on qualitative focus groups with consumers. Outside the main consumption countries where camel milk is a regular part of the daily diet, many consumers buy this product primarily due to its promised health benefits. Furthermore, they are willing to pay a substantial price premium for camel milk. The findings from the literature study suggest the need for further research aimed at improving the sensory quality of camel milk, camel milk fermented products (such as yoghurt, kefir, etc.) and camel milk cheese. In addition, the application of flavours could be an option to cover the perceived salty taste of camel milk. Another aspect is that more research needs to be conducted to optimize the operating parameters and standardization of the production procedures of camel milk yoghurt in the future. In general, we can state that so far only a few consumer studies exist and, in particular, for European consumers, not much is known about their attitudes, preferences and acceptance to try or to buy such a product.

AB  - BackgroundThe major floral scent compounds of Arabidopsis thaliana flowers are terpenes. Although A. thaliana is generally considered to be a self-pollinating plant, there are natural variation in terpene volatile emission from flowers. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying the natural variation in Arabidopsis floral scents remain limited.ResultsHere, we screened 116 natural accessions of A. thaliana and observed a substantial variability in the levels of terpene emission across these accessions. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) uncovered a genomic region associated with the observed variability in myrcene, one of monoterpene compounds. We then performed high-throughput genetic mapping using two representative accessions: Col-0 and Fr-2, which emit low and large amounts of floral terpenes, respectively. Next-generation mapping and RNA sequencing analyses revealed that the natural premature stop codon of CYP706A3 of Fr-2, located at the 98th codon, confers high emission of sesquiterpene from flowers. We also found an independent mutation of CYP706A3 of Np-0 in different position, leading to increased sesquiterpene emission. Interestingly, the expression levels of defense-related genes in Fr-2 were lower than those in Col-0 flowers, which suggests that terpene volatiles are potentially linked to floral defense.ConclusionsThe natural variation in Arabidopsis floral scent emission was partially explained by one natural allele of CYP706A3. Since some natural accessions harboring a functional allele of CYP706A3 still emit the large amount of floral sesquiterpene, it is possible that rare variants located on other loci increase scent emission.

AB  - To investigate the gene expression and metabolic pathways involved in flower development at different growth stages of Camellia oleifera, this study focused on leaves collected during the juvenile stage, initial fruiting stage, and peak fruiting stage of the 'Dabieshan 1' C. oleifera variety. Transcriptome sequencing analysis was performed to obtain the transcriptome data of leaf samples during the pre-flowering period. The annotated genes included key regulators of flower development pathways, such as FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1), SUPPRESSOR OVEREXPRESSION CONSTANS 2 (SOC2), as well as genes involved in the photoperiod pathway, including CYCLING DOF FACTOR 2 (CDF2), CYCLING DOF FACTOR 3 (CDF3), and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY). Specifically, 7 UniGene sequences of the CDF2 gene, 3 UniGene sequences of the CDF3 gene, and 3 UniGene sequences of the LHY gene were identified, highlighting their important roles in flower development regulation in C. oleifera. Gene Ontology analysis demonstrated enrichment in various biological processes related to carbohydrate metabolism, biosynthesis, and environmental response, while differentially expressed genes in the molecular function category were associated with degradation activities. In terms of cellular components, the differentially expressed genes were enriched in ribosome and plasma membranes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed enrichment in multiple metabolic pathways, biosynthesis, and degradation across the three developmental stages of C. oleifera leaves. These findings provide a foundation for further investigation into the energy metabolism involved in the regulation of flower development in C. oleifera.

AB  - Camellia is the largest and most important genus in the family Theaceae, with many species being of great economic, ornamental and ecological value. However, the phylogenetic resolution of these species has been difficult due to interspecific hybridization and polyploidy. Consequently, the interspecies relationships of the genus Camellia are still hotly debated. In this study, four chloroplast genomic regions (matK, rbcL, ycf1, trnL-F) were used as markers among 161 species representing all four sub-genera within this genus to investigate the phylogeny and interspecies relationship of the genus Camellia. The results showed that the 161 species of the genus Camellia could be grouped into 13 clades (A-M). Clades A and B mainly consisted of sect. Camellia. Clades C and I were made up of sect. Theopsis and sect. Eriandria. Clades D and J were composed of species from sect. Thea. Clade F consisted of the sect. Paracamellia species, whilst Clades G and M included sect. Furfuracea species. Clade H contained sect. Tuberculata and most species of sect. Pseudocamellia, whereas Clades K and L comprised the sect. Chrysantha species. These results supported that 161 Camellia species form paraphyletic groups, rather than a monophyletic group. And they demonstrated that the taxonomic position of related species could be resolved to some extent via sequencing markers in organelle genome, thus providing valuable cytoplasmic genetic information or maternal genetic information for accurately identifying species, clarifying taxonomy and reconstructing the phylogeny of various Camellia species.

AB  - Terpene synthase (TPS) enzymes are known to be pivotal in the biosynthesis of terpenoids in plants and microbes. These enzymes catalyse the transformation of ubiquitous acyclic prenyl diphosphate substrates into diverse hydrocarbon skeletons. Mining TPS genes from the genomes and transcriptomes of diverse taxa of plants and microbes is a powerful tool for the discovery of new enzymes and new chemistries. In this work, we used a combination of long-read and short-read RNA sequencing technologies to develop a high-quality transcriptomic data set for Daphniphyllum macropodum, a poorly studied plant rich in unique terpene derived metabolites. Through mining the transcriptome, we identified different terpene-related enzymes, including prenyl transferases (PTs), triterpene cyclases (TTCs), and terpene synthases (TPSs). These were expressed in a Nicotiana benthamiana system together with rate-limiting enzymes HMGR or DXS to boost the metabolic flux. The products were then analysed using GC-MS. We have identified four monoterpene synthases producing diverse linear, monocyclic and bicyclic monoterpenes including linalool, limonene, geraniol, and pinene. We also identified four sesquiterpene synthases, one producing caryophyllene, one alpha-guaiene, and two producing a blend of sesquiterpenes. In addition, we demonstrated the activity of two triterpene cyclases both forming cycloartenol, as well as a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPP synthase). Together, these findings expand the known chemical space of D. macropodum terpenoid metabolism and enable further investigations of terpenoids in this under-explored plant species.

AB  - Camellia reticulata Lindl., also known as Yunnan Camellia, is an important ornamental plant in China, especially for its large and stunning flowers. A comprehensive understanding of their coloration mechanisms can aid breeders in developing new cultivars and improving their ornamental value; however, it is still unclear in Yunnan Camellia, especially in mixed-color flowers. In this study, we conducted metabolic and transcriptomic comparison analyses to investigate the coloration differences in three Yunnan Camellia cultivars: C. reticulata 'Shizitou' (SZT), C. reticulata 'Damanao' (MN), and C. reticulata 'Tongzimian' (TZM). Our results revealed that the initial flowering stage may play a critical role in the color change of MN. Metabolome analysis demonstrated that cyanidin was the primary anthocyanin in SZT and MN's red region, while its content was low in TZM and MN's white region. According to the transcriptome analysis, the anthocyanins biosynthesis pathway was reconstructed in Yunnan Camellia, and the low expression of CHS was detected in TZM and MN's white region, while ANR maintained a high expression level, which may lead to the low content of cyanidin in them. Transcription factors MYBs, bHLH, and bZIP may play a key role in regulating anthocyanin-structural genes. The co-expression analysis showed that the meristem tissue may play a crucial role in the formation of the mixed white-red color in MN. Our study enriched the genetic basis of flower coloration differences in Yunnan Camellia which will be a valuable genomic resource to understanding the biology of coloration formation and for breeding the Camellia cultivars.

AB  - Late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans is the most destructive disease of potatoes worldwide and is most notable as the cause of the Irish potato famine of the mid 1840's. Whole mitochondrial genome sequences were generated from 44 Australian, two UK and one US isolates of P. infestans stored as either herbarium specimens or as recent samples on FTA cards, spanning the period 1873-2019. Mitochondrial (mt) genome sequence comparison confirmed that over the past c. 110 years, an old A1 strain of P. infestans has been present in Australia. There was evidence, however, that P. infestans had been introduced on multiple separate occasions in the early 1900s prior to the introduction of quarantine measures. The 44 Australian samples included six infected specimens of the Australian native kangaroo apple (Solanum aviculare) collected in 1911. The P. infestans mt genome sequences from these isolates clustered with P. infestans from infected potatoes collected in Victoria (1910, 1911, 1986, 1989), South Australia (1909, 2003) and Tasmania (1910, 2019), supporting the hypothesis that Australia has one old strain that has survived since the first arrival of the pathogen into the country. The study highlights the success of Australia's potato biosecurity setting and supports the need for ongoing surveillance and biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of the newer more aggressive strains of the pathogen.

AB  - Suspension cell culture of camel's thorn Alhagi persarum Boiss. et Buhse was produced for the first time and its characteristics were determined under different growing conditions (flasks and bubble bioreactors with useful volume of 15 L). The obtained culture was notable for an intense growth (accumulation of dry biomass of 15-20 g/L, growth index of 11-16, and specific growth rate of 0.15 +/- 0.01 d(-1)), with growth characteristics in bioreactors close to parameters observed in flasks. Qualitative composition of secondary metabolites in biomass of this cell culture grown in flasks was preliminarily examined by means of ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS). Isoflavones from different structural groups were detected: free isoflavones (an isomer of afrormosin), glycosides of isoflavones (glycosides of calycosin and formononetin), and acylated glycosides of isoflavones (malonyl glycosides of calycosin, formononetin, genistein, and the isomer of afrormosin). Extracts from biomass of A. persarum suspension cell culture grown in flasks were tested for antimicrobial activity. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were used as test cultures. Extracts showed a specific antimicrobial activity in respect to S. aureus but were inactive to P. aeruginosa. Thus, the obtained cell culture of A. persarum is a promising object for further examination with a potential of using as an alternative raw material and a source of biologically active compounds characteristic of this species.

AB  - The proper type designation of the name Camelina microcarpa Andrz. ex DC. (Brassicaceae) is discussed. This taxon is currently considered to be a wild relative and possible progenitor of the oilseed crop Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz, and thus the proper typification of the name C. microcarpa is important for further germplasm research and improvement of the crop species. At present, several (at least four) specimens deposited in herbaria G-DC, KW, and LE, are listed in literature and/or annotated in herbaria or online databases as the type (holotype or lectotype) of C. microcarpa. The original material deposited in G-DC [G00203789] is accepted here as the holotype of C. microcarpa because it appears to be the only original element used by Candolle when preparing his description of the new taxon. Isotypes from the Besser herbarium at the National Herbarium of Ukraine in Kyiv (KW-BESS) are discussed and illustrated. It is concluded that the holotype from G-DC and two well-preserved isotypes from KW-BESS [KW001003103, KW001003104] are sufficient for precise morphology-based application of the name C. microcarpa. Our analysis provided evidence that original material was collected by Andrzejowski no later than 1818 in the Podolian Governorate of the former Russian Empire, most probably in the eastern part of Moldova or adjacent southwestern parts of Ukraine, along the Dnister (Nistru, Dniester) River between the present-day town of Camenca (Kamenka) and the confluence of the Dnister and Yagorlyk (Iagorlic) rivers, probably on limestone outcrops. It means that the type of C. microcarpa may belong to the southern Ukrainian populations, which are genetically different from northern and central Ukrainian ones; however, further field and molecular studies are needed because more than one genotype may in fact occur in that area.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the healing of furcation when repaired with Chitosan (CS) scaffold impregnated or not with Simvastatin (SIM) compared with CollaCote (CL) in goat premolar teeth. Root canal treatment was performed in 52 mandibular premolars followed by furcal perforation induction. The perforation was repaired with CL, CS, or CS with SIM after leaving it untreated for 4 weeks. White mineral trioxide aggregate was carried into the furcal site followed by a 2-3 mm resin-modified glass ionomer. The perforation was left untreated, and the access cavity was left open without coronal filling in the control group. The animals were sacrificed after one and three months. Block sections of the premolars were prepared and examined histologically to evaluate the inflammation and type of healing. Hard tissue formation was found in CL, CS, and CS/SIM groups in both periods. At one month, no significant differences were detected among the experimental groups, whereas at three months, CS without SIM showed significantly better performance compared to CL and CS/SIM groups (p = 0.040). Therefore, repairing furcal perforation with CS scaffolds shows desirable biological responses and healing characteristics in favor of bone regeneration at three months.

AB  - Introduction: Decaploid Camellia hainanica is a new tea oil Camellia species discovered in recent years that is unique to Hainan. This species has high nutritional and medicinal value and shows strong adaptability in the growth process. Mitochondria play an important role in plant cells and have an independent genetic system. Therefore, assembling and annotating the mitochondrial genome function of decaploid C. hainanica is of great significance. Methods: This study successfully assembled the mitochondrial genome of decaploid C. hainanica and comprehensively annotated its functional genes using the Nanopore sequencing platform. Results: Results showed that the mitochondrial genome is 902,617 bp in length, with a typical circular structure and a guanine-cytosine content of 45.79%. The genome encodes 64 protein-coding genes and contains a total of 76 genes, including 40 mRNA, 32 tRNA, 3 rRNA, and 1 pseudogene. Tetranucleotide repeats accounted for 38.60% of the simple sequence repeats. Only two genes, atp6 and sdh4, had a Ka/Ks ratio <1, whereas the Pi value of the sdh3 gene had a maximum of 0.00374 in these regions, suggesting that the sdh3 gene can be used as a molecular marker for the analysis of the mitochondrial genome of C. hainanica. From the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis, 29 codons had RSCU values >1, 27 of which (93%) ended in A or U, indicating a bias for A/U endings is present in C. hainanica. During RNA editing, 48.24% (260 loci) of amino acids were changed from hydrophilic to hydryophobic, resulting in an increase in the hydrophobicity of the protein. Comparative analysis identified 34 homologous fragments between the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes, with the longest fragment being 9,572 bp in length. Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes showed that the Hainanese and Vietnamese varieties of tea oil Camellia are sister species. Discussion: Results confirmed that the mitochondrial genomes of Hainanese and Vietnamese tea oil Camellia underwent gene rearrangement. Results also provided key data support for the utilization and conservation of tea oil germplasm resources and the breeding of varieties and are of great significance for promoting genetic evolution research, genetic breeding, and identification of tea oil Camellia.

AB  - Carissa macrocarpa (Eckl.) A. DC., is a woody shrub of the family Apocynaceae used in traditional medicine. This study aimed to investigate the seasonal variations in micromorphology, ultrastructure, and histochemistry of C. macrocarpa leaves using light and electron microscopy and histochemical techniques. This novel micromorphological analysis revealed the presence of glandular trichomes consisting of a short stalk and multicellular head, located on the lower surface of the leaf. The leaf was characterized as hypostomatic, containing stomata only on its lower surface. Nonarticulated laticifers were interspersed in the leaf cortex and spongy parenchyma. Transmission electron microscopy of C. macrocarpa leaf sections showed the presence of mitochondria, vesicles, vacuoles, and chloroplasts containing starch grains and plastoglobuli. Histochemical analysis revealed a variety of phytochemicals such as proteins, alkaloids, phenols, resin acids, lipids, polyphenols, mucilage, pectin, lignin, and cutin in C. macrocarpa leaves. The chemical compounds found in the latex of its laticifers likely play a vital role in herbivory prevention. Although leaves can also be used for medicinal purposes due to the presence of many pharmacologically active metabolites, future toxicology studies of C. macrocarpa leaves are recommended to ensure their safety for medicinal use. This study is the first to describe the ultrastructure and histochemistry of C. macrocarpa leaves. Given the knowledge gap regarding this species, the present research provides a foundation for the future harvest and medicinal applications of C. macrocarpa.

AB  - - In 1838, the young Dutch botanist L. H. Buse and his brother H. D. Gildemeester Buse found a colony of Splachnum ampullaceum (Cruet Collar-moss) with sporophytes on the moorland between Beekbergen and Loenen on the Veluwe (Province of Gelderland), south of the Beekbergerwoud. This was the first documented find of S. ampullaceum in the Netherlands. In 1840 they found this species again in the same area, now in the company of J. Wttewaall. The colony they found was richly provided with sporophytes. They collected a lot of material of this colony. Buse later included this collection as number 15 in his exsiccata series Musci Neerlandici. After 1840, S. ampul laceum was found a few more times in the Netherlands in the 19th century, but it remained rare. It even seemed that the species has become extinct in the Netherlands since 1910. However, the species was found again in 2010 in the Witterveld near Assen (Province of Drenthe). This was a colony of plants without sporophytes growing on cow dung. Splachnum ampullaceum belongs to the Splachnaceae and grows in Western Europe almost exclusively on dung of herbivores in moist habitats such as cow dung in wet moorlands and peat bogs. Spores of this moss are dispersed by flies. This article discusses the possible causes of the decline of S. ampullaceum in the Netherlands and neighbouring countries and also provides information about the first 19th century collectors of this moss species.

AB  - The fruits of the Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) are a popular plant food and a valuable health product. Cultivating of plants produces a lot of leaves with fine branches as an unnecessary residue, which need valorization. The aim of the study was to estimate (by HPLC-MS/MS) the qualitative and quantitative content of polyphenolic compounds in different parts of H. rhamnoides (HR), and to determine the level of antioxidant activity of leaves and fruits (by DPPH, ABTS methods and ferrozine test). Up to 19 compounds were identified in different parts of HR. The fruits are rich in flavonoids, including various glycosides of flavonols isorhamnetin, quercetin, and kaempferol. Two isorhamnetin glycosides were not identified in the leaves, while isorhamnetin-3rhamnosylglactosides and the ellagitannins hippophaenin B, stachyurin and casuarinin were present only in the leaves of the plant. The bark and roots contained considerably more catechins, but minimal flavonols than the fruits and leaves of HR. The total phenolics and flavonols were most abundant in water infusions from leaves of HR (especially quercetin-3-O-glucoside-7-O-rhamnoside), compared to methanolic extracts. No significant differences in the quantitative and qualitative content of the fresh and dried leaves were detected. The highest antioxidant activity by all three methods was detected in the leaves of HR. In addition to the fruits, the leaves may have a perspective as a source of biologically active substances of HR.

AB  - Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are important industrial raw materials and can be produced by genetically modified oil plants. For a long time, class A lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAT) was considered unable to promote the accumulation of VLCFA in oil crops. The bottlenecks that the transgenic high VLCFA lines have an oil content penalty and the low amount of VLCFA in phosphatidylcholine remains intractable. In the present study, a class A LPAT2 from Camelina sativa (CsaLPAT2) promoting VLCFAs accumulation in phospholipid was found. Overexpression of CsaLPAT2 alone in Arabidopsis seeds significantly increased the VLCFA content in triacylglycerol, including C20:0, C20:2, C20:3, C22:0, and C22:1. The proportion of phosphatidic acid molecules containing VLCFAs in transgenic seeds reached up to 45%, which was 2.8-fold greater than that in wild type. The proportion of phosphatidylcholine and diacylglycerol molecules containing VLCFAs also increased significantly. Seed size in CsaLPAT2 transgenic lines showed a slight increase without an oil content penalty. The total phospholipid content in the seed of the CsaLPAT2 transgenic line was significantly increased. Furthermore, the function of class A LPAT in promoting the accumulation of VLCFAs is conserved in the representative oil crops of Brassicaceae, such as C. sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica napus, Brassica rapa, and Brassica oleracea. The findings of this study provide a promising gene resource for the production of VLCFAs.

AB  - During fieldwork in the Campos Amazonicos National Park, Amazonas state, Brazil, a new endemic species of Mabea was collected in savanna areas. Field collections and specimens in RON, MG, and HRCB were analyzed. To understand the species distribution and verify possible areas of occurrence, niche modeling was conducted using the sdm package in R. Mabea dalyana, the new species is a subshrub with xylopodia and reduced size (less than 1 m height) and small, yellow thyrses. There are several allopatric species of Mabea growing in Amazonian savannas, some widespread but others locally restricted, such as M. uleana from central Amazonia that has some superficial resemblance in leaves and inflorescences but can be distinguished from M. dalyana by pubescent adaxial leaf surface (vs. glabrous), 12-21 submarginal glands (vs. 10 submarginal glands), thyrse brownish to red (vs. yellow thyrse) and conspicuous caruncle (vs. caruncle inconspicuous). M. dalyana is endemic to hyperseasonal savanna, very well adapted to savanna, and fire tolerant. It has notable characteristics, such as a subshrub habit, a xylopodium, glabrous leaves, and sepals noticeably larger than the ovary.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is believed to exhibit a complex intraspecific polyploidy phenomenon. Abnormal microsporogenesis can promote the formation of unreduced gametes in plants and lead to sexual polyploidy, so it is hypothesized that improper meiosis probably results in the formation of natural polyploidy in Camellia oleifera. In this study, based on the cytological observation of meiosis in pollen mother cells (PMCs), we found natural 2n pollen for the first time in Camellia oleifera, which may lead to the formation of natural polyploids by sexual polyploidization. Additionally, abnormal cytological behaviour during meiosis, including univalent chromosomes, extraequatorial chromosomes, early segregation, laggard chromosomes, chromosome stickiness, asynchronous meiosis and deviant cytokinesis (monad, dyads, triads), was observed, which could be the cause of 2n pollen formation. Moreover, we confirmed a relationship among the length-width ratio of flower buds, stylet length and microsporogenesis. This result suggested that we can immediately determine the microsporogenesis stages by phenotypic characteristics, which may be applicable to breeding advanced germplasm in Camellia oleifera.

AB  - Ilex vomitoria Ait. is a star substitute for "tea" in recent years. At present, research on I. vomitoria mainly focuses on its breeding and cultivation, and there are few reports on the seasonal changes of important components such as leaf nutrients. This study focuses on the leaves of the topmost annual branches of I. vomitoria. Leaves were harvested at different stages, and the nutrient elements, antioxidant substances, antioxidant capacity, and aroma components in the leaves were measured and analyzed. The results showed that the content of mineral elements, soluble sugars, vitamin C, amino acids, flavonoids, polyphenols, saponins, caffeine, and catechins, as well as the DPPH free radical scavenging ability, ABTS cation free radical scavenging ability, and FRAP iron ion reduction ability in the leaves of I. vomitoria showed significant differences with seasonal changes. The mineral element content in spring leaves is relatively high. Flavonoids and polyphenols are the main antioxidant substances in the leaves of I. vomitoria, indicating that the antioxidant capacity of spring leaves is the strongest. The content of aroma components in the leaves of I. vomitoria in spring is the highest, with alcohols ranging from 54.93% to 66.08%, followed by ketones from 17.63% to 48.07%, and aldehydes from 21.27% to 38.51%. Overall, spring leaves are more suitable for harvesting, development, and utilization.

AB  - Anthocyanins in tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves enhance tea quality due to their unique health benefits. MYB transcription factors are crucial in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in various plant species. In this research, a typical R2R3 repressive transcription factor CsMYB308 was identified which includes an EAR motif that belongs to the SG4 subfamily and was localized in the nucleus. Antisense oligonucleotide (asODN)-mediated CsMYB308 silencing revealed that the anthocyanin synthesis of structural genes was up-regulated. Furthermore, DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) screened downstream genes regulated by CsMYB308. Dualluciferase reporter (DLR) results showed that CsMYB308 suppressed anthocyanin biosynthesis by regulating the transcriptional activity of CsF3 ' 5 ' H, CsDFR, and CsANS and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) proved the concrete binding sites. In addition, we elucidated the molecular mechanism of Zijuan accumulating anthocyanin at an optimal concentration by shading experiment in summer. The results could provide an agronomic strategy to enhance the utilization of fresh leaves in summer. This study also presented a new insight of the regulatory pathway involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in tea plants.

AB  - Background As one of the world's most important beverage crops, tea plants (Camellia sinensis) are renowned for their unique flavors and numerous beneficial secondary metabolites, attracting researchers to investigate the formation of tea quality. With the increasing availability of transcriptome data on tea plants in public databases, conducting large-scale co-expression analyses has become feasible to meet the demand for functional characterization of tea plant genes. However, as the multidimensional noise increases, larger-scale co-expression analyses are not always effective. Analyzing a subset of samples generated by effectively downsampling and reorganizing the global sample set often leads to more accurate results in co-expression analysis. Meanwhile, global-based co-expression analyses are more likely to overlook condition-specific gene interactions, which may be more important and worthy of exploration and research. Results Here, we employed the k-means clustering method to organize and classify the global samples of tea plants, resulting in clustered samples. Metadata annotations were then performed on these clustered samples to determine the "conditions" represented by each cluster. Subsequently, we conducted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) separately on the global samples and the clustered samples, resulting in global modules and cluster-specific modules. Comparative analyses of global modules and cluster-specific modules have demonstrated that cluster-specific modules exhibit higher accuracy in co-expression analysis. To measure the degree of condition specificity of genes within condition-specific clusters, we introduced the correlation difference value (CDV). By incorporating the CDV into co-expression analyses, we can assess the condition specificity of genes. This approach proved instrumental in identifying a series of high CDV transcription factor encoding genes upregulated during sustained cold treatment in Camellia sinensis leaves and buds, and pinpointing a pair of genes that participate in the antioxidant defense system of tea plants under sustained cold stress. Conclusions To summarize, downsampling and reorganizing the sample set improved the accuracy of co-expression analysis. Cluster-specific modules were more accurate in capturing condition-specific gene interactions. The introduction of CDV allowed for the assessment of condition specificity in gene co-expression analyses. Using this approach, we identified a series of high CDV transcription factor encoding genes related to sustained cold stress in Camellia sinensis. This study highlights the importance of considering condition specificity in co-expression analysis and provides insights into the regulation of the cold stress in Camellia sinensis.

AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), belonging to the FT/TFL1 gene family, is an important gene regulating the flowering transition and inflorescence architecture during plant development. Given its importance to plant adaptation and crop improvement, FT has been extensively studied in related plant research; however, the specific role and underlying molecular mechanisms of FT in the continuous flowering of perennial plants remains elusive. Here, we isolated and characterized homologous FT genes from two Camellia species with different flowering-period phenotypes: CaFT was isolated from Camellia azalea, a precious species blooming in summer and flowering throughout the year, and CjFT was isolated from C. japonica, which blooms in winter and spring. The major difference in the genes between the two species was an additional five-amino acid repeat sequence in C. japonica. FT showed high expression levels in the leaves in both species from January to August, especially in April for C. japonica and in May for C. azalea. CaFT was expressed throughout the year in C. azalea, whereas CjFT was not expressed from September to December in C. japonica. The expression levels of FT in the floral buds were generally higher than those in the leaves. Overexpression of CaFT and CjFT in Arabidopsis indicated that both genes can activate downstream genes to promote flowering. Transgenic callus tissue was obtained by introducing the two genes into C. azalea through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transcriptome and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that both florigen FT genes promoted the expression of downstream genes such as AP1, FUL, and SEP3, and slightly up-regulated the expression of upstream genes such as CO and GI. The above results indicated that CaFT and CjFT played a role in promoting flowering in both camellia species. The expression pattern of CaFT in leaves suggested that, compared to CjFT, CaFT may be related to the annual flowering of C. azalea.

AB  - Aromatic aldehydes and amines are common plant metabolites involved in several specialized metabolite biosynthesis pathways. Recently, we showed that the aromatic aldehyde synthase PtAAS1 and the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase PtAADC1 contribute to the herbivory-induced formation of volatile 2-phenylethanol and its glucoside 2-phenylethyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside in Populus trichocarpa. To unravel alternative metabolic fates of phenylacetaldehyde and 2-phenylethylamine beyond alcohol and alcohol glucoside formation, we heterologously expressed PtAAS1 and PtAADC1 in Nicotiana benthamiana and analyzed plant extracts using untargeted LC-qTOF-MS and targeted LC-MS/MS analysis. While the metabolomes of PtAADC1-expressing plants did not significantly differ from those of control plants, expression of PtAAS1 resulted in the accumulation of phenylacetic acid (PAA) and PAA-amino acid conjugates, identified as PAA-aspartate and PAA-glutamate. Herbivory-damaged poplar leaves revealed significantly induced accumulation of PAA-Asp, while levels of PAA remained unaltered upon herbivory. Transcriptome analysis showed that members of auxin-amido synthetase GH3 genes involved in the conjugation of auxins with amino acids were significantly upregulated upon herbivory in P. trichocarpa leaves. Overall, our data indicates that phenylacetaldehyde generated by poplar PtAAS1 serves as a hub metabolite linking the biosynthesis of volatile, non-volatile herbivory-induced specialized metabolites, and phytohormones, suggesting that plant growth and defense can be balanced on a metabolic level.

AB  - 'Zijuan' (Camellia sinensis var. assamica), a somatic mutant with purple foliage and stem selected from the Yunnan Daye cultivar, has been well developed owing to abnormal pattern of anthocyanin accumulation. However, the genetic basis for the specific accumulation of phloem glycosides is not clear. Tea plants are self-incompatible, so parents with large differences in foliage color were used for crosses to investigate the genetic mechanism of anthocyanins. In this study, 'Zijuan' and green foliage cultivar 'Fudingdabaicha' (C. sinensis var. sinensis) were used as female and male parents, respectively, to generated F1 hybrid progenies with various anthocyanin contents. In order to decipher the genetic rules of anthocyanins accumulation, we performed widely targeted metabolic and transcriptomic profiling. The results showed that cyanidin-3-O-galactoside, delphinidin-3-O-galactoside and petunidin-3-O-galactoside were the major types of anthocyanins and factors directly led to the color variation between parents and F1 plants. Transcriptomic analyses suggested the significant up-regulation of anthocyanidin synthase gene (CsANS1) and CsAN1, a MYB family gene positively regulated the expression of CsANS1, in anthocyanin-rich tea plants. Furthermore, the deletion mutation of CsAN1 was found by cloning and alignment in anthocyanin-lacking cultivars. Taken together, the function deficiency of CsAN1 is predominantly responsible for the inability of anthocyanins accumulation, and this trait is heritable in progenies through hybridization. The present study elucidated the molecular basis of leaf purple trait formation in 'zijuan' and 'Fudingdabaicha' and their F1 plants, which helps to elucidate the genetic mechanism of leaf anthocyanin accumulation regulation in tea plants, and the results provide a research reference for the selection and breeding of high anthocyanin type tea varieties.

AB  - Key messageCsJAZ11 interacts with CsMYC2.2 in the nucleus and positively regulates disease resistance toColletotrichum camelliaein tea plants.AbstractIn the jasmonic acid signaling pathway, JASMONATE ZIM DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins act as repressors by inhibiting the activity of MYELOCYTOMATOSIS (MYC) transcription factors. However, the role of JAZ proteins in modulating tea plant resistance to Colletotrichum camelliae, a major causal pathogen of tea anthracnose, remains largely unexplored. In our previous study, yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed an interaction between CsJAZ11 and CsMYC2.2, a transcription factor that negatively regulates tea plant resistance to C. camelliae. In this study, bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays further confirmed that CsJAZ11 interacts with CsMYC2.2 in the nucleus. Co-immunoprecipitation assays also validated this interaction. To investigate the role of CsJAZ11 in regulating tea plant resistance to C. camelliae, transient silencing and overexpression of CsJAZ11 were performed in tea plant leaves. Notably, transient silencing of CsJAZ11 attenuates disease resistance to C. camelliae, while overexpression of CsJAZ11 enhanced disease resistance, suggesting that CsJAZ11 positively regulates tea plant resistance to C. camelliae. Surprisingly, qRT-PCR analysis showed that CsJAZ11 did not inhibit the expression of CsMYC2.2. In contrast, CsJAZ11 positively influenced the expression of CsRPM1, a MeJA-responsive CNL gene essential for disease resistance to C. camelliae in tea plants. Our findings indicate that CsJAZ11 positively regulates tea plant resistance to C. camelliae, potentially through the modulation of CsRPM1, an NBS-LRR-encoding gene. This study provides new insights into the role of JAZ proteins in regulating disease resistance in tea plants.

AB  - Flower closure is a widespread yet understudied trait that may serve multiple functions in the success of plant reproduction. In this study, we investigated the role of flower closure in protecting pollen from rain-induced loss in lesser celandine (Ficaria verna Huds., 1762), an early-flowering species vulnerable to spring rains. Through simulated and natural rain experiments, we found that the flowers that were prevented from closing retained significantly fewer pollen grains compared to the control flowers. This demonstrates that flower closure effectively protects pollen from rain-induced flushing, thus enhancing reproductive success. Furthermore, flowers that were prevented from closing had fewer viable pollen grains than control flowers. We propose that the evolution of petal movement in F. verna was primarily driven by pressures favoring petal movement that protected pollen, with secondary contributions from herbivore avoidance. Flowers are unable to discriminate between low luminosity caused by cloudy weather and night, thus responding to both. Future studies should explore the relative importance of primary and secondary evolutionary drivers of flower closure across species, particularly in early-flowering plants facing complex environmental challenges.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) is a dicotyledonous woody shrub species widely cultivated to produce a beverage made from its leaves. Brown blight is a destructive foliar fungal disease that reduces tea production and degrades quality, resulting in lower market value. Typical brown blight symptoms observed in three commercial tea plantations in Malaysia were characterized as brownish to black lesions on young leaves. The lesions expanded with age, becoming darker and developing into necrotic cells. A total of 45 fungal isolates were isolated from brown blighted tea leaves and identified as Colletotrichum camelliae. Morphological characteristics coupled with universal spacer region and multigene phylogenetic relationships using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), beta-tubulin (tub2) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) were used to accurately identify fungal isolates. The results of the pathogenicity test revealed that C. camelliae was responsible for causing brown blight disease of tea. This study highlights the occurrence of C. camelliae which causes tea brown blight in Malaysia. These findings may assist in disease monitoring, strict quarantine and effective control management of diseased tea plants.

AB  - The NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2 (NAC) transcription factors, which are members of a plant-specific gene family, play critical roles during the growth and development of plants and in their adaption to environmental stress. Few NAC transcription factors have been functionally characterized in tea plants (Camellia sinensis). Based on the analysis of the gene structure, motif pattern, and evolutionary relationship, we identified 104 NAC genes in C. sinensis. Among them, CsNAC28 is constitutively expressed in all organs, and most significantly, exhibiting remarkable responsiveness to abscisic acid (ABA) treatment and drought stress. ABA is a primary stress-related hormone. Recently, ABA-responsive element binding factor 2 (CsABF2) was identified in the ABA pathway of C. sinensis. However, the involvement of the CsABF2-mediated ABA pathway in regulating CsNACs was not known. Herein, a series of biochemical and genetic approaches supported the fact that CsNAC28 could potentially act as a transcription factor in the downstream of CsABF2. Furthermore, we investigated the function of CsNAC28 in the adapting of a plant to drought stress. The results showed that overexpression of CsNAC28 in Arabidopsis conferred hypersensitivity to ABA treatment and decreased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in improved dehydration tolerance. Under conditions of drought, the expression levels of ABA pathway-related genes and drought stress-inducible genes were greater in CsNAC28 overexpression lines than in the wild type. Our study's comprehensive characterization of NAC genes in C. sinensis could serve as a foundation for exploring the molecular mechanism of CsNAC-mediated drought responsiveness.

AB  - Serine carboxypeptidase-like acyltransferases (SCPL-ATs) play a vital role in the diversification of plant metabolites. Galloylated flavan-3-ols highly accumulate in tea (Camellia sinensis), grape (Vitis vinifera), and persimmon (Diospyros kaki). To date, the biosynthetic mechanism of these compounds remains unknown. Herein, we report that two SCPL-AT paralogs are involved in galloylation of flavan-3-ols: CsSCPL4, which contains the conserved catalytic triad S-D-H, and CsSCPL5, which has the alternative triad T-D-Y. Integrated data from transgenic plants, recombinant enzymes, and gene mutations showed that CsSCPL4 is a catalytic acyltransferase, while CsSCPL5 is a non-catalytic companion paralog (NCCP). Co-expression of CsSCPL4 and CsSCPL5 is likely responsible for the galloylation. Furthermore, pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that CsSCPL4 and CsSCPL5 interact, increasing protein stability and promoting post-translational processing. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses revealed that their homologs co-exist in galloylated flavan-3-ol- or hydrolyzable tannin-rich plant species. Enzymatic assays further revealed the necessity of co-expression of those homologs for acyltransferase activity. Evolution analysis revealed that the mutations of the CsSCPL5 catalytic residues may have taken place about 10 million years ago. These findings show that the co-expression of SCPL-ATs and their NCCPs contributes to the acylation of flavan-3-ols in the plant kingdom.

AB  - Tea plants with distinct leaf colours, such as purple, have attracted attention for their potential economic and flavour-related benefits. To investigate how purple mutations influence aroma composition, we analyzed 64 tea germplasms (Camellia sinensis) with varying degrees of purple pigmentation, integrating microenvironmental data, volatile metabolomics and transcriptomics. Purple tea exhibited reduced accumulation of volatile phenylpropanoids/benzenoids (VPBs), higher surface temperatures and enrichment of stress-responsive genes, leading to increased levels of fatty acid-derived volatiles (FADVs) and volatile terpenoids (VTs). We identified CsWRKY70 as a central regulator of aroma biosynthesis, with its expression upregulated under heat stress, activating CsLOX3 and CsTPS13 to promote FADVs and VTs accumulation. These findings demonstrate that purple leaf mutations influence aroma composition by modulating the phenylpropanoid pathway and altering the leaf microenvironment, providing new insights into the interplay between leaf colour, environmental stress and flavour potential in tea plants.

AB  - This study reported the broad spectrum endophytic variety from the elephant apple Dillenia indica L. Endophytes are microorganisms lying within the plant interior tissues, lasting as the whole or part of their life cycle without causing any conspicuous symptoms of infection to host plants. Surface sterilization of leaves and stems was the basic doing work to isolate endophytic fungi. 16 isolates were identified and grouped into 7 based on of morphological characteristics. Through morphological colony, all the isolated strains were identified up to genus level. Isolated seven fungi, 6 from the leaves part and 1 from the bark part were subjected to sequence analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene. Finally, seven well-known species named Colletotrichum Siamense, Phomopsis liquidambaris, Diaporthe perseae, Fusarium incarnatum, Colletotrichum falcatum, and Lasiodiplodia theobromae were identified compared with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) results analysis. This study provides the broad theory of the interrelation of morphological and molecular homologies for the identification of prospective bioactive fungi for further study and experiment so that those fungus acts as a catalyst for novel thinking and the discovery of drug molecules for the welfare of mankind.

AB  - Glyceollins, a family of phytoalexins elicited in legume species, play crucial roles in environmental stress response (e.g., defending against pathogens) and human health. However, little is known about the genetic basis of glyceollin elicitation. In the present study, we employed a metabolite-based genome-wide association (mGWA) approach to identify candidate genes involved in glyceollin elicitation in genetically diverse and understudied wild soybeans subjected to soybean cyst nematode. In total, eight SNPs on chromosomes 3, 9, 13, 15, and 20 showed significant associations with glyceollin elicitation. Six genes fell into two gene clusters that encode glycosyltransferases in the phenylpropanoid pathway and were physically close to one of the significant SNPs (ss715603454) on chromosome 9. Additionally, transcription factors (TFs) genes such as MYB and WRKY were also found as promising candidate genes within close linkage to significant SNPs on chromosome 9. Notably, four significant SNPs on chromosome 9 show epistasis and a strong signal for selection. The findings describe the genetic foundation of glyceollin biosynthesis in wild soybeans; the identified genes are predicted to play a significant role in glyceollin elicitation regulation in wild soybeans. Additionally, how the epistatic interactions and selection influence glyceollin variation in natural populations deserves further investigation to elucidate the molecular mechanism of glyceollin biosynthesis.

AB  - Alternative splicing (AS) is a process by which several functional splice variants are generated from the same precursor mRNA. In our recent study, five CsA-IPT5 splice variants with various numbers of ATTTA motifs in the untranslated regions (UTRs) were cloned. Meanwhile, their transient expression, as well as the expression and functional analysis in the two shoot branching processes were studied. Here, we examined how these splice variants regulate the other three important shoot branching processes, including the spring tea development, the distal branching of new shoots, and the shoot branching induced by 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) spraying, and thus unraveling the key CsA-IPT5 transcripts which play the most important roles in the shoot branching of tea plants. The results showed that the increased expression of 5 ' UTR AS3, 3 ' UTR AS1 and 3 ' UTR AS2 could contribute to the increased synthesis of tZ/iP-type cytokinins (CKs), thus promoting the spring tea development. Meanwhile, in the TIBA-induced shoot branching or in the distal branching of the new shoots, CsA-IPT5 transcripts regulated the synthesis of CsA-IPT5 protein and CKs through transcriptional regulation of the ratios of its splice variants. Moreover, 3 ' UTR AS1 and 3 ' UTR AS2 both play key roles in these two processes. In summary, it is revealed that 3 ' UTR AS1 and 3 ' UTR AS2 of CsA-IPT5 might act as the predominant splice variants in shoot branching of the tea plant, and they both can serve as gene resources for tea plant breeding.

AB  - Tea leaf spot, caused by Lasiodiplodia theobromae, is an important disease that can seriously decrease the production and quality of tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) leaves. The analysis of circular RNA (circRNA) in tea leaves after infection by the pathogen could improve understanding about the mechanism of host-pathogen interactions. In this study, high-performance sequencing of circRNA from C. sinensis Fuding-dabaicha leaves that had been infected with L. theobromae was conducted using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. In total, 192 and 153 differentially expressed circRNAs from tea leaves were significantly up- and downregulated, respectively, after infection with L. theobromae. A gene ontology analysis indicated that the differentially expressed circRNA-hosting genes for DNA binding were significantly enriched. The genes with significantly differential expressions that were annotated in the specified database (S genes) were r factor E isoform 1, triacylglycerol lipase SDP1, DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit 2, WRKY transcription factor WRKY24, and regulator of nonsense transcripts 1 homolog. A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis indicated that the significantly enriched circRNA-hosting genes involved in the plant-pathogen interaction pathway were Calmodulin-domain protein kinase 5 isoform 1, probable WRKY transcription factor 33, U-box domain-containing protein 35, probable inactive receptor-like protein kinase At3g56050, WRKY transcription factor WRKY24, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase YODA, SGT1, and protein DGS1. Functional annotation of circRNAs in tea leaves infected by L. theobromae will provide a valuable resource for future research on host-pathogen interactions.

AB  - Rose is an economically important flowering plant that holds an essential place in cut flower, medicinal, and aromatic industries. The presence of prickles, epidermal outgrowths resembling trichomes, on rose is highly undesirable as these make harvesting and transportation difficult. Attempts were made for generating rose varieties lacking prickles via breeding and natural selections; however, these approaches obtained only chimeric and genetically unstable prickle-less mutants. The alternative way to get rid of prickles is via genetic manipulations, but the molecular mechanisms of prickle initiation and development in rose are almost unexplored. Therefore, the present study was carried out to understand the morphological, molecular, and correlated metabolic changes underlining prickle morphogenesis in a prickle-bearing Rosa hybrida L. cv. "First Red (FR)". The histological and metabolomic analyses at three distinct stages of the prickle morphogenesis, namely, emerging tiny initiating prickles, partially greenish soft prickles, and brownish hard prickles, demonstrated a gradually increasing deposition of phenolic compounds and lignification with development. Corresponding RNAseq analysis revealed an upregulation of the genes involved in secondary metabolism, especially in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway. A set of genes encoding a transcriptional network similar to the one regulating epidermal cell differentiation leading to phenylpropanoid accumulation and trichome development, was also upregulated. Differential expression of this transcriptional network in prickle-less R. hybrida L. cv. "Himalayan Wonder" compared to prickly FR plants substantiated its involvement in prickle morphogenesis. The results collectively supported the proposition that prickles are evolved from trichomes and provided molecular clues towards engineering prickle-less roses.
   Significance statement: Prickles, the vasculature less epidermal outgrowths resembling trichomes, are defense organs protecting plants against herbivory. Despite biological significance, the mechanism of prickle morphogenesis remains obscure. Here, we show that like trichomes, prickles accumulate secondary metabolites, especially lignin and flavonoids, during morphogenesis. Cognate transcriptome analysis demonstrated that upregulation of a hormone-regulated transcriptional activation-inhibition network, known to govern trichome morphogenesis, likely triggers the differentiation of epidermal cells to outgrow into prickle.

AB  - Squalene is an extremely valuable medicinal substance. In addition to being valued for its high content of unsaturated fatty acids, Camellia oleifera is also highly regarded for its rich squalene content in the seed kernels. Comparing the squalene contents within Camellia species, it was found that the content in the seed oil of C. oleifera was higher than that of any other species. The squalene content of C. oleifera "Huashuo" (ColHS) reached 0.410 mg g-1, which was the highest. However, the squalene content in the seed kernels of ColHS did not increase gradually with the continuous maturation of the fruit. The squalene content reached its peak at 329DAP, about 0.854 mg g-1, and then decreased. With the differentially expressed genes and metabolites in the seed kernels at 329DAP and its surrounding periods, it was found that squalene content was accompanied by variations in secondary metabolites, terpenoids and flavonoids. The mevalonate (MVA) pathway played a significant role in squalene synthesis of ColHS seed kernels. In the MVA pathway, the expression patterns of four CoHMGR genes were consistent with the squalene content level. Among them, CoHMGR2 exhibited a strong correlation with squalene content. The CoHMGR2 was also found co-expressed with genes that had calcium ion-binding functions, playing a role in plant signal transduction.

AB  - Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat immune receptor genes (NLRs) play an important role in plant defenses against pathogens, pathogenic nematodes, and piercing-sucking herbivores. However, little is known about their functions in plant defenses against chewing herbivores. Here, we identified a plasma membrane-localized coiled-coil-type NLR protein, OsPik-2-like, whose transcript levels were induced by the infestation of rice leaf folder (LF, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) larvae, and by treatment with mechanical wounding. Knocking out OsPik-2-like in rice increased the LF-induced levels of jasmonic acid (JA) and jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), the activity of trypsin protease inhibitors (TrypPIs), and the basal levels of some flavonoids, which in turn decreased the performance of LF larvae. Moreover, knocking out OsPik-2-like reduced plant growth. These findings demonstrate that OsPik-2-like regulates the symbiosis between rice and LF by balancing plant growth and defense.

AB  - Pestalotiopsis guepinii is a pathogenic fungus that causes grey blight on Camellia pitardii. In this study, we investigated the enzyme activity and kinetics of these cell-wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) produced by Pestalotiopsis guepinii in both C. pitardii leaves and culture medium. Our enzyme activity experiments revealed that the activities of xylanase, pectin methyl-galacturonase (PMG), beta-1,4-endoglucanase (Cx), and beta-glucosidase were high in both C. pitardii leaves and culture medium. These enzymes played a significant role in the pathogenic process. However, the activity of laccase was found to be very low and had a minor impact on the pathogenic process. Furthermore, our enzyme dynamics experiments demonstrated that the optimal reaction temperature for PMG and Cx was 50 degrees C, while for beta-glucosidase and xylanase, it was 60 degrees C. The optimal reaction pH for Cx, beta-glucosidase, and xylanase was 5.0, whereas for PMG, it ranged from 5.0 to 6.0. This indicates that these four enzymes prefer acidic conditions. Moreover, we observed that the activities of Cx, PMG, and xylanase decreased with increasing reaction time. On the other hand, the activity of beta-glucosidase initially increased sharply and then decreased slowly. The maximum reaction rates of the four cell-wall-degrading enzymes were ranked as follows: xylanase > PMG > beta-glucosidase > Cx. Additionally, the affinities of these enzymes with substrates were ranked as follows: PMG < Cx < xylanase < beta-glucosidase.

AB  - In this work, we studied the induction of somatic embryogenesis in Arabidopsis using IZEs as explants. We characterized the process at the light and scanning electron microscope level and studied several specific aspects such as WUS expression, callose deposition, and principally Ca2+ dynamics during the first stages of the process of embryogenesis induction, by confocal FRET analysis with an Arabidopsis line expressing a cameleon calcium sensor. We also performed a pharmacological study with a series of chemicals know to alter calcium homeostasis (CaCl2, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, ionophore A23187, EGTA), the calcium-calmodulin interaction (chlorpromazine, W-7), and callose deposition (2-deoxy-D-glucose). We showed that, after determination of the cotiledonary protrusions as embryogenic regions, a finger-like appendix may emerge from the shoot apical region and somatic embryos are produced from the WUS-expressing cells of the appendix tip. Ca2+ levels increase and callose is deposited in the cells of the regions where somatic embryos will be formed, thereby constituting early markers of the embryogenic regions. We also found that Ca2+ homeostasis in this system is strictly maintained and cannot be altered to modulate embryo production, as shown for other systems. Together, these results contribute to a better knowledge and understanding of the process of induction of somatic embryos in this system.

AB  - The cellulose synthase gene superfamily, including Cellulose synthase A (CesA) and cellulose synthase-like (Csl) gene families, is responsible for the synthesis of cellulose and hemicellulose, respectively. The CesA/Csl genes are vital for abiotic stress resistance and shoot tenderness regulation of tea plants (Camellia sinensis). However, the CesA/Csl gene family has not been extensively studied in tea plants. Here, we identified 53 CsCesA/Csl genes in tea plants. These genes were grouped into five subfamilies (CsCesA, CsCslB, CsCslD, CsCslE, CsCslG) based on the phylogenetic relationships with Arabidopsis and rice. The analysis of chromosome distribution, gene structure, protein domain and motif revealed that most genes in CsCesA, CsCslD and CsCslE subfamilies were conserved, whereas CsCslB and CsCslG subfamily members are highly diverged. The transcriptome analysis showed that most CsCesA/Csl genes displayed tissue-specific expression pattern. In addition, members of CsCslB4, CsCesA1/3/6, CsCslB3/4, CsCslD3, CsCslE1 and CsCslG2/3 subfamilies were up-regulated under drought and cold stresses, indicating their potential roles in regulating stress tolerance in tea plants. Furthermore, the expression levels of CsCslG2_6 and CsCslD3_5 in different tissues and cultivars, respectively, were positively correlated with the cellulose content that is negatively related with shoot tenderness. Thus, these two genes were speculated to be involved in the regulation of shoot tenderness in tea plants. Our findings may help elucidate the evolutionary relationships and expression patterns of the CsCesA/Csl genes in tea plants, and provide more candidate genes responsible for stress tolerance and tenderness regulation in tea plants for future functional research.

AB  - Sea buckthorn is a vital woody oil species valued for its role in soil conservation and its bioactive seed oil, which is rich in unsaturated fatty acids and other compounds. However, low seed oil content and small seed size are the main bottlenecks restricting the development and utilization of sea buckthorn. In this study, we tested the seed oil content and seed size of 12 sea buckthorn cultivars and identified the key genes and transcription factors involved in seed development and lipid biosynthesis via the integration of UID RNA-seq (Unique Identifiers, UID), WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression network analysis) and qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time PCR) analysis. The results revealed five cultivars (CY02, CY11, CY201309, CY18, CY21) with significantly higher oil contents and five cultivars (CY10, CY201309, CY18, CY21, CY27) with significantly heavier seeds. A total of 10,873 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the S1 and S2 seed developmental stages of the 12 cultivars. WGCNA was used to identify five modules related to seed oil content and seed weight/size, and 417 candidate genes were screened from these modules. Among them, multiple hub genes and transcription factors were identified; for instance, ATP synthase, ATP synthase subunit D and Acyl carrier protein 1 were related to seed development; plastid-lipid-associated protein, acyltransferase-like protein, and glycerol-3-phosphate 2-O-acyltransferase 6 were involved in lipid biosynthesis; and transcription factors DOF1.2, BHLH137 and ERF4 were associated with seed enlargement and development. These findings provide crucial insights into the genetic regulation of seed traits in sea buckthorn, offering targets for future breeding efforts aimed at improving oil yield and quality.

AB  - MID1-COMPLEMENTING ACTIVITY (MCA) is a land plant-specific, plasma membrane protein, and Ca2+ signaling component that responds to exogenous mechanical stimuli, such as touch, gravity, and hypotonic-osmotic stress, in various plant species. MCA is essential for cell proliferation and differentiation during growth and development in rice (Oryza sativa) and maize (Zea mays). However, the mechanism by which MCA mediates cell proliferation and differentiation via Ca2+ signaling remains unknown. Here, we address this question using the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. We show that the M. polymorpha MCA ortholog, MpMCA, is highly expressed in actively dividing regions, such as apical notches in the thalli and developing gametangiophores, and that MpMCA is a plasma membrane protein. In vivo, Ca2+ imaging using a Ca2+ sensor (yellow cameleon) revealed that MpMCA is required for maintaining proper [Ca2+]cyt levels in the apical notch region, egg cells, and antheridium cells. Mpmca mutant plants showed severe cell proliferation and differentiation defects in the thalli, gametangiophores, and gametangia, resulting in abnormal development and unsuccessful fertilization. Furthermore, expression of the Arabidopsis MCA1 gene complemented most of the defects in the growth and development of the Mpmca mutant plants. Our findings indicate that MpMCA is an evolutionarily conserved Ca2+-signaling component that regulates cell proliferation and development across the life cycle of land plants.

AB  - The plants produce secondary metabolites (SMs) as defence compounds against both abiotic and biotic stresses. These stresses instigate the secretion and release of SMs by up or down-regulating the concerned genes involved in their synthesis. The secretion of SMs varies with the plant's genetic constitution and accordingly-they are susceptible or resistant. These metabolites mostly act as deterrents or antifeedants, allelochemicals, toxins or precursors of other metabolites that defend plants from stresses. However, some pathogens use these metabolites as a signal for host recognition or nutrition rather than using them as toxins or deterrents. The SMs activate different signalling pathways e.g. terpenoids modulate the calcineurin pathway, sesquiterpenoids modulate the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid pathway, polyphenols activate the jasmonic acid and phenylpropanoid pathway, and alkaloids activate the salicylic acid pathway to protect against pathogens and herbivores. Polyphenolic compounds provide resistance to different microbes by expressing different pathogenesis-proteins and hypersensitive reaction-mediated cell death and eliminate pathogens by altering the membrane permeability (inhibiting efflux pump), cell wall integrity, suppressing enzyme activity, free radicals' generation, inhibiting protein biosynthesis, damaging DNA and reducing the expression of virulent genes. Flavonoids help plants sustain pathogen stresses through the changes in the auxin transport process. The pathogen exposure upregulate genes of alkaloid synthesis pathways such as tyrosine decarboxylase (TyDC), S-norcoclurine synthase (NCS), codeinone reductase 2-like (COR-2), and StWRKY8 transcription factors which in turn accumulate alkaloids in large amounts. Plant exposure to pathogens leads to hypersensitivity reactions and phytoalexin accumulation. The plant's treatment of salicylic acid and jasmonic acid upregulated downstream transcription factors, increased the expression of defence proteins, triggered the synthesis of SMs, and provided resistance against multiple pathogens. Pathogens and herbivores have also coevolved to cope with defence metabolites by detoxifying the toxic metabolites, converting toxins into useful products, evolving their food choice, fast digestive system, expulsion of toxins, and down-regulation of the gene-producing secondary metabolites. This review article gives a molecular insight into the genes and regulatory proteins controlling the synthesis of SMs, which may help decipher the role of the biosynthetic pathway intermediates and thereby scoring genes providing resistance to various stresses. The article comprehensively describes the roles of different SMs in plant defence and their molecular mechanisms of action.

AB  - Granule cell dispersion (GCD) has been found in the dentate gyrus (dg) of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and a history of febrile seizures but was also recently observed in pediatric patients that did not suffer from epilepsy. This indicates that GCD might not always be disease related, but instead could reflect normal morphological variation. Thus, distribution of newborn granule cells within the hilar region is part of normal dg development at early stages but could be misinterpreted as pathological GCD. In turn, pathological GCD may be caused, for example, by genetic mutations, such as the reeler mutation. GCD in the reeler mutant goes along with an increased susceptibility to epileptiform activity. Pathological GCD in combination with epilepsy is caused by experimental administration of the glutamate receptor agonist kainic acid in rodents. In consequence, the interpretation of GCD and the role of febrile seizures remain controversial. Here, we asked whether febrile temperatures alone might be sufficient to trigger GCD and used hippocampal slice cultures as in vitro model to analyze the effect of a transient temperature increase on the dg morphology. We found that a heat-shock of 41 degrees C for 6 h was sufficient to induce GCD and degeneration of a fraction of granule cells. Both of these factors, broadening of the granule cell layer (gcl) and increased neuronal cell death within the gcl, contributed to the development of a significantly reduced packaging density of granule cells. In contrast, Reelin expressing Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells in the molecular layer were heat-shock resistant. Thus, their number was not reduced, and we did not detect degenerating CR cells after heat-shock, implying that GCD was not caused by the loss of CR cells. Importantly, the heat-shock-induced deterioration of dg morphology was accompanied by a massive microgliosis, reflecting a robust heat-shock-induced immune response. In contrast, in the study that reported on GCD as a non-specific finding in pediatric patients, no microglia reaction was observed. Thus, our findings underpin the importance of microglia as a marker to distinguish pathological GCD from normal morphological variation.

AB  - Background: A few studies linked air pollution to differences in functional connectivity of resting-state brain networks in children, but how air pollution exposure affects the development of brain networks remains poorly understood. Therefore, we studied the association of air pollution exposure from birth to 3 years and one year before the first imaging assessment with the development of functional connectivity across adolescence. Methods: We utilized data from 3,626 children of the Generation R Study (The Netherlands). We estimated residential exposure to PM10, PM2.5, PM 2.5 absorbance, NOX, and NO2 with land-use regression models. Between- and within-network functional connectivity was calculated for 13 cortical networks, and the amygdala, hippo- campus, and caudate nucleus at two assessments (8.6-12.0 and 12.6-17.1 years), resulting in 4,628 scans (2,511 for assessment 1 and 2,117 for assessment 2) from 3,626 individuals. We investigated the association between air pollution and functional connectivity with linear mixed models adjusted for life-style and socioeconomic variables, and corrected for multiple testing. Results: Higher exposure to PM 2.5 from birth to 3 years was associated with persistently lower functional connectivity over time between the amygdala and the ventral attention, somatomotor hand, and auditory networks throughout adolescence (e.g.-0.027 functional connectivity [95 % CI-0.040;-0.013] amygdala - ventral attention network per 5 mu g/m3 higher PM2.5). Higher exposure to PM10 one year before the first imaging assessment was associated with persistently lower functional connectivity between the salience and medial- parietal networks throughout adolescence. Air pollution was not associated with a faster or slower change in functional connectivity with age. Conclusions: Air pollution exposure early in life was associated with persistent alterations in connectivity between the amygdala and cortical networks involved in attention, somatomotor, and auditory function. Concurrent exposure was associated with persistent connectivity alterations between networks related to higher cognitive functions (i.e. the salience and medial-parietal networks).

AB  - BACKGROUND Tea plants have high nitrogen (N) consumptions, whereas molecular and physiological responses of tea plants to N recovery are still unclear. RESULTS By using non-invasive micro-test technology (NMT), N-15 tracer technique, ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), and transcriptome sequencing technology, we investigated the N recovery-induced changes in N absorptions, N tissue distributions, contents of free amino acids (FAAs), and global transcription of the low-N tolerant and intolerant tea genotypes [i.e. Wuniuzao (W) and Longjing43 (L)]. The results showed that the phenotype of Wuniuzao was better than that of Longjing43 under low-N condition. The N absorption and utilization of Wuniuzao were superior to Longjing43 under N recovery. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ratio (N recovery/N deficiency) in the root of Wuniuzao was significantly higher than that of Longjing43, while the glutamic acid ratio in the root of Wuniuzao was significantly lower than that of Longjing43. This findings suggested that Wuniuzao tended to enhance the GABA synthesis, while Longjing43 tended to inhibit the GABA synthesis under N recovery. The key genes in response to N recovery in Wuniuzao included N transport (AMT and NRT), N transformation (NR, NirA, and GAD), and amino acid transport (GAT) genes. In addition, some ribosome and flavonoid biosynthesis genes might help to maintain proteome homeostasis. CONCLUSION The N absorption and transport, and the conversion abilities of key amino acids (Glu and GABA) might improve the adaptability of tea plants to N recovery, which provided a basis for the breeding of N efficient tea varieties.

AB  - BackgroundAdventitious root (AR) formation is the key step for successful cutting propagation of tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.). Studies showed that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) can promote the rooting ability, and auxin pathway in basal stem of cuttings was involved in this process. However, auxin and abscisic acid (another important regulator on AR formation) in the other parts of cuttings at different rooting stages responding to AMF inoculation are not well studied. Therefore, in this paper, contents, enzymes and genes related to these two plant hormones were comprehensively determined aiming to unveil how endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) involve in the AMF regulating AR development of tea cuttings.ResultsInoculating with AMF significantly increased the proportion of cuttings at S2 stage (AR formation), which was more than twice as much as the control. And the total rooting rate in mycorrhizal treatment was also higher than that in the control with an increase of 8.66%. Enzyme activity assays showed that except for decreased polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity at the S3 stage and peroxidase (POD) activity in middle stem of S3 stage, AMF inoculation increased activities of POD, PPO, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) to varying degrees in leaf, middle stem and basal stem of tea cuttings. After inoculation with AMF, the indoleacetic acid oxidase (IAAO) activity decreased to a certain extent in the first three stages of tea cuttings, which showed a trend of 'low-high-low' in the basal stem of all treatments. Besides, there was a significantly positive correlation between SOD activity and AR formation, especially for the proportion of cuttings at S2 and S3 stages. Higher IAA level and IAA/ABA ratio was found in basal stem of cuttings at S1 stage induced by AMF, which promoting the AR formation as revealed by correlation analysis. At the same time, AMF significantly elevated the level of IAA in leaf at S1 stage. By screening differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to IAA and ABA pathways, together with redundant analysis, it was indicated that auxin biosynthesis and transport, as well as ABA transport and signal transduction, were involved in AMF regulating the rooting of tea cuttings.ConclusionsOverall, both endogenous IAA and ABA played roles in the regulation of AR formation of tea cuttings by AMF inoculating, enriching the theoretical basis of AMF regulating rooting of cuttings and providing foundations for cutting propagation of tea plants.

AB  - Camellia oleifera Abel, one of the most valuable woody oil plants, has been widely cultivated for extracting edible oil. The shell of C. oleifera is a by-product generated in the processing of edible oil extraction. However, there is still limited research on the maturity and high-value resource utilization of shell by-products. We found that the C. oleifera 'Huashuo' (HS) fruit shells contained a high content of catechins. Abscisic acid (ABA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) enhanced the accumulation of catechins in C. oleifera fruit shells, providing a basis for production and application of the catechins in fruit shells of C. oleifera. We further found that 500 mu M ABA and 900 mu M MeJA significantly promoted the accumulation of catechin (C) and epicatechin (EC) in fruit shells. Following treatment with 900 mu M MeJA, the expressions of CoPAL1, CoC4H1, CoC4H2, CoC4H3, Co4CL1, Co4CL2, CoF3 ' H1, CoLAR1, CoLAR2, CoLAR3, CoANR2, and CoANRL2 were significantly upregulated, while after 500 mu M ABA treatment the expressions of CoPAL3, CoCHS1, CoCHS4, CoF3 ' H1, CoDFR, CoLAR1, CoLAR2, CoLAR3, CoANS1, CoANR1, and CoANR2 increased dramatically. These results indicate that appropriate concentrations of ABA and MeJA activate C and EC biosynthesis and promote their accumulation in fruit shells. Our results provide new ideas and guidance for promoting the resource utilization of C. oleifera fruit shells.

However, few studies have explored the associations between tea plant leaf traits and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in Guizhou.ResultsIn this study, we used the genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) method to identify 100,829 SNP markers from 338 accessions of tea germplasm in Guizhou Plateau, a region with rich genetic resources. We assessed population structure based on high-quality SNPs, constructed phylogenetic relationships, and performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Four inferred pure groups (G-I, G-II, G-III, and G-IV) and one inferred admixture group (G-V), were identified by a population structure analysis, and verified by principal component analyses and phylogenetic analyses. Through GWAS, we identified six candidate genes associated with four leaf traits, including mature leaf size, texture, color and shape. Specifically, two candidate genes, located on chromosomes 1 and 9, were significantly associated with mature leaf size, while two genes, located on chromosomes 8 and 11, were significantly associated with mature leaf texture. Additionally, two candidate genes, located on chromosomes 1 and 2 were identified as being associated with mature leaf color and mature leaf shape, respectively. We verified the expression level of two candidate genes was verified using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and designed a derived cleaved amplified polymorphism (dCAPS) marker that co-segregated with mature leaf size, which could be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding in Camellia sinensis.ConclusionsIn the present study, by using GWAS approaches with the 338 tea accessions population in Guizhou, we revealed a list of SNPs markers and candidate genes that were significantly associated with four leaf traits. This work provides theoretical and practical basis for the genetic breeding of related traits in tea plant leaves.

AB  - My favorite flower is the California poppy (Eschscholzia californica Cham., Ranunculales, Papaveraceae, Eschscholzioideae) (Fig. 1). This has such colorful flowers that it is one of the few species that can be observed from outer space. This occurs during the spectacular but rare California poppy super blooms following winters with higher than average rainfall, for example in the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve at the western tip of the Mojave Desert. These California poppy super blooms attract large crowds of digital nomads flooding social media with streams of bright orange landscapes, and sometimes trampling down whole stands in the process. Going through old pictures with my parents recently, I realized that I had seen a California poppy bloom back in 1997, when my parents and I were visiting the Western parts of the USA together before I headed back for a PhD position in Germany. Little did I know that years later I would be heavily involved in studying this species.

AB  - In plants, de novo DNA methylation is guided by 24-nt short interfering (si)RNAs in a process called RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Primarily targeted at transposons, RdDM causes transcriptional silencing and can indirectly influence expression of neighboring genes. During reproduction, a small number of siRNA loci are dramatically upregulated in the maternally derived seed coat, suggesting that RdDM might have a special function during reproduction. However, the developmental consequence of RdDM has been difficult to dissect because disruption of RdDM does not result in overt phenotypes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), where the pathway has been most thoroughly studied. In contrast, Brassica rapa mutants lacking RdDM have a severe seed production defect, which is determined by the maternal sporophytic genotype. To explore the factors that underlie the different phenotypes of these species, we produced RdDM mutations in 3 additional members of the Brassicaceae family: Camelina sativa, Capsella rubella, and Capsella grandiflora. Among these 3 species, only mutations in the obligate outcrosser, C. grandiflora, displayed a seed production defect similar to Brassica rapa mutants, suggesting that mating system is a key determinant for reproductive phenotypes in RdDM mutants.
   Comparing the mutant phenotypes of closely related plants indicates that RNA-directed DNA methylation is more important for seed development in outbreeding compared to inbreeding species.

AB  - Persimmon leaves are used for making persimmon leaf tea or as functional ingredients due to their enrichment in flavonoids, the beneficial mineral contents, and favorable flavors contributed by volatile aroma compounds. The varieties/cultivars had a significant influence on the quality and flavor of persimmon leaf tea. In this study, the integrated metabolomic-transcriptomic analysis was conducted to investigate the potential in flavonoid biosynthesis, mineral absorption, and degradation of aromatic compounds from tender leaves of "Diospyros kaki. Heishi" (HS), "Diospyros kaki Thunb. Nishimurawase" (NM), and "Diospyros kaki Thunb. Taifu" (TF), using rootstock "Diospyros Lotus Linn" (DL) as the control. The metabolomic analysis showed that 382, 391, and 368 metabolites were differentially accumulated in the comparison of DL vs. HS, DL vs. NM, and DL vs. TF, respectively, and 229 common metabolites were obtained by comparative analysis. By RNA sequencing, 182,008 unigenes with 652 bp of mean length were annotated and 2,598, 3,503, and 3,333 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected from the comparison of DL vs. HS, DL vs. NM, and DL vs. TF, respectively. After the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment, 6, 6, and 3 DEGs [with | log2(fold change)| >= 1 simultaneously in the three comparisons] involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, mineral absorption, and degradation of aromatic compounds, respectively, were selected for quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) validation and the consistent trends of the relative expression level of each DEG with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data were observed. Based on the transcriptomic analysis and qRT-PCR validation, it was observed that the leaves of HS, NM, and TF had the greatest level of mineral absorption, flavonoid biosynthesis, and degradation of aromatic compounds, respectively. In addition, a positive correlation between the 15 DEGs and their metabolites was observed by the conjoint analysis. Thus, the tender leaves of HS, NM, and TF could be recommended for the production of persimmon leaf tea rich in mineral elements, flavonoid, and aroma compounds, respectively.

AB  - Pleurodesmospora is an anamorphic genus with two known species recorded mainly on chitinous substrates such as insects, mites, spiders, and foliicolous fungi in tropical and subtropical areas. A further fungus with similar morphology of conidiophores and conidiogenous cells was found on a dead mite on a living fern (Angiopteris lygodiifolia). Isolated in culture, this fungus produced white dusty colonies. Morphologically, the new strain from the mite differs from the two known Pleurodesmospora species by non-catenate conidia and chlamydospores and is, therefore, proposed as new species. The tea whitefly, Aleurocanthus camelliae, was found as new host of Pleurodesmospora coccorum in Taiwan. The ITS sequences of these isolates are similar to those of other Pleurodesmospora strains. A phylogenetic analysis of a combined ITS and TEF sequence dataset indicates the presence of cryptic species in Pleurodesmospora.

AB  - Crop plants are assumed to have become more susceptible to pests as a result of selection for high growth rates during the process of domestication, consistent with resource allocation theories. We compared the investment by domesticated sorghum into cyanogenic glucosides, nitrogen-based specialised metabolites that break down to release hydrogen cyanide, with five wild relatives native to Australia. Plants were grown in pots in a greenhouse and supplied with low and high concentrations of nitrogen and monitored for 9 weeks. The concentrations of nitrate, total phenolics and silicon were also measured. Domesticated Sorghum bicolor had the highest leaf and root cyanogenic glucoside concentrations, and among the lowest nitrate and silicon concentrations under both treatments. Despite partitioning a much higher proportion of its stored nitrogen to cyanogenic glucosides than the wild species, S. bicolor's nitrogen productivity levels were among the highest. Most of the wild sorghums had higher concentrations of silicon and phenolics, which may provide an alternative defence system. Cyanogenic glucosides appear to be integral to S. bicolor's physiology, having roles in both growth and defence. Sorghum macrospermum displayed consistently low cyanogenic glucoside concentrations, high growth rates and high nitrogen productivity and represents a particularly attractive genetic resource for sorghum improvement.

AB  - Allene oxide synthase (AOS) is the second enzyme in the biosynthesis of the plant defensive hormone jasmonic acid (JA). In rice, there are two AOSs, OsAOS1 and OsAOS2. However, the role of these two AOS genes in herbivore-induced defenses in rice remains unidentified. We cloned the two rice AOS genes and observed that the transcript level of both OsAOS1 and OsAOS2 was enhanced by mechanical wounding, the infestation of the striped stem borer (SSB) (Chilo suppressalis) or brown planthopper (BPH) (Niaparvata lugens), and treatment with JA; however, OsAOS1 responded more rapidly to SSB infestation and JA treatment than did OsAOS2. The antisense expression of OsAOS1 (as-aos1) or OsAOS2 (as-aos2) decreased levels of SSB- or BPH-induced JA, which, in turn, reduced the production of SSB-induced trypsin protease inhibitor (TrypPI) and volatiles as well as the resistance of rice to SSB. In contrast, BPH preferred to feed and oviposit on wild-type (WT) plants over as-aos1 and as-aos2 plants. Moreover, the survival of BPH nymphs on as-aos1 or as-aos2 lines was significantly lower than on WT plants. The increased resistance of as-aos1 or as-aos2 plants to BPH correlated with higher levels of BPH-induced H2O2 and SA. These results indicate that OsAOS1 and OsAOS2 are both involved in herbivore-induced JA biosynthesis and play a vital role in determining the resistance of rice to chewing and phloem-feeding herbivores.

AB  - Background Camellia nitidissima is a rare, prized camellia species with golden-yellow flowers. It has a high ornamental, medicinal, and economic value. Previous studies have shown substantial flavonol accumulation in C. nitidissima petals during flower formation. However, the mechanisms underlying the golden flower formation in C. nitidissima remain largely unknown. Results We performed an integrative analysis of the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome of the petals at five flower developmental stages to construct the regulatory network underlying golden flower formation in C. nitidissima. Metabolome analysis revealed the presence of 323 flavonoids, and two flavonols, quercetin glycosides and kaempferol glycosides, were highly accumulated in the golden petals. Transcriptome and proteome sequencing suggested that the flavonol biosynthesis-related genes and proteins upregulated and the anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis-related genes and proteins downregulated in the golden petal stage. Further investigation revealed the involvement of MYBs and bHLHs in flavonoid biosynthesis. Expression analysis showed that flavonol synthase 2 (CnFLS2) was highly expressed in the petals, and its expression positively correlated with flavonol content at all flower developmental stages. Transient overexpression of CnFLS2 in the petals increased flavonol content. Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that the jasmonate (JA) pathways positively correlated with flavonol biosynthesis, and exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment promoted CnFLS2 expression and flavonol accumulation. Conclusions Our findings showed that the JA-CnFLS2 module regulates flavonol biosynthesis during golden petal formation in C. nitidissima.

AB  - Balancing the ATP: NADPH demand from plant metabolism with supply from photosynthesis is essential for preventing photodamage and operating efficiently, so understanding its drivers is important for integrating metabolism with the light reactions of photosynthesis and for bioengineering efforts that may radically change this demand. It is often assumed that the C3 cycle and photorespiration consume the largest amount of ATP and reductant in illuminated leaves and as a result mostly determine the ATP: NADPH demand. However, the quantitative extent to which other energy consuming metabolic processes contribute in large ways to overall ATP: NADPH demand remains unknown. Here, we used the metabolic flux networks of numerous recently published isotopically non-stationary metabolic flux analyses (INST-MFA) to evaluate flux through the C3 cycle, photorespiration, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and starch/sucrose synthesis and characterize broad trends in the demand of energy across different pathways and compartments as well as in the overall ATP:NADPH demand. These data sets include a variety of species including Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum, and Camelina sativa as well as varying environmental factors including high/low light, day length, and photorespiratory levels. Examining these datasets in aggregate reveals that ultimately the bulk of the energy flux occurred in the C3 cycle and photorespiration, however, the energy demand from these pathways did not determine the ATP: NADPH demand alone. Instead, a notable contribution was revealed from starch and sucrose synthesis which might counterbalance photorespiratory demand and result in fewer adjustments in mechanisms which balance the ATP deficit.

AB  - Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) play pivotal roles in plant anti-herbivore defense. This study investigated whether the rice 13-lipoxygense gene OsRCI-1 is involved in GLV production and plant defense in rice. The overexpression of OsRCI-1 (oeRCI lines) in rice resulted in increased wound-induced levels of two prominent GLVs, cis-3-hexen-1-ol and cis-3-hexenal. In a previous study, we found that the overexpression of OsRCI-1 reduced the colonization by the rice brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) but increased the attractiveness to the egg parasitoid Anagrus nilaparvatae compared to wild-type (WT) plants. This study found that when cis-3-hexen-1-ol, but not cis-3-hexenal, was added to WT plants, it could change the BPH's colonization preference, i.e., more BPHs preferred to colonize the oeRCI lines. The exogenous application of cis-3-hexen-1-ol or cis-3-hexenal to BPH-infested WT plants could weaken or overturn the preference of A. nilaparvatae for oeRCI lines. However, field experiments revealed that only cis-3-hexenal was attractive to the parasitoid and increased the parasitism rates of BPH eggs. These results indicate that OsRCI-1 is involved in rice GLV production and therefore modulates both direct and indirect defense in rice.

AB  - Aroma is an essential quality indicator of oolong tea, a tea derived from the Camellia sinensis L. plant. Carboxylic 6 (C6) acids and their derivative esters are important components of fatty acid (FA)-derived volatiles in oolong tea. However, the formation and regulation mechanism of C6 acid during postharvest processing of oolong tea remains unclear. To gain better insight into the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of C6 compounds in oolong tea, a combined analysis of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity, CsADH2 key gene expression, and the FA-derived metabolome during postharvest processing of oolong tea was performed for the first time, complemented by CsHIP (hypoxia-induced protein conserved region) gene expression analysis. Volatile fatty acid derivative (VFAD)-targeted metabolomics analysis using headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HS-SPEM-GC-TOF-MS) showed that the (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol content increased after each turnover, while the hexanoic acid content showed the opposite trend. The results further showed that both the ADH activity and CsADH gene expression level in oxygen-deficit-turnover tea leaves (ODT) were higher than those of oxygen-turnover tea leaves (OT). The C6-alcohol-derived ester content of OT was significantly higher than that of ODT, while C6-acid-derived ester content showed the opposite trend. Furthermore, the HIP gene family was screened and analyzed, showing that ODT treatment significantly promoted the upregulation of CsHIG4 and CsHIG6 gene expression. These results showed that the formation mechanism of oolong tea aroma quality is mediated by airflow in the lipoxygenase-hydroperoxide lyase (LOX-HPL) pathway, which provided a theoretical reference for future quality control in the postharvest processing of oolong tea.

AB  - The oomycete Albugo candida causes white rust of Brassicaceae, including vegetable and oilseed crops, and wild relatives such as Arabidopsis thaliana. Novel White Rust Resistance (WRR) genes from Arabidopsis enable new insights into plant/parasite co-evolution. WRR4A from Arabidopsis accession Columbia (Col-0) provides resistance to many but not all white rust races, and encodes a nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat immune receptor. Col-0 WRR4A resistance is broken by AcEx1, an isolate of A. candida. We identified an allele of WRR4A in Arabidopsis accession oystese-0 (Oy-0) and other accessions that confers full resistance to AcEx1. WRR4A(Oy-0) carries a C-terminal extension required for recognition of AcEx1, but reduces recognition of several effectors recognized by the WRR4A(Col-0) allele. WRR4A(Oy-0) confers full resistance to AcEx1 when expressed in the oilseed crop Camelina sativa.

AB  - Source Segregation (SS) is a novel strategy in dairy housing that can reduce emissions and separate organic matter and nutrients more efficiently than traditional slurry solid-liquid separation. The anaerobic digestion (AD) methane yield of the SS fractions, however, is unknown. We aimed at unveiling the biomethane yield of these fractions by conducting AD experiments under different configurations: batch, continuous feeding, and fed-batch. In the batch test, the solid (SF) and liquid fraction (LF) from the SS system, a slurry collected from the pit (CS), and a self-made slurry (MF) were used as substrates. The results showed that the specific CH4 yields of the SF and MF were in same range and both higher than the CS. We concluded that SS can increase the CH4 yield of dairy excreta mainly by reducing losses in the animal house. The SF and MF were then compared in a continuously-fed thermophilic test, where SF had a higher specific (174 compared to 105 NL kg-1 VS) and volumetric (12.2 compared to 9.9 NL CH4 kg-1 excreta) yields. We concluded that the SF can effectively substitute slurry in AD without compromising the yield, possibly increasing economic viability by reducing transport costs and reactor size. Further, SF produced 356 NL CH4 kg-1 VS and a digestate with 1.8% lower dry matter in the fed-batch as compared to continuous feeding. Continuously stirred fed-batch can thus increase the CH4 yield of the SF and reduce the DM of its digestate potentially contributing to lower emissions in storage and field application.

AB  - Shading is a widely applied strategy to increase theanine and chlorophyll levels in tea leaves during matcha production. However, the regulatory mechanism of theanine accumulation under shading conditions remains elusive. Through visualization analysis of PIF genes under shading conditions, we identified a homologue of AtPIF7 gene, CsPIF7, highly responsive to shading treatment. Through co-expression analysis, we found that CsPIF7 expression patterns exhibited a high correlation with those of the key theanine biosynthesis genes, CsTSI and CsGSI. Silencing of CsPIF7 significantly reduced the expression of CsTSI and CsGSI and theanine content. On the contrary, overexpression of CsPIF7 increased the expression levels of CsTSI and CsGSI and theanine content. Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H), dual-luciferase reporter assay and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) further demonstrated that CsPIF7 could bind to the promoters of CsTSI and CsGSI, and activate the expression of CsTSI and CsGSI. In conclusion, CsPIF7 could mediate the shading-induced biosynthesis of theanine by directly binding to and activating the expression of CsTSI and CsGSI. This study provides new insights into molecular mechanisms for the production of greener and fresher matcha under shading conditions.

AB  - Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are widely recognized for their role in priming neighbouring plants against pathogens and herbivores, whilst their involvement in airborne-mediated priming under abiotic stress remains largely unexplored. With a 3-step experiment, we tested the hypothesis that VOC emissions by salt-stressed plants can prime neighbouring conspecific individuals once subjected to salinity. In step 1, salt-stressed (60 mM NaCl for 20 days; emitters - C+NaCl) strawberry plants (Fragaria x ananassa var. Elsanta) were grown together with receiver individuals irrigated with water only (NaCl-S). In step 2, a subset of NaCl-S plants was exposed to salt stress (NaCl-S+NaCl), while others were co-grown in a plastic box with additional unstressed strawberry plants (super receiver - NaCl-SS). Lastly, in step 3, NaCl-SS plants were treated with salt stress (NaCl-SS+NaCl). Control (C) - irrigated with water only - and C+NaCl plants of the same age as treated plants, were maintained as references for each step. In step 2, no differences were detected in terms of biomass, gas exchange parameters and chlorophyll content in NaCl-S+NaCl compared to non-stressed plants, thus confirming an enhanced stress tolerance mediated by infochemicals from emitters. Furthermore, in step 3, NaCl-SS+NaCl mirrored the performances of emitters, suggesting that no efficient airborne signal transmission took place from NaCl-S to NaClSS. The dataset offers evidence that neighbouring plants can perceive airborne signals, altering their metabolic profile and enhancing stress tolerance when subsequently stressed. Moreover, we demonstrate that, despite being primed, receivers cannot propagate the signal to their neighbouring conspecific individuals.

AB  - Co-option of gene regulatory networks leads to the acquisition of new cell types and tissues. Stomata, valves formed by guard cells (GCs), are present in most land plants and regulate CO2 exchange. The transcription factor (TF) FAMA globally regulates GC differentiation. In the Brassicales, FAMA also promotes the development of idioblast myrosin cells (MCs), another type of specialized cell along the vasculature essential for Brassicales-specific chemical defences. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana, FAMA directly induces the TF gene WASABI MAKER (WSB), which triggers MC differentiation. WSB and STOMATAL CARPENTER 1 (SCAP1, a stomatal lineage-specific direct FAMA target), synergistically promote GC differentiation. wsb mutants lacked MCs and the wsb scap1 double mutant lacked normal GCs. Evolutionary analyses revealed that WSB is conserved across stomatous angiosperms. We propose that the conserved and reduced transcriptional FAMA-WSB module was co-opted before evolving to induce MC differentiation.

AB  - In tea (Camellia sinensis), anthocyanins are important secondary metabolites that are linked to leaf color. Anthocyanin biosynthesis is a complex biological process, in which multiple genes including structural and regulatory genes are involved. Here, we describe the cloning and characterizing of a new R2R3-MYB transcription factor gene, CsRAB, isolated from purple tea variety 'Hongfei'. Consistent with its predicted role as a transcription factor, the CsRAB protein localized to nuclei when expressed in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cell. A dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that CsRAB acts as a transcriptional activator in vivo. CsRAB overexpression in Arabidopsis seedlings led to higher expression levels of anthocyanin biosynthesis-related genes, and consequently, purple stems and higher anthocyanin contents were exhibited in overexpressing lines compared to wild type. The results indicated that CsRAB plays critical roles in positively regulating anthocyanins biosynthesis in tea plants.

AB  - Researching the photosynthetic characteristics based on the whole chloroplast genome sequence of Camellia osmantha cv 'yidan' is important for improving production. We sequenced and analyzed the chloroplast (cp) genomes of C. osmantha cv 'yidan'. The total cp genome length was 156,981 bp. The cp genomes included 134 genes encoding 81 proteins, 39 transfer RNAs, 8 ribosomal RNAs, and 6 genes with unknown functions. In total, 50 repeat sequences were identified in C. osmantha cv 'yidan' cp genomes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that C. osmantha cv 'yidan' is more closely related to Camellia vietnamensis cv 'hongguo' and Camellia oleifera cv 'cenruan 3' than to Camellia semiserrata cv 'hongyu 1'. Our complete assembly of four Camellia cp genomes may contribute to breeding for high oil content plants and further biological discoveries. The results of this study provide a basis for the assembly of the entire chloroplast genome of C. osmantha cv 'yidan'.

AB  - Camellia oleifera (C. oleifera), one of the world's four major edible woody oil crops, has been widely planted in southern China's subtropical region for the extremely high nutritional and health benefits of its seed oil. Timing and synchronization of fruit dehiscence are critical factors influencing the oil output and quality, as well as the efficiency and cost of harvesting C. oleifera, yet they extremely lack attention. To gain an understanding of the molecular basis underlying the dehiscence of C. oleifera fruit, we sampled pericarp-replum tissues containing dehiscence zones from fruits at different developmental stages and performed time-series transcriptomic sequencing and analysis for the first time. Statistical and GO enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that drastic transcriptional changes occurred over the last short sampling interval (4 days, 18th-22nd October), which directed functional classifications link to cell wall and cell wall macromolecule activity. WGCNA further showed that factors controlling cell wall modification, including endo-1,3;1,4-beta-D-glucanase, WAT1-like protein 37, LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase, and cellulose synthase A catalytic subunit, were identified as core members of the co-expression network of the last stage highly related modules. Furthermore, in these modules, we also noted genes that were annotated as coding for polygalacturonase and pectinesterase, two pectinases that were expected to be major players in cell separation during dehiscence. qRT-PCR further confirmed the expression profiles of these cell wall modification relating factors, which possessed a special high transcriptional abundance at the final stage. These results suggested the cell wall associated cell separation, one of the essential processes downstream of fruit dehiscence, happened in dehiscing fruit of C. oleifera during ripening. Hydrolases acting on cell wall components are good candidates for signal mediating dehiscence of C. oleifera fruit. In conclusion, our analysis provided insights into the cell wall macromolecule-mediated fruit dehiscence during ripening in C. oleifera.

AB  - More than 600 species in over 40 genera have been identified in family Theaceae worldwide. The accurate identification of Theaceae plants can ensure the market economic order, and it plays a vital role in achieving the sustainable utilization of germplasm resources. DNA barcoding, one of the most potential species identification technologies at present, has advanced in the rapid, accurate and repetitive discrimination of species. In this study, matK + ndhF + ycf1 was observed as the optimal combined candidate gene sequence of DNA barcodes by analyzing genetic information of four single chloroplast DNA sequences, including matK, rbcL, ndhF and ycf1, as well as six combined gene sequences. Subsequently, the experiments were performed on phylogenetic analysis based on genetic distance to study the phylogenetic relationship of Theaceae plants and evaluate the species identification accuracy of matK + ndhF + ycf1. Lastly, the species-specific DNA barcodes were designed by searching the variable sites (one type of single nucleotide polymorphism sites) for the accurate identification of Camellia amplexicaulis, Franklinia alatamaha, Gordonia brandegeei and Stewartia micrantha. The previous methods of screening and testing candidate gene sequences were optimized, and innovation was made in the above methods. The process of making visual DNA barcodes was standardized. Besides, DNA barcoding technology increased the accuracy of species identification and DNA barcoding was analyzed in accordance with the theories of population genetics (e.g., neutral theory of molecular evolution). The results of the study will lay a basis for the identification and protection of Theaceae species and germplasm resources.

AB  - There are numerous non-volatile metabolites in the fresh shoots of tea plants. However, we know little about the complex relationship between the content of these metabolites and their gene expression levels. In investigating this, this study involved non-volatile metabolites from 68 accessions of tea plants that were detected and identified using untargeted metabolomics. The tea accessions were divided into three groups from the results of a principal component analysis based on the relative content of the metabolites. There were differences in variability between the primary and secondary metabolites. Furthermore, correlations among genes, gene metabolites, and metabolites were conducted based on Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) values. This study offered several significant insights into the co-current network of genes and metabolites in the global genetic background. Thus, the study is useful for providing insights into the regulatory relationship of the genetic basis for predominant metabolites in fresh tea shoots.

AB  - Simple Summary This study delves into the turning behavior of pigeons by examining the neural mechanisms of their midbrain motor nucleus. Correlating brain oscillations with turning behavior, we identified the distinct roles of oscillatory patterns in different frequency bands during active and passive turning behavior. Specifically, 80 Hz stimulation induced higher-frequency oscillation patterns. These findings unveil the intricate relationship between neural oscillations and pigeon turning, highlighting the significance of specific frequency bands. This study enhances our understanding of avian brain-behavior connections, offering valuable insights for further research on avian locomotion neural processes and serving as a reference for future studies on neuromodulation techniques in flying animal robots.Abstract Flexible turning behavior endows Homing Pigeons (Columba livia domestica) with high adaptability and intelligence in long-distance flight, foraging, hazard avoidance, and social interactions. The present study recorded the activity pattern of their local field potential (LFP) oscillations and explored the relationship between different bands of oscillations and turning behaviors in the formatio reticularis medialis mesencephali (FRM). The results showed that the C (13-60 Hz) and D (61-130 Hz) bands derived from FRM nuclei oscillated significantly in active turning, while the D and E (131-200 Hz) bands oscillated significantly in passive turning. Additionally, compared with lower-frequency stimulation (40 Hz and 60 Hz), 80 Hz stimulation can effectively activate the turning function of FRM nuclei. Electrical stimulation elicited stronger oscillations of neural activity, which strengthened the pigeons' turning locomotion willingness, showing an enhanced neural activation effect. These findings suggest that different band oscillations play different roles in the turning behavior; in particular, higher-frequency oscillations (D and E bands) enhance the turning behavior. These findings will help us decode the complex relationship between bird brains and behaviors and are expected to facilitate the development of neuromodulation techniques for animal robotics.

AB  - Air pollution has recently emerged as a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke. Although there is a robust association between higher concentrations of ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) and increased incidence and mortality rates of ischemic stroke, the precise mechanisms underlying PM2.5-induced ischemic stroke remain to be fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to examine the synergistic effect of PM2.5 and hypoxic stress using in vivo and in vitro ischemic stroke models. Intravenously administered PM2.5 exacerbated the ischemic brain damage induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in Sprague Dawley rats. Alterations in autophagy flux and decreased levels of tight junction proteins were observed in the brain of PM2.5-administered rats after MCAo. The underlying mechanism of PM2.5-induced potentiation of ischemic brain damage was investigated in neurons, perivascular macrophages, and brain endothelial cells, which are the major components of the integrated neurovascular unit. Co-treatment with PM2.5 and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) amplified the effects of OGD on the reduction of viability in primary neurons, immortalized murine hippocampal neuron (HT-22), and brain endothelial cells (bEND.3). After co-treatment with PM2.5 and OGD, the Akt/beta-catenin and autophagy flux were significantly inhibited in HT-22 cells. Notably, the protein levels of metalloproteinase-9 and cystatin C were elevated in the conditioned media of murine macrophages (RAW264.7) exposed to PM2.5, and tight junction protein expression was significantly decreased after OGD exposure in bEND.3 cells pretreated with the conditioned media. Our findings suggest that perivascular macrophages may mediate PM2.5-induced brain endothelial dysfunction following ischemia and that PM2.5 can exacerbate ischemia-induced neurovascular damage.

AB  - Status epilepticus is linked to cognitive decline due to damage to the hippocampus, a key structure involved in cognition. The hippocampus's high vulnerability to epilepsy-related damage is the main reason for this impairment. Convulsive seizures, such as those observed in status epilepticus, can cause various hippocampal pathologies, including inflammation, abnormal neurogenesis, and neuronal death. Interestingly, substantial evidence points to the therapeutic potential of the sedative/hypnotic agent zolpidem for neurorehabilitation in brain injury patients, following the unexpected discovery of its paradoxical awakening effect. In this study, we successfully established an ideal lithium-pilocarpine rat model of status epilepticus, which displayed significant deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. The Morris water maze test was used to assess zolpidem's potential to improve learning and memory, as well as its impact on anxiety-like behavior and motorfunction. Immunohistochemical staining and fluorescence analysis were used to examine the effect of zolpidem on K'-Cl-cotransporter 2 (KCC2) and Na+-K+-Cl-cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) protein expression in the hippocampal CA(1) and CA(3.) Ourfindings showed that zolpidem did not improve learning and memory in status epilepticus rats. Additionally, its sedative/hypnotic effects were not apparent in the status epilepticus condition. However, immunohistochemical results revealed that zolpidem significantly restored altered NKCC1 levels in the CA1 and CA3 to levels similar to those seen in normal rats. These findings suggest that zolpidem may contribute to molecular restoration, particularly through its impact on NKCC1 protein expression in the hippocampus, which is crucial for proper inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain.

AB  - Yellow camellias, also known as golden camellias, are prized for their ornamental, medicinal, and edible values. Because common camellia flowers are either red, purple, pink, or white, golden flowers are rare and are in high market demand. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that paclobutrazol, a synthetic triazole-type cytochrome P450 growth inhibitor that inhibits gibberellins (GA) biosynthesis, is effective in inducing floral buds in juvenile yellow camellias. In this study, we conducted transcriptomics and endogenous phytohormone analyses with undifferentiated buds, vegetative buds, and floral buds (induced with paclobutrazol), with the aim of understanding how paclobutrazol induces vegetative to reproductive phase transition. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) generated a total of 313,689,058 transcripts, revealing many floral genes for the first time in yellow camellia and providing a valuable genomic resource for future studies. Comparisons among different timepoints and between floral and vegetative buds generated a total of 10,944 DE transcript isoforms and 12,524 DE genes, with the majority of them being identified in the comparison between floral buds and undifferentiated buds. In floral buds, the GA and cytokinin levels significantly decreased, while the ABA level increased. The expression of genes controlling vegetative to reproductive phase transition, such as AG, SPL1, CAL, and AP1, was significantly enhanced. This might have led to the formation of floral buds in the paclobutrazol-treated juvenile yellow camellia.
   Paclobutrazol treatment effectively induces vegetative to reproductive phase transition by decreasing GA and cytokinin levels and inducing the expression of floral genes.

AB  - Main conclusionCsNAC086 was found to promote the expression of CsFLS, thus promoting the accumulation of flavonols in Camellia sinensis. AbstractFlavonols, the main flavonoids in tea plants, play an important role in the taste and quality of tea. In this study, a NAC TF gene CsNAC086 was isolated from tea plants and confirmed its regulatory role in the expression of flavonol synthase which is a key gene involved in the biosynthesis of flavonols in tea plant. Yeast transcription-activity assays showed that CsNAC086 has self-activation activity. The transcriptional activator domain of CsNAC086 is located in the non-conserved C-terminal region (positions 171-550), while the conserved NAC domain (positions 1-170) does not have self-activation activity. Silencing the CsNAC086 gene using antisense oligonucleotides significantly decreased the expression of CsFLS. As a result, the concentration of flavonols decreased significantly. In overexpressing CsNAC086 tobacco leaves, the expression of NtFLS was significantly increased. Compared with wild-type tobacco, the flavonols concentration increased. Yeast one-hybrid assays showed CsNAC086 did not directly regulate the gene expression of CsFLS. These findings indicate that CsNAC086 plays a role in regulating flavonols biosynthesis in tea plants, which has important implications for selecting and breeding of high-flavonols-concentration containing tea-plant cultivars.

AB  - Camellia chekiangoleosa has a higher oleic acid content and a shorter reproductive cycle than typical oil tea plants. It was intensively sampled over six C. chekiangoleosa seed development stages. The content of fatty acids determined by GC showed that the accumulation of fatty acids gradually increased from the S1 to S5 stages, and the maximum concentration was reached in S5. Then, fatty acids declined slightly in S6. The main fatty acid component showed the same accumulation trend as the total fatty acids, except linolenic acid, which remained at a low level throughout seed developmental stages. Changes in the expression of fatty acid accumulation-related genes were monitored using second-generation and SMRT full-length transcriptome sequencing. Finally, 18.92 G accurate and reliable data were obtained. Differential expression analysis and weighted coexpression analysis revealed two "gene modules" significantly associated with oleic acid and linoleic acid contents, and the high expression of ENR, KAS I, and KAS II, which accumulate substrates for oleic acid synthesis, was thought to be responsible for the rapid accumulation of fatty acids in the early stage. The rapid increase in fatty acids in the second stage may be closely related to the synergy between the high expression of SAD and low expression of FAD2. In addition, many transcription factors, such as ERF, GRAS, GRF, MADS, MYB and WRKY, may be involved in the fatty acid synthesis. Our data provide a rich resource for further studies on the regulation of fatty acid synthesis in C. chekiangoleosa.

AB  - The phenylpropanoid pathway is important for the synthesis of numerous compounds involved in plant growth and stress resilience, including lignin and flavonoids. The last common step in the core phenylpropanoid pathway is the enzyme 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL). Maize (Zea mays) has five 4CL genes, four of which (Zm4CL1-4) are type I (lignin-associated 4CLs), while one (Zm4CL5) is a type II (non-lignin-associated 4CL). In maize, it is not known which, if any, 4CL genes are involved in plant defense. Here we show that infection with the fungal pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus alters the expression of the type I genes, while herbivory by Spodoptera frugiperda induces the type II gene Zm4CL5. A knock-down mutant of Zm4CL5 displayed altered accumulation of flavonoids and other non-lignin phenylpropanoids, as well as increased plant height, revealing a role for Zm4CL5 both in plant growth and in non-lignin phenylpropanoid production. These data indicate that 4CL genes in maize play differential roles in growth and in the defense against different biotic stressors.

AB  - Heat shock protein 20 (HSP20) serves as a chaperone and plays roles in numerous biological processes, but the codon usage bias (CUB) of its genes has remained unexplored. This study identified 140 HSP20 genes from four cruciferous species, Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica napus, Brassica rapa, and Camelina sativa, that were identified from the Ensembl plants database, and we subsequently investigated their CUB. As a result, the base composition analysis revealed that the overall GC content of HSP20 genes was below 50%. The overall GC content significantly correlated with the constituents at three codon positions, implying that both mutation pressure and natural selection might contribute to the CUB. The relatively high ENc values suggested that the CUB of the HSP20 genes in four cruciferous species was relatively weak. Subsequently, ENc exhibited a negative correlation with gene expression levels. Analyses, including ENc-plot analysis, neutral analysis, and PR2 bias, revealed that natural selection mainly shaped the CUB patterns of HSP20 genes in these species. In addition, a total of 12 optimal codons (Delta RSCU > 0.08 and RSCU > 1) were identified across the four species. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis based on coding sequences (CDS) showed that the 140 HSP20 genes were strictly and distinctly clustered into 12 subfamilies. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis based on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values supported the fact that the CUB pattern was consistent with the genetic relationship at the gene level and (or) species levels. These results will not only enrich the HSP20 gene resource but also advance our understanding of the CUB of HSP20 genes, which may underlie the theoretical basis for exploration of their genetic and evolutionary pattern.

AB  - Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), a horticulturally multipurpose species in the family Elaeagnaceae, can build associations with Frankia actinomycetes to enable symbiotic nitrogen-fixing. Currently, no high-quality reference genome is available for an actinorhizal plant, which greatly hinders the study of actinorhizal symbiotic nodulation. Here, by combining short-read, long-read and Hi-C sequencing technologies, we generated a chromosome-level reference genome of H. rhamnoides (scaffold N50: 65 Mb, and genome size: 730 Mb) and predicted 30 812 protein-coding genes mainly on 12 pseudochromosomes. Hippophae rhamnoides was found to share a high proportion of symbiotic nodulation genes with Medicago truncatula, implying a shared molecular mechanism between actinorhizal and rhizobial symbioses. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the three paralogous NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) genes of H. rhamnoides with those of other nodulating species, forming the NIN group that most likely evolved from the ancestral NLP group.

AB  - Due to the absence of effective control measures, tea leaf spot, caused by Lasiodiplodia theobromae, can seriously reduce the production and quality of tea leaves. Analysis of the relationship between messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) of tea could help to prevent and control the disease. In this current study, high-performance sequencing of mRNA and lncRNA from tea leaves during infection by L. theobromae was conducted using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. Of the differentially expressed mRNAs, 2,503 or 5,278 were significantly up- or down regulated, respectively, in challenged leaves relative to unchallenged leaves. Differentially expressed lncRNAs were also analyzed at the level of genes for the above two treatments. The numbers of significantly up- or downregulated lncRNAs were 3,403 or 1,477, respectively. Functional analysis of mRNA revealed that L. theobromae challenge can induce the upregulation of the genes of seven transmembrane MLO family protein -3, -6, -11, major allergen Pru ar 1, and so on. In total, 176 differentially expressed lncRNAs occurred in response to L. theobromae challenge as a result of cis regulation, with 146 differentially expressed mRNAs. At the biological process of defense response, the glycosyl hydrolase 9A1 gene was cis regulated by the differentially expressed lncRNA. The expression profiling and association studies of the tea host infected by L. theobromae will provide a resource for future research into host-pathogen interactions and disease resistance.

AB  - Simple Summary Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting the motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Mutations in the gene Matr3 have been linked to ALS, including the autosomal dominant missense mutation S85C. We previously created a mouse model containing the S85C mutation in the Matr3 gene to understand how it causes ALS. The S85C mice exhibited MATR3 staining loss in selective populations of degenerating neurons, such as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and alpha-motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord. However, studies have shown that neurons other than motor neurons may be involved in contributing to ALS; therefore, we investigated additional neuronal cell types in the spinal cord and brain. Here, we found that MATR3 staining is selectively reduced in interneurons and alpha-motor neurons of the cervical and thoracic regions of the spinal cord, as well as in subsets of upper motor neurons and hippocampal neurons. These neurons did not exhibit cell body loss; however, how the MATR3 loss affects neuronal function remains to be determined. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the MATR3 S85C mutation affects other neuronal types of the brain and spinal cord in addition to motor neurons, suggesting that these additional neuronal types are involved in ALS pathogenesis. The neuropathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is motor neuron degeneration in the spinal cord and cortex. Accumulating studies report that other neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) are also affected in ALS. Mutations in Matr3, which encodes a nuclear matrix protein involved in RNA splicing, have been linked to ALS. Previously, we generated a MATR3 S85C knock-in (KI) mouse model that recapitulates early-stage features of ALS. We reported that MATR3 S85C KI mice exhibit defects in lumbar spinal cord motor neurons and in cerebellar Purkinje cells, which are associated with reduced MATR3 immunoreactivity. Here, we show that neurons in various other regions of the CNS are affected in MATR3 S85C KI mice. Using histological analyses, we found selective loss of MATR3 staining in alpha-motor neurons, but not gamma-motor neurons in the cervical and thoracic spinal cord. Loss of MATR3 was also found in parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord. In addition, we found the loss of MATR3 in subsets of upper motor neurons and hippocampal CA1 neurons. Collectively, our findings suggest that these additional neuronal types may contribute to the disease process in MATR3 S85C KI mice.

AB  - Aging is associated with cognitive decline and accumulation of senescent cells in various tissues and organs. Senolytic agents such as dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q) in combination have been shown to target senescent cells and ameliorate symptoms of aging-related disorders in mouse models. However, the mechanisms by which senolytics improve cognitive impairments have not been fully elucidated particularly in species other than mice. To study the effect of senolytics on aging-related multifactorial cognitive dysfunctions we tested the spatial memory of male Wistar rats in an active allothetic place avoidance task. Here we report that 8 weeks treatment with D+Q alleviated learning deficits and memory impairment observed in aged animals. Furthermore, treatment with D+Q resulted in a reduction of the peripheral inflammation measured by the levels of serum inflammatory mediators (including members of senescent cell secretome) in aged rats. Significant improvements in cognitive abilities observed in aged rats upon treatment with D+Q were associated with changes in the dendritic spine morphology of the apical dendritic tree from the hippocampal CA1 neurons and changes in the level of histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 9 and 27 in the hippocampus. The beneficial effects of D+Q on learning and memory in aged rats were long-lasting and persisted at least 5 weeks after the cessation of the drugs administration. Our results expand and provide new insights to the existing knowledge associated with effects of senolytics on alleviating age-related associated cognitive dysfunctions.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effects of repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) on the glutamate receptors and immediate early genes (IEGs) in the SH-SY5Y cells.
   Methods: The genes regulated by REST were screened by bioinformatics between AD patients and the control group. Then, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 10 mu M A beta or REST siRNA/cDNA, and the expressions of synaptic genes and IEGs were detected. Moreover, the protein expression of synaptophysin and PSD-95 was detected by Western blotting in the primary mouse hippocampal neurons.
   Results: Firstly, 464 differentially expressed genes regulated by REST were identified between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and controls, and REST was closely related to the glutamatergic synapses and long-term potentiation. GRIA1, GRIN2A, GRIN1, and ARC showed significant variations with the changes of REST. Moreover, the loss of REST reduced the expression of synaptophysin and PSD-95, which was related to synaptic plasticity.
   Conclusion: REST maintains synaptic plasticity by affecting both glutamate receptors and IEGs, and the imbalance between neural excitation and inhibition mediated by REST compromises neural function, contributing to cognitive impairment.

AB  - People should use antibiotics (AB) prudently to mitigate antibiotic resistance (ABR). Previous studies-and, subsequently, interventions-on ABR have focused mainly on improving public awareness and knowledge. We investigated a comprehensive theory-based explanatory model to understand the public's decision making regarding prudent AB use, based on, among others, the theory of planned behavior. In a cross-sectional online survey, the psychological determinants of people's decisions about prudent AB use were examined in a sample of 1,228 Swiss adults. The questionnaire assessed respondents' demand for AB, willingness to adopt measures that prevent the need for AB, perceived risks of ABR, perceived benefits of AB, attitudes and social influences regarding AB, knowledge of AB and ABR, and cultural values. Mokken scale analysis revealed three types of knowledge: knowledge of the functioning of AB, of ABR, and of preventive measures. Structural equation modeling indicated that respondents' demand for AB was mostly predicted by social influences, perceived benefits of AB, and knowledge of AB functioning. Willingness to prevent AB use was mainly related to conservative values, perceived risks of ABR, negative attitudes toward AB, and knowledge of preventive measures. Our study suggests that the provision of information about AB and preventive measures is a first step toward changing people's decisions related to prudent AB use. Future interventions that additionally utilize cultural values to convey important messages and target additional factors, such as social influences, the risks of ABR, and the benefits of cautious AB use, can be more successful in promoting prudent AB use.

AB  - The problem of estimating predation rates from molecular gut content data has been challenging. Previous work showed how per capita predation rates could be estimated from quantitative molecular gut content data using the average prey quantity in the predator, the decay rate of the prey in the predator and a conversion constant to convert measured prey quantity into prey numbers or biomass. Based on this previous work, we developed and illustrated a method to estimate relative per capita predation rates for a single prey species consumed by one predator species. This method does not require estimation of either the decay rate of the prey in the predator or the conversion constant. We describe how gut content data from qPCR, quantitative ELISA, metabarcoding and unassembled shotgun reads (Lazaro) can be used to estimate relative per capita predation rates. The method was used to estimate the relative per capita predation rate in a laboratory feeding trial to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the method using Lazaro data. Ten independent estimates were statistically similar, but precision was related to the number of observed prey reads. We estimated the relative per capita predation rate by the ant Pheidole flavens on another ant Pheidole tristis in a field experiment and by the ladybeetle Hippodamia convergens on the aphid Lipaphis pseudobrassicae on organic production farms. We found that higher P. flavens activitydensity was associated with lower relative per capita predation rates, therefore indicating lower predation rates on P. tristis. The absence of variation among farms in relative per capita predation by H. convergens suggested that the farms were biological replicates. Using relative per capita predation rates can provide a rapid way to assess how a predator-prey interaction changes over space and time and may help identify factors that limit or enhance biological control of pests.

AB  - Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) stands as the pioneering histone demethylase uncovered, proficient in demethylating H3K4me1/2 and H3K9me1/2, thereby governing transcription and participating in cell apoptosis, proliferation, or differentiation. Nevertheless, the complete understanding of LSD1 during porcine early embryonic development and the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Thus, we investigated the mechanism by which LSD1 plays a regulatory role in porcine early embryos. This study revealed that LSD1 inhibition resulted in parthenogenetic activation (PA) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) embryo arrested the development, and decreased blastocyst quality. Meanwhile, H3K4me1/2 and H3K9me1/2 methylase activity was increased at the 4-cell embryo stage. RNA-seq results revealed that autophagy related biological processes were highly enriched through GO and KEGG pathway analyses when LSD1 inhibition. Further studies showed that LSD1 depletion in porcine early embryos resulted in low mTOR and p-mTOR levels and high autophagy and apoptosis levels. The LSD1 deletion-induced increases in autophagy and apoptosis could be reversed by addition of mTOR activators. We further demonstrated that LSD1 inhibition induced mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy. In summary, our research results indicate that LSD1 may regulate autophagy and apoptosis through the mTOR pathway and affect early embryonic development of pigs.

AB  - Mycosis, especially superficial fungal infections (SFIs), has been a serious threat to humans in recent years. Evodiamine (EVO), as an effective component of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Evodia rutaecarpa, has good antibacterial effects and low toxicity. In order to find out the potential therapeutic agents against SFIs, a series of EVO derivatives were synthesized and systematic evaluations of antifungal activity were carried out. Among them, compound A7 exhibited great antifungal activity with the values of MIC100 were 38, 38 and 2 mu g/mL, respectively, against T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes and C. albicans, and even stronger than that of ketoconazole (KCZ) with the values of MIC100 were 106, 106 and 3 mu g/mL, respectively. Further antifungal evaluations in vitro verified that compound A7 indeed had favorable antifungal activity. Moreover, compound A7 could exert excellent antifungal effect on T. rubrum-infected guinea pigs, suggesting that A7 was an attractive molecule and could be a potential lead compound for the development of anti-fungal agents, and providing a great promising therapeutic strategy for fungal disease.

AB  - Camellia azalea is an endemic species within the genus Camellia that exhibits the trait of summer flowering, which is of significant ornamental and research value. Nevertheless, research on the regulatory mechanisms of flower formation in C. azalea is still limited, so in this study, transcriptome sequencing and analysis of endogenous hormone contents were conducted at three distinct growth stages: floral induction, floral organ maturation, and anthesis. Illumina sequencing yielded a total of 20,643 high-quality unigenes. Comparative analyses of representative samples from the three growth stages identified 6681, 1925, and 8400 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. These DEGs were further analyzed for functional enrichment using the GO and KEGG databases. Additionally, core genes from each flowering pathway underwent expression pattern analysis and network diagram construction. This revealed that the flower development process in C. azalea is linked to the specific expression of the genes involved in the photoperiod, temperature, and autonomous pathways and is subject to comprehensive regulation by multiple pathways. Further analysis of the dynamic trends of five endogenous hormone contents and plant hormone signal transduction genes revealed significant differences in the requirements of endogenous hormones, such as gibberellins and indoleacetic acid, by C. azalea at distinct growth stages. Additionally, the majority of genes on the phytohormone signal transduction pathway demonstrated a high correlation with the changes in the contents of each hormone. The present study integrates physiological and molecular approaches to identify key genes and metabolic pathways that regulate the summer flowering of C. azalea, thereby laying a theoretical foundation for further investigations into its flowering mechanism and related functional genes.

AB  - Hippophae salicifolia, a dioecious shrub endemic to the Himalayan region, holds substantial ecological and economic value. The lack of pre-flowering morphological traits for sex identification has long impeded efficient germplasm management and breeding efforts. In this study, we utilized third-generation sequencing technology to conduct whole-genome comparative analysis of known-sex individuals, identifying insertion/deletion loci significantly associated with sex. Based on these loci, we designed a specific primer pair, Hsa09. PCR amplification results demonstrated 100% accuracy in sex differentiation, with female individuals showing a single band and male individuals exhibiting a double-band pattern. Cross-species validation revealed limited applicability of Hsa09 in closely related Hippophae species, suggesting notable divergence in sex determination mechanisms within the genus. This study establishes the first molecular tool for early sex identification in H. salicifolia, overcoming the dependence on reproductive organ development in traditional methods. It provides essential technical support for understanding the evolutionary pathways of sex chromosomes and advancing sex-regulated breeding strategies within the Hippophae genus.

AB  - Camellia drupifera, a significant woody oil crop in southern China, produces oil from its fruit seeds. Understanding sugar metabolism enzyme regulation is crucial for sugar accumulation and oil synthesis in fruit organs. This study examines the dynamic changes in sugar metabolism across four developmental stages of C. drupifera fruits, from rapid fruit enlargement to oil conversion. We analyzed sugar content, enzyme activity, and transcriptomic data to identify key periods and mechanisms involved in sugar metabolism. Our findings indicate that photosynthetic products are rapidly transported from leaves to fruit organs after synthesis, with transport efficiency decreasing significantly after 48 hours. September was identified as a critical period for oil conversion, during which the highest sucrose levels and SuSy-II enzyme activity were detected in the kernels. A positive correlation was found between high expression of ten genes related to sugar metabolism enzymes and sugar transport proteins and sucrose content. Notably, the expression levels of c158337.graph_c0 (SPS), c166323.graph_c0 (SuSy), c159295.graph_c0 (SUC2-like), and c156402.graph_c0 (SUC2-like) significantly increased during the oil conversion phase.These findings provide a crucial theoretical foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of sugar metabolism in C. drupifera fruits, offering insights that could enhance its economic yield.

AB  - Oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are important factors determining cardiovascular risk. This study investigated the antioxidant mechanisms and potential protective effect of a hydroethanolic extract of yerba mate (Ilex paraguaiensis; EHEM) on the in vitro oxidation of LDL and HDL. EHEM was found to possess ferric reducing power, DPPH free radical scavenging capacity, metal chelating activity, and NO radical scavenging activity. In addition, EHEM reduced the lipoperoxidation induced by alpha,alpha '-Azodiisobutyramidine dihydrochloride (AAPH) in HDL and LDL at all tested concentrations. In this study, we demonstrate the antioxidant properties of yerba mate and its phytochemical compounds. These properties may effectively prevent the in vitro oxidation of LDL and HDL molecules, a phenomenon linked to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

AB  - Plant tannases (TAs) or tannin acyl hydrolases, a class of recently reported carboxylesterases in tannin-rich plants, are involved in the degalloylation of two important groups of secondary metabolites: flavan-3-ol gallates and hydrolyzable tannins. In this paper, we have made new progress in studying the function of tea (Camellia sinensis) (Cs) TA-it is a hydrolase with promiscuous acyltransferase activity in vitro and in vivo and promotes the synthesis of simple galloyl glucoses and flavan-3-ol gallates in plants. We studied the functions of CsTA through enzyme analysis, protein mass spectrometry, and metabolic analysis of genetically modified plants. Firstly, CsTA was found to be not only a hydrolase but also an acyltransferase. In the two-step catalytic reaction where CsTA hydrolyzes the galloylated compounds epigallocatechin-3-gallate or 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-d-glucose into their degalloylated forms, a long-lived covalently bound Ser159-linked galloyl-enzyme intermediate is also formed. Under nucleophilic attack, the galloyl group on the intermediate is transferred to the nucleophilic acyl acceptor (such as water, methanol, flavan-3-ols, and simple galloyl glucoses). Then, metabolic analysis suggested that transient overexpression of TAs in young strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) fruits, young leaves of tea plants, and young leaves of Chinese bayberry (Myrica rubra) actually increased the total contents of simple galloyl glucoses and flavan-3-ol gallates. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the promiscuous acyltransferase activity of plant TA.

AB  - Laticifers are secretory structures that produce latex, forming a specialized defense system against herbivory. Studies using anatomical approaches to investigate laticifer growth patterns have described their origin; however, their mode of growth, i.e., whether growth is intrusive or diffuse, remains unclear. Studies investigating how cytoskeleton filaments may influence laticifer shape establishment and growth patterns are lacking. In this study, we combined microtubule immunostaining and developmental anatomy to investigate the growth patterns in different types of laticifers. Standard anatomical methods were used to study laticifer development. Microtubules were labelled through immunolocalization of alpha-tubulin in three types of laticifers from three different plant species: nonanastomosing (Urvillea ulmacea), anastomosing unbranched with partial degradation of terminal cell walls (Ipomoea nil), and anastomosing branched laticifers with early and complete degradation of terminal cell walls (Asclepias curassavica). In both nonanastomosing and anastomosing laticifers, as well as in differentiating meristematic cells, parenchyma cells and idioblasts, microtubules were perpendicularly aligned to the cell growth axis. The analyses of laticifer microtubule orientation revealed an arrangement that corresponds to those cells that grow diffusely within the plant body. Nonanastomosing and anastomosing laticifers, branched or not, have a pattern which indicates diffuse growth. This innovative study on secretory structures represents a major advance in the knowledge of laticifers and their growth mode.

AB  - Flowers emit a bouquet of volatiles to attract pollinators or to protect flowers from pathogen and herbivore attacks. Most floral volatiles are synthesized in the cytoplasm of petals and released into the headspace at a specific time of day. Various floral scent sampling methods coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry have been used to measure the quality and quantity of floral volatiles. However, little is known about the emission patterns of floral scents. In most cases, it is still unclear whether floral scents emit continuously or discontinuously. Here we measured the frequency with which lily flowers emit scents using optical interferometry. By analyzing the refractive index difference between volatile organic compounds and ambient air, we were able to visualize the accumulation of the volatile vapors. The frequency of volatile emission was calculated from the unique footprint of temporal power spectrum maps. Based on these real-time measurements, we found that lily flowers emit the volatile compounds discontinuously, with pulses observed around every 10-50 min.

AB  - Background and Aims: Utricularia (Lentibulariaceae) includes ca. 240 carnivorous species of cosmopolitan distribution. The Guayana Shield has 48 species, about 20% of the world total. Of the 35 groups into which the genus is divided, Utricularia sect. Orchidioides is one of the best known and studied, as it usually has large and striking flowers. In this paper, the identity of one of the species in this section, present in the Guayana Shield, is clarified.
   Methods: The taxonomic literature, herbarium material, and photographs of cultivated plants from the study area (Bolivar and Amazonas states of Venezuela, in the central portion of the Guayana Shield) available on the internet, were reviewed. Additionally, and for comparative purposes, material from the most closely related species (Utricularia asplundii, U. jamesoniana and U. uxoris) was also reviewed.
   Key results: Utricularia elephanthoides sp. nov., which is characterized by the photosynthetic organs with an acute apex, upper lip of the corolla shallowly tetralobulate, applied to the lower lip, and spur =1.5 times the length of the lower lip of the corolla, is described and illustrated. This new species, together with Utricularia asplundii, U. jamesoniana and U. uxoris, forms a natural group with relatively small flowers and deeply trilobulate lower corolla lobe, which is named here "U. jamesoniana complex". A table of morphological characters, a key and two maps are presented, by means of which these four species can be compared and differentiated.
   Conclusions: The Guayanan populations of Utricularia sect. Orchidioides with a deeply trilobulate lower corolla lip and a spur with basal (conical) and apical (subulate) portions of similar length should be assigned to the new concept (U. elephanthoides), so far only known from Venezuela. This species is part of the "Utricularia jamesoniana" complex, which is monophyletic and widely distributed in the Neotropics.

AB  - TAU is a microtubule-associated protein that promotes microtubule assembly and stability in the axon. TAU is missorted and aggregated in an array of diseases known as tauopathies. Microtubules are essential for neuronal function and regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications, changes of which affect microtubule stability and dynamics, microtubule interaction with other proteins and cellular structures, and mediate recruitment of microtubule-severing enzymes. As impairment of microtubule dynamics causes neuronal dysfunction, we hypothesize cognitive impairment in human disease to be impacted by impairment of microtubule dynamics. We therefore aimed to study the effects of a disease-causing mutation of TAU (P301L) on the levels and localization of microtubule post-translational modifications indicative of microtubule stability and dynamics, to assess whether P301L-TAU causes stability-changing modifications to microtubules. To investigate TAU localization, phosphorylation, and effects on tubulin post-translational modifications, we expressed wild-type or P301L-TAU in human MAPT-KO induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (iNeurons) and studied TAU in neurons in the hippocampus of mice transgenic for human P301L-TAU (pR5 mice). Human neurons expressing the longest TAU isoform (2N4R) with the P301L mutation showed increased TAU phosphorylation at the AT8, but not the p-Ser-262 epitope, and increased polyglutamylation and acetylation of microtubules compared with endogenous TAU-expressing neurons. P301L-TAU showed pronounced somatodendritic presence, but also successful axonal enrichment and a similar axodendritic distribution comparable to exogenously expressed 2N4R-wildtype-TAU. P301L-TAU-expressing hippocampal neurons in transgenic mice showed prominent missorting and tauopathy-typical AT8-phosphorylation of TAU and increased polyglutamylation, but reduced acetylation, of microtubules compared with non-transgenic littermates. In sum, P301L-TAU results in changes in microtubule PTMs, suggestive of impairment of microtubule stability. This is accompanied by missorting and aggregation of TAU in mice but not in iNeurons. Microtubule PTMs/impairment may be of key importance in tauopathies.

AB  - As a first step in innate immunity, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize the distinct pathogen and herbivore-associated molecular patterns and mediate activation of immune responses, but specific steps in the evolution of new PRR sensing functions are not well understood. We employed comparative genomic and functional analyses to define evolutionary events leading to the sensing of the herbivore-associated peptide inceptin (Inil) by the PRR inceptin receptor (INR) in legume plant species. Existing and de novo genome assemblies revealed that the presence of a functional INR gene corresponded with ability to respond to In11 across similar to 53 million years (my) of evolution. In11 recognition is unique to the Glade of Phaseoloid legumes, and only a single Glade of INR homologs from Phaseoloids was functional in a heterologous model. The syntenic loci of several non-Phaseoloid outgroup species nonetheless contain non-functional INR-like homologs, suggesting that an ancestral gene insertion event and diversification preceded the evolution of a specific INR receptor function similar to 28 my ago. Chimeric and ancestrally reconstructed receptors indicated that 16 amino acid differences in the C1 leucine-rich repeat domain and C2 intervening motif mediate gain of !nil recognition. Thus, high PRR diversity was likely followed by a small number of mutations to expand innate immune recognition to a novel peptide elicitor. Analysis of INR evolution provides a model for functional diversification of other germline-encoded PRRs.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a type of mycotoxin that threatens human and livestock health. Right open reading frame kinase 2 (RIOK2) is a kinase that has a pivotal function in ribosome maturation and cell cycle progression. This study aims to clarify the role of the RIOK2 gene in DON-induced cytotoxicity regulation in porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). Cell viability assay and flow cytometry showed that the knockdown of RIOK2 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and oxidative stress in DON-induced IPEC-J2. Then, transcriptome profiling identified candidate genes and pathways that closely interacted with both DON cytotoxicity regulation and RIOK2 expression. Furthermore, RIOK2 interference promoted the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway by increasing the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK. Additionally, we performed the dual-luciferase reporter and ChIP assays to elucidate that the expression of RIOK2 was influenced by the binding of transcription factor Sp1 with the promoter region. Briefly, the reduced expression of the RIOK2 gene exacerbates the cytotoxic effects induced by DON in IPEC-J2. Our findings provide insights into the control strategies for DON contamination by identifying functional genes and effective molecular markers.

AB  - Plasmalogens (Pls), a kind of glycerophospholipids, have shown potent biological effects but their role in hippocampus-dependent memory remained mostly elusive. Here, we first report Pls can enhance endogenous expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in the hippocampus and promotes neurogenesis associated with improvement of learning and memory in mice. Genomic and proteomic studies revealed that Pls enhanced recruitment of CREB transcription factor onto the murine Bdnf promoter region via upregulating ERK-Akt signaling pathways in neuronal cells. Reduction of endogenous Pls in murine hippocampus significantly reduced learning and memory associated with the reduction of memory-related protein expression, suggesting that Pls can regulate memory-related gene expression in the hippocampus.

AB  - Heterogeneity of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) is gradually recognized in polyp tissue of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). However, the contributions of MDM subsets for sustaining inflammation remain unclear. This study therefore aimed to characterize MDM subsets in polyp tissues and estimate their functions. We identified MDM subsets in polyp tissues by flow cytometry, and analyzed the correlation between the expression of these subsets and disease severity. We also explored the similarities and differences between tissue MDMs and classical ex vivo polarized MDMs. By using appropriate substitutes for tissue MDMs, we investigated the function of MDMs. MDM1 (lin-CD44+CD64+) and MDM3 (lin-CD44+CCR2+CD64-) were identified in polyp tissues by flow cytometry. Recurrent CRSwNP patients exhibited higher levels of MDM3 compared to non-recurrent patients. This increase in MDM3 was positively correlated with the Lund-Mackay score, the number of infiltrated tissue eosinophils, and IL-5 expression levels. Ex vivo polarized alternatively activated (M2a) macrophage preferentially expressed MDM3 marker genes, which can be used as the substitute for MDM3 within the polyp tissues. M2a macrophages engulfed more Staphylococcus aureus than classically activated (M1) macrophages. However, interferon lambda 1 (IFN-lambda 1) did not alter the bacterial killing efficiency of M2a macrophages, nor did it affect the activation of reactive oxidase substrate (ROS) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) pathway and viability. The increase in MDM3 within polyp tissues, similar to classical M2a macrophages, acted as bacterial reservoirs and contributed to persistent inflammation, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms of CRSwNP.

AB  - The family Rhinocerotidae, also referred to as 'true rhinoceroses', is one of the multiple perissodactyl lineages that have independently evolved large body sizes, lophodonty (fully developed crests between dental cusps), a simplified anterior dentition, and the molarization of the premolars. During the last decades, descriptions of novel fossil collections, the update of previously published ones, and taxonomic reviews through cladistic analyses have brought to bear a new, comprehensive perspective on the group, significantly increasing its recorded deep-time diversity. This paper reviews the historical development of the study of Rhinocerotidae in the Iberian Peninsula, provides an up-to-date compendium of the regional rhinoceros fossil record by gathering the available references, and presents an updated taxonomic framework. As a result, 27 out of the more than 200 rhinoceros species described in the literature worldwide inhabited the Iberian Peninsula, regionally ranging from the Oligocene to the Late Pleistocene. Their systematics, stratigraphic, and geographical ranges are detailed in the present article and the occurrences and geographical ranges illustrated.

AB  - The heart of date palm (HDP) is a nutrient-dense vegetable, rich in protein and carbohydrate, obtained from the core of palm trees. Carbohydrates are the major component of the heart of date palm, providing a quick source of energy and fiber content can help digestion and contribute to feeling of fullness, making it good addition to a balanced diet. The study investigated the potential of incorporating HDP into low-fat bio fermented camel milk (BCM). The initial findings highlighted HDP's medicinal properties and its significant cytotoxic effects against HepG2 cells, indicating its potential as an anticancer agent. Over 21 days of cold storage, the addition of HDP improved the water-holding capacity, color, sensory qualities, bioactive compounds, and rheological properties of low-fat BCM. Moreover, no mold, yeasts, or coliforms were detected in any samples throughout the storage. The total number of viable probiotic cells remained functional (>10(6) log CFU/g) for 21 days. The sensory evaluation results suggested that high-quality low-fat BCM can be achieved by adding up to 20 % HDP. The molecular docking study supports the various biological activities of HDP particularly in relation to its cytotoxic effects against HepG2 cancer cells. This study opens the door for further exploration into utilizing HDP as a novel functional ingredient in dairy foods to create value-added products.

AB  - Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder, with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) providing relief from hyper-excitability of neurons, but largely failing to restrain neurodegeneration. We investigated a progressive preclinical trial in rats, whereby the test drugs; sodium valproate (SVP; 150 and 300 mg/kg), baclofen (BFN; 5 and 10 mg/kg), and thymoquinone (THQ; 40 and 80 mg/kg) were administered (i.p, once/day for 15 days) alone, and as low dose combinations, and subsequently tested for antiseizure and neuroprotective potential using electrical stimulation of neurons by Maximal electroshock (MES). The seizure stages were monitored, and hippocampal levels of m-TOR, IL-1 beta, IL-6 were measured. Hippocampal histopathology was also performed. Invitro and Insilco studies were run to counter-confirm the results from rodent studies. We report the synergistic effect of trio-drug combination; SVP (150 mg/kg), BFN (5 mg/kg) and THQ (40 mg/kg) against generalized seizures. The Insilco results revealed that trio-drug combination binds the Akt active site as a supramolecular complex, which could have served as a delivery system that affects the penetration and the binding to the new target. The potential energy of the ternary complex in the Akt active site after dynamics simulation was found to be -370.426 Kcal/mol, while the supramolecular ternary complex alone was -38.732 Kcal/mol, with a potential energy difference of -331.694 Kcal/mol, which favors the supramolecular ternary complex at Akt active site binding. In addition, the said combination increased cell viability by 267% and reduced morphological changes induced by Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in HEK-293 cells, which indicates the neuroprotective property of said combination. To conclude, we are the first to report the anti-convulsant and neuroprotective potential of the trio-drug combination.

AB  - BackgroundEosinophilic inflammation is a feature of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Patients with eosinophilic CRSwNP (ENP) tend to be refractory and prone to recurrence. Although there is increasing evidence linking lipid metabolic irregularities to eosinophilia, the particular lipid responsible for promoting eosinophilic inflammation and the precise molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear.MethodsLipidomic atlas and metabolic pathway enrichment were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing, respectively. Eosinophil extracellular trap cell death (EETosis) was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Functional analyses were performed on purified eosinophils.ResultsThe unbiased lipidomic atlas identified a specific accumulation in long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) in ENP. Consistently, RNA-seq analysis confirmed the enrichment in long-chain unsaturated fatty acid metabolism pathway in ENP. In this lipid-rich airway inflammatory environment, EETosis including ETotic eosinophils, EETs release and Charcot-Leyden crystals (CLCs) generation was enhanced in ENP, and associated with disease severity. Further, we found that both saturated and unsaturated LCFAs, such as arachidonic acid, are critical fuel sources to trigger eosinophil activation and filamentous DNA release, whereas only arachidonic acid could induce crystalline Galectin10 (CLCs). Mechanistically, arachidonic acid induces EETosis through a mechanism independent of reactive oxygen species but the IRE1 alpha/XBP1s/PAD4 pathway. Both the long-acting dexamethasone and short-acting hydrocortisone, while facilitate eosinophil apoptosis, are ineffective to block arachidonic acid-induced EETosis.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate a previously unknown role of the LCFA arachidonic acid in mediating EETosis and glucocorticoid insensitivity to drive ENP progression, which may lead to novel insights regarding the treatment of patients with refractory eosinophilic inflammation.

AB  - Glaesserella parasuis (GPS), a causative agent of Glasser's disease, is thought to be the main fatal cause of peritonitis in swine, thus resulting in high mortality and morbidity and significant economic losses to the swine industry. However, the mechanisms of GPS infection-induced apoptosis and possible therapeutic pathway for GPS infection in peritonitis remain unclear. Baicalin has important biological functions during disease treatment, such as antiviral, bacterial inhibition, anti-apoptosis, and anti-inflammatory. However, whether baicalin has anti-apoptotic effects during the process of GPS infection in peritonitis is unclear. In the present study, the anti-apoptotic effect and mechanisms of baicalin in GPS infection-induced apoptosis were investigated in porcine peritoneal mesothelial cells (PPMC). The results showed that baicalin could inhibit the apoptosis rate occurrence of PPMC induced by GPS to various degrees and inhibit the expression of apoptosis-related genes and cleaved caspase-3. Meanwhile, baicalin significantly antagonized the expression of p-JNK, p-p38, and p-ERK induced by GPS in PPMC. These findings for the first time demonstrate that baicalin exerted the effect of antagonizing GPS induced apoptosis in PPMC by inhibiting the activation of the PKC-MAPK pathway and could be a therapeutic option in the management of GPS infection.

AB  - Isorhamnetin (ISO) is an active flavonoid compound mainly isolated from the fruits of Hippophae rhamnoides L. and the leaves of Ginkgo biloba L. Previous studies have revealed the antifibrotic action of ISO in the liver and lungs, although its potential protective effects against renal fibrosis and the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Given that many actions of ISO could be similarly attained by hydrogen sulfide (H2S), we speculated that ISO may work through the induction of endogenous H2S. To test the hypothesis, we established the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) renal fibrosis rat model and transforming growth factor-beta 1(TGF-beta 1)-induced fibrosis in cultured renal tubular cells. ISO treatment inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) formation, decreased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and relieved renal fibrosis. Further analysis revealed that ISO stimulated the expression of the H2S-synthesizing enzyme cystathionine lyase (CSE) and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), and promoted H2S production in vivo and in vitro. The elevated H2S attenuated oxidative stress and elevated the thiol level. It induced Keap1 sulfhydration, disrupted Keap1-Nrf2 interaction, and promoted the entry of Nrf2 into the nucleus. Finally, we found that circulating H2S mainly derived from the liver, and not the kidney. Collectively, our study revealed that ISO alleviated renal fibrosis by inducing endogenous H2S and regulating Keap1-Nrf2 interaction through sulfhydration of Keap1. Endogenous H2S could be an important mediator underlying the pharmacological actions of ISO. Due to the multifunctional properties of H2S, the H2S-inducing nature of ISO could be exploited to treat various diseases.

AB  - The co-evolution of social behavior and the immune system plays a critical role in individuals' adaptation to their environment. However, also need for further research on the key molecules that co-regulate social behavior and immunity. This study focused on neonatal mice that were separated from their mothers for 4 hours per day between the 6th and 16th day after birth. The results showed that these mice had lower plasma levels of IFN-gamma and oxytocin, but higher levels of plasma glucocorticoids (GC), then impacting their social abilities. Additionally, maternal separation led to decreased levels of BDNF, IGF2, and CREB mRNAs in the hippocampus, while levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) remained unaffected. Maternal separation also resulted in increased levels of oxytocin and CRH mRNA in the hypothalamus, as well as an increase in CD45+ lymphocyte subsets in the meninges and choroid plexus (CP), with CD8+ lymphocytes in meninges and CD4+ lymphocytes in CP showing an increase. In IFN-gamma-/- mice, a decrease in social preference was observed alongside lower plasma oxytocin levels. Moreover, IFN-gamma-/- mice exhibited reduced numbers of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN), decreased BDNF levels in the PFC and hippocampus, and alterations in CD45+ lymphocytes in CP and meninges, with an increase in CD8+ lymphocytes in meninges and CD4+ lymphocytes in CP. These findings highlight the immunological impact of social stress on IFN-gamma regulation, suggesting that the immunomodulatory molecule IFN-gamma may influence social behavior by affecting synaptic efficiency in brain regions such as the hippocampus and PFC, which are linked to oxytocin in the PVN.

AB  - Supermolecular hydrogel ionic skin (i-skin) linked with smartphones has attracted widespread attention in physiological activity detection due to its good stability in complex scenarios. However, the low ionic conductivity, inferior mechanical properties, poor contact adhesion, and insufficient freeze resistance of most used hydrogels limit their practical application in flexible electronics. Herein, a novel multifunctional poly(vinyl alcohol)-based conductive organohydrogel (PCEL5.0%) with a supermolecular structure was constructed by innovatively employing sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na) as reinforcement material, ethylene glycol as antifreeze, and lithium chloride as a water retaining agent. Thanks to the synergistic effect of these components, the PCEL5.0% organohydrogel shows excellent performance in terms of ionic conductivity (1.61 S m(-1)), mechanical properties (tensile strength of 70.38 kPa and elongation at break of 537.84%), interfacial adhesion (1.06 kPa to pig skin), frost resistance (-50.4 degrees C), water retention (67.1% at 22% relative humidity), and remoldability. The resultant PCEL5.0%-based i-skin delivers satisfactory sensitivity (GF = 1.38) with fast response (348 ms) and high precision under different deformations and low temperature (-25 degrees C). Significantly, the wireless sensor system based on the PCEL5.0% organohydrogel i-skin can transmit signals from physiological activities and sign language to a smartphone by Bluetooth technology and dynamically displays the status of these movements. The organohydrogel i-skin shows great potential in diverse fields of physiological activity detection, human-computer interaction, and rehabilitation medicine.

AB  - Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) is responsible for causing Porcine pleuropneumonia (PCP) in pigs. However, using vaccines and antibiotics to prevent and control this disease has become more difficult due to increased bacterial resistance and weak cross-immunity between different APP types. Naringin (NAR), a dihydroflavonoid found in citrus fruit peels, has been recognized as having significant therapeutic effects on inflammatory diseases of the respiratory system. In this study, we investigated the effects of NAR on the inflammatory response caused by APP through both in vivo and in vitro models. The results showed that NAR reduced the number of neutrophils (NEs) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and decreased lung injury and the expression of proteins related to the NLRP3 inflammasome after exposure to APP. In addition, NAR inhibited the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) P65 in porcine alveolar macrophage (PAMs), reduced protein expression of NLRP3 and Caspase-1, and reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by APP. Furthermore, NAR prevented the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex by reducing protein interaction between NLRP3, Caspase-1, and ASC. NAR also inhibited the potassium (K+) efflux induced by APP. Overall, these findings suggest that NAR can effectively reduce the lung inflammation caused by APP by inhibiting the over-activated NF-kappa B/NLRP3 signalling pathway, providing a basis for further exploration of NAR as a potential natural product for preventing and treating APP.

AB  - Cisplatin is a frequently used chemotherapeutic medicine for cancer treatment. Permanent hearing loss is one of the most serious side effects of cisplatin, but there are few FDA-approved medicines to prevent it. We applied high-through screening and target fishing and identified aldose reductase, a key enzyme of the polyol pathway, as a novel target for treating cisplatin ototoxicity. Cisplatin treatment significantly increased the expression level and enzyme activity of aldose reductase in the cochlear sensory epithelium. Genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of aldose reductase showed a significant protective effect on cochlear hair cells. Cisplatininduced overactivation of aldose reductase led to the decrease of NADPH/NADP+ and GSH/GSSG ratios, as well as the increase of oxidative stress, and contributed to hair cell death. Results of target prediction, molecular docking, and enzyme activity detection further identified that Tiliroside was an effective inhibitor of aldose reductase. Tiliroside was proven to inhibit the enzymatic activity of aldose reductase via competitively interfering with the substrate-binding region. Both Tiliroside and another clinically approved aldose reductase inhibitor, Epalrestat, inhibited cisplatin-induced oxidative stress and subsequent cell death and thus protected hearing function. These findings discovered the role of aldose reductase in the pathogenesis of cisplatin-induced deafness and identified aldose reductase as a new target for the prevention and treatment of hearing loss.

AB  - Captive African elephants used in the tourism industry face numerous welfare issues which are often stress related and linked to high numbers of tourists or human-elephant interactions. Elephant welfare is commonly assessed by quantifying faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations, and monitoring stereotypic behaviour, which are either costly or problematic in identifying underlying causes. Self-directed behaviours (SDBs), a form of displacement activity, have been substantially linked with stress and anxiety in primates, and could be a potential but not yet utilised behavioural marker in elephants. We thus explored the usage of several trunk, tail, and body related SDBs in a group of 7 semi-captive African elephants maintained at the Knysna Elephant Park, a tourist destination offering a variety of close contact experiences. Using continuous behavioural sampling (focal following), SDBs were recorded as they occurred, along with the numbers of nearby tourists (<5 m to focal; with 3 levels: None, Low 1-5, and High >5), and the nature of the tourist interaction (5 levels: None, Feed, Touch, Walk, and Ride). We then compared SDB rates with fGCM concentrations (n = 115) determined following observations (1 day and 2 days after behavioural sampling). Data were analysed using Generalized Linear Mixed effects Models. SDB rates (p/min) significantly increased during elephant Walks (p < 0.001) and Rides (p < 0.001), indicating a correlation with their usage during potentially stressful scenarios. The Touch interaction significantly decreased SDBs (p < 0.05), whilst the Feed interaction had a non-significant effect (p > 0.05), which could indicate the element of control in terms of perceived stress is an important component in welfare, as elephants were free to move away during these interactions. Interestingly, SDBs significantly decreased when tourist numbers were High (p = < 0.05), potentially due to greater quantities of high value food. Additionally, no correlation was found between SDBs and fGCM concentrations determined on day one (p > 0.05), and day two (p > 0.05). Hence, SDBs may be correlated more with anxiety or lower-level stress, which is not significant enough to activate GC production, and may therefore act as a coping strategy utilised to maintain physiological homeostasis during anxiety-inducing situations. Additional research would benefit from coupling SDB observations with different forms of physiological assessments to better understand the internal motivations, and formally establish SDBs as a reliable, cost-effective, and non-invasive welfare index to identify stressed in-dividuals in real time and ensure optimum husbandry.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, affecting behavior, speech, and motor abilities. The neuropathology of AD includes the formation of extracellular amyloid-beta plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of phosphorylated tau, along with neuronal loss. Although neuronal loss is an AD hallmark, cell-cell communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations maintains neuronal health and brain homeostasis. To study changes in cell-cell communication during disease progression, we performed snRNA-sequencing of the hippocampus from female 3xTg-AD and wild-type littermates at 6 and 12 months. We inferred differential cell-cell communication between 3xTg-AD and wild-type mice across time points and between senders (astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and OPCs) and receivers (excitatory and inhibitory neurons) of interest. We also assessed the downstream effects of altered glia-neuron communication using pseudobulk differential gene expression, functional enrichment, and gene regulatory analyses. We found that glia-neuron communication is increasingly dysregulated in 12-month 3xTg-AD mice. We also identified 23 AD-associated ligand-receptor pairs that are upregulated in the 12-month-old 3xTg-AD hippocampus. Our results suggest increased AD association of interactions originating from microglia. Signaling mediators were not significantly differentially expressed but showed altered gene regulation and transcription factor activity. Our findings indicate that altered glia-neuron communication is increasingly dysregulated and affects the gene regulatory mechanisms in neurons of 12-month-old 3xTg-AD mice.

AB  - Increasing piglet weaning age while maintaining the reproductive efficiency of the breeding herd depends on the ability to stimulate sows to ovulate during lactation without reducing subsequent pregnancy rates and litter sizes. The aim of this study was to determine if a reduction in piglet suckling load, either prior to or immediately after mating in lactation, altered ovarian follicle development and increased embryo survival to day 30 of gestation. Fifty-nine multiparous Large White x Landrace sows were allocated to one of three treatments; litter size maintained at 11 piglets (control); litter size reduced to seven piglets on day 18 of lactation (split wean (SW)); or litter size reduced to seven piglets at expression of lactation oestrus (oestrus split wean (OES SW)). The percentage of sows that expressed lactation oestrus did not differ between treatments (79.7 %; P > 0.05) and split weaning had minimal effects on ovarian follicle development. Pregnancy rates were higher for SW and OES SW sows, compared to control sows. Embryo survival to day 30 of gestation was higher for SW sows (73.7 %) compared with control (56.4 %) and OES SW sows (49.5 %; P < 0.05). In summary, weaning a portion of the litter prior to mating in lactation improved pregnancy rates and embryo survival.

AB  - To effectively mitigate heat stress among lactating sows, this study proposed a novel pen partition-attached jet air supply (PJAS) and compared its performance with commercial ceiling jet air supply (CJAS) by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Each PJAS unit, comprising a circular distribution duct with 5 slot orifices at each side, was installed at the pen partition between two adjacent pens to direct air towards lactating sows to enhance convective heat removal. The cooling performances of air supplier were primarily evaluated by assessing the convective heat flux from lying sows. The effect of jet angles induced by PJAS and CJAS on convective heat flux were investigated as well as the consequence of reducing the inlet dimension of CJAS. The results revealed that reducing the inlet dimension of CJAS doubled the speed of supplied air. However, it also limited the amount of air impinging on sow due to the narrowing of the inlet air jet. Consequently, the combined effect only marginally increased the convective heat flux when the inlet area of CJAS was reduced. By placing air supplier closer to lactating sows, the air jet induced by PJAS impinged on sows' bodies directly and therefore significantly increased the convective heat removal. Compared to CJAS, PJAS required approximately 45% less ventilation rate to induce the same convective heat flux. When the ventilation rate was identical, PJAS could increase the convective heat flux by up to 27.6%. These results highlight PJAS as a promising energy-efficient localized cooling device for mitigating heat stress among lactating sows. To determine the optimal design and control strategy of PJAS based on industrial requirements, further research is still needed.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a common mycotoxin that is widely found in various foods and feeds, posing a potential threat to human and animal health. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of the natural polyphenol piceatannol (PIC) against DON-induced damage in porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2 cells) and the underlying mechanism. The results showed that PIC promotes IPEC-J2 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, it not only significantly relieved DON-induced decreases in cell viability and proliferation but also reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Further studies demonstrated that PIC alleviated DON-induced oxidative stress damage by increasing the protein expression levels of the antioxidant factors NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM), and the mRNA expression of catalase (CAT), Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1), peroxiredoxin 3 (PRX3), and glutathione S-transferase alpha 4 (GST alpha 4). In addition, PIC inhibited the activation of the nuclear factor-B (NF-kappa B) pathway, downregulated the mRNA expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) to attenuate DON-induced inflammatory responses, and further mitigated DON-induced cellular intestinal barrier injury by regulating the protein expression of Occludin. These findings indicated that PIC had a significant protective effect against DON-induced damage. This study provides more understanding to support PIC as a feed additive for pig production.

AB  - Background: Gui Shao Tea (GST), a long-aged tea with a Chinese herbal aroma, can treat many stubborn and malignant diseases, according to traditional Chinese medicine. This research aimed to discover and define GST, study the anti-gastric cancer effects of GST extracts and preliminarily elucidate the mechanism of action in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and the gut microbiota. Methods: GST was analyzed by GC/MS and HPLC. Cell proliferation, the cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated by a CCK8 assay and flow cytometry. The effects of GST extracts on tumor inhibition and survival time were explored by a gastric cancer xenograft model in nude mice. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was assessed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Gut microbiota detection and fecal microbiota transplantation were performed to examine whether the tumor inhibition observed in mice was related to gut microbiota changes. Results: The ingredients in GST, mostly terpenes and their derivatives, were novel and more concentrated than those in tea made from the branches and leaves of the same plant species, Camellia sinensis, picked and produced the same year, while the levels of polyphenols and alkaloids were significantly reduced. In BGC-823, MGC-803, and SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells, GST extracts significantly inhibited proliferation (p = 0.037), induced G0/G1 arrest (p < 0.001) and promoted early apoptosis (p = 0.041). In mice, gastric tumor growth was significantly inhibited in both the high-dose (HTF) and middle-dose (MTF) GST-fed groups. The inhibition rate in the HTF group was 33.77% on Day 14 (p = 0.042), and that in the MTF group was 55.21% on Day 14 (p = 0.002) and 61.6% on Day 28 (p = 0.008). The survival time of MTF group mice was significantly prolonged by 22.2% (p = 0.013). GST extracts inhibited the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells (p = 0.016) and tissues (p = 0.029), downregulated the protein p-Rb and further downregulated E2F1, thereby affecting the cell cycle and proliferation. GST extracts altered the gut microbiota in mice, but these alterations alone were insufficient to inhibit gastric cancer growth. Conclusions: We confirmed the anti-gastric cancer effects of GST extracts, which might provide new approaches and methods for research and development of gastric cancer drugs.

AB  - BackgroundsIsoflurane is a widely used inhalation anesthetic and could lead to postoperative cognitive dysfunction, especially in aged patients, while the underlying mechanisms are not so far fully explained.ObjectivesIn the present study, the effects of isoflurane on cognitive function and its neurotoxicity were evaluated both in vivo and in vitro.ResultsThe expression of LCN2 in mice hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was upregulated by isoflurane anesthesia. By incubation of isoflurane with different type of neural cells, we noticed induction of LCN2 by isoflurane was more pronounced in astrocytes than that in neurons and microglia. Gian-of-function of LCN2 by endogenous overexpression or exogenous recombinant protein addition facilitated the inflammatory cytokine secretion and migration capacity of astrocytes. Knockdown of LCN2 in astrocytes reduced neuronal apoptosis induced by isoflurane in co-culture system.ConclusionThese results demonstrated the key role of astrocyte-derived LCN2 in isoflurane-induced neurotoxicity and postoperative cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - The efficiency of in vitro embryo production in mammals is influenced by variables associated with culture conditions during maturation, fertilization, and embryonic development. The embryos obtained often exhibit low quality due to suboptimal in vitro culture conditions compared to the in vivo environment. Co -culturing gametes and embryos with somatic cells has been developed to enhance in vitro culture conditions. This study aimed to assess the impact of coculturing in vitro -produced porcine embryos with porcine oviductal epithelial cells (POEC) on embryo development and quality. Firstly, a pure culture of POEC suitable for coculture systems was established. The epithelial origin of the cells was confirmed by the expression of E-cadherin and cytokeratin. The expression pattern of hormone receptors aligned with the diestrous oviduct, and POEC also secreted oviductal glycoprotein type 1 (OVGP-1). Secondly, POEC from passage 1 (POEC-1) were used to coculture with in vitroproduced porcine embryos. A successful coculture system was established without the addition of fetal bovine serum as a supplement. Coculturing POEC-1 in monolayers with in vitro -produced porcine embryos during the initial two days of culture enhanced the percentage of blastocysts and their hatching. Although the coculture did not alter the number of cells in the blastocysts or apoptosis assessed by TUNEL, it significantly reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in cleaved porcine embryos. This study represents the first report evaluating the quality of porcine embryos produced by IVF in coculture systems and assessing ROS levels in cleaved porcine embryos obtained by IVF.

AB  - Tea is a healthy beverage made from the leaves of the tea plant [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze]. The tea plant is a perennial evergreen plant that is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions. PR proteins (pathogenesis-related proteins, PRs) are defense-related proteins induced under pathogenesis-related conditions. Currently, there are a few studies on PRs in plants. Tea leaf color mutants have been of wide interest to scientists as special materials. A tea plant displaying variegated spontaneous albinism found in a local tea plantation in Huangshan City, Anhui Province, China, was used as the material sample in this study. An analysis of preexisting transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed the significant upregulation of three classes of PRs. In order to investigate the correlation between PRs and variegated tea plants, a series of studies were conducted on PR genes. The results revealed the identification of 17 CsPR1, 3 CsPR4 and 31 CsPR5 genes in tea plants using bioinformatics methods, and their structures and promoter sequences. The expression of three PR1, two PR4 and one PR5 genes was determined to be induced in stress treatment experiments involving mechanical damage, insect bites, low temperature treatment, and fungal infections. Additionally, the ribonuclease activity of CsPR4 was successfully verified. This is the first study to report the ribonuclease activity of CsPR4 in tea plants. The results can serve as a reference for future studies on PRs in tea plants, offering new insights into information on albinism in tea plants.

AB  - Prolonged exposure to high altitudes above 2500 m above sea level (a.s.l.) can cause cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions. Herein, we sought to investigate the effects of chronic exposure to plateau hypoxia on the hippocampus in a rat model by using voxel-based morphometry, creatine chemical exchange saturation transfer (CrCEST) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging techniques. 58 healthy 4-week-old male rats were randomized into plateau hypoxia rats (H group) as the experimental group and plain rats (P group) as the control group. H group rats were transported from Chengdu (500 m a.s.l.), a city in a plateau located in southwestern China, to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (4250 m a.s.l.), Yushu, China, and then fed for 8 months there, while P group rats were fed in Chengdu (500 m a.s.l.), China. After 8 months of exposure to plateau hypoxia, open-field and elevated plus maze tests revealed that the anxiety-like behavior of the H group rats was more serious than that of the P group rats, and the Morris water maze test revealed impaired spatial memory function in the H group rats. Multimodal MR imaging analysis revealed a decreased volume of the regional gray matter, lower CrCEST contrast and higher transport coefficient Ktrans in the hippocampus compared with the P group rats. Further correlation analysis found associations of quantitative MRI parameters of the hippocampus with the behavioral performance of H group rats. In this study, we validated the viability of using noninvasive multimodal MR imaging techniques to evaluate the effects of chronic exposure to a plateau hypoxic environment on the hippocampus.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Tangzhiqing decoction (TZQD) is an effective prescription developed by Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications, which has a clear cerebral protective effect on mice with diabetic cognitive dysfunction, but its specific mechanism has not been well elucidated. Aims of the study: This study aims to verify the protection of TZQD on cognitive function in mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and explore the possible underlying mechanisms. Materials and methods: Six active ingredients in TZQD were detected using high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. In vivo experiments, the protection of TZQD on cognitive function and hippocampal neurons in type 2 diabetes mice was verified to obtain the optimal intervention dose of TZQD. TZQD and 3-methyladenine (3 MA) respectively or jointly intervened in mice with T2DM for 12 weeks, followed by detecting the cognitive difference, hippocampus cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region injury, and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in each group. Simultaneously, the investigation of autophagosome formation and organelle impairment in hippocampal neurons, along with the examination of AMPK/mTOR pathway proteins and autophagy-related proteins, was conducted to elucidate the potential mechanisms, through which TZQD modulates autophagy and enhances cognitive function. In vitro experiments, TZQD-containing serum and AMPK inhibitor Compound C (CC) were used to intervene in mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells under high glucose environment, further clarifying the regulatory role of TZQD on the AMPK/mTOR pathway and its impact on HT22 cell apoptosis and autophagy. Results: In vivo experiment results showed that TZQD had an obvious hypoglycemic effect. Different doses of TZQD could improve cognitive function and hippocampus damage in diabetes mice, with the middle dose of TZQD showing the best effect. TZQD increased the swimming speed of diabetes mice, improved their spatial recognition and memory ability, and reduced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, Nissl body injury, and p-tau217 protein deposition. In addition, through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence, and Western blot (WB) detection, TZQD significantly improved the organelle damage of hippocampal neurons in diabetes mice, promoted the formation of autophagy lysosomes, increased the expression of autophagy-related proteins like Beclin 1, LC3II/LC3I, LAMP1, and LAMP2, reduced the level of P62 and promoted autophagy flow, which, however, were all significantly weakened by 3 MA. Meanwhile, TZQD regulated the expressions of AMPK/mTOR pathway proteins. In vitro experimental study results showed that TZQD can regulate the expression ratio of p-AMPK/AMPK alpha 1 and p-mTOR/mTOR in HT22 cells under high glucose conditions and improved the morphology and vitality of HT22 cells. By employing techniques such as monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining, Lysosomal red fluorescent probe staining, and Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining, the investigation revealed that TZQD administration resulted in enhanced autophagosome formation, preservation of a lysosomal acidic milieu, and consequent mitigation of HT22 cell apoptosis under high glucose conditions. Conclusions: TZQD can regulate the AMPK/mTOR pathway to activate autophagy to attenuate hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, thereby protecting cognitive function in diabetic mice.

AB  - Herein, we report, for the first time, the synthesis, characterization, and the photocatalytic methyl blue dye degradation performance of magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by a facile green approach using Camellia sinensis (tea leaves) extract as a reducing agent. The as-prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), which confirmed the large-scale synthesis of well crystalline cubic crystalline phase MgO NPs. Rietveld refinement analysis of the XRD pattern was done to determine the crystallographic parameters of the MgO NPs and to investigate lattice defects. Microstrain, lattice stress, and energy density were calculated using Williamson-Hall analysis The synthesized nanoparticles exhibited over 97% photocatalytic degradation efficiency of methylene blue (MB) dye. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the favorable formation of O-2 radicals on the MgO (001) surface as the drivers of the MB dye degradation.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In this study, the expression profiles of miR-148a were constructed in eight different ovine tissues, including mammary gland tissue, during six different developmental periods. The effect of miR-148a on the viability, proliferation, and milk fat synthesis of ovine mammary epithelial cells (OMECs) was investigated, and the target relationship of miR-148a with two predicted target genes was verified. The expression of miR-148a exhibited obvious tissue-specific and temporal-specific patterns. miR-148a was expressed in all eight ovine tissues investigated, with the highest expression level in mammary gland tissue (p < 0.05). Additionally, miR-148a was expressed in ovine mammary gland tissue during each of the six developmental periods studied, with its highest level at peak lactation (p < 0.05). The overexpression of miR-148a increased the viability of OMECs, the number and percentage of Edu-labeled positive OMECs, and the expression levels of two cell-proliferation marker genes. miR-148a also increased the percentage of OMECs in the S phase. In contrast, transfection with an miR-148a inhibitor produced the opposite effect compared to the miR-148a mimic. These results indicate that miR-148a promotes the viability and proliferation of OMECs in Small-tailed Han sheep. The miR-148a mimic increased the triglyceride content by 37.78% (p < 0.01) and the expression levels of three milk fat synthesis marker genes in OMECs. However, the miR-148a inhibitor reduced the triglyceride level by 87.11% (p < 0.01). These results suggest that miR-148a promotes milk fat synthesis in OMECs. The dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-148a reduced the luciferase activities of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-A (PPARGC1A) in wild-type vectors, suggesting that they are target genes of miR-148a. The expression of miR-148a was highly negatively correlated with PPARGC1A (r = -0.789, p < 0.001) in ovine mammary gland tissue, while it had a moderate negative correlation with DNMT1 (r = -0.515, p = 0.029). This is the first study to reveal the molecular mechanisms of miR-148a underlying the viability, proliferation, and milk fat synthesis of OMECs in sheep.

AB  - Nuclear speckles, also known as interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs), are subnuclear domains highly enriched in proteins involved in transcription and mRNA metabolism and, until recently, have been regarded primarily as their storage and modification hubs. However, several recent studies on non-neuronal cell types indicate that nuclear speckles may directly contribute to gene expression as some of the active genes have been shown to associate with these structures. Neuronal activity is one of the key transcriptional regulators and may lead to the rearrangement of some nuclear bodies. Notably, the impact of neuronal activation on IGC/nuclear speckles organization and function remains unexplored. To address this research gap, we examined whether and how neuronal stimulation affects the organization of these bodies in granular neurons from the rat hippocampal formation. Our findings demonstrate that neuronal stimulation induces morphological and proteomic remodelling of the nuclear speckles under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Importantly, these changes are not associated with cellular stress or cell death but are dependent on transcription and splicing.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by core behavioral symptoms in the domains of sociability, language/communication, and repetitive or stereotyped behaviors. Deficits in the prefrontal and hippocampal excitatory/inhibitory balance due to a functional loss of GABAergic interneurons are proposed to underlie these symptoms. Increasing the postsynaptic effects of GABA with compounds that selectively modulate GABAergic receptors could be a potential target for treating ASD symptoms. In addition, deficits in GABAergic interneurons have been linked to dopamine (DA) system dysregulation, and, despite conflicting evidence, abnormalities in the DA system activity may underly some ASD symptoms. Here, we investigated whether the positive allosteric modulator of alpha 5-containing GABA(A) receptors (alpha 5-GABA(A)Rs) SH-053-2 ' F-R-CH3 (10 mg/kg) attenuates behavioral abnormalities in rats exposed to valproic acid (VPA) in utero, an established risk factor for autism. We also evaluated if animals exposed to VPA in utero present changes in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA system activity using in vivo electrophysiology and if SH-053-2 ' F-R-CH3 could attenuate these changes. SH-053-2 ' F-R-CH3 was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before each behavioral test and electrophysiology. In utero VPA exposure caused male and female rats to present increased repetitive behavior (self-grooming) in early adolescence and deficits in social interaction in adulthood. Male, but not female VPA rats, also presented deficits in recognition memory as adults. SH-053-2 ' F-R-CH3 attenuated the impairments in sociability and cognitive function in male VPA-exposed rats without attenuating the decreased social interaction in females. Adult male and female VPA-exposed rats also showed an increased VTA DA neuron population activity, which was not changed by SH-053-2 ' F-R-CH3. Despite sex differences, our findings indicate that alpha 5-GABA(A)Rs positive allosteric modulators may effectively attenuate some core ASD symptoms.

AB  - To observe the expression changes of P2 protein in cochlear spiral ganglion cells before and after noise injury, and to explore the relationship between the changes of purinergic receptors in spiral ganglion cells and noise-induced hearing loss, so that the signal transduction of purinergic receptors can be used to treat SNHL The target point provides a theoretical basis. The experimental animals were randomly divided into normal and experimental groups. The experimental group was given 120 dB white noise continuous exposure for 10 days and 3 h a day. The auditory brainstem response was measured before and after the noise exposure. After the noise exposure, the two groups of animals were collected. Do immunofluorescence staining, western blot, fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR to observe the expression of P2 protein. The average hearing threshold of the animals in the experimental group increased to 38.75 +/- 6.44 dB SPL after 7 days of noise exposure, and the high-frequency hearing loss was lower and severe; the average hearing threshold increased to 54.38 +/- 6.80 dB SPL after 10 days of noise exposure, and the hearing loss at 4 k Hz was relatively high. Light; Frozen sections of cochlear spiral ganglion cells and staining of isolated spiral ganglion cells found that P2X2, P2X3, P2X4, P2X7, P2Y2, and P2Y4 proteins were all expressed in cochlear spiral ganglion cells before noise exposure. Among them, P2X3 expression increased and P2X4, the down-regulation of P2Y2 expression was statistically significant (P < 0.05); Western blot and real-time quantitative PCR detection results showed that the expression of P2X3 was significantly increased after noise exposure than before noise exposure (P < 0.05), and P2X4 and P2Y2 were expressed after noise exposure The amount was significantly lower than before noise exposure (P < 0.05). (Figure. 4). After noise exposure, the expression of P2 protein is upregulated or downregulated. By affecting the -Ca2+ cycle, the transmission of sound signals to the auditory center is blocked, which provides a theoretical basis for the signal transduction of purinergic receptors to become a target for the treatment of SNHL.

AB  - Use of foliar auxin applications are increasing in the nursery and greenhouse industry. However, previous research has shown that insufficient auxin is absorbed or translocated to the site of action when foliar auxin applications are used. It is theorized that adding surfactants to foliar applications of auxin may help with the absorption and translocation of auxin to the site of action. Research was conducted to determine whether adding surfactants to one-time foliar applications of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) would be as effective as the current industry standard, the basal quick-dip. Terminal, semi-hardwood cuttings of Red CascadeTM miniature climbing rose (Rosa 'MOORcap'), common camellia (Camellia japonica) and 'Southern Charm' magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora 'Southern Charm') were sprayed to the drip point using Hortus IBA Water Soluble Salts (TM) at concentrations of 0 ppm, 50 ppm, 75 ppm, or 100 ppm for rose cuttings or 0 ppm, 500 ppm, 1000 ppm, or 1500 ppm IBA for camellia or magnolia. To serve as an industry control, the basal end of cuttings was immersed for 3-s in a solution of either 250 ppm, 4000 ppm or 2500 ppm for rose, camellia, or magnolia, respectively. A foliar application of 1500 ppm after sticking was as effective as the basal quick-dip for cuttings of 'Southern Charm', while other spray treatments were less effective. A basal quick-dip was more effective than a foliar spray for rooting cuttings of camellia. Auxin rate had no impact on rooting of Red Cascade TM miniature rose. The goal of commercial plant propagation is to produce high-quality rooted cuttings as quickly as possible. Plant propagation places a large demand on labor within the nursery industry, with one recent report being that labor accounts for >50% of a nursery's budget. Our results from this trial affirm the results reported by similar trials into foliar applications of auxin suggests that the benefits of foliar applications are species dependent Further work is warranted on examining other auxin and surfactant formulations.

AB  - Porcine astrovirus (PAstV) has a potential zoonotic risk, with a high proportion of co-infection occurring with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and other diarrheal pathogens. Despite its high prevalence, the cellular mechanism of PAstV pathogenesis is ill-defined. Previous proteomics analyses have revealed that the differentially expressed protein NOD-like receptor X1 (NLRX1) located in the mitochondria participates in several important antiviral signaling pathways in PAstV-4 infection, which are closely related to mitophagy. In this study, we confirmed that PAstV-4 infection significantly up-regulated NLRX1 and mitophagy in Caco-2 cells, while the silencing of NLRX1 or the treatment of mitophagy inhibitor 3-MA inhibited PAstV-4 replication. Additionally, PAstV-4 infection triggered the activation of the extracellular regulated protein kinases/ myosin light-chain kinase (ERK/MLCK) pathway, followed by the down-regulation of tight-junction proteins (occludin and ZO-1) as well as MUC-2 expression. The silencing of NLRX1 or the treatment of 3-MA inhibited myosin light-chain (MLC) phosphorylation and up-regulated occludin and ZO-1 proteins. Treatment of the ERK inhibitor PD98059 also inhibited MLC phosphorylation, while MLCK inhibitor ML-7 mitigated the down-regulation of mucosa-related protein expression induced by PAstV-4 infection. Yet, adding PD98059 or ML-7 did not affect NLRX1 expression. In summary, this study preliminarily explains that NLRX1 plays an important role in the disruption of intestinal mucosal function triggered by PAstV-4 infection via the ERK/MLC pathway. It will be helpful for further antiviral drug target screening and disease therapy.

TI  - Targeting tumor heterogeneity: multiplex-detection-based multiple instance learning for whole slide image classification
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS

KW  - PROSTATE-CANCER
KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - Motivation Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a powerful technique to classify whole slide images (WSIs) for diagnostic pathology. The key challenge of MIL on WSI classification is to discover the critical instances that trigger the bag label. However, tumor heterogeneity significantly hinders the algorithm's performance.Results Here, we propose a novel multiplex-detection-based multiple instance learning (MDMIL) which targets tumor heterogeneity by multiplex detection strategy and feature constraints among samples. Specifically, the internal query generated after the probability distribution analysis and the variational query optimized throughout the training process are utilized to detect potential instances in the form of internal and external assistance, respectively. The multiplex detection strategy significantly improves the instance-mining capacity of the deep neural network. Meanwhile, a memory-based contrastive loss is proposed to reach consistency on various phenotypes in the feature space. The novel network and loss function jointly achieve high robustness towards tumor heterogeneity. We conduct experiments on three computational pathology datasets, e.g. CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC. Benchmarking experiments on the three datasets illustrate that our proposed MDMIL approach achieves superior performance over several existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - As a potential adsorbent material, loose, porous livestock manure biochar provides a new approach to livestock manure resource utilization. In this study, coconut husks (CH) and livestock manure, i.e., cow dung (CD), pig manure (PM), and chicken manure (CM) were used as biomass precursors for preparation of biochar via high-temperature pyrolysis and CO2 activation. Characterization technologies, such as scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, adsorption-desorption isotherms, and pore size distributions, were used to study the microscopic morphologies and physicochemical properties of unactivated and activated biochar materials. The results showed that CD biochar provides better adsorption performance (up to 29.81 mg H2S/g) than CM or PM biochar. After activation at 650 degrees for 1 h, the best adsorption performance was 38.23 mg H2S/g. For comparison, the CH biochar removal performance was 30.44 mg H2S/g. Its best performance was 38.73 mg H2S/g after 1 h of activation at 750 degrees C. Its best removal performance is equivalent to that of CH biochar activated at a temperature that is 100 degrees C higher. Further material characterization indicates that the H2S removal performance of livestock-manure-derived biochar is not entirely dependent on the specific surface area, but is closely related to the pore size distribution.

AB  - Spinescence-characterized by spines, prickles, and thorns-is a key defensive trait in plants, but is rare among bamboo genera. Its evolutionary history in bamboos remains poorly understood due to limited fossil evidence, with only a single previously documented specimen of a preserved node. Furthermore, the evolutionary ecology and paleoclimatic adaptations of bamboos during the Quaternary in Asia remain unclear due to a lack of fossil records. This study introduces Chimonobambusa manipurensis sp. nov., a well-preserved thorny bamboo fossil from the late Pleistocene of eastern India, marking the first Asian fossil record of thorny bamboo and the first Quaternary record from Asia. The fossil features nodes, internodes, nodal buds, and thorn scars, offering novel insights into bamboo spinescence and nodal morphology. C. manipurensis displays three well-preserved nodes, two complete internodes, prominently conserved nodal buds, and 3-4 thorn base scars along each nodal rim. Morphologically, it shares traits seen in modern Chimonobambusa Makino and is placed within the same genus. Together with a Pliocene-Pleistocene thorny bamboo record from Peru, this discovery suggests spinescence in bamboos likely emerged during the Neogene, with evolutionary adaptations continuing into the Pleistocene potentially as an adaptation to changing climatic conditions and increased herbivory pressures. Furthermore, it suggests that bamboos during Quaternary time in Asia were growing under warm and humid climatic conditions. This finding enhances our understanding of bamboo morphological evolution and paleoclimatic adaptations, filling a critical gap in the global fossil record.

AB  - Flavonoids are critical secondary metabolites that determine the health benefits and flavor of tea, while chlorophylls are important contributors to the appearance of tea. However, transcription factors (TFs) that can integrate both chlorophyll biosynthesis and flavonoid accumulation in response to specific light signals are rarely identified. In this study, we report that the GOLDEN 2-LIKE TF pair, CsGLK1 and CsGLK2, orchestrate UV-B-induced responses in the chlorophyll biosynthesis and flavonoid accumulation of tea leaves. The absence of solar UV-B reduced the transcriptional expression of CsGLKs in the tea leaves and was highly correlated with a decrease in flavonoid levels (especially flavonol glycosides) and the expression of genes and TFs involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis and flavonoid accumulation. In vivo and in vitro molecular analyses showed that CsGLKs could be regulated by the UV-B signal mediator CsHY5, and could directly bind to the promoters of gene and TF involved in light-harvesting (CsLhcb), chlorophyll biosynthesis (CsCHLH, CsHEMA1, and CsPORA), and flavonoid accumulation (CsMYB12, CsFLSa, CsDFRa, and CsLARa), eventually leading to UV-B-induced responses in the chlorophylls and flavonoids of tea leaves. Furthermore, UV-B exposure increased the levels of total flavonoids, CsGLK1 protein, and expression of CsGLKs and target genes in the tea leaves. These results indicate that CsGLKs may modulate tea leaf characteristics by regulating chlorophyll biosynthesis and flavonoid accumulation in response to solar UV-B. As the first report on UV-B-induced changes in flavonoid and chlorophyll regulation mediated by CsGLKs, this study improves our understanding of the environmental regulations regarding tea quality and sheds new light on UV-B-induced flavonoid responses in higher plants.

AB  - The study examines the potential of an organic food waste, green tea (Camellia sinensis) waste (GTW), to mitigate excessive fat accumulation in Pangasianodon hypophthalmus. In-vitro evaluations revealed a significant presence of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activities in GTW extracts, with the highest levels observed in the methanolic extract. Seven isonitrogenous (32% CP) and isocaloric (around 3700 kcal kg(-1) DE) diets were formulated with varying levels of GTW methanolic extract (GE) or powder (GP)), comprising: control (without GE and GP), GE(2) (2 g kg(-1)GE), GE(4) (4 g kg(-1)GE), GE(8) (8 g kg(-1)GE), GP(5) (5 g kg(-1)GP), GP(10) (10 g kg(-1)GP), and GP(20) (20 g kg(-1)GP). A 60-day feeding trial was conducted with these diets by stocking P. hypophthalmus juveniles (35.61 +/- 0.75 g) in seven groups in triplicates. Post-trial results showed enhanced growth and nutrient utilization in GE(4) and GP(10) groups but a significant decline in these parameters at higher doses (GE(8), GP(20)). These changes were associated with a decrease in whole-body lipid content, with the GP(20) group exhibiting a significant (p < 0.05) 28.66% reduction compared to the control. Other groups displayed moderate lipid reductions. Fatty acid profiles indicated decreasing SFAs and increasing MUFAs, PUFAs, Sigma n-3, and Sigma n-6 fatty acids in muscle and viscera as GE and GP levels increased. Serum lipid profiles showed reduced TG, TC, and LDL-c, along with increased HDL-c levels as GE and GP doses increased. These effects were attributed to the downregulation of lipogenic enzymes (G6PDH, ME) and upregulation of the lipolytic gene PPAR-alpha in the liver with increasing GE and GP doses. The study concludes by recommending 20 g kg(-1) GTW powder supplementation for maximum fat reduction and 4 g kg(-1) GTW extract or 10 g kg(-1) GTW powder for moderate fat reduction while maintaining optimal growth in P. hypophthalmus diets.

AB  - The main production area of Camellia vietnamensis (C. vietnamensis) is in the low mountain and hilly areas of southern China. The low survival rate of seedlings caused by drought is one of the main obstacles restricting the development of the C. vietnamensis industry. An exploration of the key adaptation mechanism of C. vietnamensis to drought stress is important in order to improve its drought resistance. We conducted a study on the morphological, physiological, biochemical, and drought resistance-related genes of five C. vietnamensis cultivars grown in Hainan province under varying degrees of drought stress. The results indicate that drought stress can lead to a decrease in the relative water content and photosynthetic capacity of C. vietnamensis leaves. Compared with the control, the drought damage index, malondialdehyde, relative electrical conductivity, soluble protein, soluble sugar and proline contents of the five C. vietnamensis cultivars increased with drought-stress duration and degree. With increasing drought-stress intensity, the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the content of related metabolites (total polyphenols, total flavonoids, tea saponins) gradually increased, and the expression levels of phenylpropanoid pathway-related genes (Cv4CL1, CvCAD1, CvCAD2, CvPOX1, CvPOX2, CvPOX3) were upregulated. Based on the results of the drought tolerance coefficients, principal component analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis, we classified five C. vietnamensis cultivars into drought-tolerant cultivars ('Haida 1'); moderately drought-tolerant cultivars ('Haida 4' and 'Wanhai 4'); and drought-sensitive cultivars ('Wanhai 3' and 'Wanhai 1'). The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the promotion and cultivation of C. vietnamensis and the selection of drought-resistant cultivars.

AB  - The use of mixed ration silage (MRS) provides animals with a diet formulation that meets their nutritional requirements. This study aimed to evaluate the fermentative profile, losses, chemical composition and in vitro dry matter digestibility of mixed ration silages, including babassu by-products as a feed alternative for dairy cows. A completely randomized design was used, with four treatments and five replications, which were composed of TGS: Tanzania grass silage; MRSS: Tanzania grass silage with corn and soybean meal; MRSF: Tanzania grass silage with corn, soybean meal and babassu flour; and MRSC: Tanzania grass silage with corn, soybean meal and babassu cake. There was a significant difference between MRS and TGS (p < 0.05) in the variables' pH, gas (GL) and effluent losses (EL), dry matter recovery (DMR), water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and total digestible nutrients (TDN). There was no statistical difference in buffer capacity (BC), acid detergent lignin, hemicellulose, ether extract (EE) and aerobic stability. However, for the variables' ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and non-fibre carbohydrate (NFC) content, lower values were observed in the MRS (p < 0.001). The babassu by-products, cake and flour, can replace corn by up to 50% of the total ration silage with Tanzania grass, meeting the nutritional requirements of dairy cows.

AB  - CRISPR screens have empowered the high-throughput dissection of gene functions; however, more explicit genetic elements, such as codons of amino acids, require thorough interrogation. Here, we establish a CRISPR strategy for unbiasedly probing functional amino acid residues at the genome scale. By coupling adenine base editors and barcoded sgRNAs, we target 215,689 out of 611,267 (35%) lysine codons, involving 85% of the total protein-coding genes. We identify 1,572 lysine codons whose mutations perturb human cell fitness, with many of them implicated in cancer. These codons are then mirrored to gene knockout screen data to provide functional insights into the role of lysine residues in cellular fitness. Mining these data, we un-cover a CUL3-centric regulatory network in which lysine residues of CUL3 CRL complex proteins control cell fitness by specifying protein-protein interactions. Our study offers a general strategy for interrogating genetic elements and provides functional insights into the human proteome.

AB  - Osmotic stress caused by low -temperature, drought and salinity was a prevalent abiotic stress in plant that severely inhibited plant development and agricultural yield, particularly in tea plant. Jasmonic acid (JA) is an important phytohormone involving in plant stress. However, underlying molecular mechanisms of JA modulated osmotic stress response remains unclear. In this study, high concentration of mannitol induced JA accumulation and increase of peroxidase activity in tea plant. Integrated transcriptome mined a JA signaling master, MYC2 transcription factor is shown as a hub regulator that induced by mannitol, expression of which positively correlated with JA biosynthetic genes (LOX and AOS) and peroxidase genes (PER). CsMYC2 was determined as a nuclei -localized transcription activator, furthermore, ProteinDNA interaction analysis indicated that CsMYC2 was positive regulator that activated the transcription of CsLOX7, CsAOS2, CsPER1 and CsPER3 via bound with their promoters, respectively. Suppression of CsMYC2 expression resulted in a reduced JA content and peroxidase activity and osmotic stress tolerance of tea plant. Overexpression of CsMYC2 in Arabidopsis improved JA content, peroxidase activity and plants tolerance against mannitol stress. Together, we proposed a positive feedback loop mediated by CsMYC2, CsLOX7 and CsAOS2 which constituted to increase the tolerance of osmotic stress through fine-tuning the accumulation of JA levels and increase of POD activity in tea plant.

AB  - The B3 DNA-binding superfamily is a group of gene families that contain a B3 domain in their proteins. Members of this superfamily are involved in responses to stresses including salt, drought, and cold stress. The B3 DNA-binding superfamily has not been fully studied in Camelina sativa. A total of eighty-seven members of this superfamily were identified in C. sativa. The identified genes were placed into five groups based on a phylogenetic analysis. All the proteins were predicted to be nuclear. The RAV and ARF gene family had the most conserved motifs, with nine out of ten motifs being preserved, while the REM gene family was discovered to have the fewest, with just one conserved motif being present. The RAV and REM gene families showed the least protein-protein interactions. The CsARF5 and CsARF7 genes showed the highest potent interaction score with multiple auxin-responsive proteins. A qPCR analysis was carried out on six genes that showed stress-induced expression changes. CsREM17, CsREM5, and CsRAVL5 were discovered to be considerably increased in response to drought stress, while CsARF10, CsARF4, and CsREM34 were found to be downregulated to a large extent. The B3 DNA-binding superfamily regulates abscisic acid signaling, which in turn influences plant growth and stress resistance.

AB  - Equisetites lateralis Phillips (= Equisetum laterale (Phillips) Gould) (Equisetaceae) is recorded for the first time for the Triassic of Gondwana. The specimens come from the upper section of the Can similar to ad ' on Largo Formation, late Ladinian-early Carnian, Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. The identification is based on sterile and fertile remains, preserved as stems, leaf sheaths, nodal diaphragms, and strobilus in organic connection. The first morphological and anatomical data of the epidermal cells and stomatal apparatus of Gondwanan Triassic Equisetites are presented. This species is characterized by having stems unbranched, 8-23-35 free leaves tips in the leaf sheaths, cart-wheel structure, internode and lower part of the leaf-sheath showing scattered sunken stomata and ovate terminal strobilus with whorls of peltate sporangiophores. Herein, we described the fine sculptures in the epidermal and subsidiary cells, as pilulae and thickenings of the outer walls surrounding the sunken stomata. The Patagonian specimens identified as E. lateralis display characters of both subgenus (Hippochaete and Equisetum) of extant Equisetum. The first record of oviposition scars tentatively assigned to Odonatoptera are described from Triassic of Argentina, and are identified as Paleoovoidus contactus. Oviposition scars and paleoenvironmental interpretation of the formation, suggest that these plants could have grown in shallow water of the local lacustrine/palustrine deposits.

AB  - Red mud (RM) is a hazardous alumina industrial solid waste and its utilization faces three major challenges, namely, efficient recovery of valuable metals, favorable control of hazardous substances, and complete utiliza-tion of residues. We simultaneously achieved the three goals in a short one-step process, which was inspired by green chemistry principles and focused on multi-objective coupled control. Iron-based metal elements were recovered in reduction smelting process to produce pig iron. Molten slags after smelting were rapidly cooled and fiberized to produce mineral wool and hazardous alkaline substances were immobilized in vitreous fibers. The smelting-reduction process, fibration capacity of RM-based molten slags, and performance and environmental impact of prepared mineral wool were investigated using thermodynamic, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental methods. The results indicated the recovery rate of Fe could reach above 87%. The obtained mineral wool showed satisfactory properties with the fibrosis rate of around 73%-92%, the mean fiber diameter of 1.57-5.62 mu m, and the mean fiber tensile strength of 1520-6700 MPa. The highest Na+ leaching concentration was under 1.42 mg/L and the solidification rate of Na+ in different samples was above 99.8%. This paper provided a fresh approach to achieve clean and high value-added utilization of RM.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a progressive worsening in cognitive function, which is often accompanied by emotional disturbance. Recent studies revealed that anthocyanin-rich blackcurrant extract (BCE) can impart health benefits, but it is not known whether BCE is useful in the prevention and/or treatment of AD. Here, we examined the effects of BCE using a senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) model. Dietary BCE supplementation for 9 weeks was found to both improve the diminished long-term recognition memory and normalize the anxiety levels of SAMP8 mice. RNA sequencing demonstrated that dietary supplementation with anthocyanin-rich BCE significantly altered the gene expression profile in the hippocampus. According to enrichment analysis, genes regulated by BCE were related to cellular component terms such as "smooth endoplasmic reticulum," "axon," and "glutamatergic synapse." Real-time PCR verified alterations in the expression of AD-related genes. These findings indicate that anthocyanin-rich BCE may be valuable for the prevention and/or treatment of AD. Practical applications Blackcurrant contains an abundance of polyphenols, especially anthocyanins. This study demonstrated that anthocyanin-rich BCE improves the long-term recognition memory impairment and emotional abnormality of SAMP8 mice, a mouse model characterized by several pathological features of AD. These findings indicate that anthocyanin-rich BCE may be a useful food supplement or ingredient for the prevention of AD.

AB  - Phospholipases are among the important elements involved in lipid-dependent cell signaling that lead to the induction of downstream pathways. In the current study, phospholipases D (PLDs) gene family was characterized and compared in two important oilseed crops, Brassica napus and Camelina sativa. The results revealed that PLD has 33 members in Camelina sativa (CsPLD) and 41 members in Brassica napus (BnPLD). All studied PLDs showed a negative GRAVY value, indicating that PLDs are probably hydrophilic proteins. Phylogenetic analysis classified PLDs into five main subfamilies, including gamma, delta, beta, alpha, and zeta. According to evolution analysis, a different evolution process was observed between CsPLD and BnPLD. In addition, the results disclosed that most of the PLD genes have been segmentally duplicated under purifying selection. Cis-regulatory elements related to ABA and auxin responsiveness were found more in the upstream region of CsPLDs, while elements linked with MeJA responsiveness were observed more in the promoter region of BnPLDs. Analysis of the expression data showed that PLD alpha genes have a wide expression in most tissues. Quantitative expression analysis (qPCR) of CsPLD genes under salt stress, 200 mM of NaCl, was conducted in different time series. The results revealed that the CsPLD genes are involved in the response to salinity stress and their expression levels enhance with increasing salinity stress period. The outcomes of this research will be useful for future molecular works related to lipid signaling in oilseed plants.

AB  - Photosynthesis plays vital roles in plant growth and development. Stay-green (SGR) proteins are responsible for chlorophyll degradation and photosynthetic metabolism. To identify SGR family members and determine their potential functions in tea plants, we identified and cloned three SGR genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the tea SGR homologs were classified into the SGR subfamily (named CsSGR1 and CsSGR2) and the SGRL subfamily (named CsSGRL). Cis-element analysis indicated that the promoters of CsSGR1, CsSGR2 and CsSGRL contained light-, phytohormone- and stress-related elements. Subcellular localization confirmed that CsSGR1 was localized in the chloroplast, while CsSGR2 and CsSGRL were localized in the chloroplast, membrane and nucleus. The RT-qPCR results showed that the three genes in the matures of albino tea cultivars were expressed higher than in the green tea cultivar. However, only CsSGR2-overexpressing tobacco leaves exhibited a yellowish phenotype and significantly lower Fv/Fm values. CsSGR1 and CsSGR2 exhibited similar expression patterns in different tissues after infection with the pathogen Colletotrichum camelliae, which was opposite to the pattern observed for CsSGRL. In addition, CsSGR1 was significantly induced in response to cold stress, SA, JA and ABA in C. camelliae. These findings identified valuable candidate genes for elucidating the mechanism of leaf albinism, stress response and phytohormone signaling in tea plants.

AB  - Simple Summary The rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta cornuta), like many other iguana species, has become severely endangered as a result of human activities, earning the highest level of protection under the CITES convention for protected species. Moreover, it has been classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The rhinoceros iguana belongs to the family Iguanidae and is native to the island of Hispaniola. Since its population has declined, the Canary Island Government has promoted an initiative for its recovery in a completely natural environment. The limited literature regarding the anatomy of this species motivated us to investigate its cranial structures by using modern imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with anatomical dissection, to obtain helpful information on the structures that form the rhinoceros iguana's head. In this paper, we attempted to elaborate on an atlas of the head of the rhinoceros iguana, applying modern imaging techniques such as CT and MRI. Furthermore, by combining the images acquired through these techniques with macroscopic anatomical sections, we obtained an adequate description of the relevant structures that form the head of this species. This anatomical information could provide a valuable diagnostic tool for the clinical evaluation of different pathological processes in iguanas such as abscesses and osteodystrophy secondary to nutrient imbalances, skull malformations, fractures, and neoplasia.

AB  - Dravet syndrome is an intractable epilepsy with a high seizure burden that is resistant to current anti-seizure medications. There is evidence that neuroinflammation plays a role in epilepsy and seizures, however few studies have specifically examined neuroinflammation in Dravet syndrome under conditions of a higher seizure burden. Here we used an established genetic mouse model of Dravet syndrome ( Scn1a + /- mice), to examine whether a higher seizure burden impacts the number and morphology of microglia in the hippocampus. Moreover, we examined whether a high seizure burden influences classical inflammatory mediators in this brain region. Scn1a + /- mice with a high seizure burden induced by thermal priming displayed a localised reduction in microglial cell density in the granule cell layer and subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, regions important to postnatal neurogenesis. However, microglial cell number and morphology remained unchanged in other hippocampal subfields. The high seizure burden in Scn1a + /- mice did not affect hippocampal mRNA expression of classical inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 1 beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha, but increased cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression. We then quantified hippocampal levels of prostanoids that arise from COX-2 mediated metabolism of fatty acids and found that Scn1a + /- mice with a high seizure burden displayed increased hippocampal concentrations of numerous prostaglandins, notably PGF 2 alpha , PGE 2 , PGD 2 , and 6-K-PGF 1A , compared to Scn1a + /- mice with a low seizure burden. In conclusion, a high seizure burden increased hippocampal concentrations of various prostaglandin mediators in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome. Future studies could interrogate the prostaglandin pathways to further better understand their role in the pathophysiology of Dravet syndrome.

AB  - Intensive livestock production has a negative environmental impact by producing large amounts of animal dejections, which, if not properly managed, can contaminate nearby water bodies with nutrient excess. However, if the animal manure could be transferred efficiently to nearby crops and used as a fertilizer for the plants, pollution/contamination would be mitigated, transforming manure from a waste to a resource. This valorization of manure from waste to a resource falls within the circular economy principles, but the transportation of manure also comes at an environmental and economic cost. It is a single-objective optimization problem regarding finding the best solution for the logistics process of satisfying nutrient crops needs through livestock manure. This paper uses a centralized optimal algorithm (COA) to solve the problem, based on a realistic simulator that considers numerous real-world constraints that related work has not yet addressed. Implementation and evaluation of this method have been carried out based on extensive geolocalized data from Catalonia (Spain), one of the densest European farming regions, as a case study. The findings show that the use of treatment units in pig farms is not profitable, while applying treatment units on selected cow farms for composting manure has its merits, under an intelligent choice of cow farms. Finally, a comparison of our findings with those of two similar studies in Hangzhou, China and Minnesota, USA, are performed.

AB  - Ionic liquid (IL)-catalyzed in situ transesterification (IST) of wet algae is a promising strategy for energy-efficient biodiesel production owing to the dual roles of ILs as both solvents of the cell wall and catalysts of transesterification, while their variations and interactions within different water contents, which subsequently affect biodiesel production, are still out of knowledge. Accordingly, the variations of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yields and cellulose solubilities of [Bmim][HSO4], [Bmim][H2PO4], and [Bmim]2[HPO4] under different water conditions are experimentally and theoretically studied. Results indicate that [Bmim][HSO4], [Bmim][H2PO4], and [Bmim]2[HPO4] are acid, weak alkaline, and strong alkaline catalysts of transesterification of lipid with methanol, respectively. FAME yields of both [Bmim] [HSO4]-and [Bmim][H2PO4]-catalyzed reactions increase initially with the addition of 1.5 g of water, while they decrease with the increase of water content because of the consequent decline of the nucleophilic index and electrophilic index of the OH groups of [Bmim][HSO4] and [Bmim][H2PO4], respectively. Analogously, slight decreases of FAME yields of [Bmim]2[HPO4]-catalyzed transesterification are observed within 0.0-3.0 g of water, while a notable decrease is presented when 6.0 g of water is added. Contrary to the variation of catalytic properties, the cellulose solubilities of [Bmim][HSO4], [Bmim][H2PO4], and [Bmim]2[HPO4] all decrease with the addition of 1.5 g of water, as the water molecules occupy the H-bonding sites of [Bmim][HSO4]-cellobiose (clb), while the H-bonding interactions of water-clb and water- [Bmim][H2PO4] formed by shared oxygen atoms are enhanced with the increase of water content, subsequently enhancing the H bonding interactions of ILs-clb and relative cellulose solubilities. The variations of cellulose solubilities of ILs with the addition of 0.0-6.0 g of water are opposite to those of their catalytic properties. This study indicates that the cellulose solubilities and catalytic properties of [Bmim][HSO4], [Bmim][H2PO4], and [Bmim]2[HPO4] compete with each other under different water conditions, providing a potential strategy to offset the negative effect of water content on IST of wet algae.

AB  - To explore whether apple polyphenol extract (APE) ameliorates sugary-diet-induced depression-like behaviors, thirty male C57BL/6 mice (3-4 weeks old) were assigned to three groups randomly to receive different treatments for 8 consecutive weeks: (1) control group (CON), (2) S-HSD group (60% high sucrose diet feeding with 0.1 mg mL-1 sucralose solution as drinking water), and (3) S-APE group (S-HSD feeding with 500 mg per (kg bw day) APE solution gavage). The S-HSD group showed significant depression-like behaviors compared with the CON group, which was manifested by an increased number of buried marbles in the marble burying test, prolonged immobility time in both the tail suspension test and forced swimming test, and cognitive impairment based on the Morris water maze test. However, APE intervention significantly improved the depression-like behaviors by reducing serum levels of corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone, and increasing the serum level of IL-10. Moreover, APE intervention inhibited the activation of the NF-kappa B inflammatory pathway, elevated colonic MUC-2 protein expression, and elevated the colonic and hippocampal tight junction proteins of occludin and ZO-1. Furthermore, APE intervention increased the richness and diversity of gut microbiota by regulating the composition of microbiota, with increased relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidota, decreased relative abundance of Verrucomicrobiota at the phylum level, significantly lowered relative abundance of Akkermansia at the genus level, and rebalanced abnormal relative abundance of Muribaculaceae_unclassified, Coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002, and Lachnoclostridium induced by S-HSD feeding. Thus, our study supports the potential application of APE as a dietary intervention for ameliorating depression-like behavioral disorders.
   C57BL/6 mice were fed with control diet, sugary-diet, or sugary-diet with APE gavage for 8 weeks. After behavioral testing, the samples of serum, hippocampus, colon, and colonic contents were collected for further determination.

AB  - The concept of the tripartite synapse describes the close interaction of pre- and postsynaptic elements and the surrounding astrocyte processes. For glutamatergic synapses, it is established that the presence of astrocytic processes and their structural arrangements varies considerably between and within brain regions and between synapses of the same neuron. In contrast, less is known about the organization of astrocytic processes at GABAergic synapses although bi-directional signaling is known to exist at these synapses too. Therefore, we established super-resolution expansion microscopy of GABAergic synapses and nearby astrocytic processes in the stratum radiatum of the mouse hippocampal CA1 region. By visualizing the presynaptic vesicular GABA transporter and the postsynaptic clustering protein gephyrin, we documented the subsynaptic heterogeneity of GABAergic synaptic contacts. We then compared the volume distribution of astrocytic processes near GABAergic synapses between individual synapses and with glutamatergic synapses. We made two novel observations. First, astrocytic processes were more abundant at the GABAergic synapses with large postsynaptic gephyrin clusters. Second, astrocytic processes were less abundant in the vicinity of GABAergic synapses compared to glutamatergic, suggesting that the latter may be selectively approached by astrocytes. Because of the GABA transporter distribution, we also speculate that this specific arrangement enables more efficient re-uptake of GABA into presynaptic terminals.

AB  - Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) is an unconventional neurotrophic factor because it does not bind to a known specific receptor on the plasma membrane and functions primarily as an unfolded protein response (UPR) regulator in the endoplasmic reticulum. Data on the effects of CDNF on nonmotor behavior and monoamine metabolism are limited. Here, we performed the intracerebroventricular injection of a recombinant CDNF protein at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mu g in C57BL/6 mice. No adverse effects of the CDNF injection on feed and water consumption or locomotor activity were observed for 3 days afterwards. Decreases in body weight and sleep duration were transient. CDNF-treated animals demonstrated improved performance on the operant learning task and a substantial decrease in anxiety and behavioral despair. CDNF in all the doses enhanced serotonin (5-HT) turnover in the murine frontal cortex, hippocampus, and midbrain. This alteration was accompanied by changes in the mRNA levels of the 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors and in monoamine oxidase A mRNA and protein levels. We found that CDNF dramatically increased c-Fos mRNA levels in all investigated brain areas but elevated the phosphorylated-c-Fos level only in the midbrain. Similarly, enhanced CREB phosphorylation was found in the midbrain in experimental animals. Additionally, the upregulation of a spliced transcript of XBP1 (UPR regulator) was detected in the midbrain and frontal cortex. Thus, we can hypothesize that exogenous CDNF modulates the UPR pathway and overall neuronal activation and enhances 5-HT turnover, thereby affecting learning and emotion-related behavior.

AB  - A growing number of individuals are now exposed to neodymium (Nd) owing to its extensive applications. However, the biological effects of Nd on humans, especially on learning and memory, remain elusive. To investigate whether Nd exposure affects learning and memory, in this study female ICR mice were exposed to nano Nd2O3 via intranasal instillation at doses of 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg body weight, daily for 45 days. According to Morris water maze data, learning and memory parameters were significantly reduced in the 150 mg/kg nano-Nd2O3 group than the sham control. Furthermore, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy analysis revealed that Nd levels were significantly higher in the hippo campus of the 100 and 150 mg/kg exposed group than the sham control; however, no significant differences were observed in the hippocampal histopathology between these groups. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species were elevated in hippocampal tissues of experimental groups than the sham control, 447.3 in high dose group and 360.0 in control group; however, malondialdehyde levels were significantly increased and superoxide dismutase activities were decreased only in mice exposed to 100 and 150 mg/kg Nd2O3. High-performance liquid chromatography data demonstrated that levels of glutamic acid, glycine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid were higher in the hippocampus of mice exposed to 150 mg/kg Nd2O3 than the sham control. Our findings indicated that the neuronal injury was induced by disruption of the oxidation-antioxidation homeostasis and altered amino acid neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus, which could result in the poor cognitive performance demonstrated by exposed mice.

AB  - Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is one of the most common refractory epilepsies and is usually accompanied by a range of brain pathological changes, such as neuronal injury and astrocytosis. Naive astrocytes are readily converted to cytotoxic reactive astrocytes (A1) in response to inflammatory stimulation, suppressing the polarization of A1 protects against neuronal death in early central nervous system injury. Our previous study found that pro-inflammatory cytokines and miR-132-3p (hereinafter referred to as "miR-132") expression were upregulated, but how miR-132 affected reactive astrocyte polarization and neuronal damage during epilepsy is not fully understood. Here, we aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of miR-132 on A1 polarization. Our results confirmed that A1 markers were significantly elevated in the hippocampus of MTLE rats and IL-1 beta-treated primary astrocytes. In vivo, knockdown of miR-132 by lateral ventricular injection reduced A1 astrocytes, neuronal loss, mossy fiber sprouting, and remitted the severity of status epilepticus and the recurrence of spontaneous recurrent seizures. In vitro, the neuronal cell viability and axon length were reduced by additional treatment with A1 astrocyte conditioned media (ACM), and downregulation of astrocyte miR-132 rescued the inhibition of cell activity by A1 ACM, while the length of axons was further inhibited. The regulation of miR-132 on A1 astrocytes may be related to its target gene expression. Our results show that interfering with astrocyte polarization may be a breakthrough in the treatment of refractory epilepsy, which may extend to the research of other astrocyte polarization-mediated brain injuries.

AB  - The motility, health quality, and membrane disorders of spermatozoa are adversely affected during the process of semen cryopreservation due to the over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO(2)NPs) possess properties to scavenge ROS either by mimicking specific antioxidants or by enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the effects of adding the CeO(2)NPs in the TRIS-citrate-yolk extender on in-vitro antioxidant enzyme activities, spermatozoa quality attributes, and in-vivo fertility of post-thaw Beetal buck spermatozoa. The CeO(2)NPs were prepared and characterized (UV-spectrophotometry, FTIR, and XRD). Semen samples, collected from bucks (n = 5), were distributed into five aliquots and diluted in an extender containing increasing concentrations of nanoparticles (0 mu g/ml, called the control group, 25 mu g/mL, 50 mu g/mL, 75 mu g/mL, and 100 mu g/mL). At post-thaw, spermatozoa were evaluated for the above-mentioned attributes and the pregnancy rate by inseminating Beetal does (n = 252). Results demonstrated that CeO(2)NPs mitigated the detrimental effects of cryopreservation as ROS production and lipid peroxidation were lower (P < 0.001) in the 25, 50, and 75 mu g/mL CeO(2)NPs-added groups compared to the control and 100 mu g/ml CeO(2)NPs-added group. The addition of 25 mu g/mL CeO(2)NPs improved (P < 0.001) the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase and the concentration of reduced glutathione (P < 0.001) compared to the other groups. In terms of sperm kinematics and velocity parameters, the groups added with the 25 and 50 mu g/mL CeO(2)NPs exhibited higher total motility (P < 0.001), sperm progressive motility (P = 0.003), and rapid velocity (P < 0.001). The group added with the 50 mu g/mL CeO(2)NPs had the highest (P = 0.04) average path velocity. The groups added with the 25 and 50 mu g/mL CeO(2)NPs also exhibited higher plasma membrane integrity (P = 0.003), acrosomal integrity, and viability (P < 0.001) compared to the control group. The DNA integrity was also higher (P < 0.001) in all the CeO(2)NPs-added groups. The pregnancy rate was higher (P = 0.003) in the 25 (51.92 %) and 50 mu g/mL CeO(2)NPs (58.33 %) groups compared to the other groups. Conclusively, our findings suggest that the inclusion of cerium oxide nanoparticles in the TRIS-citrate-yolk freezing extender can reduce the occurrence of cryopreservation-induced damages to Beetal's buck spermatozoa and ultimately enhance the pregnancy rate in does.

AB  - This study aimed to improve the inoculation procedure with Sphacelotheca reiliana to identify germplasms susceptible to head smut of maize. During Phase 1, 1.5 g of spores were introduced into a substrate roll, which was then sown at 15, 20, 25, and 30 days after inoculation in a spore-free field. During Phase 2, 15 hybrids were planted on three dates in a field with head smut disease record. The tassel and ear were examined, and the number of infected plants was registered. In Phase 1, all hybrids showed the highest infection rates 25 days after inoculation. In Phase 2, the highest infection percentage was observed on the first date (32.5%). Experimental hybrids 1 and 2 and hybrid DK357 showed the highest infection percentages, whereas hybrids DK2037 and DK2061 showed the lowest infection percentages. On the second date, 10 hybrids were susceptible to infection, while on the third date, the hybrids showed low infection percentages or were not infected. The disease response in the Cimarron, Experimental 3, and Antelope hybrids was relatively constant over the first two planting dates. The experimental hybrids and P4063W showed high infection percentages. On the first date, the Experimental 3, Experimental 2, P4063W and Experimental 1 hybrids showed infection percentages of 77, 65, 62 and 46%, respectively. On the second date, these percentages changed to 49, 35, 41 and 48%, respectively. The proposed inoculation method is more effective and can be employed a lower cost and with less infrastructure than previous methods.

AB  - The sugarcane borer Diatraea saccharalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) is an important sugarcane pest and mechanical injuries caused through the mandibles can allow pathogen infections. The mandibles of D. saccharalis, as well as other insects, are associated with mandibular glands with a possible function in food intake and mouthparts lubrication; however, the chemical composition of the secretion is poorly known and its elucidation is important for the comprehensive understanding of plant-insect interactions. This study characterized some proteins and volatiles in the mandibular glands of D. saccharalis larvae. MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry allowed the identification of 24 predicted proteins within 10 functional classes, including the transport and metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides; Posttranslational protein modifications; energy conversion; intracellular trafficking; transcription; translation; and cytoskeleton function. Metabolites identified from GC/MS analysis revealed the presence of hydrocarbons classified as alcohols, ether, alkanes, and esters with differences in their relative abundance. Linolenic acid, the most abundant metabolite found in this gland, when conjugated with amino acids, can be an elicitor in the plant-herbivore interaction. The results suggest the occurrence of digestive and defensive biochemical components, which may contribute to understanding of the multifunctional roles of the mandibular gland secretion of D. saccharalis larvae during feeding activity.

AB  - Gray blight caused by Pestalotiopsis-like species is a major disease of tea crop worldwide including India, causes significant losses in tea production. Management of disease using fungal biocontrol agents is considered an alternative eco-friendly approach to synthetic fungicides. The present study explores the efficacy of Trichoderma reesei in the gray blight management in tea crop and activation of defense related enzymes against gray blight pathogen by developing a tri-trophic interaction system. Out of 16 isolates of Trichoderma species screened in laboratory against Pseudopestalotiopsis theae, a gray blight pathogen, isolate TRPATH01 had highest antagonistic activity (81.2%) against Ps. theae and was found to produce inhibitory volatile and non-volatile metabolites. Based on ITS and TEF-1 alpha sequencing, the isolate TRPATH01 was recognised as T. reesei. The methanolic extract of T. reesei was also found effective against Ps. theae at 200 mu g/mL also confirmed presence of highest volatile compounds. The isolate also produced hydrolytic enzymes such as chitinase, cellulase, protease, and lipase. Under nursery conditions, 2% and 5% concentrations with 2 x 10(6) conidia/ml of T. reesei were able to reduce 67.5% to 75.0% of disease severity over pathogen inoculated controls. Moreover, compared with positive and negative controls, T. reesei -treated tea plants showed increased shoot height, stem diameter, shoot and root fresh weight at 45 days after inoculation. Principal component analysis capturing 97.1% phenotypic variations, which revealed that the tea plants co-inoculated with Ps. theae and T. reesei exhibited significantly upregulated accumulation of defensive enzymes viz., polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, phenolics, ss-1, 3-glucanase, and chitinase when compared to both controls. Hence, T. reesei could provide an ecofriendly and viable mitigation option for gray blight in tea gardens by inducing defense-related enzymes.

AB  - Background: Maternal anesthetic exposure may exacerbate significant neurocognitive risks in the immature brains of fetuses. However, the mechanisms through which sevoflurane exposure during pregnancy results in cognitive impairments in offspring remain unclear. Methods: Pregnant C57BL/6 mice (gestational day 14) were intervented with 2.5 % sevoflurane for 6 h. Morris water maze test and context fear conditioning test were utilized to evaluate the cognitive function of the offspring. BV2 cells were stimulated with LPS-ATP to evaluate the impacts of SENP7 on microglial pyroptosis. A co-culture experiment was conducted to investigate the apoptosis of mouse hippocampal neuronal cells induced by BV2 cells. The regulatory roles of SENP7 in the cGAS/STING/IRF3 pathway were assessed using an immunoprecipitation SUMOylation assay, along with Western blot analysis. Results: Sevoflurane exposure during pregnancy resulted in cognitive impairments in offspring mice, which were associated with the upregulation of SENP7, Iba1, Caspase1, and GSDMD-N proteins, as well as the downregulation of NeuN and TH proteins in the brains of the offspring. The knockdown of SENP7 inhibited the elevation of GSDMD-N, Caspase1, and NLRP3 protein levels, subsequently reducing the concentrations of IL-1 beta and IL-18 in BV2 cells induced by LPS-ATP. Furthermore, SENP7 facilitated the activation of the cGAS/STING/ IRF3 axis by regulating the deSUMOylation of cGAS, which triggered microglial pyroptosis and subsequently led to neuronal apoptosis. Conclusion: Maternal exposure to sevoflurane increased the expression of SENP7 in the brains of offspring and resulted in detrimental effects on cognitive function. This phenomenon was associated with neuronal apoptosis triggered by microglial pyroptosis, which was regulated by SENP7 through the cGAS/STING/IRF3 pathway.

AB  - Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with a variety of symptoms, including core symptoms as well as behavioral and psychological symptoms. Somatosensory neural systems are generally believed to be relatively unaffected by AD until late in the course of the disease; however, somatosensory perception in patients with AD is not yet well understood. One factor that may complicate the assessment of somatosensory perception in humans centers on individual variations in pathological and psychological backgrounds. It is therefore necessary to evaluate somatosensory perception using animal models with uniform status. In the current study, we focused on the hippocampus, the primary site of AD. We first constructed a rat model of AD model using bilateral hippocampal injections of amyloid-(3 peptide 1-40 and ibotenic acid; sham rats received saline injections. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate memory impairment, and the formalin test (1 % or 4 % formalin) and upper lip von Frey test were performed to compare pain perception between AD model and sham rats. Finally, histological and immunohistochemical methods were used to evaluate tissue damage and neuronal activity, respectively, in the hippocampus. AD model rats showed bilateral hippocampal damage and had memory impairment in the Morris water maze test. Furthermore, AD model rats exhibited significantly less pain-related behavior in phase 2 (the last 50 min of the 60-minute observation) of the 4 % formalin test compared with the sham rats. However, no significant changes were observed in the von Frey test. Immunohistochemical observations of the trigeminal spinal subnucleus caudalis after 4 % formalin injection revealed significantly fewer cFos-immunoreactive cells in AD model rats than in sham rats, reflecting reduced neuronal activity. These results indicate that AD model rats with hippocampal damage have reduced responsiveness to persistent inflammatory chemical stimuli to the orofacial region.

AB  - The present study investigates sex differences in hippocampal functions in the context of synaptic plasticity, which is the cellular basis of learning and memory, and differences in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that accompanies plasticity in young-adult rats. The long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) were induced by stimulating the perforant pathway (PP) and field potentials composed of the field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) and population spike (PS) were recorded from the dentate gyrus (DG). Following the completion of the electrophysiological recordings, the hippocampi were removed bilaterally, and the protein and gene expression levels of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and P38-MAPK were determined by Western blot analysis and real-time PCR, respectively. No significant difference was found in synaptic and neuronal function before (basal) and after high -frequency stimulation between male and female rats. Nevertheless, female, but not male, rats were able to ex-press long term depression at the PP - DG synapses, suggesting that sex differences in plasticity are stimulation paradigm specific. MAPK1 expression was higher in males and MAPK3 expression was higher in females, but these differences disappeared after induction of plasticity in both sexes. While the expression of MAPK8 is influenced by sex, independent of the induction of plasticity, MAPK14 expression was down regulated by plasticity induction in females, but not males. No effect of sex, HFS and LFS on total and phosphorylated levels of MAPKs was found except phosphorylated ERK1/2. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was up regulated after LFS in male rats but did not change in female rats. These findings indicate that LFS-induced plasticity is differentially modulated between sexes, probably as a result of increased activation of ERK1/2 in male rats.

AB  - Aim of study: The objective of this study was to evaluate the intake, digestibility, performance, carcass yield, and meat quality parameters in Santa Ines lambs fed cactus pear and bean meal.
   Area of study: NW Brazil
   Materials and methods: 32 intact Santa Ines male lambs were distributed in a completely randomized design with 4 treatments (diets): control diet (concentrated feed containing corn and soybean meal as energy and protein ingredients); diet containing bean meal as a protein source; diet containing cactus pear as an energy source and; diet containing bean meal and/or cactus pear), using 8 animals per treatment. At the end of the experimental period, lambs were slaughtered with an average body weight of 32.78 kg.
   Main results: Animal fed cactus pear and bean meal/cactus pear had a higher intake and digestibility for non-fibrous carbohydrates (p<0.05). Lambs fed cactus pear diet had greater water intake via diet and lower neutral detergent fibre digestibility compared to other evaluated diets (p<0.05). Cactus pear and bean meal/cactus pear diets promoted lower water intake concerning to control and bean meal diets (p<0.05). The lower feed conversion was observed for animals that received control diet (p<0.05). Carcass characteristics and meat quality were not affected for the diets (p>0.05). Bean meal can be used as a source of protein concentrate in combination with cactus pear promoting a reduction in the use of corn and soybean in diets for small ruminants. The use of cactus pear in the diets promoted a water supply to the animals.
   Research highlights: Diets containing cactus pear and bean meal/cactus pear provided higher non-fibrous carbohydrates intake.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of developing obesity. Although fulvic acid alleviates back fat thickness in pigs, the mechanism underlying its anti-obesity effect remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the anti-obesity mechanism of fulvic acid using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We examined the effects of fulvic acid on adipocyte differentiation, cell viability, and lipid accumulation using molecular techniques. Fulvic acid treatment significantly decreased intracellular lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells during the differentiation compared with that in the control group. Western blotting revealed fulvic acid-induced downregulated expression of the adipocyte differentiation-related markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1. The fulvic acid treatment decreased the expression of the lipid uptake-related markers fatty acid-binding protein 4 and the cluster of differentiation 36 in 3T3-L1 cells. Moreover, fulvic acid significantly increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration via Ca2+ sequestration from the endoplasmic reticulum, enhanced Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity, and upregulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), thereby reducing adipocyte differentiation. Conclusively, fulvic acid attenuates adipocyte differentiation by activating the Ca2+/CaMKII/AMPK pathway, suggesting its anti-obesity potential.

AB  - As the most abundant congener of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) detected in environment and human biotic samples, 2, 2', 4, 4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) has been found to accumulate in brain and induce neurotoxicity, however, the detailed mechanism has not been clearly elucidated. To investigate the neurotoxicity of BDE-47, undifferentiated PC-12 cells were exposed to different doses of BDE-47, and BDE-47 dissolved in corn oil was orally administered to mice for 8 consecutive weeks. Our data showed that BDE-47 obviously changed cell morphology, altered cell viability, promoted cell apoptosis, and induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. BDE-47 promoted the differentiation of PC-12 cells by enhancing the expression of TrkA receptor and the phosphorylation levels of ERK and Akt. Moreover, BDE-47-induced differentiation of PC-12 cells was suppressed by inhibitors of corresponding pathways (MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt). H&E staining of brain showed neurons in DG and CAl areas of hippocampus decreased after BDE-47 exposure. Transcriptome sequencing of brain tissue suggested that multiple signaling pathways related to neuron death and nerve function were significantly regulated. In conclusion, these results provided new evidence for revealing the neurotoxicity of BDE-47, and offered important experimental basis for environmental controlling and post-exposure health risk assessment of BDE-47.

AB  - Background: Soyo-san (Xiaoyao-san; SYS), a traditional herbal medicine formula, has been used for treating mood disorders, especially depression and anxiety. Modified SYS (mSYS) is formulated by adding or removing herbs to SYS, and is mainly used in cases of mood disorders with comorbid diseases such as diabetes, digestive disorders, and anorexia. However, there has been no detailed comparative analysis of the differences in efficacy and underlying neurological mechanisms between SYS and mSYS. Purpose: This review aimed to investigate the present scientific evidence regarding the effects of SYS and mSYS on depression and anxiety in animal models based on behavioral improvements and changes in biomarker levels. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Medline databases were searched for all depression- and anxietymodel animal studies that used SYS and mSYS. The types of animals, methods for inducing depression or anxiety, publication trends, target diseases, types and proportions of herbs, and significant behavioral and biomolecular changes induced by SYS and mSYS treatment were analyzed. Results: A total of 1,120 studies were identified, of which 57 studies were finally included in this review. Behavioral or environmental stress was mainly used to induce depression or anxiety in rodent models. SYS treatment improved body weight, food intake, and depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. The proportions of the herbs in the original SYS formulation were mostly fixed, whereas the types and proportions of herbs used in mSYS formulations were quite diverse. mSYS had a wider range of target diseases than SYS, and it has been used not only for depression and anxiety, but also cancer and stroke. Changes in biomarker levels in the hippocampus of the brain have been studied most extensively for both SYS and mSYS. Both SYS and mSYS are reported to regulate 5-hydroxytryptamine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axisrelated biomolecules in the brain, as well as changes in micro-organisms and metabolite levels in the serum and intestinal environment. Conclusions: SYS and mSYS improved depression- and anxiety-like behaviors by regulating neurotransmission, neuronal survival, and inflammation. Further research is needed to elucidate the clinical value of mSYS through various uses-related in-depth mechanistic studies.

AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) leads to hippocampal damage and causes a variety of physiopathological responses, including the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), neuroinflammation, and alterations in synaptic plasticity. As an important trace element, strontium (Sr) has been reported to have antioxidant effects, to have anti-inflammatory effects, and to cause the inhibition of adipogenesis. The present study was undertaken to investigate the protective effects of Sr on hippocampal damage in NAFLD mice in order to elucidate the underlying mechanism of Sr in NAFLD. The mouse model of NAFLD was established by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD), and the mice were treated with Sr. In the NAFLD mice, we found that treatment with Sr significantly increased the density of c-Fos(+) cells in the hippocampus and inhibited the expression of caspase-3 by suppressing ERS. Surprisingly, the induction of neuroinflammation and the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus following an HFD were attenuated by Sr treatment. Sr significantly attenuated the activation of microglia and astrocytes induced by an HFD. The expression of phospho-p38, ERK, and NF-& kappa;B was consistently significantly increased in the HFD group, and treatment with Sr decreased their expression. Moreover, Sr prevented HFD-induced damage to the ultra-structural synaptic architecture. This study implies that Sr has beneficial effects on repairing the damage to the hippocampus induced by an HFD, revealing that Sr could be a potential candidate for protection from neural damage caused by NAFLD.

AB  - The present study was conducted to establish if laparoscopic ovum pick-up (LOPU) could be adapted to the swine species, and if the developmental competence of LOPU-sourced oocytes from peripubertal gilts could be improved by gonadotropin stimulation, by comparing with oocytes sourced from slaughtered gilts lacking hormonal stimulation. Estrus was synchronized in 34 gilts of similar to 6-8 months of age by daily oral administration of 17.6 mg altrenogest for 13 days and 10 mg dinoprost IM on the last day of altrenogest. Follicular development was stimulated in all gilts with a single injection of 1250 IU eCG given 3 days before LOPU (together with the 12th dose of altrenogest). In about half of the gilts (Group eCG-hCG), 500 IU hCG were injected IM similar to 72 h after eCG injection, or similar to 16-18 h prior to LOPU, to initiate oocyte maturation in vivo, while the remaining animals only received eCG (Group eCG). Most gilts underwent LOPU twice alternating the gonadotropin protocol, thereby decreasing the impact of individual variation on results. Abattoir-sourced oocytes from prepubertal gilts served as Control. Following LOPU, oocytes were in vitro matured, fertilized, and cultured to the blastocyst stage following standard procedures, while oocytes collected from Group eCG-hCG gilts were considered partly matured in vivo and were matured for similar to 24 h instead of similar to 44 h. Embryos reaching the blastocyst stage were fixed and stained to assess quality through cell numbers. There were no significant differences in the number of follicles aspirated and cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) recovered between Groups eCG-hCG and eCG (22.4 and 16.9 vs. 22.6 and 17.6, P > 0.05), as well as the recovery rate (76.6 vs. 78.1, P > 0.05). Cleavage rate was not different between Group eCG-hCG, Group eCG and Control (61.1 vs. 64.4 vs. 53.4 %, P > 0.05). However, the blastocyst rate over total oocytes (32.2 vs. 36.9 vs. 11.1 %, P < 0.05), blastocyst rate over cleaved oocytes (51.8 vs. 55.1 vs. 21.2 %, P < 0.01) and the average number of cells/blastocyst (89.6 vs. 87.5 vs. 62.2, P < 0.01) were unaffected by hCG treatment in LOPU-sourced oocytes, but both LOPU groups were significantly higher than abattoir-sourced oocytes, respectively. Our results suggest LOPU may become a powerful tool for sourcing swine oocytes with higher developmental competence than abattoir-sourced oocytes and known disease status for creating swine models for human biomedical applications, as well as for accelerated genetic gain in swine breeding programs.

AB  - Malignant melanoma (MM) affects not only humans but also animals, with gray horses being particularly predisposed to acquiring the disease. Multiomics have greatly advanced the understanding of human MM. In contrasty little is known regarding the pathogenesis of gray-horse melanoma and the unique phenomenon of melanoma "dormancy" in some animals. To help close this gap in knowledge, melanoma tissue and intact skin collected from gray horses were subjected to transcriptome analysis using RNAseq. In the next step, cultured primary tumor cells and normal skin fibroblasts were established from gray horses, and their protein expression profiles were determined. The obtained data unambiguously identified gray-horse melanoma (ghM) as a malignant tumor, as reflected by the overrepresentation of pathways typically activated in human melanoma and other human cancers. These included the RAS/RAF/MAPK, the IRS/IGF1R, and the PI3K/AKT signaling networks. In addition, the obtained data suggest that the key molecules RAC1, RAS, and BRAF, which are frequently mutated in human melanoma, may also contain activating mutations in ghM, whilst PTEN may harbor loss-of-function mutations. This issue will be subject to downstream analyses determining the mutational status in ghM to further advance the understanding of this frequent disease in gray horses.

AB  - The blockade of the CD40/CD40L immune checkpoint is considered essential for cardiac xenotransplantation. However, it is still unclear which single antibody directed against CD40 or CD40L (CD154), or which combination of antibodies, is better at preventing organ rejection. For example, the high doses of antibody administered in previous experiments might not be feasible for the treatment of humans, while thrombotic side effects were described for first-generation anti-CD40L antibodies. To address these issues, we conducted six orthotopic pig-to-baboon cardiac xenotransplantation experiments, combining a chimeric anti-CD40 antibody with an investigational long-acting PASylated anti-CD40L Fab fragment. The combination therapy effectively resulted in animal survival with a rate comparable to a previous study that utilized anti-CD40 monotherapy. Importantly, no incidence of thromboembolic events associated with the administration of the anti-CD40L PAS-Fab was observed. Two experiments failed early because of technical reasons, two were terminated deliberately after 90 days with the baboons in excellent condition and two were extended to 120 and 170 days, respectively. Unexpectedly, and despite the absence of any clinical signs, histopathology revealed fungal infections in all four recipients. This study provides, for the first time, insights into a combination therapy with anti-CD40/anti-CD40L antibodies to block this immune checkpoint.

AB  - Herein, we propose an oxygen nanobubbles-embedded hydrogel(ONB-G)with carbopol for oxygenation of wounds to accelerate the wound healingprocess. We integrate carbopol, hydrogel, and dextran-based oxygennanobubbles (ONBs) to prepare ONB-G where ONBs can hold and releaseoxygen to accelerate wound healing. Oxygen release tests showed thatthe proposed ONB-G could encapsulate oxygen in the hydrogels for upto 34 days; meanwhile, fluorescence studies indicated that the ONB-Gcould maintain high oxygen levels for up to 4 weeks. The effect ofcarbopol concentration on the oxygen release capacity and rheologicalfeatures of the ONB-G were also investigated along with the sterilityof ONB-G. HDFa cell-based studies were first conducted to evaluatethe viability, proliferation, and revival of cells in hypoxia. Scratchassay and mRNA expression studies indicated the potential benefitfor wound closure. Histological evaluation of tissues with a pig modelwith incision and punch wounds showed that treatment with ONB-G exhibitedimproved healing compared with hydrogel without ONBs or treated withoutthe gel. Our studies show that dextran-shell ONBs embedded in a gel(ONB-G) have the potential to accelerate wound healing, given itsoxygen-holding capacity and release properties.

AB  - Aim of study: To investigate the in vitro anthelmintic efficacies of three plants, Annona senegalensis (AS), Cochlospermum planchonii (CP), and Sarcocephalus latifolius (SL), used by livestock farmers in Northern Nigeria, to treat gastrointestinal nematode infections in ruminants.
   Area of study: Makurdi, Benue State, Nigeria.
   Materials and methods: The plants were selected through a structured questionnaire administered to livestock farmers in Northern Nigeria. Aqueous and acetone leaf (AS and SL) and root (CP) extracts of these plants were investigated for their anthelmintic activity against Haemonchus contortus using the egg hatch inhibition assay at concentration levels of 0.3125 to 10 mg/mL in 2.5% dimethyl sulfoxide.
   Main results: A probit log-dose response analysis showed that acetone extract of CP achieved 100% egg hatch inhibition similar to the commercial drug at all tested concentrations after 48 hours of incubation, while AS demonstrated 88.7% egg hatch inhibition. Acetone extract of SL had less than 50% egg hatch inhibition at all tested concentrations. On the other hand, the aqueous extract of CP and SL both exhibited 100% inhibition at 5 and 10 mg/mL of the tested concentrations, while AS had less than 50% egg hatch inhibition at all tested concentrations.
   Research highlights: This study identified CP, AS, and SL as medicinal plants with rich sources of molecules that have potential value in the development of novel anthelmintic drugs.

AB  - Tryptophan can alleviate stress and improve intestinal health, but the precise mechanism has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to examine the effects of tryptophan supplementation on antioxidant status, inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, apoptosis, and pyroptosis signaling pathway in the intestine of piglets after Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Thirty-two weaning piglets were allotted to four treatments including: non-challenged control, LPS-challenged control, LPS + 0.2% tryptophan and LPS + 0.4% tryptophan. On day 35 of feeding, piglets were injected intraperitoneally with 100 mu g/kg of body weight LPS or saline. Among the LPS-challenged pigs, tryptophan supplementation improved intestinal morphology as indicated by greater villus height, villus area and smaller crypt depth, and antioxidant status, and decreased the mRNA expression and concentration of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, tryptophan downregulated the expression of ER stress (ER oxidoreductase-1 alpha, ER oxidoreductase-1 beta, glucose-regulated protein-78, activating transcription factor 6, C/EBP homologous protein), apoptosis (B-cell lymphoma-2, BCL2-associated X protein, caspase 3), and pyroptosis signaling pathway (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3, caspase 1, gasdermin-D, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD). Collectively, tryptophan supplementation can contribute to gut health by improving antioxidant status and alleviating inflammation, ER stress, apoptosis, and pyroptosis in the intestine of piglets after lipopolysaccharide challenge.

AB  - Conceptual gaps and imprecise terms and definitions may obscure the breadth of plant-animal dispersal relationships involved in directed dispersal. The term 'directed' indicates predictable delivery to favourable microsites. However, directed dispersal was initially considered uncommon in diffuse mutualisms (i.e. those involving many species), partly because plants rarely influence post-removal propagule fate without specialized adaptations. This rationale implies that donor plants play an active role in directed dispersal by manipulating vector behaviour after propagule removal. However, even in most classic examples of directed dispersal, participating plants do not influence animal behaviour after propagule removal. Instead, such plants may take advantage of vector attraction to favourable plant microsites, indicating a need to expand upon current interpretations of directed dispersal. We contend that directed dispersal can emerge whenever propagules are disproportionately delivered to favourable microsites as a result of predictably skewed vector behaviour. Thus, we propose distinguishing active and passive forms of directed dispersal. In active directed dispersal, the donor plant achieves disproportionate arrival to favourable microsites by influencing vector behaviour after propagule removal. By contrast, passive directed dispersal occurs when the donor plant takes advantage of vector behaviour to arrive at favourable microsites. Whereas predictable post-removal vector behaviour is dictated by characteristics of the donor plant in active directed dispersal, characteristics of the destination dictate predictable post-removal vector behaviour in passive directed dispersal. Importantly, this passive form of directed dispersal may emerge in more plant-animal dispersal relationships because specialized adaptations in donor plants that influence post-removal vector behaviour are not required. We explore the occurrence and consequences of passive directed dispersal using the unifying generalized gravity model of dispersal. This model successfully describes vectored dispersal by incorporating the influence of the environment (i.e. attractiveness of microsites) on vector movement. When applying gravity models to dispersal, the three components of Newton's gravity equation (i.e. gravitational force, object mass, and distance between centres of mass) become analogous to propagules moving towards a location based on characteristics of the donor plant, the destination, and relocation processes. The generalized gravity model predicts passive directed dispersal in plant-animal dispersal relationships when (i) animal vectors are predictably attracted to specific destinations, (ii) animal vectors disproportionately disperse propagules to those destinations, and (iii) those destinations are also favourable microsites for the dispersed plants. Our literature search produced evidence for these three conditions broadly, and we identified 13 distinct scenarios where passive directed dispersal likely occurs because vector behaviour is predictably skewed towards favourable microsites. We discuss the wide applicability of passive directed dispersal to plant-animal mutualisms and provide new insights into the vulnerability of those mutualisms to global change.

AB  - We previously demonstrated that polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) inhibit the growth of axons in primary rat hippocampal neurons. Here, we test the hypothesis that PBDE effects on axonal morphogenesis are mediated by thyroid hormone and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanisms. Axonal growth and ROS were quantified in primary neuronal-glial co-cultures dissociated from neonatal rat hippocampi exposed to nM concentrations of BDE-47 or BDE-49 in the absence or presence of triiodothyronine (T3; 3-30 nM), N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC; 100 mu M), or alpha-tocopherol (100 mu M). Co-exposure to T3 or either antioxidant prevented inhibition of axonal growth in hippocampal cultures exposed to BDE-47 or BDE-49. T3 supplementation in cultures not exposed to PBDEs did not alter axonal growth. T3 did, however, prevent PBDE-induced ROS generation and alterations in mitochondrial metabolism. Collectively, our data indicate that PBDEs inhibit axonal growth via ROS-dependent mechanisms, and that T3 protects axonal growth by inhibiting PBDE-induced ROS. These observations suggest that co-exposure to endocrine disruptors that decrease TH signaling in the brain may increase vulnerability to the adverse effects of developmental PBDE exposure on axonal morphogenesis.

AB  - The Kisspeptin1 (KISS1)/neurokinin B (NKB)/Dynorphin (Dyn) [KNDy] neurons in the hypothalamus regulate the reproduction stage in human beings and rodents. KNDy neurons co-expressed all KISS1, NKB, and Dyn peptides, and hence commonly regarded as KISS1 neurons. KNDy neurons contribute to the "GnRH pulse generator" and are implicated in the regulation of pulsatile GnRH release. The estradiol (E2)-estrogen receptor (ER) interactions over GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus cause nitric oxide (NO) discharge, in addition to presynaptic GABA and glutamate discharge from respective neurons. The released GABA and glutamate facilitate the activity of GnRH neurons via GABAA-R and AMPA/kainate-R. The KISS1 stimulates MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling and cause the release of Ca2+ from intracellular store, which contribute to neuroendocrine function, increase apoptosis and decrease cell proliferation and metastasis. The ageing in women deteriorates KISS1/KISS1R interaction in the hypothalamus which causes lower levels of GnRH. Because examining the human brain is so challenging, decades of clinical research have failed to find the causes of KNDy/GnRH dysfunction. The KISS1/ KISS1R interactions in the brain have a neuroprotective effect against Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings modulate the pathophysiological role of the KNDy/GnRH neural network in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) associated with ageing and, its protective role in cancer and AD. This review concludes with protecting effect of the steroid-derived acute regulatory enzyme (StAR) against neurotoxicity in the hippocampus, and hypothalamus, and these measures are fundamental for delaying ageing with PCOS. StAR could serve as novel diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for the most prevalent hormone-sensitive breast cancers (BCs).

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of camellia oil on 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)induced atopic dermatitis (AD) in mice, as well as its effect on the expression of skin-barrier-related proteins. A mouse model of AD was created via topical application of DNCB; subsequently, the animals were randomly divided into four groups: the blank control (Control), model (Model), moisturizing cream (Moisturizer), and camellia oil (Camellia) groups. The Camellia group received camellia oil, whereas the Moisturizer group was treated with moisturizing cream, as a positive control. Skin lesions, ear and back tissue morphology, and the serum levels of IgE, IL-4, and IFN-gamma were analyzed. Compared with the Control group, AD mice exhibited erythema, papules, dryness, peeling, and significantly higher serum IgE and IL-4 levels. Compared with the Model group, treatment with camellia oil and moisturizing cream considerably reduced skin inflammation, ear thickness, and scratching frequency. A histopathological analysis revealed that camellia oil reduced inflammatory- cell infiltration and edema in the AD-affected skin. Furthermore, camellia oil upregulated filaggrin (FLG), thus aiding in skin-barrier repair. These findings suggest that camellia oil significantly improves AD symptoms, enhances FLG expression, and restores the damaged skin barrier in AD mouse models.

AB  - In the search for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies, most animal models focus on familial AD, which accounts for a small fraction of cases. The majority of AD cases arise from stress factors, such as oxidative stress, leading to neurological changes (sporadic AD). Early in AD progression, dysfunction in gamma-secretase causes the formation of insoluble A beta(1-42) peptides, which aggregate into senile plaques, triggering neurodegeneration, cognitive decline, and circadian rhythm disturbances. To better model sporadic AD, we used a new AD rat model induced by intracerebroventricular administration of A beta(1-42) oligomers (icvA beta(1-42)) combined with melatonin deficiency via pinealectomy (pin). We validated this model by assessing spatial memory using the radial arm maze test and measuring A beta(1-42) and gamma-secretase levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus with ELISA. The icvA beta(1-42) + pin model experienced impaired spatial memory and increased A beta(1-42) and gamma-secretase levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, effects not seen with either icvA beta(1-42) or the pin alone. Chronic melatonin treatment reversed memory deficits and reduced A beta(1-42) and gamma-secretase levels in both structures. Our findings suggest that our icvA beta(1-42) + pin model is extremely valuable for future AD research.<br />

AB  - Phthalates might trigger immune dysregulation. The relationship between a phthalate mixture exposure and eczema remains unclear. To address this research gap, four statistical models were used to investigate the in-dividual, combined, and interaction relationships between monoesters of phthalates (MPAEs) and eczema, including the logistic regression, weighted quantile sum regression (WQS), quantile g computation (qg-compu-tation), and bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). Moreover, subgroup analyses were performed by sex and age. After adjusting for all covariates, the logistic regression model suggested a positive correlation between mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP) and eczema. Subgroup analysis suggested that the effect of the MPAEs on eczema was predominantly present in men and children. In the WQS model, the joint effect of 11 MPAEs on eczema was marginally significant [odds ratio = 1.36, 95% confidence interval: 0.97-1.90]. Moreover, a positive association was observed between the combined exposure to 11 MPAEs and eczema in the BKMR model. MCPP and mono-(carboxynonyl) phthalate were the most substantial risk factors based on the results of WQS and qg-computation models. The exposure to a mixture of MPAEs may lead to an elevated prevalence of eczema in the United States population, with men and children being particularly vulnerable to their effects.

AB  - Simple Summary Piglet crushing is one of the leading causes of preweaning mortality. This loss represents reduced production efficiency, substantial economic losses for producers, and is an animal welfare concern. The goal of this study was to determine if enrichment ropes would entice neonatal piglets away from the sow and reduce preweaning mortality. Three treatments (OIL: sunflower oil; MC: milky cheese; SC: semiochemical) were applied to the enrichment ropes to increase attractiveness to piglets. Results indicate that neonatal piglets were interested in all enrichment treatments on Day 2 of life, although there was high individual variation in frequency and duration of interactions. Enrichment treatment did not impact the frequency or duration of rope interactions or litter average weight gain. Piglet mortality was impacted by treatment: MC piglets had the lowest percent mortality during the enrichment period, and SC piglets had the lowest percent mortality over the entire experimental period. This proof-of-concept study highlights the value of neonatal piglet environmental enrichment. In the United States swine industry, preweaning mortality represents the highest mortality rate of any production phase, nearly half attributed to crushing. The overarching aim of this study was to determine if enrichment ropes would entice neonatal piglets away from the sow and reduce preweaning mortality. Rope enrichments were provided to 161 piglets from 26 sows after farrowing. Ropes were dipped in sunflower oil (n = 7), semiochemical (n = 8), or milky cheese (n = 11). Piglet purposeful rope investigations, weight gain, and mortality were recorded. On Day 2, 75% of piglets touched the enrichment at least once, and frequency ranged from 1 to 21 investigations across all treatments. Frequency (p = 0.20) and duration (p = 0.21) of investigations were not affected by treatment. Preweaning litter average weight gain did not differ between treatments (p = 0.71). MC (milky cheese) piglets had the lowest percent mortality when the enrichment ropes were present (Days 2 to 5, p = 0.01), and SC (semiochemical) piglets had the lowest percent mortality after the enrichment ropes were removed (Days 6 to weaning, p < 0.0001). This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential value of neonatal piglet environmental enrichment.

AB  - Stromal tissue is an essential componenlt of the ovary not only for providing structural support but also for contributing to the early follicular growth with their bi-directional paracrine signaling. Estradiol is a major female hormone mainly secreted by the follicular cells in the ovary. To examine the relationship between 17 beta-estradiol and the factors involved in androgen production in stromal cells, ovarian stromal cells were cultured in the graded concentrations (50 and 100 ng/mL) of 17 beta-estradiol for varying time periods (24 and 48 h). The cells were processed for transmission electron microscopy to study the changes in steroidogenic functions of the cells. The effect of estradiol treatment was also evaluated on the quantity of androgen production and abundance of steroidogenic enzymes and proteins. The results indicated 17 beta-estradiol increased androgen production in ovarian stromal cells. In addition to enhanced androstenedione and testosterone production, estradiol stimulation was also based on the marked increase in abundance of mRNA transcript of steroidogenic enzymes [Star (Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein), Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, and hsd3b1 (3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)], as well as abundances of StAR and CYP11A1 protein. Thus, 17 beta-estradiol enhanced steroidogenesis in ovarian stromal cells. This study provided a basis for further exploration of regulation of steroidogenesis in ovarian stromal cells and the feedback mechanisms in association with estradiol.

AB  - Simple Summary Neonatal mortality represents a major cause of production loss in camelids, reaching rates higher than 25%; despite the increasing global importance of this species, most of the physiological features of the newborn dromedary camel remain unknown. Tailored reference values for dromedary calves are needed for a more accurate discrimination of healthy and sick animals. This study aimed at investigating the blood gases, acid-base and electrolyte profiles in healthy dromedary calves during the first 3 weeks of age, assessing possible associations with age. A total of 21 healthy dromedary camel calves aged between 1 and 21 days were sampled on the same day, and venous blood was analyzed through a VETSTAT (R) analyzer. Calves were divided in two groups; younger calves aged 1-10 d, and older calves aged 11-21 d. Age was associated with differences in K+, Na+, Cl-, sO(2) and pCO(2) between the two groups. These results suggest an effect of age on some blood parameters, and provide preliminary data regarding the blood gas, acid-base and electrolyte profiles in the healthy dromedary calf during the first 3 weeks of age. The importance of prompt evaluation and care of the newborn is essential for reducing neonatal mortality, which represents a major cause of loss in camelids. This study investigated the blood gases, acid-base and electrolyte profiles in healthy dromedary calves during the first 3 weeks of life, assessing possible associations with age. Twenty-one dromedary camel calves aged 1 to 21 days were sampled, and venous whole blood analyzed through a VETSTAT (R) analyzer. The following parameters were measured: sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), hydrogen ion concentration (pH), partial pressure carbon dioxide (pCO(2)), partial pressure oxygen (pO(2)), total hemoglobin concentration (tHb), hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sO(2)), total carbon dioxide (tCO(2)), bicarbonate (HCO3-), base excess (BE) and anion gap (AG). Calves were divided in two groups; younger calves (1-10 d), and older calves (11-21 d). Statistical analysis showed an effect of age, with lower K+ (p < 0.001) and higher Na+ and Cl- (p < 0.05) mean concentrations in the younger calves compared to the older ones, and higher pCO(2) and lower sO(2) mean concentrations in the older group. These preliminary results firstly described the blood gas, acid-base and electrolyte profiles in the healthy dromedary calf during the first 3 weeks of age, suggesting an effect of age on some parameters.

AB  - Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) presents several potential skin benefits, but its water-soluble nature poses challenges for effectively penetrating the skin to produce its effects. This research aimed to improve GABA's skin penetration and availability by employing a nanoemulsion formulation, both with and without the aid of the penetration enhancer 1,8-cineole. Using a high-pressure homogenizer, an oil-in-water nanoemulsion was created, and its size and distribution were analyzed. The stability of these nanoemulsions was tested under various conditions, revealing their resilience over six months, even at elevated temperatures of 40 degrees C. In vitro tests on pig skin showed that GABA-loaded nanoemulsions, particularly those without the enhancer, demonstrated a nearly 2.89-fold increase in skin permeation compared to the solution form. Moreover, the addition of the enhancer amplified this effect, resulting in over a 3.37-fold increase in skin permeation compared to the solution. These results emphasize the potential of nanoemulsion formulations as effective tools for enhancing GABA's skin permeation and availability, potentially expanding its use in dermatological applications. Further exploration and research are necessary to fully exploit GABA's capabilities in supporting skin health and wellness.

AB  - Malaria and dengue are diseases transmitted by mosquitoes of the genera Anopheles and Aedes resistant to commercial insecticides, which are toxic to non-target animals. Alternatively, eco-friendly strategies have focused on searching for essential oil (EO) from plants to control these mosquitoes. In this aspect, this study was carried out to investigate the toxicity of the EO from Tetradenia riparia and its main constituent against Anopheles and Aedes larvae and non-target animals Toxorhynchites haemorrhoidalis and Gambusia affinis. The mechanism of the larvicidal action of the EO and its main compound was investigated by the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. The EO from T. riparia was extracted by hydrodistillation with yield of 1.4 +/- 0.17%. The analysis of the EO by GC-MS and GC-FID revealed fenchone (38.62%) as the main compound. The EO (100 ppm) showed larvicidal activity against Anopheles and Aedes larvae (91 to 100% of mortality) (LC50 from 29.31 to 40.76 ppm). On the other hand, fenchone (10 ppm) showed more activity (89 to 100% of mortality) (LC50 from 5.93 to 7.00 ppm) than the EO. The EO and fenchone caused the inhibition of AChE (IC50 from 1.93 to 2.65 ppm), suggesting the inhibition of this enzyme as a possible mechanism of larvicidal action. Regarding toxicity, the EO (1000 ppm) and fenchone (100 ppm) showed low toxicity against T. haemorrhoidalis and G. affinis (9 to 74% of mortality) (LC50 from 170.50 to 924.89 ppm) (SI/PSF from 17.99 to 31.91) than the alpha-cypermethrin (0.52 ppm) which was extremally toxic against these non-target animals (100% of mortality, LC50 from 0.22 to 0.29 ppm). This sig-nificant larvicidal activity of the T. riparia EO and its main constituent, along with the low toxicity towards non -target organisms indicate these samples as a possible eco-friendly alternative for the control of malaria and dengue vectors.

KW  - CANCER
AB  - Evidence from animal and human research suggests that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a prevalent persistent organic pollutant (POP), exerts neurotoxic effects, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Additionally, the function of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a crucial modulator of cellular metabolism, redox balance, and survival, in PFOS-induced neurotoxicity has not been fully elucidated. In vitro metabolomics studies revealed that PFOS elevated the intracellular concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lowered the levels of reduced L-glutathione (GSH). Significant alterations in the mRNA and protein expression levels of ferroptosis-related biomarkers, including ferroptosis-related genes [NRF2, nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), KEAP1, xCT/SLC7A11, GPX4, and FTH1], cellular iron, and lipid peroxidation were observed. Moreover, erastin (Ers) exacerbated lipid peroxidation, which was alleviated by ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and Nacetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). In mice, PFOS exposure damaged the structure and function of the hippocampus, including decreasing the number of neurons and impairing spatial learning and memory capacity. Importantly, ferroptosis was also observed in vivo, concomitant with the inhibition of ATF4, which was also observed in vitro. ATF4 silencing further increased ROS levels, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis induced by PFOS, whereas NAC and Fer-1 abrogated the effects of ATF4 silencing. Treatment with E235, an ATF4 activator, alleviated PFOSinduced ferroptosis. In conclusion, this study revealed that ATF4-mediated ferroptosis is involved in PFOSinduced neurotoxicity, offering novel mechanistic insights into the neurotoxic effects of PFOS and potentially paving the way for new therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Inhibitory associative learning counters the effects of excitatory learning, whether appetitively or aversively motivated. Moreover, the affective responses accompanying the inhibitory associations are of opponent valence to the excitatory conditioned responses. Inhibitors for negative aversive outcomes (e.g. shock) signal safety, while inhibitors for appetitive outcomes (e.g. food reward) elicit frustration and/or disappointment. This raises the question as to whether studies using appetitive and aversive conditioning procedures should demonstrate the same neural substrates for inhibitory learning. We review the neural substrates of appetitive and aversive inhibitory learning as measured in different procedural variants and in the context of the underpinning excitatory conditioning on which it depends. The mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathways, retrosplenial cortex and hippo -campus are consistently implicated in inhibitory learning. Further neural substrates identified in some proce-dural variants may be related to the specific motivation of the learning task and modalities of the learning cues. Finally, we consider the translational implications of our understanding of the neural substrates of inhibitory learning, for obesity and addictions as well as for anxiety disorders.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) plays a significant role in regulating hippocampal function, particularly in modulating synaptic plasticity. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in neuroplasticity-related signaling influenced by DA remains incomplete. This study aimed to elucidate the changes in the expression of key molecules related to hippocampal neuroplasticity following DA depletion in rats. To induce DA depletion, unilateral striatal infusions of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) were administered to adult Sprague-Dawley rats. The subsequent loss of nigrostriatal DAergic signaling in these 6-OHDA-lesioned rats was confirmed using an apomorphine-induced rotation test at 4 weeks post-infusion and by assessing the expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) through immunohistochemistry and western blotting at 7 weeks post-infusion. A decrease in DAergic signaling, evidenced by reduced TH-positive immunoreactivity, was also noted in the ipsilateral hippocampus of the lesioned rats. Interestingly, 6-OHDA infusion led to increased phosphorylation of pivotal hippocampal plasticity-related proteins, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta), and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), in the ipsilateral hippocampus 7 weeks following the infusion. To extend these findings, in vitro experiments were conducted on primary hippocampal neurons exposed to DA and/or the active D1/D2 DA receptor antagonist, flupentixol (Flux). DA inhibited the constitutive phosphorylation of ERK, Akt, GSK3, and CREB, while Flux restored these phosphorylation levels. Taken together, these findings indicate that DA depletion triggers an increase in plasticity-related signaling in the hippocampus, suggesting a possible compensatory mechanism that promotes activity-independent neuroplasticity following DA depletion.

AB  - Characterization of air pollution assessment methodologies in rhinologic disease research is lacking. A scoping review was thus conducted to survey exposure methods in studies examining common rhinologic conditions: allergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Several medical databases were queried for variables relating to (1) adults with a diagnosis of CRS or AR and (2) air pollution exposure. Data was extracted for pollutants assessed, method of quantifying exposure, assessment of residential stability, inclusion of authors with expertise in environmental exposure assessment, and disease-related outcomes. Thirty-four articles were included for analysis - 16 for AR and 18 for CRS. Fifteen studies originated from East Asia, 10 from North America, and 6 from Europe. The most common pollutant studied was PM2.5 (28 studies), with most studies investigating multiple pollutants. Twenty-one studies used a nearby air monitor to quantify exposure, 9 studies reported whether subjects had residential stability for the period assessed, and 17 studies included authors with climate science background. Timeframes included both acute and chronic exposure. Current methods to quantify air pollution exposure in rhinology vary considerably and inconsistently employ expertise from environmental scientists. Future investigations may benefit from multidisciplinary collaboration, reporting of residential stability, and standardized reporting metrics.

AB  - In the adult brain, new neurons are constitutively derived from postnatal neural stem cells/progenitors located in two neurogenic regions: the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles (migrating and differentiating into different subtypes of the inhibitory interneurons of the olfactory bulbs), and the subgranular layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Cyclin D2 knockout (cD2-KO) mice exhibit reduced numbers of new hippocampal neurons; however, the proliferation deficiency and the dysregulation of adult neurogenesis in the SVZ required further investigation. In this report, we characterized the differentiation potential of each subpopulation of the SVZ neural precursors in cD2-KO mice. The number of newly generated cells in the SVZs was significantly decreased in cD2-KO mice compared to wild type mice (WT), and was not accompanied by elevated levels of apoptosis. Although the number of B1-type quiescent precursors (B1q) and the overall B1-type activated precursors (B1a) were not affected in the SVZ neurogenic niche, the number of transit-amplifying progenitors (TaPs) was significantly reduced. Additionally, the subpopulations of calbindin D28k and calretinin interneurons were diminished in the olfactory bulbs of cD2-KO mice. Our results suggest that cyclin D2 might be critical for the proliferation of neural precursors and progenitors in the SVZ-the transition of B1a into TaPs and, thereafter, the production of newly generated interneurons in the olfactory bulbs. Untangling regulators that functionally modulate adult neurogenesis provides a basis for the development of regenerative therapies for injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Hippo signaling restricts tumor growth by inhibiting the oncogenic potential of YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcriptional complex. Here, we uncover a context-dependent tumor suppressor function of YAP in androgen receptor (AR) positive prostate cancer (PCa) and show that YAP impedes AR(+) PCa growth by antagonizing TEAD-mediated AR signaling. TEAD forms a complex with AR to enhance its promoter/enhancer occupancy and transcriptional activity. YAP and AR compete for TEAD binding and consequently, elevated YAP in the nucleus disrupts AR-TEAD interaction and prevents TEAD from promoting AR signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of MST1/2 or LATS1/2, or transgenic activation of YAP suppressed the growth of PCa expressing therapy resistant AR splicing variants. Our study uncovers an unanticipated crosstalk between Hippo and AR signaling pathways, reveals an antagonistic relationship between YAP and TEAD in AR(+) PCa, and suggests that targeting the Hippo signaling pathway may provide a therapeutical opportunity to treat PCa driven by therapy resistant AR variants.

AB  - The lower specific capacitance of biochar electrode material limits its practical application. Therefore, this study attempts to develop a novel supercapacitor biochar electrode material with high specific capacitance from waste camellia oleifera shell (COS). COS shell powder was pre-impregnated with phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin then carbonization-KOH activation. An orthogonal experiment (L9(33)) was designed to explore the influence of mass mixing ratio of PF/COS, activation time, and temperature on the electrochemical property of COS-based biochar. The optimal process parameters were: 800 degrees C, 1 h and mass mixing ratio of 5:1. Compared with c. oleifera shellactivated carbon (COS-AC) and phenol-formaldehyde-activated carbon (PF-AC) controls, the phenolformaldehyde modified c. oleifera shell-activated carbon (PMC-AC) exhibited micro-morphology of carbon microspheres and a three-dimensional network pore. The internal orientation of PMC-AC tended to be disordered, and had a superior specific surface area of 3037.68 m2 g1 and total pore volume of 1.7 cm3 g1. Electrochemical tests used PMC-AC as the negative electrode, with high specific capacitance (375.9 F g � 1 at 0.5 A g � 1), good rate property (49.3 % of capacitance retention at 0.5-10 A g � 1), and charging/discharging stability. It is supposed that it was a convenient and feasible way to modify biochar into high-quality hard carbon for supercapacitors.

AB  - The synthesis of nitrogen-doped Graphene Quantum Dots (N-GQDs) employing Pennisetum purpureum (elephant grass) as the carbon precursor and ethylenediamine (EDA) as the nitrogen source was conducted. This study highlights the potential applications of nitrogen-doped multi-fluorescent graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) in the detection of Fe3+. The synthesized N-GQDs have been studied using UV-vis spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectrometry, Raman spectrometry, FT-IR spectrometry, x-ray spectroscopy, selected-area electron diffraction, transmission and high-transmission electron microscopy. The acquired N-GQDs were observed to have an almost hexagonal shape with a lateral size of 2.42 nm and exhibited a comparable quantum yield of approximately 26%. The N-GQDs that have been prepared with consistent size distribution and a significant amount of nitrogen and oxygen-based functional groups showcase outstanding water dispersity. The N-GQDs exhibited the capability to identify the Fe3+ ions in a broad range concentration of 1-600 & mu;M by creating an N-GQDs-Fe3+ complex through the occurrence of functional groups like nitrogen, carbonyl, and carboxyl on N-GQDs surface, has a lower limit of detection at approximately 60 nM. Our study provides evidence that the N-GQDs produced a strong and persistent fluorescence, which is highly soluble in water, notably the precise and selective detection of Fe3+ in water-based solutions.

AB  - The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, is a polyphagous pest threatening many economically important crops worldwide. Until recently, synthetic pyrethroids remain in wide use for controlling pest insects including the cotton bollworm. Understanding the metabolic mechanism of pyrethroids in a given pest can provide significant implication for a smart choice of insecticides, and such information is useful for the development of novel selective and safe insecticides. In this study, we used complexes of recombinant H. armigera cytochrome P450 CYP9A and NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase to investigate the capacity of three CYP9A paralogs in the transformation of seven structurally different pyrethroids by metabolism assays. The results showed that the three paralogous CYP9As were able to metabolize multiple pyrethroids. Interestingly, all the three CYP9As transformed pyrethrin-resembling pyrethroids (e.g. bioallethrin) more efficiently than the heavily modified ones (e.g. bifenthrin). These findings suggest that herbivorous insects can cope with synthetic insecticides using their physiological systems that initially evolved to survive exposure to the defensive chemicals in their host plants, adding support to the pre-adaptation hypothesis.

AB  - Copper (Cu) exists in two oxidation states Cu+I and Cu+II yielding formation of enzymes involved in biological processes. In higher concentrations, by oxidative process and ROS production, Cu is toxic towards plants, humans and animals livers as observed in Wilson disease or sheep scrapie. Fighting according to the Fenton reaction against bacteria and viruses, has been proposed as a mean of combatting nosocomial diseases and complementary to COVID19 vaccination. In humans, Cu is stocked in liver, muscle or bound to brain protein as ss-APP, tau-protein, alpha-synuclein, ubiquitin or prion which present antioxidant properties when Cu-bonded. In abnormal ss-sheet conformation, they can trigger neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer(AD), Parkinson(PD) and ALS. In these diseases, blood copper increase correlated with brain copper decrease has been described. In AD, abnormal D-serine has been detected in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. D-glutamate and D-alanine blood levels have been found in AD and could also be controlled with Cu and ceruloplasmin in a possible disease screening test. This abnormal D-conformation might result from epimerization of physiologically L-conformation brain peptides into protease-resistant D-enantiomers. This has previously been experimentally demonstrated for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy in a free Cu reductive medium with UV-induced free radicals. The Cu brain protective effect against free radicals was restored with cupric addition in oxidizing medium. Cupric supplementation in the brain, might restore Cu protection and slow down neurodegenerative processes. To lower side effects, Cu amino-acid complexes able to cross the blood brain barrier might be suggested for a Cu transfer to the brain.

AB  - Objective. The study aimed to examine the impact of melatonin on mitigating brain inflammation and cough sensitivity resulting from exposure to particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). Methods. Guinea pigs were randomly assigned to the blank control group, normal saline group, PM2.5 exposure group, and PM2.5 exposure + melatonin group. The PM2.5 exposure and PM2.5 exposure + melatonin groups were given intranasal instillations of PM2.5 suspension twice daily for 28 consecutive days. Starting on day 21, the PM2.5 exposure + melatonin group was treated with an intraperitoneal injection of melatonin at 10 pm. Cough sensitivity to citric acid, microglia activation, IL-1(3 and TNF-alpha levels in the airway and dorsal vagal complex (DVC), and ultrastructural changes in neurons within the DVC were assessed. Results. The PM2.5 exposure group exhibited a significantly higher cough count to citric acid challenge (29.1 +/- 5.7 coughs) compared with the PM2.5 exposure + melatonin group (18.8 +/- 4.1 coughs), normal saline group (8.4 +/- 2.1 coughs), and blank control group (7.7 +/- 1.8 coughs). In addition, cough latency was shorter in the PM2.5 exposure group (26.9 +/- 6.5 seconds) than in the PM2.5 exposure + melatonin group (36.6 +/- 12.4 seconds), normal saline group (43.4 +/- 14.7 seconds), and blank control group (47.0 +/- 13.0 seconds). The PM2.5 exposure + melatonin group showed significantly reduced IL-1(3 (105.3 +/- 14.3 pg/ml) and TNF-alpha levels (113.0 +/- 23.5 pg/ml) in the DVC, as well as in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (IL-1(3: 24.92 +/- 5.14 pg/ml, TNF-alpha: 12.72 +/- 3.99 pg/ml) compared with the PM2.5 exposure group (in the DVC: IL-1(3: 132.7 +/- 17.6 pg/ml, TNF-alpha: 143.8 +/- 30.4 pg/ml; in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid: IL-1(3: 34.0 +/- 5.3 pg/ml; TNF-alpha: 15.8 +/- 0.8 pg/ml). Microglia in the DVC were less activated in the PM2.5 exposure + melatonin group (25.1 +/- 5.4) than in the PM2.5 exposure group (54.6 +/- 9.9). Furthermore, the PM2.5 exposure group exhibited an impaired blood-brain barrier in the DVC, which tended to alleviate the PM2.5 exposure + melatonin group. Conclusions. Exposure to PM2.5 induces airway inflammation, central facilitation, and heightened cough sensitivity in guinea pigs. Melatonin significantly inhibits microglia activation and reduces airway and DVC inflammation, which might contribute to attenuated cough hypersensitivity.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive dementia, and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has been defined as a transitional stage between normal aging and AD. Accumulating evidence has shown that altered functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) in the default mode network (DMN) is the prominent hallmarks of AD. However, the relationship between the changes in SC and FC of the DMN is not yet clear. In the present study, we derived the FC and SC matrices of the DMN with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data and further assessed FC and SC abnormalities within a discovery dataset of 120 participants (39 normal controls, 34 patients with aMCI and 47 patients with AD), as well as a replication dataset of 122 participants (43 normal controls, 37 patients with aMCI and 42 patients with AD). Disrupted SC and FC were found among DMN components (e.g., the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and hippocampus) in patients in the aMCI and AD groups in the discovery dataset; most of the disrupted connections were also identified in the replication dataset. More importantly, some SC and FC elements were significantly correlated with the cognitive ability of patients with aMCI and AD. In addition, we found structural-functional decoupling between the PCC and the right hippocampus in patients in the aMCI and AD groups. These findings of the alteration of DMN connectivity in neurodegenerative cohorts deepen our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD.

AB  - In recent years, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and its analogs, including taltirelin (TAL), have demonstrated a range of effects on the central nervous system that represent potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of various neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms of their actions remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated phosphosignaling dynamics in pituitary GH1 cells affected by TRH and TAL and the putative role of beta-arresting in mediating these effects. Our results revealed widespread alterations in many phosphosignaling pathways involving signal transduction via small GTPases, MAP kinases, Ser/Thr- and Tyr-protein kinases, Wnt/beta-catenin, and members of the Hippo pathway. The differential TRH- or TAL-induced phosphorylation of numerous proteins suggests that these ligands exhibit some degree of biased agonism at the TRH receptor. The different phosphorylation patterns induced by TRH or TAL in beta-arresting-deficient cells suggest that the beta-arresting scaffold is a key factor determining phosphorylation events after TRH receptor activation. Our results suggest that compounds that modulate kinase and phosphatase activity can be considered as additional adjuvants to enhance the potential therapeutic value of TRH or TAL.

AB  - Simple Summary The difficulty of treating bacterial infections has become a worldwide health concern due to the evolution of bacterial antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics are routinely used to prevent and treat infections in food-producing animals, especially in young animals. This procedure may lead to resistant bacteria in the animal gut that may indirectly cause a broader public health issue. Therefore, we conducted a study in a pig farrow-to-finish operation during five months to understand how the administration of antibiotics in sows and piglets impact the emergence of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli and its maintenance in the gut until the slaughter weight is reached. Our results showed that sows and their piglets carried antibiotic resistant E. coli throughout their life cycle that can be associated to farm administration of antibiotics. These antibiotics are critical in human medicine, which includes the antibiotic colistin used as a last-resort therapy in some multidrug resistant bacteria in human infections. In addition, these bacteria demonstrated the presence of virulence genes that support pathogenesis. Overall, this study highlights the need to reduce antibiotic use in animal husbandry or to find alternatives to antibiotics in food-animal production to reduce the emergence and potential spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Cephalosporins and polymyxins are employed in antimicrobial protocols to control and treat neonatal infections and post-weaning diarrhoea in swine operations. We conducted a longitudinal study to evaluate the colonization and transmission of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli in sows and their piglets in a farrow-to-finish operation, focusing on characterization of Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) and mcr genes, virulence traits and genetic relatedness. A total of 293 E. coli isolates were obtained from faecal samples collected in five time points. At birth bla(CTX-M-1group) cluster was detected in E. coli isolates from 9 sows and 49 piglets (73.41%), while in the following four' piglets sampling moments it was detected in 91.8%, 57.6%, 71.4% and 97.4%. The gene mcr-1 was detected in E. coli from one sow and from three piglets from different litters at birth and increased in the first weeks of piglet life (68.85%, 100%, 90% and 8.1%). A new mcr-4 allele, mcr-4.7, was identified in 3.28%, 28.57%, 7.5% of E. coli isolates. Most mcr-positive E. coli isolates (96,7%) carried bla(CTX-M-1Group) genes and 93,33% carried both mcr-4 and mcr-1. CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-32 were the most predominant ESBLs. Plasmids belonged to IncI1, IncF and IncN groups. Most isolates belong to phylogenetic group B1; PAI IV536 marker was detected in nine isolates. The strains were kept in the different stages of the piglets' life. The use of ceftiofur and colistin may explain the high prevalence and co-selection of bla(CTX-M-1Group) and mcr-1 and/or -4 genes, contributing to the maintenance of resistant and virulent isolates throughout the pig life cycle that may reach the food chain.

AB  - In regions of China experiencing severe cold, the duration of the winter heating season significantly contributes to elevated heating energy consumption in rural dwellings. This study focuses on typical brick-and-concrete rural homes in the Wusu area. Utilizing the Rhino-Grasshopper parametric modeling platform, it aims to minimize heating-related carbon emissions and the overall costs associated with retrofitting. The approach involves improving the insulation properties of the building envelope to reduce energy requirements. Additionally, the study incorporates solar photovoltaic systems atop rural homes, building upon low-carbon, passive, energy-efficient design principles. By examining the influence of various factors on rural housing energy consumption, the research employs the entropy weight method to identify the most effective design solutions. The goal is to explore strategies for the energy-efficient retrofitting of rural dwellings in areas faced with harsh winter conditions, aligning with the objectives and preferences of Applied Sciences. The simulation results reveal the following: (1). In comparison with the baseline scenario, 42.2% of the optimized solutions within the Pareto frontier satisfy the current standards for 75% energy savings in energy-efficient residential design. (2). The lowest recorded thermal consumption index for the buildings can reach 12.427 W/m(2), at which point the rate of energy savings is elevated to 79.5%. (3). Within the solutions identified by the Pareto frontier, 80% exhibit initial investments that are lower than the cost savings over the lifecycle due to reduced energy consumption (dC(g) < 0), demonstrating the economic feasibility of the proposed retrofitting strategies.

AB  - An operative olfactory bulb (OB) is critical to social recognition memory (SRM) in rodents, which involves identifying conspecifics. Furthermore, OB also allocates synaptic plasticity events related to olfactory memories in their intricate neural circuit. Here, we asked whether the OB is a target for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a well-known mediator of plasticity and memory. Adult ICR-CD1 male mice had their SRM evaluated under the inhibition of BDNF-dependent signaling directly in the OB. We also quantified the expression of BDNF in the OB, after SRM acquisition. Our results presented an amnesic effect of anti-BDNF administered 12 h posttraining. Although the western blot showed no statistical difference in pro-BDNF and BDNF expression, the analysis of fluorescence intensity in slices suggests SRM acquisition decreases BDNF in the granular cell layer of the OB. Next, to test the ability of BDNF to rescue SRM deficit, we administered the human recombinant BDNF (rBDNF) directly in the OB of socially isolated (SI) mice. Unexpectedly, rBDNF did not rescue SRM in SI mice. Furthermore, BDNF and pro-BDNF expression in the OB was unchanged by SI. Our study reinforces the OB as a plasticity locus in memory-related events. It also adds SRM as another type of memory sensitive to BDNFdependent signaling.

AB  - Elektrocateres rappsilberi gen. et sp. nov. is described from Bitterfeld or Saxonian amber. It is the first representative of the superfamily Cleroidea (Coleoptera) recorded in this amber, from which only 10 families of beetles were known until now. The new genus and species was studied using classical stereomicroscopy, as well as digital microscopy and synchrotron-radiation-based micro-computed tomography. The fossil is related to the rare extant monotypic genera Trichocateres Kolibac, 2010 and Carinicateres Kolibac, 2021 from tropical forests of Southeastern Asia. It is assumed that Elektrocateres rappsilberi gen. et sp. nov. would be predatory, hunting other arthropods on tree branches and trunks; however, its mouthparts are probably still on halfway between herbivory or fungivory and predatory.

AB  - Soybean is frequently attacked by herbivorous pests throughout the growth period. Exploring anti-insect genes to improve insect resistance in soybean is an important soybean breeding goal. Here, we cloned and characterized the gene for a quantitative trait locus (QTL) related to insect resistance, Glyma.06g189600, which encodes CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE17 (GmCDPK17) in soybean. The pairwise sequence alignment analysis revealed that the presumed protein of GmCDPK17 shares 52.06% similarity with that of GmCDPK38, a known negative regulatory gene of insect resistance in soybean. Ectopic expression of GmCDPK17 and GmCDPK38 restored the phenotypes of the Arabidopsis insect-susceptible mutant cpk10 and insect-resistant mutant cpk28, respectively. Moreover, transgenic hairy roots of the soybean cultivar Jack were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Overexpression of GmCDPK17 increased soybean hairy root resistance to common cutworm (CCW), while RNA interference of the gene decreased soybean hairy root resistance to CCW. Sequencing data from the cultivated and wild soybeans were used to analyze the genetic diversity of GmCDPK17. This gene was subjected to domestication selection. Six and seven haplotypes (Haps) were identified in cultivated and wild soybeans, respectively. The resistance Hap1 is not widely used in cultivated soybeans and is mainly distributed at low latitudes. Accessions with resistance haplotypes of the GmCDPK17 and GmCDPK38 genes showed high resistance to CCW. Altogether, we revealed a novel positive regulatory insect resistance gene, GmCDPK17, which may further improve insect resistance in soybean.

AB  - Aberrant neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampus (HIP) contributes to schizophrenia pathogenesis. Haloperidol (HAL) and olanzapine (OLA), commonly prescribed antipsychotics for schizophrenia treatment, affect neurogenesis too. The effect of HAL and OLA on an mHippoE-2 cell line was studied in vitro where we measured the cell number and projection length. In vivo, we studied the gene expression of DCX, Sox2, BDNF, and NeuN in the SVZ and HIP in an MK-801-induced animal schizophrenia model. Cells were incubated with HAL, OLA, and MK-801 for 24, 48, and 72 h. Animals were injected for 6 days with saline or MK801 (0.5 mg/kg), and from the 7th day with either vehicle HAL (1 mg/kg) or OLA (2 mg/kg), for the next 7 days. In vitro, HAL and OLA dose/time-dependently suppressed cells' proliferation and shortened their projection length. HAL/OLA co-treatment with MK-801 for 24 h reversed HAL's/OLA's inhibitory effect. In vivo, HAL and OLA suppressed DCX and NeuN genes' expression in the HIP and SVZ. MK-801 decreased DCX and NeuN genes' expression in the HIP and OLA prevented this effect. The data suggest that subchronic HAL/OLA treatment can inhibit DCX and NeuN expression. In an MK-801 schizophrenia model, OLA reversed the MK-801 inhibitory effect on DCX and NeuN and HAL reversed the effect on DCX expression; however, only in the HIP.

AB  - Chronic neurodegenerative diseases are typically associated with oxidative stress conditions leading to neuronal cell death. We aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of three pyranocoumarins (decursin, decursinol angelate, and decursinol) targeting oxidative stress factors. Decursin (also known as dehydro-8-prenylnaringenin) is a prenylated coumarin compound consisting of a coumarin ring system with a prenyl group attached to one of the carbons in the ring. As a secondary metabolite of plants, pyranocoumarin decursin from Angelica gigas Nakai presented protective effects against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in HT22, a murine hippocampal neuronal cell line. Decursinol (DOH) is a metabolite of decursin, sharing same coumarin ring system but a slightly different chemical structure with the prenyl group replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). In our findings, DOH was ineffective while decursin was, suggesting that this prenyl structure may be important for compound absorption and neuroprotection. By diminishing the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species as well as stimulating the expression of HO-1, decursin triggers the self-protection system in neuronal cells. Additionally, decursin also revealed an anti-apoptotic effect by inhibiting chromatin condensation and reducing the forming of annexin-V-positive cells.

AB  - Memories initially formed in hippocampus gradually stabilize to cortex over weeks-to-months for long-term storage. The mechanistic details of this brain re-organization remain poorly understood. We recorded bulk neural activity in circuits that link hippocampus and cortex as mice performed a memory-guided virtual -re-ality task over weeks. We identified a prominent and sustained neural correlate of memory in anterior thal-amus, whose inhibition substantially disrupted memory consolidation. More strikingly, gain amplification enhanced consolidation of otherwise unconsolidated memories. To gain mechanistic insights, we developed a technology for simultaneous cellular-resolution imaging of hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex throughout consolidation. We found that whereas hippocampus equally encodes multiple memories, the anteromedial thalamus preferentially encodes salient memories, and gradually increases correlations with cortex to facil-itate tuning and synchronization of cortical ensembles. We thus identify a thalamo-cortical circuit that gates memory consolidation and propose a mechanism suitable for the selection and stabilization of hippocampal memories into longer-term cortical storage.

AB  - A generic, low-cost and fully automated roadkill prevention system (RPS) using lasers was developed. The RPS is designed as a real-time system that adapts to all weather conditions, that can detect and categorize road crossing animals based on their heights and display distinguish-able (category based) warning light signals for approaching vehicles. The system can also send animal category-specific short message service (SMS) to preserved mobile numbers for detection data base (DDB) generation and take necessary counteraction by the forest officials. The RPS prototype was installed in Velamundi Reserve Forest in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve on the Sathyamangalam-Mettupalayam state highway in 2019 and its performance has been closely monitored since then. At present, the RPS is the only functioning system of its kind in India or else-where and has registered a 60% dip in roadkill at the project site since its installation. The complete details like architecture, operational algorithm, implementation and performance analysis of the RPS system over a year is presented. Once available in the literature with complete details, the RPS is expected to be replicated in other parts of the world, wherever roadkill is a growing threat to the existing biodiversity.

AB  - Interactions between living cells and nanoparticles are extensively studied to enhance the delivery of therapeutics. Nanoparticles size, shape, stiffness, and surface charge are regarded as the main features able to control the fate of cell-nanoparticle interactions. However, the clinical translation of nanotherapies has so far been limited, and there is a need to better understand the biology of cell-nanoparticle interactions. This study investigates the role of cellular mechanosensitive components in cell-nanoparticle interactions. It is demonstrated that the genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of yes-associated protein (YAP), a key component of cancer cell mechanosensing apparatus and Hippo pathway effector, improves nanoparticle internalization in triple-negative breast cancer cells regardless of nanoparticle properties or substrate characteristics. This process occurs through YAP-dependent regulation of endocytic pathways, cell mechanics, and membrane organization. Hence, the study proposes targeting YAP may sensitize triple-negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy and increase the selectivity of nanotherapy.
   The inhibition of Yeas-associated protein (YAP) in TNBC cells affects the organization of plasma membrane, reduces the extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, impacts their adhesion ability, and increases the endocytosis rate. Thus, targeting cell mechanobiology may be leveraged to optimize cell-nanoparticle interactions. Ultimately, these changes contribute cooperatively to promote the delivery of nanomedicines to cancer cells and improve the therapeutic efficiency.image

AB  - The AMPA glutamate receptor (AMPAR) is the major type of synaptic excitatory ionotropic receptor in the brain. AMPARs have four different subunits, GluA1-4 (each encoded by different genes, Gria1, Gria2, Gria3 and Gria4), that can form distinct tetrameric assemblies. The most abundant AMPAR subtypes in the hippocampus are GluA1/2 and GluA2/3 heterotetramers. Each subtype contributes differentially to mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, which may be in part caused by how these receptors are regulated by specific associated proteins. A broad range of AMPAR interacting proteins have been identified, including the well-studied transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins TARP-gamma 2 (also known as Stargazin) and TARP-gamma 8, Cornichon homolog 2 (CNIH-2) and many others. Several interactors were shown to affect biogenesis, AMPAR trafficking, and channel properties, alone or in distinct assemblies, and several revealed preferred binding to specific AMPAR subunits. To date, a systematic specific interactome analysis of the major GluA1/2 and GluA2/3 AMPAR subtypes separately is lacking. To reveal interactors belonging to specific AMPAR subcomplexes, we performed both expression and interaction proteomics on hippocampi of wildtype and Gria1- or Gria3 knock-out mice. Whereas GluA1/2 receptors co-purified TARP-gamma 8, synapse differentiation-induced protein 4 (SynDIG4, also known as Prrt1) and CNIH-2 with highest abundances, GluA2/3 receptors revealed strongest co-purification of CNIH-2, TARP-gamma 2, and Noelin1 (or Olfactomedin-1). Further analysis revealed that TARP-gamma 8-SynDIG4 interact directly and co-assemble into an AMPAR subcomplex especially at synaptic sites. Together, these data provide a framework for further functional analysis into AMPAR subtype specific pathways in health and disease.

AB  - Lay Summary Invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (IFRS) may infect people with diabetes, cancer, or COVID-19. In this study, various types of fungi were identified from COVID-19-associated-IFRS, encouraging physicians to consider specific treatments.
   Since COVID-19 spread worldwide, invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (IFRS) has emerged in immunocompromised patients as a new clinical challenge. In this study, clinical specimens of 89 COVID-19 patients who presented clinical and radiological evidence suggestive of IFRS were examined by direct microscopy, histopathology, and culture, and the isolated colonies were identified through DNA sequence analysis. Fungal elements were microscopically observed in 84.27% of the patients. Males (53.9%) and patients over 40 (95.5%) were more commonly affected than others. Headache (94.4%) and retro-orbital pain (87.6%) were the most common symptoms, followed by ptosis/proptosis/eyelid swelling (52.8%), and 74 patients underwent surgery and debridement. The most common predisposing factors were steroid therapy (n = 83, 93.3%), diabetes mellitus (n = 63, 70.8%), and hypertension (n = 42, 47.2%). The culture was positive for 60.67% of the confirmed cases, and Mucorales were the most prevalent (48.14%) causative fungal agents. Different species of Aspergillus (29.63%) and Fusarium (3.7%) and a mix of two filamentous fungi (16.67%) were other causative agents. For 21 patients, no growth was seen in culture despite a positive result on microscopic examinations. In PCR-sequencing of 53 isolates, divergent fungal taxons, including 8 genera and 17 species, were identified as followed: Rhizopus oryzae (n = 22), Aspergillus flavus (n = 10), A. fumigatus (n = 4), A. niger (n = 3), R. microsporus (n = 2), Mucor circinelloides, Lichtheimia ramosa, Apophysomyces variabilis, A. tubingensis, A. alliaceus, A. nidulans, A. calidoustus, Fusarium fujikuroi/proliferatum, F. oxysporum, F. solani, Lomentospora prolificans, and Candida albicans (each n = 1). In conclusion, a diverse set of species involved in COVID-19-associated IFRS was observed in this study. Our data encourage specialist physicians to consider the possibility of involving various species in IFRS in immunocompromised and COVID-19 patients. In light of utilizing molecular identification approaches, the current knowledge of microbial epidemiology of invasive fungal infections, especially IFRS, may change dramatically.

AB  - The cerebellum is thought to fine-tune movement without being required for its production. However, this textbook view derives mainly from studies of mammalian species with highly developed cerebral cortices. Here, we examined cerebellar function in the elephant-nose fish, a member of a family of African weakly electric fish (Mormyridae) in which the cerebellum is massively enlarged, covering the entire dorsal surface of the brain.1-5 Although the microcircuitry and anatomical connections of the mormyrid "gigantocerebellum" have been well characterized, its function(s) remains unknown.6-11 The elephant-nose fish is named for a flexible facial appendage, the schnauzenorgan (SO), used to probe surfaces and extract prey from substrate.8,12 Here, we provide evidence from microstimulation, electrophysiological recordings, and lesions for a direct and essential role for the C1 region of the mormyrid cerebellum in the production of SO movement. These findings indicate that the cerebellum may be capable of performing a wider range of functions than previously thought, including roles typically ascribed to the forebrain, and emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on the functional specialization of brain regions.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignant tumor in women worldwide, and its recurrence and metastasis negatively affect patient prognosis. However, the mechanisms underlying its tumorigenesis and progression remain unclear. Recently, the influence of dermatopontin (DPT), which is an extracellular matrix protein, has been proposed in the development of cancer. Here we found that DNMT3a-mediated DPT, promoter hypermethylation results in the downregulation of DPT expression in breast cancer and its low expression correlated with poor prognosis. Notably, DPT directly interacted with YAP to promote YAP Ser127 phosphorylation, and restricted the translocation of endogenous YAP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thereby suppressing malignant phenotypes in BC cells. In addition, Ectopic YAP overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of DPT on BC growth and metastasis. Our study showed the critical role of DPT in regulating BC progression, making it easier to explore the clinical potential of modulating DPT/YAP activity in BC targeted therapies.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and repetitive behavior. Many studies show that the number of cognitive impairmentscan be reduced by antagonists of the histamine H3 receptor (H3R). In this study, the effects of ciproxifan (CPX) (1 and 3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) on cognitive impairments in rat pups exposed to valproic acid (VPA) (600 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) wereexamined on postnatal day 48-50 (PND 48-50) using marble-burying task (MBT), open field, novel object recognition (NOR), and Passive avoidance tasks. Famotidine (FAM) (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was also used to determine whether histaminergic neurotransmission exerts its procognitive effects via H2 receptors (H2Rs). Furthermore, a histological investigation was conducted to assess the degree of degeneration of hippocampal neurons. The results revealed that repetitive behaviors increased in VPA-exposed rat offspring in the MBT. In addition, VPA-exposed rat offspring exhibited more anxiety-like behaviors in the open field than saline-treated rats. It was found that VPA-exposed rat offspring showed memory deficits in NOR and Passive avoidance tasks. Our results indicated that 3 mg/kg CPX improved cognitive impairments induced by VPA, while 20 mg/kg FAM attenuated them. We concluded that 3 mg/kg CPX improved VPA-induced cognitive impairments through H3Rs. The histological assessment showed that the number of CA1 neurons decreased in the VPA-exposed rat offspring compared to the saline-exposed rat offspring, but this decrease was not significant. The histological assessment also revealed no significant differences in CA1 neurons in VPA-exposed rat offspring compared to saline-exposed rat offspring. However, CPX3 increased the number of CA1 neurons in the VPA + CPX3 group compared to the VPA + Saline group, but this increase was not significant. This study showed that rats prenatally exposed to VPA exhibit cognitive impairments in the MBT, open field, NOR, and Passive avoidance tests, which are ameliorated by CPX treatment on PND 48-50. In addition, morphological investigations showed that VPA treatment did not lead to neuronal degeneration in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus in rat pups.

AB  - Objective: Epidemiologic investigations have examined the correlation between air pollution and neurologic disorders and neuroanatomic structures. Increasing evidence underscores the profound influence of the gut microbiota on brain health. However, the existing evidence is equivocal, and a causal link remains uncertain. This study aimed: to determine if there is a causal connection between four key air pollutants, and 42 neurologic diseases, and 1325 distinct brain structures; and to explore the potential role of the gut microbiota in mediating these associations. Methods: Univariable Mendelian randomization (UVMR) and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) models were deployed to estimate the causal impact of air pollutants (including particulate matter [PM] with aerodynamic diameters <2.5 mu m [PM2.5], and <10 mu m [PM10]; PM2.5 absorbance; and nitrogen oxides [NOx]) on brain health through various Mendelian randomization methodologies. Lastly, the mediating role of the gut microbiome in the connections between the identified pollutants and neurologic diseases and brain structures was systematically examined. Results: The potential causal associations of PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance, PM10, and exposure to NOx, with the risks of intracerebral hemorrhage, hippocampal perivascular spaces, large artery strokes, generalized epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, anorexia nervosa, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 420 brain structures, were investigated by UVMR analysis. Following adjustment for air pollutants by MVMR analysis, the genetic correlations between PM10 exposure and PTSD and multiple sclerosis remained significant and robust. Importantly, we observed that phylum Lentisphaerae may mediate the association between PM10 and multiple sclerosis. Additionally, PM2.5 absorbance with a greater risk of reduced thickness in the left anterior transverse temporal gyrus of Heschl and a decreased area in the right sulcus intermedius primus of Jensen, mediated by genus Senegalimassilia and genus Lachnospiraceae UCG010, respectively. Finally, we provided evidence that Clostridium innocuum and genus Ruminococcus2 may partly mediate the causal effect of NOx on altered thickness in the left transverse temporal cortex and area in the right sulcus intermedius primus of Jensen, respectively. Conclusion: This study established a genetic connection between air pollution and brain health, implicating the gut microbiota as a potential mediator in the relationship between air pollution, neurologic disorders, and altered brain structures.

AB  - The accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) processes chemical signals crucial for species-specific socio-sexual behaviors. There is limited information about the AOB of wild rodents, and this study aims to characterize the neurochemical organization of the AOB in the fossorial water vole (Arvicola scherman), a subterranean Cricetidae rodent. We employed histological, immunohistochemical, and lectin-histochemical techniques. The AOB of these voles exhibits a distinct laminar organization, with prominent mitral cells and a dense population of periglomerular cells. Lectin histochemistry and G-protein immunohistochemistry confirmed the existence of an antero-posterior zonation. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated significant expression of PGP 9.5, suggesting its involvement in maintaining neuronal activity within the AOB. In contrast, the absence of SMI-32 labelling in the AOB, compared to its strong expression in the main olfactory bulb, highlights functional distinctions between these two olfactory subsystems. Calcium-binding proteins allowed the characterization of atypical sub-bulbar nuclei topographically related to the AOB. All these features suggest that the AOB of Arvicola scherman is adapted for enhanced processing of chemosensory signals, which may play a pivotal role in its subterranean lifestyle. Our results provide a foundation for future studies exploring the implications of these adaptations, including potential improvements in the management of these vole populations.

AB  - Simple Summary Porcine circovirus 2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Lawsonia intracellularis, are four highly prevalent, major pathogens of swine for which routine vaccination is common. This study determined whether the intradermal application of vaccines against these four pathogens at the same time and at the same anatomical site had any negative effect on vaccine efficacy. Intradermal vaccination and reduced handling moments offer a more animal-friendly method of vaccination. For all four diseases, the efficacy with the combination of vaccines was equivalent to that with the single vaccines. The combined application of vaccines in swine offers many benefits, including reduced time and labour costs, and improved animal welfare, due to fewer injections and manipulations. This study investigated if simultaneous intradermal vaccinations against porcine circovirus 2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, and Lawsonia intracellularis, using a specialised needle-free applicator would confer comparable protection against experimental infection compared to the single vaccines. In all cases, the administration of the vaccines together was as efficacious as the administration of the vaccines alone, significantly reducing clinical signs associated with each of the four pathogens.

AB  - Sequenced reactivations of hippocampal neurons called replays, concomitant with sharp-wave ripples in the local field potential, are critical for the consolidation of episodic memory, but whether replays depend on the brain's reward or novelty signals is unknown. Here, we combined chemogenetic silencing of dopamine neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA) and simultaneous electrophysiological recordings in dorsal hippocampal CA1, in freely behaving male rats experiencing changes to reward magnitude and environmental novelty. Surprisingly, VTA silencing did not prevent ripple increases where reward was increased, but caused dramatic, aberrant ripple increases where reward was unchanged. These increases were associated with increased reverse-ordered replays. On familiar tracks this effect disappeared, and ripples tracked reward prediction error (RPE), indicating that non-VTA reward signals were sufficient to direct replay. Our results reveal a novel dependence of hippocampal replay on dopamine, and a role for a VTA-independent RPE signal that is reliable only in familiar environments.

AB  - Prenatal stress is a neuropsychiatric risk factor, and effects may be mediated by prenatal oxidative stress. Cell types in the brain sensitive to oxidative stress-cortical microglia and cortical and hippocampal interneurons-may be altered by oxidative stress generated during prenatal stress and may be neurobiological substrates for altered behavior. Our objective was to determine the critical nature of oxidative stress in prenatal stress effects by manipulating prenatal antioxidants. CD1 mouse dams underwent restraint embryonic day 12 to 18 three times daily or no stress and received intraperitoneal injections before each stress period of vehicle, N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg daily), or astaxanthin (30 mg/kg before first daily stress, 10 mg/kg before second/third stresses). Adult male and female offspring behavior, microglia, and interneurons were assessed. Results supported the hypothesis that prenatal stress-induced oxidative stress affects microglia; microglia ramification increased after prenatal stress, and both antioxidants prevented these effects. In addition, N-acetylcysteine or astaxanthin was effective in preventing distinct male and female interneuron changes; decreased female medial frontal cortical parvalbumin interneurons was prevented by either antioxidant; increased male medial frontal cortical parvalbumin interneurons was prevented by N-acetylcysteine and decreased male hippocampal GAD67GFP+ cells prevented by astaxanthin. Prenatal stress-induced increased anxiety-like behavior and decreased sociability were not prevented by prenatal antioxidants. Sensorimotor gating deficits in males was partially prevented by prenatal astaxanthin. This study demonstrates the importance of oxidative stress for persistent impacts on offspring cortical microglia and interneurons, but did not link these changes with anxiety-like, social, and sensorimotor gating behaviors.

AB  - The current study aimed to examine the effect of post-weaning treatment with probiotics on memory formation under stress during the adult period in male Wistar rats. Considering GABA is a potential mediator between probiotics and the host, the present study also investigated the involvement of the GABAergic system in the probiotic response. The hippocampal and prefrontal cortical (PFC) expression levels of BDNF and c-Fos were also assessed to show whether the treatments affect the memory-related signaling pathway. Three weeks after birth, the post-weaning rats were fed with probiotic water (PW) or tap water (TW) for 2, 3, 4, or 5 weeks. Exposure to acute stress impaired memory formation in a passive avoidance learning task. Feeding the post-weaning animals with probiotic strains (3, 4, or 5 weeks) inhibited stress-induced amnesia of the adult period. Post-training intracerebroventricular (ICV) microinjection of muscimol improved stress-induced amnesia in the animals fed with TW. ICV microinjection of muscimol inhibited probiotic treatment's significant effect on the stress response in the memory task. The expression levels of BDNF and c-Fos in the PFC and the hippocampus were significantly decreased in the stress animal group. The levels of BDNF and c-Fos were increased in the PW/stress animal group. The muscimol response was compounded with the decreased levels of BDNF and c-Fos in the PFC and the hippocampus. Thus, the GABA-A receptor mechanism may mediate the inhibitory effect of this probiotic mixture on stress-induced amnesia, which may be associated with the PFC and hippocampal BDNF/c-Fos signaling changes.

AB  - Intracellular sensing technologies necessitate a delicate balance of spatial resolution, sensitivity, biocompatibility, and stability. While existing methods partially fulfill these criteria, none offer a comprehensive solution. Nanodiamonds (NDs) harboring nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers have emerged as promising candidates due to their sensing capabilities under biological conditions and their ability to meet all aforementioned requirements. This study focuses on expanding the application of NDs and NV center-based sensing to neuronal contexts by investigating their functionalization and subsequent effects on three distinct cell lines relevant to neurodegenerative disease research. Our study concentrates on positioning fluorescent NDs (FNDs) with NV center point defects onto neuronal cell surfaces. Achieving this through specific antibody attachment enhances the proximity of FND to neurites, facilitating the detection of local action potentials. Targeting voltage-dependent calcium channels (Cav2.2) with biotin-streptavidin-bound antibodies enables the precise positioning of FNDs. The functionalized FNDs (f-FNDs) show increased size and zeta potential, confirming the antibody presence without compromising cell viability. Two-color confocal imaging and co-localization algorithms are employed to further attest to the success of the functionalization. The f-FNDs are applied to cell cultures of three cell lines: SH-SY5Y, differentiated dopaminergic neurons, and hippocampal rat neurons; their biocompatibility and effects on synaptic activity are explored. Moreover, preliminary total internal reflection fluorescence - optically detected magnetic resonance (TIRF-ODMR) experiments across cellular sites demonstrate the magnetic field sensitivity of our sensor network. The successful establishment of this sensor network provides a platform for characterizing neuronal signaling in healthy models and conditions mimicking Parkinson's disease.

AB  - The use of sustainable organic substrates of recognized quality is essential in the production of seedlings of fruit species. In this context, the present study aimed to formulate different sustainable organic substrates based on millicompost combined with different proportions of locally available organic waste, such as coconut fiber (Cocos nucifera) powder, gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) and elephant grass shavings (Pennisetum purpureum) for the production of Passiflora edulis seedlings. The organic substrates used were as follows: S1- millicompost; S2- commercial substrate and substrates formulated based on millicompost: S3%-25% millicompost + 25% gliricidia + 25% elephant grass + 25% coconut fiber; S4%-50% millicompost + 50% elephant grass; (S5) 50% millicompost + 50% gliricidia; (S6) 50% millicompost + 50% coconut fiber. At 56 days of sowing, the following morphological parameters were evaluated: shoot dry mass (SDM); root dry mass (RDM); plant height (PH); number of leaves (NL); stalk diameter (SD); root volume (RV); leaf area in cm(2) (LA); seedling vigor (SV) and clod stability (CS). The nutrient contents (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) accumulated in the shoot dry mass of the seedlings were determined after this period. The organic substrates that provided seedlings with significantly higher parameters (P< 0.05) of SDM, RDM, PH, NL, SD, RV, LA, SV and CS were as follows: S1>S6>S5. The other substrates (S2, S3 and S4) presented seedlings with morphological parameters similar to each other. In addition, there was a greater accumulation of P, K Ca and Mg (P<0.05) in the shoot dry mass of the seedlings developed on the substrates S1>S6>S5. The substrates S6 and S5 represent two new options of sustainable substrates, being effective in the production of yellow passion fruit seedlings with excellent vegetative growth rates.

AB  - More than 4700 nominal family-group names (including names for fossils and ichnotaxa) are nomenclaturally available in the order Coleoptera. Since each family-group name is based on the concept of its type genus, we argue that the stability of names used for the classification of beetles depends on accurate nomenclatural data for each type genus. Following a review of taxonomic literature, with a focus on works that potentially con-tain type species designations, we provide a synthesis of nomenclatural data associated with the type genus of each nomenclaturally available family-group name in Coleoptera. For each type genus the author(s), year of publication, and page number are given as well as its current status (i.e., whether treated as valid or not) and current classification.Information about the type species of each type genus and the type species fixation (i.e., fixed originally or subsequently, and if subsequently, by whom) is also given. The orig-inal spelling of the family-group name that is based on each type genus is included, with its author(s), year, and stem. We append a list of nomenclaturally available family-group names presented in a classification scheme. Because of the importance of the Principle of Priority in zoological nomenclature, we provide information on the date of publication of the references cited in this work, when known. Several nomenclatural issues emerged during the course of this work. We therefore appeal to the community of coleopterists to submit applications to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (hence-forth "Commission") in order to permanently resolve some of the problems outlined here.The following changes of authorship for type genera are implemented here (these changes do not affect the concept of each type genus): CHRYSOMELIDAE: Fulcidax Crotch, 1870 (previously credited to "Clavareau, 1913"); CICINDELIDAE: Euprosopus W.S.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Citri Reticulata Pericarpium Viride (also known Qing-Pi or QP) is a plant in the Rutaceae family, QP is a traditional Qi-regulating medicine in Chinese medicine that is compatible with other Chinese medicine components and has extensive clinical practice in treating anxiety and depression. Reports on the pharmacological effects of QP have demonstrated its neuroprotective effects and antioxidant capacities. Numerous pharmacological benefits of QP are attributed to its antioxidant abilities. Anxiety disorders are a broadly defined category of mental illnesses. Oxidative stress and an imbalance in the antioxidant defense system are typical pathological features of these disorders. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of QP essential oil on anxiety using animal models and investigate the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Materials and methods: This study aimed to develop an animal model of anxiety using chronic restraint stress and investigate the effects of inhalation of Citri Reticulata Pericarpium Viride essential oil on anxiety-like behavior, olfactory function, and olfactory bulb neurogenesis in mice with anxiety. Results: The results showed that long-term chronic restraint stimulation caused a decrease in olfactory function, significant anxiety-like behavior, and a notable reduction in the number of neurons in the olfactory bulb. However, inhalation of Citri Reticulata Pericarpium Viride essential oil reversed these effects, improving the olfactory function, neuro-stimulating effect, alleviating anxiety-like behavior, and regulating theta (4-12Hz) oscillation in the hippocampus DG area. These effects were associated with changes in the expression levels of glutamate receptor NMDAR and NeuN in olfactory bulb. Conclusions: The study revealed that mice with anxiety induced by chronic restraint stress exhibited significant olfactory dysfunction, providing strong evidence for the causal relationship between anxiety disorders and olfactory dysfunction. Moreover, QP essential oil has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic drug for anxiety disorders, in addition to its role as a complementary anxiolytic.

AB  - Results over the last decades have provided evidence suggesting that HPA axis dysfunction is a major risk factor predisposing to the development of psychopathological behaviour. This susceptibility can be programmed during developmental windows of marked neuroplasticity, allowing early-life adversity to convey vulnerability to mental illness later in life. Besides genetic predisposition, also environmental factors play a pivotal role in this process, through embodiment of the mother's emotions, or via nutrients and hormones transferred through the placenta and the maternal milk. The aim of the current translational study was to mimic a severe stress condition by exposing female CD-1 mouse dams to abnormal levels of corticosterone (80 mu g/mL) in the drinking water either during the last week of pregnancy (PreCORT) or the first one of lactation (PostCORT), compared to an Animal Facility Rearing (AFR) control group. When tested as adults, male mice from PostCORT offspring and somewhat less the PreCORT mice exhibited a markedly increased corticosterone response to acute restraint stress, compared to perinatal AFR controls. Aberrant persistence of adolescence-typical increased interest towards novel social stimuli and somewhat deficient emotional contagion also characterised profiles in both perinatal-CORT groups. Intranasal oxytocin (0 or 20.0 mu g/kg) generally managed to reduce the stress response and restore a regular behavioural phenotype. Alterations in density of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, oxytocin and mu- and kappa-opioid receptors were found. Changes differed as a function of brain areas and the specific age window of perinatal aberrant stimulation of the HPA axis. Present results provided experimental evidence in a translational mouse model that precocious adversity represents a risk factor predisposing to the development of psychopathological behaviour.

AB  - Robertsonian chromosomes form by fusion of two chromosomes that have centromeres located near their ends, known as acrocentric or telocentric chromosomes. This fusion creates a new metacentric chromosome and is a major mechanism of karyotype evolution and speciation. Robertsonian chromosomes are common in nature and were first described in grasshoppers by the zoologist W. R. B. Robertson more than 100 years ago. They have since been observed in many species, including catfish, sheep, butterflies, bats, bovids, rodents and humans, and are the most common chromosomal change in mammals. Robertsonian translocations are particularly rampant in the house mouse, Mus musculus domesticus, where they exhibit meiotic drive and create reproductive isolation. Recent progress has been made in understanding how Robertsonian chromosomes form in the human genome, highlighting some of the fundamental principles of how and why these types of fusion events occur so frequently. Consequences of these fusions include infertility and Down's syndrome. In this Hypothesis, I postulate that the conditions that allow these fusions to form are threefold: (1) sequence homology on non-homologous chromosomes, often in the and (3) physical proximity of the homologous sequences in threedimensional space. This Hypothesis highlights the latest progress in understanding human Robertsonian translocations within the context of the broader literature on Robertsonian chromosomes.

AB  - Performing cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and circulatory arrest (CA) provokes the development of complications caused by tissue metabolism, microcirculatory disorders, and endogenous nitric oxide (NO) deficiency. This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms for systemic organoprotective effects of exogenous NO during CPB and CA based on the assessment of dynamic changes in glycocalyx degradation markers, deformation properties of erythrocytes, and tissue metabolism in the experiment. A single-center prospective randomized controlled study was conducted on sheep, n = 24, comprising four groups of six in each. In two groups, NO was delivered at a dose of 80 ppm during CPB ("CPB + NO" group) or CPB and CA ("CPB + CA + NO"). In the "CPB" and "CPB + CA" groups, NO supply was not carried out. NO therapy prevented the deterioration of erythrocyte deformability. It was associated with improved tissue metabolism, lower lactate levels, and higher ATP levels in myocardial and lung tissues. The degree of glycocalyx degradation and endothelial dysfunction, assessed by the concentration of heparan sulfate proteoglycan and asymmetric dimethylarginine, did not change when exogenous NO was supplied. Intraoperative delivery of NO provides systemic organoprotection, which results in reducing the damaging effects of CPB on erythrocyte deformability and maintaining normal functioning of tissue metabolism.

AB  - Prenatal testosterone (T) excess-induced metabolic dysfunctions involve tissue specific changes in insulin sensitivity with insulin resistant, oxidative and lipotoxic state in liver/muscle and insulin sensitive but inflammatory and oxidative state in visceral adipose tissues (VAT). We hypothesized that mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and premature cellular senescence are contributors to the tissue-specific changes in insulin sensitivity. Markers of mitochondrial number, function, and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), ER stress and cellular senescence (telomere length) were assessed in liver, muscle and 4 adipose (VAT, subcutaneous [SAT], epicardiac [ECAT] and perirenal [PRAT]) depots collected from control and prenatal T-treated female sheep at 21 months of age. Prenatal T treatment led to: (a) reduction in mitochondrial number and OxPhos complexes and increase in ER stress markers in muscle; (b) increase in fibrosis with trend towards increase in short telomere fragments in liver (c) depot-specific mitochondrial changes with OxPhos complexes namely increase in SAT and reduction in PRAT and increase in mitochondrial number in ECAT; (d) depot-specific ER stress marker changes with increase in VAT, reduction in SAT, contrasting changes in ECAT and no changes in PRAT; and (d) reduced shorter telomere fragments in SAT, ECAT and PRAT. These changes indicate insulin resistance may be driven by mitochondrial and ER dysfunction in muscle, fibrosis and premature senescence in liver, and depot-specific changes in mitochondrial function and ER stress without involving cellular senescence in adipose tissue. These findings provide mechanistic insights into pathophysiology of metabolic dysfunction among female offspring from hyperandrogenic pregnancies.

AB  - Simple Summary Pain elimination during the surgical castration of male piglets is an important animal welfare issue. Bans on castration without pain relief are pending in most pork-producing European countries. Surgical castration of suckling piglets without anesthesia has been prohibited in Germany since January 2021. Boar fattening, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccination and surgical castration under isoflurane or injection anesthesia are permitted as legal alternatives. These alternatives have advantages and disadvantages, and a feasible and simple method is still needed. The legal basis for another alternative, i.e., the application of a local anesthetic by the farmer prior to castration, has been created in Germany, but evidence of its efficacy remains controversial. The present study developed a feasible and effective method for local anesthesia in piglet castration. Two different injection techniques in combination with the local anesthetics lidocaine and mepivacaine were investigated using nociceptive parameters, injection pressure and tissue distribution. Both injection techniques significantly reduced the nociceptive parameters regardless of the local anesthetic used and achieved similar distribution patterns and injection pressures. One method performed slightly better in the experimental setup, based on injection duration and handling. The present study evaluated the effects of two injection techniques in combination with lidocaine or mepivacaine for piglets undergoing castration. To improve ease of use, a cannula with side holes (one-step fenestrated (F)) was invented to simultaneously deliver a local anesthetic into the testis and scrotum and was compared to a two-step injection technique. The distribution of a lidocaine/contrast agent mixture using the two methods was examined using computed tomography. Piglets were randomly divided into treatment groups: handling, castration without pain relief and castration after lidocaine or mepivacaine injection using the one-step F or two-step method. Acute physiological responses to noxious stimuli were evaluated by measuring the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and nocifensive movements. Fos protein expression in the spinal dorsal cord was semi-quantitatively analyzed. Both injection techniques achieved similar distribution patterns. The one-step F method was faster and easier. Injection was not associated with significant changes in MAP or HR, but Mepi1 and NaCl elicited significantly increased nocifensive movements. Both techniques significantly reduced MAP and nocifensive movements when the spermatic cords were cut, regardless of the local anesthetic type. Compared to NaCl, only the lidocaine treatments significantly reduced HR during skin incision. Lido2 significantly reduced Fos protein expression.

AB  - The rapid development of 5G network technology has gained much popularity as well as concerns about its adverse effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of 4.9 GHz (one of working frequencies of 5G communication) radiofrequency (RF) field on emotional behaviours and spatial memory in adult male mice. Open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST) and Y maze were used to evaluate anxiety, depression-like behaviour and spatial memory ability, respectively. It was found that the anxiety-like behaviour and spatial memory ability of mice did not change, but the depression-like behaviour was induced in mice after 4.9 GHz RF exposure. In addition, the number of neurons significantly reduced and the level of pyroptosis obviously increased in amygdala rather than hippocampus. These results suggested that 4.9 GHz RF exposure could induce depression-like behaviour, which might be associated with the neuronal pyroptosis in amygdala.

AB  - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen with different pathogenesis in humans and camels. The mechanisms behind the higher tolerance of camels to MERS-CoV infection are still unknown. Monocytes are innate myeloid cells that are able, depending on the local stimulation in their microenvironment, to differentiate into different functional subtypes of macrophages with an impact on the adaptive immune response. Several in vitro protocols have been used to induce the differentiation of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in human and several veterinary species. Such protocols are not available for camel species. In the present study, monocytes were separated from camel blood and differentiated in vitro in the presence of different stimuli into MDM. Camel MDMs generated in the presence of a combined stimulation of monocytes with LPS and GM-CSF resulted in the development of an M1 macrophages phenotype with increased abundance of the antigen-presentation receptor MHCII molecules and a decreased expression of the scavenger receptor CD163. The expression pattern of the cell markers CD163, CD14, CD172a, CD44, and CD9 on MDM generated in the presence of the MERS-CoV S1 protein revealed similarity with M-CSF-induced MDM, suggesting the potential of the MERS-CoV S1 protein to induce an M2 macrophages phenotype. Similarly to the effect of M-CSF, MERS-CoV-S protein-induced MDMs showed enhanced phagocytosis activity compared to non-polarized or LPS/GM-CSF-polarized MDMs. Collectively, our study represents the first report on the in vitro generation of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in camels and the characterization of some phenotypic and functional properties of camel MDM under the effect of M1 and M2 polarizing stimuli. In addition, the results suggest a polarizing effect of the MERS-CoV S1 protein on camel MDMs, developing an M2-like phenotype with enhanced phagocytosis activity. To understand the clinical relevance of these in vitro findings on disease pathogenesis and camel immune response toward MERS-CoV infection, further studies are required.

AB  - Simple Summary Nowadays, owing to its limited availability and high cost, fish meal is no longer an affordable protein source in fish feed. Therefore, it is necessary to find new sustainable protein sources to replace fishmeal in the diet of fish or in aquafeeds. Recently, yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) has been widely used as a protein source in the formulated feed of broilers, pigs, shrimp and fish, due to its high protein content, excellent amino acid profile and abundant functional substances. In this study, we found that yellow mealworm meal has high digestibility in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and an appropriate level (less than 19.52%) in the diet can promote growth and improve liver health in largemouth bass. Therefore, we assume that utilization of yellow mealworm in the diet of largemouth bass as a protein source is feasible. This study investigated the effects of yellow mealworm meal (TM) on growth performance, hepatic health and digestibility in juvenile largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). The fish were fed with the basic feed and the test feed (70% basic feed and 30% raw materials) containing Cr2O3, and feces were collected for digestibility determination. The fish were fed with five isonitrogenous (47% crude protein) and isolipidic (13% crude lipid) diets, in which fishmeal (FM) was replaced with 0% (TM0), 12% (TM12), 24% (TM24), 36% (TM36) and 48% (TM48) TM. The fish were reared in cylindrical plastic tanks in a recirculating aquaculture system for 11 weeks. The apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC), of dry matter, crude protein and crude lipid, in largemouth bass of TM were 74.66%, 91.03% and 90.91%, respectively. The ADC of total amino acid (TAA) of TM in largemouth bass was 92.89%, and the ADC of essential amino acid (EAA) in TM in largemouth bass was 93.86%. The final body weight (FBW), weight gain rate (WGR) and specific growth rate (SGR) in the TM24 group were significantly higher than those in other groups. Similarly, the highest mRNA expression levels of hepatic protein metabolism genes (pi3k, mtor, 4ebp2 and got) and antioxidant enzyme (glutathione peroxidase, Gpx; catalase, Cat) activities were observed in the TM24 group. Moreover, the expression levels of anti-inflammatory factors (il-10 and tgf) in liver were up-regulated and the expression levels of pro-inflammatory factors (il-8 and il-1 beta) in liver were down-regulated. Quadratic regression model analysis, based on weight gain rate (WGR) against dietary TM level, indicated that the optimum level of dietary TM replacing FM in largemouth bass diet was 19.52%. Appropriate replacement levels (less than 36%) of FM by TM in the diets can enhance the antioxidant capacity and immunity of largemouth bass. However, high levels of FM substitution with TM (more than 48%) in the feeds can damage the liver health and inhibit the growth of largemouth bass. Notably, largemouth bass has high ADC and high utilization of TM, which indicates that it is feasible to use TM as feed protein source for largemouth bass.

AB  - This study investigates the potential of keratin and silk as natural structural proteins for designing tissue adhesives for wound healing. The study demonstrates the silk-wool-tannic acid (SF-Wool-TA) complex as an in situ tissue adhesive through the utilization of polyphenol chemistry. Keratin is first isolated from coarse sheep wool using a green microwave treatment process. Due to the presence of functional groups such as tyrosine, carboxyl, and thiol groups; silk, and keratin can form multiple interactions with pyrogallol and catechol functional groups of TA to form an in situ adhesive hydrogel. The SF-Wool-TA hydrogel exhibits in situ gelation, recyclability, moldability, elasticity (G'>100 kPa), adhesiveness, self-healing properties, 3D printability, antibacterial activity, antioxidant properties, and biocompatibility. The inclusion of wool keratin also enhances the hydrophilicity of the hydrogel. The hydrogel was tested in vivo and enhanced wound healing in a full-thickness skin incision model. The keratin-polyphenol interaction represents an attractive hybrid material for advanced biomaterials applications, particularly in the field of skin wound healing.

AB  - Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) and Syrian, or golden, hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) are closely related to mice (Mus musculus) and are commonly used in studies of social behavior including social interaction, social memory, and aggression. Hippocampal area CA2 is known to play a key role in these behaviors in mice and responds to social stimuli in rats, but CA2 has yet to be characterized in hamsters or voles, which are also used in studies of social behaviors. Here, we used immunofluorescence to determine whether CA2 could be molecularly identified in tissue from voles and hamsters. We found that staining for many CA2 markers was similar in these three species, with labeling seen in neurons at the distal end of the mossy fibers . In contrast, although perineuronal nets (PNNs) surround CA2 cells in mice, PNN staining differed across species. In voles, both CA2 and CA3 were labeled, whereas in hamsters, labeling was seen primarily in CA3. These results demonstrate that CA2 can be molecularly distinguished from neighboring CA1 and CA3 areas in voles and hamsters with several antibodies commonly used in mice. However, PNN staining is not useful for identifying CA2 in voles or hamsters, suggestive of differing roles for either PNNs or for the hippocampal subregions in social behavior. These findings reveal commonalities across species in the molecular profile of CA2 and should facilitate future studies of CA2 in these species.
   Characterization of hippocampal area CA2 in mouse, vole, and hamsterBrains of mice, voles, and hamsters were stained for markers of hippocampal area CA2. While many of the markers appeared similar across the species, staining for perineuronal nets (PNNs) differed substantially-PNNs were only specific to CA2 in mice. image

AB  - Corneal transplantation serves as the standard clinical therapy for serious corneal disorders. However, rejection of grafts, significant expenditures, and most crucially, the global donor shortage, may affect the outcome. Recently, 3D bioprinting using biodegradable polymeric materials has become a suitable method for creating tissue replicas with identical architecture. One such most renowned material is GelMA, for its scaffold's three-dimensional structure, biocompatibility, robust mechanics, and favourable optical transmittance. However, GelMA's inadequate viscosity to print at body temperature with better form integrity remains an obstacle. The aim of this work is to create 3D printed GelMA/MC hydrogels for corneal stroma tissue engineering using MC's printability at room temperature and GelMA's irreversible photo cross-linking with UV irradiation. The print speed and pressure conditions for 3D GelMA/MC hydrogels were tuned. Thermal, morphological and physicochemical characteristics were studied for two distinct concentrations of GelMA/MC hydrogels. The hydrogels achieved a transparency of similar to 78 % (at 700 nm), which was on par with that of the normal cornea (80 %). The in vitro studies conducted using goat corneal stromal cells demonstrated the ability of both hydrogels to promote cell adhesion and proliferation. Expression of Vimentin and keratan sulphate validated the phenotype of keratocytes in the hydrogel. This 3D printed GelMA/MC hydrogel model mimics biophysical characteristics of the native corneal stroma, which may hold promise for clinical corneal stromal tissue engineering.

AB  - Spatial navigation and event memory (termed episodic memory) are thought to be heavily intertwined, both in terms of their cognitive processes and underlying neural systems. Some theoretical models posit that both memory for places during navigation and episodic memory depend on highly overlapping brain systems. Here, we assessed this relationship by testing navigation in an individual with severe retrograde and anterograde amnesia; the amnesia stemmed from bilateral lesions in the medial temporal lobes from two separate strokes. The individual with amnesia and age-matched controls were tested on their memories for the locations of previously seen objects relative to distal mountain cues in an immersive virtual environment involving free ambulation. All participants were tested from both repeated and novel start locations and when a single distal mountain cue was unknowingly moved to determine if they relied on a single (beacon) cue to a greater extent than the collection of all distal cues. Compared to age-matched controls, the individual with amnesia showed no significant deficits in navigation from either the repeated or novel start points, although both the individual with amnesia and controls performed well above chance at placing objects near their correct locations. The individual with amnesia also relied on a combination of distal cues in a manner comparable to age-matched controls. Despite largely intact memory for locations using distal cues, the individual with amnesia walked longer paths, rotated more, and took longer to complete trials. Our findings suggest that memory for places during navigation and episodic memory may involve partially dissociable brain circuits and that other brain regions outside of the medial temporal lobe partially support some aspects of navigation. At the same time, the fact that the individual with amnesia walked more circuitous paths and had dense amnesia for autobiographic events supports the idea that the hippocampus may be important for binding information as part of a larger role in memory.

AB  - Tau is a neuronal protein involved in microtubule stabilization and intracellular vesicle transport in axons. In neurodegenerative disorders termed "tauopathies," like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and forms intracellular inclusions. Rhesus macaques are widely used for studying ageing processes and modeling neurodegenerative disorders, yet little is known about endogenous tau expression in their brains. In this study, immunohistochemical methods were used to map and characterize total tau, 3R- and 4R-tau isoforms, and phosphorylated tau (pThr231-tau and pSer202/Thr205-tau/AT8) expression bilaterally in 16 brain regions of normal and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced hemiparkinsonian adult rhesus macaques. Tau-immunoreactivity (-ir), including both 3R and 4R isoforms, was observed throughout the brain, with varying regional intensities. The anterior cingulate cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus displayed the most robust tau-ir, while the subthalamic nucleus and white matter regions had minimal expression. Tau was present in neurons of gray matter regions; it was preferentially observed in fibers of the globus pallidus and substantia nigra and in cell bodies of the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus. In white matter regions, tau was abundantly present in oligodendrocytes. Additionally, neuronal pThr231-tau-ir was abundant in all brain regions, but not AT8-ir. Differences in regional and intracellular protein expression were not detected between control subjects and both brain hemispheres of MPTP-treated animals. Specifically, tau-ir in the substantia nigra of all subjects colocalized with GABAergic neurons. Overall, this report provides an in-depth characterization of tau expression in the rhesus macaque brain to facilitate future investigations for understanding and modeling tau pathology in this species.

AB  - Background: Depression is a debilitating condition that affects the mind and the individual's body. The improving effects of saffron on depression and anxiety have long been discussed, with limited information about the mo-lecular mechanism of action. Hypothesis/Purpose: Investigating the effect of saffron carotenoids, Crocin and Crocetin, on depression and anxiety in rats by emphasizing some signaling pathways involved.Study Design: Depression and anxiety were induced in rats via unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Then different rat groups were treated with Crocin, Crocetin, Fluoxetine, and vehicle. Behavioral tests were done before and after treatment.Methods: The serum Serotonin and Corticosterone and the expression of some hippocampal signaling proteins were studied. Furthermore, bioinformatics tools were used to predict the interactions of Crocin/ Crocetin with the Serotonin transporter and NMDA receptor subunit NR2B. Then, the patch-clamp was used to study the interaction of Crocetin with the NMDA receptor.Results: Various behavioral tests confirmed the induction of depression and the improvement of depression by these natural carotenoids. In addition, Crocin/ Crocetin significantly increased the decreased serum Serotonin and reduced the increased serum Corticosterone in the depressed groups. They also increased or caused a trend of increase in the CREB, ERK, BAD, BDNF, p11, and 5-HT1B expression in the hippocampus of the depressed groups. In addition, there were an increase or a trend in p-CREB/CREB, p-ERK1/2 /ERK1/2, and p-BAD/BAD ratios in the Crocin/ Crocetin treated depressed groups. However, the NR2B and FOXO3a expression showed a trend of decrease in depressed groups after treatment. The bioinformatics data indicated that Crocin/ Crocetin could bind to the Serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. Both carotenoids bind to the same site as Fluoxetine in the SLC6A4. However, they bound to different sites on the NR2B. So, Crocetin binds to NR2B at the same site as Ifenprodil. But Crocin bound to another site. The whole cell patch-clamp recording on the normal rat hippocampus revealed a significant decrease in the NMDA peak amplitude after Crocetin treat-ment, indicating its inhibitory effect on this receptor.

AB  - Currently, surgery is the only treatment that can completely remove gastric tumor. This study investigated the effect of curcumin on sevoflurane anesthesia-induced nerve damage in rats with gastric cancer (GC). A rat GC model was established and received sevoflurane for anesthesia. The rats were then divided into model group, low-dose (20 mg/kg), high-dose (60 mg/kg) group and blank control group (n = 5, each group). To identify the interaction between curcumin and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression, we set up MAPK IP: 12700.1 On: Tue, 21 Nov 2023 06 52:55 mimic group, MAPK inhibitor group, and igh-dose curcumin + MAPK inhibitor group (n = 5). The cognitive Copyright: American Scientific Publishers ability of rats after anesthesia and neuronal damage was assessed using Morris water maze test, whilst the Delivered by ngenta expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and pyroptosis were also detected. Administration of curcumin attenuated neuronal injury and pyroptosis in the hippocampus induced by sevoflurane, and facilitated the recovery of memory impairment in rats, resulting in decreased expression of MAPK and increased expressions of BNDF and NGF. After treatment with MAPK inhibitors, the nerve damage in the rat hippocampus tissue was controlled, and more prominently neuroprotective effect appeared in the curcumin high-dose + MAPK inhibitor group. Curcumin can thus effectively up-regulate BNDF and NGF in hippocampal tissue, which is closely related to inhibited MAPK pathway activity. Curcumin protects the nervous system by inhibiting the expression of pyroptin, contributing toimprovement of cognitive impairment in rats.

AB  - Simple Summary Chlamydia, an important zoonotic pathogen, poses a serious threat to public health and the development of animal husbandry. Shanxi Province, famous for its Loess Plateau terrain, has been taking cattle and sheep husbandry as an important direction of development, which means that it is necessary to prioritize the detection of pathogens in cattle and sheep. In this study, based on the location and management pattern, the seroprevalence of Chlamydia and C. abortus infection in cattle in Shanxi Province was examined by indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The results revealed a high (52.29%) overall seroprevalence of Chlamydia in cattle in Shanxi Province. Location was closely related to the prevalence of Chlamydia and C. abortus, and different management patterns also had a certain impact on the prevalence of Chlamydia. This study provided valuable baseline information for the prevention and control of Chlamydia in cattle in Shanxi Province. The information on Chlamydia infection in cattle is limited in Shanxi Province, north China. This study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence and risk factors of Chlamydia and Chlamydia abortus infection in cattle in Shanxi Province. In November 2020, a large-scale investigation of Chlamydia seroprevalence was conducted on 981 cattle serum samples collected from 40 cattle farms in 11 cities of Shanxi Province. The seroprevalence of Chlamydia and C. abortus was examined by indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The seroprevalence of Chlamydia and C. abortus was 52.29% (513/981) and 2.96% (29/981), respectively, in cattle in Shanxi Province. Location was identified as a risk factor for Chlamydia and C. abortus infection (p < 0.05). Under different management patterns, the seroprevalence of Chlamydia and C. abortus in large-scale animal farming companies was higher than that in household animal farms and animal farming cooperatives, and only the seroprevalence of Chlamydia was significantly different in different management patterns (p < 0.01). The results showed that there was higher seroprevalence of Chlamydia in cattle in Shanxi Province, while C. abortus was not the dominant species. This study provided baseline information on Chlamydia infection in cattle in Shanxi Province, which constitutes valuable data for monitoring livestock health and preventing potential zoonoses.

AB  - Gamma and theta oscillations have been functionally associated with cognitive processes, such as learning and memory. Synaptic conductances play an important role in the generation of intrinsic network rhythmicity, but few studies have examined the effects of voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) on these rhythms. In this report, we have used a pyramidal-interneuron-gamma (PING) network consisting of excitatory pyramidal cells and two types of inhibitory interneurons. We have constructed a conductance-based neural network incorporating a persistent sodium current (I-NaP), a delayed rectifier potassium current (I-KDR), a inactivating potassium current (I-A) and a hyperpolarization-activated current (I-H). We have investigated the effects of several conductances on network theta and gamma frequency oscillations. Variation of all conductances of interest changed network rhythmicity. Theta power was altered by all conductances tested. Gamma rhythmogenesis was dependent on I-A and I-H. The I-KDR currents in excitatory pyramidal cells as well as both types of inhibitory interneurons were essential for theta rhythmogenesis and altered gamma rhythm properties. Increasing I-NaP suppressed both gamma and theta rhythms. Addition of noise did not alter these patterns. Our findings suggest that VGICs strongly affect brain network rhythms. Further investigations in vivo will be of great interest, including potential effects on neural function and cognition.

AB  - Background: Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), an active ingredient in ginseng, may be a potential agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the protective effect of Rg1 on neurodegeneration in AD and its mechanism of action are still incompletely understood.
   Methods: Wild type (WT) and APP/PS1 AD mice, from 6 to 9 months old, were used in the experiment. The open field test (OFT) and Morris water maze (MWM) were used to detect behavioral changes. Neuronal damage was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Nissl staining. Immunofluorescence, western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) were used to examine postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) expression, amyloid beta (A beta) deposition, Tau and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and NAPDH oxidase 2 (NOX2) expression.
   Results: Rg1 treatment for 12 weeks significantly ameliorated cognitive impairments and neuronal damage and decreased the p-Tau level, amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, and A beta generation in APP/PS1 mice.

AB  - Objective: To study the biological effects of resveratrol on the growth, electrophysiology, and mitochondrial function of human granulosa cells (h-GCs).
   Design: Preclinical study.
   Setting: Electrophysiology laboratory and in vitro fertilization unit.
   Patient(s): This study included h-GCs from seven infertile women undergoing assisted reproductive techniques.
   Intervention(s): Human ovarian Granulosa Cell Tumor (GCT) cell line COV434 and h-GCs obtained after oocyte retrieval were cultured in the absence or presence of resveratrol.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Granulosa cells were evaluated for cell viability and mitochondrial activity. Electrophysiological recordings and evaluation of potassium current (IKur) and Ca2? concentration were also performed.
   Result(s): Resveratrol induced mitochondrial activity in a bell-shaped, dose-effect-dependent manner. Specifically, resveratrol treatment (3 mM, 48 hours) increased ATP production and cell viability and promoted the induction of cellular differentiation. These biological changes were associated with mitochondrial biogenesis. Electrophysiological recordings showed that resveratrol reduced the functional expression of an ultra rapid activating, slow inactivating, delayed rectifier potassium current (IKur) that is associated with a plasma membrane depolarization and that promotes an increase in intracellular Ca2? .
   Conclusion(s): The effects of resveratrol on potassium current and mitochondrial biogenesis in h-GCs could explain the beneficial effects of this polyphenol on the physiology of the female reproductive system. These findings suggest there are therapeutic implications of resveratrol in a clinical setting. (Fertil Sterile 2021;115:1063?73. ?2020 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.)

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The plant Arnica montana L. has been shown to alleviate inflammation, pain and swelling associated with trauma, and post-operative clinical conditions, yet the mechanism of action is not well understood.Aim of the study: The study was designed to investigate the effect of Arnica montana (A. montana) mother tincture and homeopathic dilutions on inflammation markers, oxidative stress and cell migration in diverse cell culture models.Materials and methods: We tested A. montana mother tincture and a range of homeopathic dilutions in different human and murine cell culture models to demonstrate their anti-inflammatory properties by measuring the inflammatory markers: tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell migration. The inflammatory markers were measured by ELISA assays. The intracellular oxidative stress (ROS) in microglial cells was measured using Deep Red CellROX probe. The cell migration was examined by wound healing using the Oris Cell migration assay.Results: These data showed the ability of A. montana (mother tincture and mainly 1C dilution) to significantly reduce TNF alpha production in inflamed macrophages compared with vehicle (control). They significantly reduced both IL-6 and MCP-1 in inflamed human microglial cells and significantly decreased COX-2 expression in inflamed murine fibroblasts. Moreover, A. montana mother tincture reduced the cell migration whereas 9C dilution significantly enhanced the migration of fibroblast cells compared with vehicle. The expression of ICAM-1 was significantly reduced with A. montana mother tincture and 1C, 3C, 5C, and 9C dilutions in inflamed human endothelial cells compared with vehicle. A. montana mother tincture and 1C, 3C, 5C and 9C dilutions induced a significant and consistent effect on ROS production in inflamed murine microglial cells. A. montana 1C had the largest impact on ROS production.AcknowledgmentsThis work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 82073725), and by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, South-Central MinZu University (Grant No. CZP22002; CZQ23025)Conclusions: Mother tincture and 1C dilution of A. montana showed anti-inflammatory properties assessed by measurement of several markers (pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecule, ROS) in various human and murine cell models. In addition, A. montana 3C, 5C, 9C dilutions have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects as highlighted on both primary endothelial cells and murine microglial cells.

AB  - Excessive levels of the mitochondrial reactive oxygen radical (mitSOX) and Ca2+ influx were found to cause neuropathic pain in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Naltriben (NLT) and mitSOX activate the transient receptor (TRP) melastatin 7 (TRPM7) channel, but antioxidants and carvacrol inhibit it. Selenium (Se) and curcumin (CRC) have been thoroughly studied for their modulator effects on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced neuropathic pain, apoptosis, and oxidative stress through the blockage of TRP channels in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. It has not yet been fully understood how Se and CRC protect against STZ-induced neuropathic pain by modulating TRPM7. Here, we assessed how Se and CRC affected the Ca2+ influx, mitSOX-mediated oxidative damage, and apoptosis in the DRGs of mice through modifying TRPM7 activity. Seven groups (control, Se, CRC, STZ, STZ + Se, STZ + CRC, and STZ + Se + CRC) were induced from the 56 male mice. We observed that the STZ-induced stimulation of TRPM7 increased mechanical neuropathic pain (von Frey), thermal neuropathic pain (hot plate), cytosolic Ca2+, TRPM7 current density, TRPM7 expression, lipid peroxidation, mitSOX, cytosolic ROS, apoptosis, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 concentrations, whereas Se and CRC therapies diminished the alterations. The STZ-mediated decreases of DRG viability, brain glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, vitamin A, and vitamin E concentrations were also upregulated in the treatment groups by the therapies. These findings collectively imply that an imbalance of neuropathic pain, oxidative neurotoxicity, and apoptosis in the mice is caused by the STZ-mediated activation of TRPM7. However, the downregulation of TRPM7 activity caused by the injections of Se and CRC reduced the neurotoxicity and apoptosis.

AB  - Due to the strong response to air exposure, high mortality was occurred in Coilia nasus. Previous studies reported that 10 %o NaCl could significantly reduce mortality in C. nasus under air exposure. To investigate the mechanisms that 10 %o NaCl can alleviate stress, community structure and metabolism of the intestinal flora of C. nasus were detected via metagenome and metabolome. In this study, C. nasus were divided into control group (C), air exposure group without 10 %o NaCl (AE), and air exposure group with 10 %o NaCl (AES). After air exposure stress and salinity mitigation, the mortality, intestinal microorganisms, metabolites, and physiological biomarkers were analyzed. The results showed that the mortality rate of C. nasus was reduced after salinity reduction; the antioxidant capacity was elevated compared to the AE group; and anti-inflammatory capacity was increased in the AES group compared to the AE group. Metagenomic sequencing results showed that the levels of harmful bacteria (E. coli, Aeromonas) in the Candida nasus gut increased after air exposure; beneficial bacteria (Actinobacteria, Corynebacteria) in the C. nasus gut increased after salinity reduction. Metabolomics analyses showed that AE decreased the expression of beneficial metabolites and increased the expression of harmful metabolites; AES increased beneficial metabolites and decreased harmful metabolites. Correlation analysis showed that in the AE group, beneficial metabolites were negatively correlated with oxidative stress and inflammatory response, while harmful metabolites were positively correlated with oxidative stress and inflammatory response, and were associated with bacterial communities such as Gillisia, Alkalitalia, Avipoxvirus, etc.; the correlation of metabolites with oxidative stress and inflammatory response was opposite to that of AE in the case of AES, and was associated with Lentilactobacillus, Cyanobacterium, and other bacterial communities. Air exposure caused damage to Candida rhinoceros and 10 %o salinity was beneficial in alleviating C. nasus stress. These results will provide new insights into methods and mechanisms to mitigate stress in fish.

AB  - Oleuropein (OLE), a main constituent of olives, displays a pleiotropic beneficial dynamic in health and disease; the effects are based mainly on its antioxidant and hypolipidemic properties, and its capacity to protect the myocardium during ischemia. Furthermore, OLE activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR ff) in neurons and astrocytes, providing neuroprotection against noxious biological reactions that are induced following cerebral ischemia. The current study investigated the effect of OLE in the regulation of various neural plasticity indices, emphasizing the role of PPARff. For this purpose, 129/Sv wild-type (WT) and Ppara-null mice were treated with OLE for three weeks. The findings revealed that chronic treatment with OLE up-regulated the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice via activation of the ERK1/2, AKT and PKA/CREB signaling pathways. No similar effects were observed in the hippocampus. The OLE-induced effects on BDNF and TrkB appear to be mediated by PPARff, because no similar alterations were observed in the PFC of Ppara-null mice. Notably, OLE did not affect the neurotrophic factors NT3 and NT4/5 in both brain tissues. However, fenofibrate, a selective PPARff agonist, up-regulated BDNF and NT3 in the PFC of mice, whereas the drug induced NT4/5 in both brain sites tested. Interestingly, OLE provided neuroprotection in differentiated human SH-SY5Y cells against fi-amyloid and H2O2 toxicity independently from PPAR ff activation. In conclusion, OLE and similar drugs, acting either as PPARff agonists or via PPARff independent mechanisms, could improve synaptic function/plasticity mainly in the PFC and to a lesser extent in the hippocampus, thus beneficially affecting cognitive functions.

AB  - Gastric cancer (GC) is a common digestive malignancy that causes numerous cancer-related deaths. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in the development of various tumors, including GC. In this study, we revealed that ELFN1-AS1, a lncRNA with aberrantly high expression, contributes to the proliferation and metastasis of GC. Mechanically, ELFN1-AS1 plays an oncogenic role by binding to the protein kinase domain of thousand and one amino acid protein kinase (TAOK1), a tumor suppressor in GC, and disrupting the TAOK1-STK3 interaction, leading to decreased STK3 phosphorylation. This decrease is accompanied by attenuation of the Hippo kinase cascade, resulting in reduced YAP1 phosphorylation, a crucial effector of the Hippo signaling pathway. Subsequently, the reduced YAP1 phosphorylation promotes its nuclear translocation, thereby enhancing the expression of MYC, a downstream target of the pathway and well-known oncogene. Taken together, the ELFN1-AS1/TAOK1/STK3/YAP1 axis may promote GC progression and is a promising target for GC treatment.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a complex pathophysiological process involving multiple mechanisms, including apoptosis and autophagy, which can lead to significant neuronal damage. PIEZO1, a stretch-activated ion channel, has recently emerged as a potential regulator of cellular responses to ischemic conditions. However, its role in neuronal cell survival and death during ischemic events is not well elucidated. This study aimed to ascertain the regulatory function of PIEZO1 in neuronal cell apoptosis and autophagy in an in vitro model of hypoxia-reoxygenation and an in vivo model of brain I/R injury. HT22 hippocampal neuronal cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to simulate ischemic conditions, with subsequent reoxygenation. In vitro, PIEZO1 expression was silenced using small interfering RNA (si-RNA) transfection. The effects on cell viability, apoptosis, and autophagy were assessed using CCK-8 assays, PI-Annexin/V staining combined with flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis. Additionally, intracellular Ca2+ levels in HT22 cells were measured using a Ca2+ probe. The involvement of the AMPK-mTOR pathway was investigated using rapamycin. For in vivo validation, middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) in rats was employed. To determine the neuroprotective role of PIEZO1 silencing, sh-PIEZO1 adeno-associated virus was stereotaxically injected into the cerebral ventricle, and neurological and histological outcomes were assessed using neurological scoring, TTC staining, H&E staining, Nissl staining, and immunofluorescence. In HT22 cells, OGD/R injury notably upregulated PIEZO1 expression and intracellular Ca2+ levels. Silencing PIEZO1 significantly diminished OGD/R-induced Ca2+ influx, apoptosis, and autophagy, as indicated by lower levels of pro-apoptotic and autophagy-related proteins and improved cell viability. Additionally, PIEZO1 modulated the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway, an effect that was counteracted by rapamycin treatment, implying its regulatory role. In vivo, PIEZO1 silencing ameliorated brain I/R injury in MCAO/R rats, demonstrated by improved neurological function scores and reduced neuronal apoptosis and autophagy. However, these neuroprotective effects were reversed through rapamycin treatment. Our findings indicate that PIEZO1 is upregulated following ischemic injury and facilitates Ca2+ influx, apoptosis, and autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR pathway. Silencing PIEZO1 confers neuroprotection against I/R injury both in vitro and in vivo, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for stroke management.

AB  - The use of animal as opposed to human skin for in vitro permeation testing (IVPT) is an alternative, which can reduce logistical and economic issues. However, this surrogate also has ethical considerations and may not provide an accurate estimation of dermal absorption in humans due to physiological differences. The current project aimed to provide a detailed repository for the anatomical and physiological parameters of porcine skin, with the aim of parametrizing the Multi-phase Multi-layer Mechanistic Dermal Absorption (MPML MechDermA) Model in the Simcyp Simulator. The MPML MechDermA Model is a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that accounts for the physiology and geometry of skin in a mechanistic mathematical modelling framework. The database provided herein contains information on 14 parameters related to porcine skin anatomy and physiology, namely, skin surface pH, number of stratum corneum (SC) layers, SC thickness, corneocyte thickness, corneocyte dimensions (length and width), volume fraction of water in corneocyte (where SC is divided into four parts with different water contents), intercellular lipid thickness, viable epidermis thickness, dermis thickness, hair follicle and hair shaft diameter, hair follicle depth and hair follicle density. The collected parameters can be used to parameterize PBPK models, which could be further utilized to bridge the gap between animal and human studies with interspecies extrapolation or to predict dermatokinetic properties typically assessed in IVPT experiments.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal-associated staphylococci have been isolated in human infections. Therefore, these strains may pose a zoonotic risk in addition to constituting a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance genes. In this study, we isolated Staphylococcus aureus and other species of staphylococci from camels used for recreational activities in the Canary Islands. Most S. aureus lacked the antimicrobial resistance genes, but some staphylococci species carried the mecA gene which confers resistance to methicillin. The carriage of this gene conferring resistance to methicillin in staphylococci isolated from camels may be a public health concern since there is a risk of bacterial transmission to humans during recreational activities. Furthermore, since the Canary Islands are the only camel exporter to the European Union, camels could constitute a source of zoonotic agents to the rest of the European countries. Several different species of animals host staphylococci as normal microbiota. These animals can be a source of staphylococci zoonotic infections. People with routine or occupational exposure to infected/colonized animals are at risk of a potential transmission. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the presence of S. aureus and other staphylococci in camels used for recreational purposes as well as their antimicrobial resistance, virulence factors and genetic lineages. A total of 172 samples were collected from 86 healthy camels (nose and mouth) from different farms located in the Canary Islands, Spain. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed against 14 antimicrobial agents. The presence of virulence genes was studied by PCR. Multilocus sequence typing, spa typing and agr typing were performed in all S. aureus isolates. From the 86 camels tested, 42 staphylococci were isolated, of which there were 11 S. aureus, 13 S. lentus, 12 S. sciuri, 3 S. xylosus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis and S. chromogenes. Staphylococci isolates were resistant to penicillin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin and fusidic acid. All S. aureus isolates harbored the hla, hlb and hld virulence genes. S. aureus isolates were ascribed to three sequence types (STs) and three spa types. All S. aureus isolates belonged to agr type III. Camels from Gran Canaria used in recreational purposes have a moderate prevalence of S. aureus and other coagulase-negative staphylococci. Nevertheless, S. aureus isolates are susceptible to almost all antibiotics tested.

AB  - The inability to support the growth and development of a mature fetus up to delivery results in significant human suffering. Current available solutions include adoption, surrogacy, and uterus transplantation. However, these options are subject to several ethical, religious, economic, social, and medical concerns. Ectogenesis is the process in which an embryo develops in an artificial uterus from implantation through to the delivery of a live infant. This current narrative review summarizes the state of recent research focused on human ectogenesis. First, a literature search was performed to identify published reports of previous experiments and devices used for embryo implantation in an extracorporeally perfused human uterus. Furthermore, studies fitting that aim were selected and critically evaluated. Results were synthesized, interpreted, and used to design a prospective strategy for future research. Therefore, this study suggests that full ectogenesis might be obtained using a computer-controlled system with extracorporeal blood perfusion provided by a digitally controlled heart-lung-kidney system. From a clinical perspective, patients who will derive significant benefits from this technology are mainly those women diagnosed with anatomical abnormalities of the uterus and those who have undergone previous hysterectomies, numerous abortions, and experienced premature birth. Ectogenesis is the complete development of an embryo in an artificial uterus. It represents the solutions for millions of women suffering from premature deliveries, and the inability to supply growth and development of embryos/fetuses in the womb. In the future, ectogenesis might replace uterine transplantation and surrogacy.

AB  - The dentate gyrus (DG) receives substantial input from the homologous brain area of the contralateral hemisphere. This input is by and large excitatory. Viral-tracing experiments provided anatomical evidence for the existence of GABAergic connectivity between the two DGs, but the function of these projections has remained elusive. Combining electrophysiological and optogenetic approaches, we demonstrate that somatostatin-expressing contralateral DG (SOM+ cDG)-projecting neurons preferentially engage dendrite-targeting interneurons over principal neurons. Single-unit recordings from freely moving mice reveal that optogenetic stimulation of SOM+ cDG projections modulates the activity of GABAergic neurons and principal neurons over multiple timescales. Importantly, we demonstrate that optogenetic silencing of SOM+ cDG projections during spatial memory encoding, but not during memory retrieval, results in compromised DG-dependent memory. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of SOM+ cDG projections is sufficient to disrupt contextual memory recall. Collectively, our findings reveal that SOM+ long-range projections mediate inter-DG inhibition and contribute to learning and memory.

AB  - The objectives of the study were to test the biological activities of peppermint and spearmint oils via (i) measuring in vitro anti-inflammatory effects with porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), (ii) determining the barrier integrity of IPEC-J2 by analyzing transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), (iii) testing their antioxidant activities, and (iv) investigating the antimicrobial activity against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) F18+. Briefly, (i) macrophages were seeded at 10(6) cells/mL and treated (24 h) with mint oils and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The treatments were 2 (0 or 1 mu g/mL of LPS) x 5 (0, 25, 50, 100, 200 mu g/mL of mint oils). The supernatants were collected for TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta measurement by ELISA; (ii) IPEC-J2 cells were seeded at 5 x 10(5) cells/mL and treated with mint oils (0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mu g/mL). TEER (omega cm(2)) was measured at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h; (iii) the antioxidant activity was assessed (0, 1, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 600 mg/mL) using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and reducing power assays; (iv) overnight-grown ETEC F18+ were quantified (CFU/mL) after supplementing with peppermint and spearmint oils (0, 1.44, 2.87, 5.75, 11.50, and 23.00 mg/mL). All data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure. Both mint oils significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha secretion from LPS-stimulated PAMs. Mint oil treatments did not affect TEER in IPEC-J2. Spearmint and peppermint oils exhibited (p < 0.05) strong antioxidant activities in DPPH and reducing power assays. Both mint oils also dose-dependently inhibited (p < 0.05) the growth of ETEC F18+ in vitro. The results of the study indicated that both mint oils are great candidate feed additives due to their in vitro anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial effects. Further research is needed to evaluate their efficacy in vivo.

Methods: Clinical data were collected from 190 subjects including 110 TLE patients and 80 healthy people. Cognitive function was assessed using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R) scale. Serum levels of APOE were measured using ELISA kits. Genotyping of APOE in peripheral blood was detected by microarray hybridization. Results: Patients with TLE had significantly lower ACE-R total score, memory and verbal fluency scores compared to the healthy group. Serum levels of APOE were significantly higher in TLE patients than in the healthy subjects. Serum APOE levels were significantly negatively correlated with ACE-R total score, memory and verbal fluency scores. The cognitive function score of TLE with APOE e4 allele was lower than that of TLE without APOE e4

AB  - Context The traditional Chinese medicine formula Tao-Hong-Si-Wu decoction (TSD), used for treating ischaemic stroke, has the potential to treat depressive disorder (DD). Objective To explore the effective targets of TSD on DD animal models. Materials and methods Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were modelled by inducing chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) during 35 days and treated with three dosages of TSD (2.5, 5 and 10 g/kg) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) by oral gavage for 14 days. Bodyweight measurements and behavioural tests were performed to observe the effect of TSD on the CUMS animals. A gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomic analysis was conducted to reveal the metabolic characteristics related to the curative effect of TSD. Levels of the proteins associated with the feature metabolites were analysed. Results Reduced immobile duration and crossed squares in the behavioural tests were raised by 48.6% and 32.9%, on average, respectively, by TSD treatment (ED50=3.2 g/kg). Antidepressant effects of TSD were associated with 13 decreased metabolites and the restorations of ornithine and urea in the serum. TSD (5 g/kg) raised serum serotonin by 54.1 mg/dL but suppressed arginase I (Arg I) by 47.8 mg/dL in the CUMS rats. Proteins on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) axis that modulate the inhibition of Arg I were suppressed in the CUMS rats but reversed by the TSD intervention. Discussion and conclusions TSD improves depression-like symptoms in CUMS rats. Further study will focus on the antidepressant-like effects of effective compounds contained in TSD.

AB  - This work aimed to evaluate the potential of two cultivars of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum), canara and capia & ccedil;u, as feedstocks for energy purposes through levoglucosan production by fast pyrolysis. Levoglucosan is an anhydrous pyrolytic sugar that has great potential as a fermentation substrate for the obtaining of biofuels. Then, pyrolysis experiments were carried out seeking to intensify the levoglucosan production through the evaluation of the thermochemical conversion at 400, 500, and 600 degrees C, with biomass acid pretreatment (5, 10, and 15% v/v acetic acid) for canara and capia & ccedil;u biomasses, and 50% canara/capia & ccedil;u mixtures for co-pyrolysis. Structural as well as physicochemical composition changes after biomass acid treatment were observed prior pyrolysis. Statistical analysis revealed that pyrolysis temperature and biomass type significantly affected levoglucosan production at p < 0.1. Then, optimization by using the Design-Expert software pointed out that canara cultivar had the greatest potential since produced around fivefold more levoglucosan than untreated biomass and almost twofold more than capia & ccedil;u at 500 degrees C. However, co-pyrolysis seems to be a good alternative when biomass mixtures from different cultivars/varieties are available. Thus, the results from this study can be interesting to support lignocellulosic feedstock diversification to attaining pyrolytic compounds with special focus in anhydrosugars for renewable fuel production, adding value to the elephant grass productive chain.

AB  - Nanoparticles (NPs) based therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) attract interest due to their ability to pass across or bypass the blood-brain barrier. Chitosan (CS) NPs or graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are promising drug carriers with excellent physicochemical and electrical properties. The current study proposes the combination of CS and GQDs in ultrasmall NP form not as drug carriers but as theranostic agents for AD. The microfluidic-based synthesis of the CS/GQD NPs with optimized characteristics makes them ideal for transcellular transfer and brain targeting after intranasal (IN) delivery. The NPs have the ability to enter the cytoplasm of C6 glioma cells in vitro and show dose and time-dependent effects on the viability of the cells. IN administration of the NPs to streptozotocin (STZ) induced AD-like models lead to a significant number of entrances of the treated rats to the target arm in the radial arm water maze (RAWM) test. It shows the positive effect of the NPs on the memory recovery of the treated rats. The NPs are detectable in the brain via in vivo bioimaging due to GQDs as diagnostic markers. The noncytotoxic NPs localize in the myelinated axons of hippocampal neurons. They do not affect the clearance of amyloid beta (A beta) plaques at intercellular space. Moreover, they showed no positive impact on the enhancement of MAP2 and NeuN expression as markers of neural regeneration. The memory improvement in treated AD rats may be due to neuroprotection via the anti-inflammation effect and regulation of the brain tissue microenvironment that needs to be studied.

AB  - Background: Dietary supplementation with L-arginine (Arg) has been shown to increase the volume of fetal fluids in gestating swine. Aquaporins (AQPs), known as water channel proteins, are essential for embryonic growth and development. It was not known if Arg mediates water transport through AQPs in porcine conceptus trophectoderm (pTr2) cells. Methods: pTr2 cells derived from pregnant gilts on day 12 of gestation were cultured in customized Arg-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Ham medium (DMEM) supplemented with either 0.00, 0.25, or 0.50 mM Arg. Results: Arg treatment increased water transport and the expression of AQP3, which was abundantly expressed in pTr2 cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. Arg also increased the expression of iNOS and the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) in pTr2 cells. The presence of N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME; an inhibitor of NO synthase) significantly attenuated the Arg-induced expression of AQP3. Furthermore, 0.50 mM Arg increased the concentrations of cAMP and the abundances of phosphorylated cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), phosphorylated PKA oi/beta/gamma, and phosphorylated CREB. These effects of Arg were mimicked by Forskolin (a cell-permeable activator of adenylyl cyclase), but inhibited by H-89 (an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase). Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that Arg regulates AQP3 expression and promotes water transport in pTr2 cells through NO- and cAMP-dependent signaling pathways.

AB  - The emergence of various variants of concern (VOCs) necessitates the development of more efficient vaccines for COVID-19. In this study, we established a rapid and robust production platform for a novel subunit vaccine candidate based on eukaryotic HEK-293 T cells. The immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate was evaluated in pigs. The results demonstrated that the pseudovirus neutralizing antibody (pNAb) titers reached 7751 and 306 for the SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants, respectively, after the first boost. Subsequently, pNAb titers further increased to 10,201 and 1350, respectively, after the second boost. Additionally, ELISPOT analysis revealed a robust T-cell response characterized by IFN-gamma (171 SFCs/106 cells) and IL-2 (101 SFCs/106 cells) production. Our study demonstrates that a vaccine candidate based on the Delta variant spike protein may provide strong and broad protection against the prototype SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs. Moreover, the strategy for the efficient and stable expression of recombinant proteins utilizing HEK-293 T cells can be employed as a universal platform for future vaccine development.

AB  - Minks and brown rats are reservoir hosts for many endoparasites including those of the genus Trichinella, a group of parasite nematodes with a worldwide distribution. However, little is known about the prevalence of Trichinella sp. infection in the American mink (Neovison vison) and rats (Rattus norvegicus) in China. Therefore, we aimed to examine the prevalence of Trichinella sp. infection in farmed minks in Weihai city, Shandong province, China and infer the possible route for Trichinella transmission to farmed American minks. In total, 289 muscle samples from minks and 102 carcasses of rats were collected from Weihai City. The appearance of Trichinella sp. was examined using the pooled artificial HCl-pepsin digestion method. The results showed that muscle larvae were detected in 20 of 289 minks (6.92%) and 2 of 102 synanthropic rats (1.96%). The larval density of Trichinella sp. in mink samples ranged from 0.025 to 0.815 larvae per gram (lpg), while the average larval burden in rats was 0.17 lpg. The isolates derived from minks and rats were identified at the species level using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which revealed that the size of the two PCR products matched that of T. spiralis at 173 bp. Furthermore, sequence analysis showed 100% identity of the 5S rDNA inter-gene spacer regions of the two isolates to that of T. spiralis. This study presents a novel report of T. spiralis-mediated infection in minks and synanthropic rats in China. We highlight the vulnerability of farmed minks to Trichinella infection through exposure to synanthropic rats, which may raise a public health concern of potential zoonotic risks for domestic animals.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate Haloperidol's (Hal) effects on the behavioral, neurotrophic factors, and epigenetic parameters in an animal model of schizophrenia (SCZ) induced by ketamine (Ket). Injections of Ket or saline were administered intraperitoneal (once a day) between the 1st and 14th days of the experiment. Water or Hal was administered via gavage between the 8th and 14th experimental days. Thirty minutes after the last injection, the animals were subjected to behavioral analysis. The activity of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), histone deacetylase (HDAC), and histone acetyltransferase and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were evaluated in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Ket increased the covered distance and time spent in the central area of the open field, and Hal did not reverse these behavioral alterations. Significant increases in the DNMT and HDAC activities were detected in the frontal cortex and striatum from rats that received Ket, Hal, or a combination thereof. Besides, Hal per se increased the activity of DNMT and HDAC in the hippocampus of rats. Hal per se or the association of Ket plus Hal decreased BDNF, NGF, NT-3, and GDNF, depending on the brain region and treatment regimen. The administration of Hal can alter the levels of neurotrophic factors and the activity of epigenetic enzymes, which can be a factor in the development of effect collateral in SCZ patients. However, the precise mechanisms involved in these alterations are still unclear.

AB  - Incorporating blast furnace slag into the composition of paving concrete can be one of the cost-effective ways to completely eliminate by-products from the pig iron production process (approximately 70% granulated slag and 30% air-cooled slag). The possibility to reintroduce blast furnace slag back into the life cycle will provide significant support to current environmental concerns and the clearance of tailings landfills. Especially in recent years, granulated and ground blast furnace slag (GGBS) as a substitute for cement and air-cooled blast furnace slag (ACBFS) aggregates as a substitute for natural aggregates in the composition of concretes have been studied by many researchers. But concrete compositions with large amounts of incorporated blast furnace slag affect the mechanical and durability properties through the interaction between the slag, cement and water depending on the curing times. This study focuses on identifying the optimal proportions of GGBS as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM) and ACBFS aggregates as a substitute to natural sand such that the performance at 90 days of curing the concrete is similar to that of the control concrete. In addition, to minimize the costs associated with grinding GGBS, the hydration activity index (HAI) of the GGBS, the surface morphology, and the mineral components were analyzed via X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDX), and nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry (NMR). The flexural strength, the basic mechanical property of road concretes, increased from 28 to 90 days by 20.72% and 20.26% for the slag concrete but by 18.58% for the reference concrete. The composite with 15% GGBS and 25% ACBFS achieved results similar to the reference concrete at 90 days; therefore, they are considered optimal percentages to replace cement and natural sand in ecological pavement concretes. The HAI of the slag powder with a specific surface area equivalent to that of Portland cement fell into strength class 80 at the age of 28 days, but at the age of 90 days, the strength class was 100. The results of this research present three important benefits: the first is the protection of the environment through the recycling of two steel industry wastes that complies with European circular economy regulations, and the second is linked to the consequent savings in the disposal costs associated with wastefully occupied warehouses and the savings in slag grinding.

AB  - Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a multisystem disorder associated with multiple congenital anomalies, variable medical features, and neurodevelopmental differences resulting in diverse psychiatric phenotypes, including marked deficits in facial memory and social cognition. Neuroimaging in individuals with 22q11.2DS has revealed differences relative to matched controls in BOLD fMRI activation during facial affect processing tasks. However, time-varying interactions between brain areas during facial affect processing have not yet been studied with BOLD fMRI in 22q11.2DS. We applied constrained principal component analysis to identify temporally overlapping brain activation patterns from BOLD fMRI data acquired during an emotion identification task from 58 individuals with 22q11.2DS and 58 age-, race-, and sex-matched healthy controls. Delayed frontal-motor feedback signals were diminished in individuals with 22q11.2DS, as were delayed emotional memory signals engaging amygdala, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. Early task-related engagement of motor and visual cortices and salience-related insular activation were relatively preserved in 22q11.2DS. Insular activation was associated with task performance within the 22q11.2DS sample. Differences in cortical surface area, but not cortical thickness, showed spatial alignment with an activation pattern associated with face processing. These findings suggest that relative to matched controls, primary visual processing and insular function are relatively intact in individuals with 22q11.22DS, while motor feedback, face processing, and emotional memory processes are more affected. Such insights may help inform potential interventional targets and enhance the specificity of neuroimaging indices of cognitive dysfunction in 22q11.2DS.

AB  - Possible high biodeterioration of the microorganisms due to their metabolic pathway and activities on stone materials causes solemn problems in cultural heritage. Different kinds of laboratory-scale methods have been used for the reduction of microbial growth, that is, chemical, mechanical, and physical, which are cost-effective and not ecofriendly. In the current study, an ecofriendly approach utilizing silver nanoparticles were synthesized using sheep blood serum. Transmission electron microscopy results have confirmed the spherical and well dispersed silver nanoparticles with an average size of 32.49 nm, while energy dispersive X-ray has shown the abundance of silver nanoparticles. The efficiency against bacterial species was verified through laboratory-scale testing. The strong antibacterial activity was confirmed when B-AgNPs was tested against different bacterial species isolated from the Beishiku Cave Temple. The largest zone of inhibition was measured 26.48 +/- 0.14 mm against Sphingomonas sp. while the smallest zone of inhibition measured was 9.70 +/- 0.27 mm against Massilia sp. Moreover, these ecofriendly B-AgNPs were tested for daily based dose in different concentrations (0.03, 0.06, and 0.09 mg/L) against common carp fish for a long exposure (20 days) and 6.5% fatality was found. The highest lethal concentration (LC50) for fish (0.61 +/- 0.09 mg/L). No doubt, the laboratory scale applications have revealed the best results with minute toxicity in fish. Therefore, sheep serum should be continued to synthesize silver nanoparticles on a large scale. A strict monitoring system should be developed for the synthesis and application of AgNPs.

AB  - Firefighters are exposed to carcinogenic and mutagenic combustion emissions, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Fire service and firefighter cancer advocacy groups recommend skin cleaning using wipes or washing with detergent and water after exposure to smoke, although these strategies have not been proven to reduce exposures to harmful combustion products such as PAHs. This study assessed dermal decontamination methods to reduce PAH exposures by firefighters participating in live fire training scenarios. Study participants (n = 88) were randomly assigned to an intervention group (i.e., two types of commercial skin wipes, detergent and water, or a control group who did not use any skin decontamination). PAHs were measured in personal air (during the fire) and dermal wipe samples (before and after fire suppression and after dermal decontamination). PAH metabolites and mutagenicity were measured in urine samples before and after fire suppression. Airborne PAH concentrations during the fire ranged between 200 and 3,970 mu g/m(3) (mean = 759 mu g/m(3), SD = 685 mu g/m(3)). Firefighters had higher total PAHs and high-molecular-weight PAHs on their skin after the fire compared to before (1.3- and 2.2-fold, respectively, p < 0.01). Urinary PAH metabolites increased significantly following exposure to the training fires by 1.7 to 2.2-fold (depending on the metabolite, p < 0.001). Urinary mutagenicity did not differ significantly between pre- and post-fire for any of the decontamination methods. Detergent and water was the only intervention that removed a significant amount of total PAHs from the skin (0.72 ng/cm(2) preintervention vs. 0.38 ng/cm(2) postintervention, p < 0.01). However, fold changes in urinary PAH metabolites (i.e., pre- vs. post-exposure levels) did not differ among any of the dermal decontamination methods or the control group. These data suggest that despite on-site attempts to remove PAHs from firefighters' skin, the examined interventions did not reduce the internal dose of PAHs. Future work should investigate preventing initial exposure using other interventions, such as improved personal protective equipment.

AB  - Insects rely on olfaction to guide a wide range of adaptive behaviors, including mate and food localization, mate choice, oviposition site selection, kin recognition, and predator avoidance.1 In nocturnal insects, such as moths2 and cockroaches,3 mate finding is stimulated predominantly by long-range species-specific sex pheromones, typically emitted by females. During courtship, at close range, males in most moth species emit a blend of pheromone compounds from an everted, often large, pheromone gland. While long-distance communication with sex pheromones has been remarkably well characterized in thousands of moth species,2,4 close-range chemosensory sexual communication remains poorly understood. We reveal that in the moth Chloridea virescens, the male pheromone consists of three distinct classes of compounds: de novo biosynthesized alcohols, aldehydes, acetates, and carboxylic acids that resemble the female's emissions; newly identified compounds that are unique to the male pheromone, such as aliphatic polyunsaturated hydrocarbons; and sequestered plant secondary compounds and hormone derivatives, including methyl salicylate (MeSA). Thus, males employ a mosaic pheromone blend of disparate origins that may serve multiple functions during courtship. We show that two olfactory receptors in female antennae are tuned to MeSA, which facilitates female acceptance of the male. Because MeSA is emitted by plants attacked by pathogens and herbivores,5 the chemosensory system of female moths was likely already tuned to this plant volatile, and males appear to exploit the female's preadapted sensory bias. Interestingly, while female moths (largely nocturnal) and butterflies (diurnal) diverged in their use of sensory modalities in sexual communication,6 MeSA is used by males of both lineages.

AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Approximately 1 million infants born with HIE each year survive with cerebral palsy and/or serious cognitive disabilities. While infants born with mild and severe HIE frequently result in predictable outcomes, infants born with moderate HIE exhibit variable outcomes that are highly unpredictable. Here, we describe an umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) model of moderate HIE with a 6-day follow-up. Near-term lambs (n = 27) were resuscitated after the induction of 5 min of asystole. Following recovery, lambs were assessed to define neurodevelopmental outcomes. At the end of this period, lambs were euthanized, and brains were harvested for histological analysis. Compared with prior models that typically follow lambs for 3 days, the observation of neurobehavioral outcomes for 6 days enabled identification of animals that recover significant neurological function. Approximately 35% of lambs exhibited severe motor deficits throughout the entirety of the 6-day course and, in the most severely affected lambs, developed spastic diparesis similar to that observed in infants who survive severe neonatal HIE (severe, UCOs). Importantly, and similar to outcomes in human neonates, while initially developing significant acidosis and encephalopathy, the remainder of the lambs in this model recovered normal motor activity and exhibited normal neurodevelopmental outcomes by 6 days of life (improved, UCOi). The UCOs group exhibited gliosis and inflammation in both white and gray matters, oligodendrocyte loss, neuronal loss, and cellular death in the hippocampus and cingulate cortex. While the UCOi group exhibited more cellular death and gliosis in the parasagittal cortex, they demonstrated more preserved white matter markers, along with reduced markers of inflammation and lower cellular death and neuronal loss in Ca3 of the hippocampus compared with UCOs lambs. Our large animal model of moderate HIE with prolonged follow-up will help further define pathophysiologic drivers of brain injury while enabling identification of predictive biomarkers that correlate with disease outcomes and ultimately help support development of therapeutic approaches to this challenging clinical scenario.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is a key feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and stem cell therapies have emerged as promising candidates due to their immunomodulatory properties. Neuro-Cells (NC), a combination of unmodified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), have demonstrated therapeutic potential in models of central nervous system (CNS) injury and neurodegeneration. Here, we studied the effects of NC in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, an AD mouse model. Twelve-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice or their wild-type littermates were injected with NC or vehicle into the cisterna magna. Five to six weeks post-injection, cognitive, locomotor, and emotional behaviors were assessed. The brain was stained for amyloid plaque density using Congo red, and for astrogliosis using DAPI and GFAP staining. Gene expression of immune activation markers (Il-1 beta, Il-6, Cd45, Tnf) and plasticity markers (Tub beta 3, Bace1, Trem2, Stat3) was examined in the prefrontal cortex. IL-6 secretion was measured in cultured human monocytes following endotoxin challenge and NC treatment. Untreated APPswe/PS1dE9 mice displayed impaired learning in the conditioned taste aversion test, reduced object exploration, and anxiety-like behavior, which were improved in the NC-treated mutants. NC treatment normalized the expression of several immune and plasticity markers and reduced the density of GFAP-positive cells in the hippocampus and thalamus. NC treatment decreased amyloid plaque density in the hippocampus and thalamus, targeting plaques of <100 mu m(2). Additionally, NC treatment suppressed IL-6 secretion by human monocytes. Thus, NC treatment alleviated behavioral deficits and reduced amyloid plaque formation in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, likely via anti-inflammatory mechanisms. The reduction in IL-6 production in human monocytes further supports the potential of NC therapy for the treatment of AD.

TI  - Neurite development varies across the hippocampus and covaries with the cellular composition of hippocampal tissue
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
LA  - English

KW  - CONNECTIVITY
KW  - PATTERNS
AB  - The hippocampus is a critical brain structure supporting memory encoding and retrieval, yet the development of its microstructure in humans remains unknown. Understanding this development may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying memory and their disruption in disease. To address this, we non-invasively estimated the density and branching complexity of neurite (dendrites, axons, glial processes) using diffusion-weighted MRI in 364 participants aged 8-21. With development, large increases in neurite density and branching complexity persisted until similar to 15 years of age before stabilizing at adult-like values. Neurite density increases were relatively homogenous across hippocampal axes, whereas branching-complexity increases were heterogeneous: increasing primarily in CA1, SRLM, subiculum, and anterior hippocampus. To assess whether this development may be attributable to specific cell-types, we tested for spatial overlap between age-related change in neurite and cell-type composition of the adult hippocampus via cross-reference with an out-of-sample gene-expression atlas. We found age-related changes in neurite density occur in hippocampal locations which, in adults, consist of granule cells, whereas age-related changes in neurite branching complexity occur in locations consisting of pyramidal neurons. These results provide the first glimpse at the nonlinear maturation of hippocampal microstructure and the cell-type composition of hippocampal tissue underlying these changes.

AB  - Blood platelets are best known for their roles in hemostasis and thrombosis, but platelets also make important contributions to inflammation, immunity, and inflammatory resolution. Experiments involving depletion, genetic modification, and live imaging of platelets in animal models have increased our mechanistic understanding of platelet contributions to inflammation. In this minireview, we provide a critical overview of experimental techniques for manipulating and imaging platelets in inflammation models. We then highlight studies using innovative approaches to elucidate molecular mechanisms through which platelet subsets, platelet Fc gamma receptors, and pro-resolution platelet functions influence inflammatory responses. We also propose future technologies and research directions which might move us closer to harnessing of platelet functions for improved therapeutic modulation of inflammatory diseases.

AB  - Early postnatal development is a critical period for the configuration of neural networks that support social and affective-like behaviors. In this sense, children raised in stressful environments are at high risk to develop maladaptive behaviors immediately or later in life, including anti-social and aggressive behaviors. However, the neurobiological bases of such phenomena remain poorly understood. Here we showed that, at long-term, maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW) decreased the density of somatostatin-expressing (SST+) neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of females and males, while their activity was only reduced in the medial amygdala (MeA) of males. Interestingly, only MSEW males exhibited long-term behavioral effects, including reduced sociability and social novelty preference in the 3-chamber test (3CH), decreased social interest in the resident-intruder test (RI), and increased aggressivity in both the RI and the tube dominance test (TT). To test whether the manipulation of MeASST+ neurons was sufficient to reverse these negative behavioral outcomes, we expressed the chemogenetic excitatory receptor hM3Dq in MSEW adult males. We found that the activation of MeASST+ neurons ameliorated social interest in the RI test and reduced aggression traits in the TT and RI assays. Altogether, our results highlight a role for MeASST+ neurons in the regulation of aggressivity and social interest and point to the loss of activity of these neurons as a plausible etiological mechanism linking early life stress to these maladaptive behaviors in later life.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of the study is to improve elephant habitats by restoring them with wild grass fodder. Based on the feeding behaviour and food spectrum of elephants, the study documented 30 grass fodders. We used standard protocols to assess the nutritional analysis, and finally the study identified five nutrient rich potential grass fodder, viz., Cynodon dactylon, Dichanthium aristatum, Heteropogon contortus, Oplismenus burmannii and Themeda triandra for fodder bank development in corridors and fringe areas to improve the habitat of elephants. Hence, the findings are crucial and can be utilized for the management and conservation of elephantsin the Coimbatore Elephant Reserve (CER). An elephant, being a mega herbivore, consumes large amounts of food. Due to the lack of availability of fodder inside the forest, the elephants move out of their habitat areas and also find agricultural crops attractive, which further results in man-animal conflict. To improve the elephant habitat area, the current study was conducted to assess the availability of native fodder grasses inside the Coimbatore Elephant Reserve, Western Ghats, from April 2021-April 2022. The area falls between 10 degrees 37 ' and 11 degrees 31 ' North latitudes and 76 degrees 39 ' and 77 degrees 5 ' East longitudes. It was approached in a systematic random sampling method. A total of 128 sample plots of 1 sq.m size were randomly placed, and the density of grass species was recorded in percentage (%). The collected samples were shade dried for one week, ground to pass through a 1 mm sieve, and stored in polythene bags. Furthermore, the samples were chemically analyzed to determine their nutritional values. The dry matter (DM) content of various grass fodder varied from 28.18% to 59.75%. The crude protein (CP) content differed between 5.94% and 11.94%. The highest CP was recorded in Cynodon dactylon (11.94%) and the least in Aristida setacea (5.94%). Ether extract content was found in the ranges of 1.00% to 5.00%. The acid detergent fibre (ADF) content of Aristida setacea (45.74%) was observed as the highest, whereas the lowest was observed in Oplismenus burmannii (26.78%), followed by Themeda triandra (26.85%), Heteropogon contortus (30.12%) and Enteropogon monostachyos (30.31%). The average neutral detergent fibre content of grass fodder was 52.27%, with a range of 37.89% (Oplismenus burmannii) to 67.87% (Cymbopogon martinii). The average total digestible nutrient (TDN) content of grass was 77.45%; relative forage quality (RFQ) exhibited wider variations among the grasses and ranged between 107.51 and 198.83. This study is a pioneer in evaluating the nutritional values of native grass fodder species for elephants in the Western Ghats. The study gives strategies for the selection of high nutritive fodder grass for the habitat improvement of elephants, and it also provides scientific and baseline information for the conservation of native grass fodder species in the Western Ghats.

AB  - Light pollution has become a potential health risk factor worldwide. Chronic exposure to constant light (CCL) leads to depressive-like behavior, yet the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, mice exposed to CCL for 3 weeks exhibited depression-like behaviors, with decreased melatonin in plasma and increased oxidative stress in hippocampus. Meanwhile, CCL-exposed mice showed elevated plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels and diminished glucocorticoid receptor (GR) phosphorylation in hippocampus. Concurrently, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK38) was inactivated with increased phosphorylation at Ser9. The interrelationship of GSK38 and GR was clarified in mouse hippocampal neuron (HT-22) cells. GSK38 inhibitor CHIR-99021 induced GR inhibition with diminished phosphorylation, while GR inhibitor RU486 did not affect GSK38 expression or phosphorylation. Furthermore, GSK38-mediated GR inhibition was reproduced in vitro in HT-22 cells treated with melatonin receptor antagonist luzindole and H2O2 in combination. Finally, melatonin reversed GSK38-mediated GR inhibition in hippocampus and improved CCL-induced depression-like behavior in mice. These results indicate that CCL induces melatonin deficiency and oxidative stress in hippocampus, which in turn leads to GSK38-mediated GR inhibition and depression-like behavior in mice.

AB  - Context Catalase, an antioxidant, prolonged camel sperm survival during storage at 5 degrees C; however, its effect on storage of camel embryos at 4 degrees C is unknown.Aims This study aims to evaluate the possibility of improving pregnancy rates for embryos stored at 4 degrees C for 24-72 h in catalase-supplemented media.Methods Embryos recovered from camels flushed 8 days after mating were deposited in Eppendorf tubes containing embryo holding media, either supplemented with 500 IU catalase (Group 1) or without supplementation (Group 2). These Eppendorf tubes were placed in an Equitainer and cooled to 4 degrees C. After 24 h, 11 embryos in each group were transferred into recipients 7 days after gonadotropin-releasing hormone injection, and the remainder was placed in the fridge at 4 degrees C for a further 24 (n = 11/group) or 48 h (n = 11/group) before transfer.Key results A non-significant increase in pregnancy rate was achieved from embryos cooled in media containing catalase compared with the controls at 24 and 48 h, although there was no difference at 72 h (9/11 (82%) vs 5/11 (45%), 7/11 (64%) vs 2/11 (18%) and 2/11 (18%) vs 2/11 (18%), for with catalase vs controls at 24, 48 or 72 h respectively).Conclusions These results showed that there was a tendency for improved pregnancy rates at 24 (82% vs 45%) and 48 h (64% vs 18%) of cooling in catalase-supplemented media compared with controls. This improvement was not evident at 72 h.Implications The ability to keep embryos at 4 degrees C for 24-48 h reduces the need for such tight synchronization between donors and recipients.

AB  - Subterranean termites, particularly Microcerotermes diversus, are destructive pests in tropical regions, including southwestern Iran, necessitating effective bait formulations for sustainable control. This study evaluated the preferences of *M. diversus* workers for various wood types (date palm, red gum, European aspen, and MDF), binding materials (starch and clay), presentation forms (powdered, simple compressed, and porous compressed), and additives (sodium bicarbonate, pure cellulose, yeast, hydroquinone, acrylamide, glucose, and urea) through no-choice and free-choice tests. Results revealed that date palm wood bound with clay was the most preferred substrate, significantly increasing termite consumption (2.69 g) and survival, while porous compressed baits were more attractive than powdered or simple compressed forms, with 34.6% and 370% higher termite settlement, respectively. Sodium bicarbonate (46.66% attractiveness), pure cellulose (21.56%), and yeast (41.66%) significantly improved bait attractiveness and feeding activity, with yeast likely enhancing appeal through its nutrient content and CO2 emission. In contrast, hydroquinone, acrylamide, urea, and glucose showed either repellent or neutral effects. Clay-bound baits outperformed starch-bound ones, highlighting the importance of binding materials. These findings demonstrate that bait composition, presentation form, and additives, particularly sodium bicarbonate, pure cellulose, and yeast, significantly influence termite foraging behavior, providing a foundation for developing optimized bait formulations. This research offers a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to termite management, reducing reliance on chemical interventions and enhancing integrated pest management (IPM) strategies for controlling M. diversus in agricultural, urban, and household settings.

AB  - Although social behaviour is common in group-living mammals, our understanding of its mechanisms in longlived animals is largely based on studies in human and non-human primates. There are health and fitness benefits associated with strong social ties, including increased life span, reproductive success, and lower disease risk, which are attributed to the proximate effects of lowered circulating glucocorticoid hormones. However, to deepen our understanding of health-social dynamics, we must explore species beyond the primate order. Here, using Asian elephants as a model species, we combine social data generated from semi-captive timber elephants in Myanmar with measurements of faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations. These data enable a "natural experiment" because individuals live in work groups with different demographic compositions. We examine sex-specific FGM concentrations for four different aspects of an individuals' social world: general sociality, work group size, sex ratio and the presence of immatures (<5 years) within the work group. Males experienced lower FGM concentrations when engaged in more social behaviours and residing in female-biased work groups. Surprisingly, females only exhibited lower FGM concentrations when residing with calves. Together, our findings highlight the importance of sociality on individual physiological function among elephants, which may have broad implications for the benefits of social interactions among mammals.

AB  - The quality and safety of chicken meat are prone to deteriorate due to bacteria reproduction and oxidation reac-tion. In this study, the antimicrobial and antioxidant effects of KGM-KC coatings incorporated camellia oil were evaluated to extend the shelf-life of chicken meat. The result showed that the KGM/KC-CO coating significantly (P < 0.05) decreased weight loss, pH, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), total volatile nitrogen (TVN) and microbial counts when compared to uncoated samples. The obtained results revealed that KGM/KC-based coating incorporated with CO significantly extended the shelf-life of chicken meat by restraining the oxi-dation of lipid and protein, and retarding the microbial growth. The sensory evaluation showed that the addition of CO did not affect the odor of chicken meat, maintained the overall acceptability of coated samples. The shelf-life of chicken meat was extended up to 10 days using KGM/KC-based coating containing 3.5% CO at refrigeration (4 degrees C) compared to control samples. These results indicated CO could be used as an active agent to be dispersed in KGM/KC matrix by emulsification method, and the prepared emulsion coating had positive effects on extending the shelf-life of chicken meat.

AB  - We aimed to explore the effects of hypercholesterolemia on sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment in aged rats and the underlying mechanism(s). Aged rats were administrated with high-fat diet, sevoflurane, or both. Thereafter, the plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were evaluated. The Morris water maze task was performed to evaluate the spatial learning and memory ability of rats. Moreover, Nissl and Evans blue staining were conducted to test nerve damage and detect the blood-brain barrier permeability, respectively. The percentage of apoptotic cells was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay. The messenger RNA expression of inflammatory factors and protein expression of microglial activation markers and apoptosis-related proteins were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or western blot analysis, respectively. High-fat diet induced high levels of TC, TG, and LDL but decreased levels of HDL. However, sevoflurane had no effects on these levels. In contrast, sevoflurane significantly induced the impairment of learning and memory, nerve damage, neuroinflammatory damage, and neuronal apoptosis. Hypercholesterolemia exacerbated the sevoflurane-induced impairment in aged rats. These results suggested that hypercholesterolemia aggravates sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment in aged rats, possibly by inducing neurological inflammation and apoptosis.

AB  - The spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula, native to parts of East Asia and the Indomalayan region, is a polyphagous herbivore poised to become a major global agricultural pest. Since its establishment in the US in 2014, L. delicatula continues to expand its range, and its invasion into California is highly anticipated. Proactive work evaluating Anastatus orientalis, an egg parasitoid of L. delicatula in its native range, as a potential biological agent determined this parasitoid is too polyphagous for release in the US, and no other suitable egg parasitoids have been identified. Consequently, the potential of native North American egg parasitoids to provide biotic resistance to the L. delicatula invasion is being assessed. In a quarantine laboratory study, Anastatus reduvii, an egg parasitoid native to and widespread in North America, including California, parasitized 79% of L. delicatula egg masses with an average egg parasitism rate of 31%. Egg masses exposed to A. reduvii exhibited significantly reduced L. delicatula hatch rates (33%) compared to unexposed control egg masses (90%). These observed rates are comparable to that of A. orientalis attacking L. delicatula egg masses. Rearing A. reduvii from eggs of five different host species did not significantly affect parasitism or L. delicatula mortality, although parasitism was substantially higher compared to previous work using A. reduvii reared exclusively on Pentatomidae eggs. Massrearing of A. reduvii is highly feasible and continued investigations into the suitability of this egg parasitoid as a biological control agent for L. delicatula in the US are recommended.

AB  - Dysfunctional autophagy and impairment of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) each contribute to the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, whether dysfunctional autophagy is linked to aberrant AHN underlying MDD remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that the expression of nuclear receptor binding factor 2 (NRBF2), a component of autophagy-associated PIK3C3/VPS34-containing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, is attenuated in the dentate gyrus (DG) under chronic stress. NRBF2 deficiency inhibits the activity of the VPS34 complex and impairs autophagic flux in adult neural stem cells (aNSCs). Moreover, loss of NRBF2 disrupts the neurogenesis-related protein network and causes exhaustion of aNSC pool, leading to the depression-like phenotype. Strikingly, overexpressing NRBF2 in aNSCs of the DG is sufficient to rescue impaired AHN and depression-like phenotype of mice. Our findings reveal a significant role of NRBF2-dependent autophagy in preventing chronic stress-induced AHN impairment and suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting NRBF2 in MDD treatment.

AB  - Task learning involves learning associations between stimuli and outcomes and storing these relationships in memory. While this information can be reliably decoded from population activity, individual neurons encoding this representation can drift over time. The circuit or molecular mechanisms underlying this drift and its role in learning are unclear. We performed two-photon calcium imaging in the perirhinal cortex during task training. Using post hoc spatial transcriptomics, we measured immediate-early gene (IEG) expression and assigned monitored neurons to excitatory or inhibitory subtypes. We discovered an IEG-defined network spanning multiple subtypes that form stimulus-outcome associations. Targeted deletion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the perirhinal cortex disrupted IEG expression and impaired task learning. Representational drift slowed with prolonged training. Pre-existing representations were strengthened while stimulus- reward associations failed to form. Our findings reveal the cell types and molecules regulating long-term network stability that is permissive for task learning and memory allocation.

AB  - Cortisol is inevitably secreted by pigs due to the physicalandpsychological stressors produced by mixed group transportation andpreslaughter handling. Accumulated cortisol in animal tissues entersthe human body through the food chain and entails potential risksto human health. An integrated lipidome and proteome analysis wasconducted to investigate the effect of the spatiotemporal variationof residual cortisol on nutrient acquisition in pork. A total of 55crucial lipid molecules associated with cortisol residue were identifiedbased on debiased sparse partial correlation analysis. Label-freeproteomics was applied to screen 58 differentially abundant proteins(including phospholipase A(2), lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase,and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase), indicating that cortisolresidue perturbed the glycerophospholipid biosynthetic process andglycerophospholipid metabolic process. Cortisol induced downregulationsof cPLA2 encoding genes and decreased phospholipase A(2) activity,resulting in the bioaccumulation of phosphatidylethanolamine (from36.86 to 43.18 mg kg(-1)). Cortisol increased theactivity of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase by improving theavailability of fatty acids and aggregating the inactive L-form (lipid-independentform) to the active H-form (lipid-associated form). The metabolicpathways perturbed by cortisol resulted in phosphatidylcholine degradation(from 93.73 to 58.28 mg kg(-1)) and lysophosphatidylcholineaccumulation (from 3.39 to 5.16 mg kg(-1)). Thesefindings indicated that cortisol residue deteriorated meat qualityand obstructed nutrient acquisition in animal-origin foods.

AB  - With the transformation of the breeding industry towards a healthy breeding model, the application of green feed additives in pig production is gradually increasing. Many plant polysaccharides are widely used as safe and green additives in animal production. Boron may be a necessary trace element for animals and its application in animal husbandry is also increasing. The study on the application effect of the combined addition of plant polysaccharides and boron in fatteners production performance, immune function, antioxidant function, digestive function and harmful substance emissions is of great significance for the rational use of both. This study added boron and different types of plant polysaccharides to the diet in the form of boric acid and found that the combined addition of boric acid and plant polysaccharides can improve the production performance and antioxidant function of fatteners by enhancing the activity of intestinal digestive enzymes and reducing the content of harmful substances such as heavy metals and harmful gases in feces and urine, thereby effectively improving healthy growth and reducing environmental pollution today. The experiment aimed to investigate the effects of plant polysaccharides combined with boric acid on digestive function, immune function and harmful gas and heavy metal contents in the faeces of fatteners. For this study, 90 healthy crossbred fatteners were selected and randomly divided into five groups: the control group was fed with a basal diet (Con); experimental group I was fed with basal diet + 40 mg/kg boric acid (BA); experimental group II was fed with basal diet + 40 mg/kg boric acid + 400 mg/kg Astragalus polysaccharides (BA+APS); experimental group III was fed with basal diet + 40 mg/kg boric acid + 200 mg/kg Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides (BA+GLP); and experimental group IV was fed with basal diet + 40 mg/kg boric acid + 500 mg/kg Echinacea polysaccharides (BA+EPS). Compared with Con, the average daily gain (ADG), the trypsin activities in the duodenum and jejunum, the IL-2 levels in the spleen, the T-AOC activities and GSH-Px contents in the lymph node of fattening were increased in the BA group (p < 0.05), but malondialdehyde content in the lymph and spleen, and the contents of NH3, H2S, Hg, Cu, Fe and Zn in the feces and urine were decreased (p < 0.05). Compared with the BA, the ADG, gain-to-feed ratio (G/F), the trypsin and maltase activities in the duodenum and jejunum were increased in the BA+APS (p < 0.05), and the T-SOD activities in the spleen and T-AOC activities in the lymph node were also increased (p < 0.05), but the H2S level was decreased in the feces and urine (p < 0.05). Compared with the BA, the ADG, G/F and the trypsin and maltase activities in the duodenum were increased in the BA+GLP and BA+EPS (p < 0.05), the activities of maltase and lipase in the duodenum of fatteners in the BA+GLP and the activities of trypsin, maltase and lipase in the BA+EPS were increased (p < 0.05). Gathering everything together, our findings reveal that the combined addition of boric acid and plant polysaccharides in the diet of fatteners synergistically improved their growth performance and immune status. That may be achieved by regulating the activity of intestinal digestive enzymes, improving the antioxidant function and then promoting the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Furthermore, the above results reduce the emission of harmful gases and heavy metals in feces and urine.

AB  - Hyperglycemia-induced aberrant glucose metabolism is a causative factor of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. The pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-lactic acid axis is regarded as a critical link between metabolic reprogramming and the pathogenic process of neurological disorders. However, its role in diabetic neuropathy remains unclear. Here, we found that PDK1 and phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) were obviously increased in high glucose (HG)-stimulated primary neurons and Neuro-2a cell line. Acetyl-coA, a central metabolic intermediate, might enhance PDK1 expression via histone H3K9 acetylation modification in HG condition. The epigenetic regulation of PDK1 expression provided an available negative feedback pattern in response to HG environment-triggered mitochondrial metabolic overload. However, neuronal PDK1 was decreased in the hippocampus of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Our data showed that the expression of PDK1 also depended on the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) transcriptional activation under the HG condition. However, HIF-1 was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of diabetic mice, which might explain the opposite expression of PDK1 in vivo. Importantly, overexpression of PDK1 reduced HG-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and neuronal apoptosis. Enhancing PDK1 expression in the hippocampus ameliorated STZ-induced cognitive impairment and neuronal degeneration in mice. Together, our study demonstrated that both acetyl-coA-induced histone acetylation and HIF-1 are necessary to direct PDK1 expression, and enhancing PDK1 may have a protective effect on cognitive recovery in diabetic mice.Schematic representation of the protective effect of PDK1 on hyperglycemia-induced neuronal injury and memory loss. High glucose enhanced the expression of PDK1 in an acetyl-coA-dependent histone acetylation modification to avoid mitochondrial metabolic overload and ROS release. However, the decrease of HIF-1 may impair the upregulation of PDK1 under hyperglycemia condition. Overexpression of PDK1 prevented hyperglycemia-induced hippocampal neuronal injury and memory loss in diabetic mice.

AB  - Simple Summary Red pandas have evolved to become specialized bamboo eaters within Carnivora. Probably due to the difficulty in obtaining materials, reports on genes related to digestion and metabolism at expression and regulation levels in red pandas are rare. Red pandas and carnivorous mammal ferrets have a close phylogenetic relationship. They both consume highly nutritious milk during the suckling period, but consume low-energy bamboo and high-energy meat during the adult period, respectively. In order to explore the molecular mechanisms of dietary changes and nutrient utilization in red pandas, we discussed (1) the differences in expression changes of some genes related to digestion and metabolism in the stomach of these two species after food changes, as well as the expression adaptation of genes related to digestion and metabolism in both species during different feeding periods, and (2) the regulatory effects of lncRNAs and miRNAs on adaptive expressions of genes related to digestion and metabolism in both species from suckling to adult.Abstract Red pandas evolved from carnivores to herbivores and are unique within Carnivora. Red pandas and carnivorous mammals consume milk during the suckling period, while they consume bamboo and meat during the adult period, respectively. Red pandas and carnivorous mammal ferrets have a close phylogenetic relationship. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms of dietary changes and nutrient utilization in red pandas from suckling to adult, comparative analysis of the whole transcriptome was performed on stomach tissues from red pandas and ferrets during the suckling and adult periods. The main results are as follows: (1) we identified ncRNAs for the first time in stomach tissues of both species, and found significant expression changes of 109 lncRNAs and 106 miRNAs in red pandas and 756 lncRNAs and 109 miRNAs in ferrets between the two periods; (2) up-regulated genes related to amino acid transport regulated by lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks may efficiently utilize limited bamboo amino acids in adult red pandas, while up-regulated genes related to amino acid degradation regulated by lncRNAs may maintain the balance of amino acid metabolism due to larger daily intakes in adult ferrets; and (3) some up-regulated genes related to lipid digestion may contribute to the utilization of rich nutrients in milk for the rapid growth and development of suckling red pandas, while up-regulated genes associated with linoleic acid metabolism regulated by lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks may promote cholesterol decomposition to reduce health risks for carnivorous adult ferrets. Collectively, our study offers evidence of gene expression adaptation and ncRNA regulation in response to specific dietary changes and nutrient utilization in red pandas during suckling and adult periods.

AB  - A coupling distributed solid-state anaerobic digestion model was developed and performed considering a simplified AM2 model and a saturated Mobile-Immobile water Model (MIM). This model allows considering both microporosity and macroporosity evolutions as well as the impact on biological kinetics. This model was adapted, implemented and validated on cattle manure in mesophilic conditions and carried out in a solid-state leach-bed reactor. Three 60 L sacrificial leach-bed reactors were used to determine hydrodynamics and kinetic parameters in a calibration-validation approach. A sensitivity analysis was conducted and has shown a high value of hydrolysis kinetics on outputs variables (until 92% for accumulated methane yield and 72% for volatile fatty acids accumulation) which confirmed the necessity to identify accurately the hydrolysis parameter before calibration step. Finally, the solutes present inside each mobile and immobile region evolved in a different way confirming the model relevance.

AB  - This paper presents the results of laboratory and field tests on the hydraulic properties of georopes produced using the Kemafil technology from sheep wool waste generated in the textile industry. The laboratory tests included the determination of the basic physical parameters and filtration properties of georopes, as well as tests of the physical properties and water permeability of the experimental training ground. As part of the field research, measurements of water infiltration through 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 m long georopes embedded in the ground were carried out in nine monthly cycles. The conditions of water flow through the georopes were monitored on the basis of georope resistance measurements. Numerical calculations were also performed to determine the conditions of water flow through the georopes and the process of water infiltration from the georopes into the ground. The laboratory tests have shown that the water permeability of georopes is high and, based on the filtration criteria, they can act as a drainage material. The field measurements showed that the resistance of the georopes changed over time and depended on the amount of water supplied and the absorbency of the ground. The results of the numerical calculations were consistent with the results of the field measurements, at the same time indicating that some water infiltrated into the ground in the vicinity of the georopes, meaning that under the conditions that prevailed during the experiment, the georopes can act as infiltration drainage systems in the ground.

AB  - Postoperative abdominal adhesions are the leading cause of bowel obstruction and a cause of chronic pain and infertility. Adhesion formation occurs after 50 to 90% of abdominal operations and has no proven preventative or treatment strategy. Abdominal adhesions derive primarily from the visceral peritoneum and are composed of polyclonally proliferating tissue-resident fibroblasts. We have previously shown that signaling of the transcription factor JUN regulates adhesiogenesis and that a small-molecule JUN inhibitor (T-5224) decreases adhesion formation. Here, we encapsulated T-5224 in a shear-thinning hydrogel with antiadhesion properties for intraperitoneal postoperative delivery and sustained release of a JUN inhibitor for adhesion prevention. The material properties of the T-5224-hydrogel support its use for open or minimally invasive surgical application. We found this therapeutic system to be safe, well tolerated, and efficacious in murine and porcine preclinical models. T-5224-hydrogel minimized adhesion quantity and also diminished adhesion fibrosis at an ultrastructural level. Moving toward clinical translation, we developed a large mammal adhesion model in pigs with bowel resection. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that JUN and associated pathway signaling were diminished in adhesion-derived fibroblasts treated with T-5224-hydrogel. The JUN-inhibiting T-5224-hydrogel provided robust prevention of adhesion without deleterious effects on bowel anastomosis or abdominal wall healing. Adhesion biology is similar across surgical sites, and, therefore, this formulation has potential for applicability across the body. The development of therapeutics to prevent adhesions is of paramount importance with potential for high-impact translation to patient care to address a common, unmet clinical need.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of dietary lysine supplementation in low-protein diets on nutrient digestibility, nitrogen metabolism, growth performance, serum biomarkers, and pelt quality in female blue foxes (Alopex lagopus) during the fur-growing period. A total of 105 18-week-old female blue foxes were randomly assigned to seven groups (n = 15 per group). The control group received a standard-protein diet (28% dry matter, DM), while six experimental groups were fed low-protein diets (26% DM) supplemented with 0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, and 1.0% lysine, corresponding to total lysine levels of 0.75%, 0.95%, 1.15%, 1.35%, 1.55%, and 1.75% DM, respectively. Lysine supplementation at 1.35% and 1.55% DM significantly improved the digestibility of ether extract and amino acids, including aspartic acid, glycine, methionine, isoleucine, and tyrosine (p < 0.05). Nitrogen retention increased accordingly, indicating enhanced dietary utilization (p < 0.05). Daily weight gain, particularly from day 15 to day 30, was significantly higher in 1.15-1.55% lysine groups compared to low-lysine groups (p < 0.05), achieving growth performance comparable to the control (p > 0.05). Serum total protein and albumin concentration were significantly improved with increasing lysine levels in low-protein groups (p < 0.01), aligning with those of the control group (p > 0.05). Furthermore, high lysine supplementation significantly improved pelt quality, as evidenced by the increased underfur length and decreased guard hair/underfur in 1.35-1.75% DM (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that lysine supplementation in low-protein diets supports nutrient utilization, growth performance, and metabolic health status while reducing dietary protein content. The optimal dietary lysine range is 1.15% to 1.55% DM (corresponding to 0.4% to 0.8% in air-dry basis), with 1.35% DM (corresponding to 0.6% in air-dry basis) identified as the most suitable level for balancing growth, nitrogen excretion, and pelt quality in fur-growing female blue foxes.

AB  - Background: Neurons have specialized structures that facilitate information transfer using electrical and chemical signals. Within the perspective of neural computation, the neuronal structure is an important prerequisite for the versatile computational capabilities of neurons resulting from the integration of diverse synaptic input patterns, complex interactions among the passive and active dendritic local currents, and the interplay between dendrite and soma to generate action potential output. For this, characterization of the relationship between the structure and neuronal spike dynamics could provide essential information about the cellular-level mechanism supporting neural computations. Results: This work describes simulations and an information-theoretic analysis to investigate how specific neuronal structure affects neural dynamics and information processing. Correlation analysis on the Allen Cell Types Database reveals biologically relevant structural features that determine neural dynamics-eight highly correlated structural features are selected as the primary set for characterizing neuronal structures. These features are used to characterize biophysically realistic multi-compartment mathematical models for primary neurons in the direct and indirect hippocampal pathways consisting of the pyramidal cells of Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) and CA3 and the granule cell in the dentate gyrus (DG). Simulations reveal that the dynamics of these neurons vary depending on their specialized structures and are highly sensitive to structural modifications. Information-theoretic analysis confirms that structural factors are critical for versatile neural information processing at a single-cell and a neural circuit level; not only basic AND/OR but also linearly non-separable XOR functions can be explained within the information-theoretic framework. Conclusions: Providing quantitative information on the relationship between the structure and the dynamics/information flow of neurons, this work would help us understand the design and coding principles of biological neurons and may be beneficial for designing biologically plausible neuron models for artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

AB  - We propose a method to reconstruct a 3D coordinate system and a vascular map for the operation of magnetic medical robots (MMRs) controlled by a magnetic navigation system (MNS) using two 2D X-ray images and four corners of an MNS. Utilizing the proposed method, we calculated the relative rotation angle of a C-arm considering its rotational precision error. We derived the position information and 3D coordinate system of an MNS workspace in which the magnetic fields are generated and controlled by an MNS. The proposed method can also be utilized to reconstruct vascular maps. Reconstructed vascular maps are in the 3D coordinate system of the C-arm and can be transformed into the 3D coordinate system of an MNS workspace to generate the magnetic flux density with the desired direction and magnitude at the position of the MMR. The proposed method allows us to remotely and precisely control the MMR inserted into the vessel by controlling the external magnetic field. The proposed method was validated through in vitro experiments with an MNS mock-up and a vascular jig. Finally, the proposed method was applied to in vivo experiments where the MMR was inserted into the superficial femoral artery of a mini pig to remotely control the motion of the MMR. This research will enable precise and effective control of MMRs in various medical procedures utilizing an MNS.

AB  - The recently discovered social place cells and grid cells in hippocampal formation are believed to be the neural basis underlying relative navigation of conspecifics. In this paper, we propose a new brain-inspired relative navigation model in a large-scale 3D environment for collective UAVs that translates the neurodynamics of the social place cell-grid cell circuit to robotic relative navigation algorithm for the first time. Our approach comprises three key parts: (1) a 3D isotropic Gaussian function-based cube social place cell network (cube-SPCNet), (2) a 3D continuous attractor neural network-based cube grid cell network (cube-GCNet), and (3) a population vector-based neural decoding module. The resulting brain-inspired relative navigation model incorporates the good relative information abstraction capabilities of the cube-SPCNet with the powerful temporal filtering capabilities of the cube-GCNet, yielding robustness and accuracy performance improvement for relative navigation. Experimental results show the new method can provide more robust and precise relative navigation results than its conventional counterpart, displaying a possible brain-inspired solution for relative navigation enhancement for collective UAVs.

AB  - Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposures during pregnancy could lead to adverse birth outcomes, including neurobehavioral development defects. However, limited studies explored the effects and potential epigenetic mechanisms of maternal PM2.5 exposure on offspring spatial memory defects. This study aims to explore the effects and underlying epigenetic mechanisms of maternal concentrated ambient PM2.5 exposure in male mice offspring with spatial memory defects. Pregnant female C57BL/6 mice were exposed daily to concentrated ambient PM2.5 (CAP) or filtered air (FA) throughout gestation, with the concentration of particulates (102.99 +/- 78.74 mu g/m(3)) and (2.78 +/- 1.19 mu g/m(3)), respectively. Adult male mice offspring were subsequently assessed for spatial learning and memory ability using Morris Water Maze tests and locomotor activities in open field tests. The hippocampus of the male mice offspring was harvested to test mRNA expression and DNA methylation. Results from the probe test of Morris Water Maze showed that the mice offspring in the CAP group had shorter swimming distance travelled in the target quadrant, shorter duration in the target quadrant, and less number of entries into the target quadrant (p < 0.05), suggesting spatial memory impairments. The acquisition trials of Morris Water Maze did not show a significant difference in learning ability between the groups. The mRNA level of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the CAP group hippocampus (10.80 +/- 7.03) increased significantly compared to the FA group (1.08 +/- 0.43). Interestingly, the methylation levels of the CpG sites in the IL-6 promoter region declined significantly in the CAP group, (5.66 +/- 0.83)% vs. (4.79 +/- 0.48)%. Prenatal exposure to concentrated ambient PM2.5 induced longlasting spatial memory defects in male mice offspring. The underlying biological mechanism might be mediated by an inflammatory reaction which is regulated by DNA methylation.

AB  - Background: Spermidine has recently received major attention for its potential therapeutic benefits in the context of neurodegeneration, cancer, and aging. However, it is unclear whether concentration dependencies of spermidine exist, to differentially enhance autophagic flux. Moreover, the relationship between low or high autophagy activity relative to basal neuronal autophagy flux and subsequent protein clearance as well as cellular toxicity has remained largely unclear.Methods: Here, we used high-resolution imaging and biochemical techniques to investigate the effects of a low and of a high concentration of spermidine on autophagic flux, neuronal toxicity, and protein clearance in in vitro models of paraquat (PQ) induced neuronal toxicity and amyloid precursor protein (APP) overexpression, as well as in an in vivo model of PQ-induced rodent brain injury.Results: Our results reveal that spermidine induces autophagic flux in a concentration-dependent manner, however the detectable change in the autophagy response critically depends on the specificity and sensitivity of the method employed. By using correlative imaging techniques through Super-Resolution Structured Illumination Microscopy (SR-SIM) and Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM), we demonstrate that spermidine at a low concentration induces autophagosome formation capable of large volume clearance. In addition, we provide evidence of distinct, context-dependent protective roles of spermidine in models of Alzheimer's disease. In an in vitro environment, a low concentration of spermidine protected against PQ-induced toxicity, while both low and high concentrations provided protection against cytotoxicity induced by APP overexpression. In the in vivo scenario, we demonstrate brain region-specific susceptibility to PQ-induced neuronal toxicity, with the hippocampus being highly susceptible compared to the cortex. Regardless of this, spermidine administered at both low and high dosages protected against paraquat-induced toxicity.Conclusions: Taken together, our results demonstrate that firstly, administration of spermidine may present a favourable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and secondly, that concentration and dosage-dependent precision autophagy flux screening may be more critical for optimal autophagy and cell death control than previously thought.

AB  - With the rapid increase in electric vehicle (EV) ownership, the uncertainty of EV charging demand has become a significant concern, especially in distributed photovoltaic (PV) power distribution networks (DNs) with high penetration rates. This growing demand presents challenges in meeting the needs of EV owners and grid charging/discharging stations (GCDSs), jeopardizing the stability, efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of the DNs. To address these challenges, this study introduces innovative models, the anchoring effect, and regret theory for EV demand response (DR) decision-making, focusing on dual-sided demand management for GCDSs and EVs. The proposed model leverages the light spectrum optimizer-convolutional neural network to predict PV output and utilizes Monte Carlo simulation to estimate EV charging load, ensuring precise PV output prediction and effective EV distribution. To optimize DR decisions for EVs, this study employs time-of-use guidance optimization through a logistic-sine hybrid chaotic-hippopotamus optimizer (LSC-HO). By integrating the anchoring effect and regret theory model with LSC-HO, this approach enhances satisfaction levels for GCDSs by balancing DR, enhancing voltage quality within the DNs. Simulations on a modified IEEE-33 system confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach, validating the efficiency of the optimal scheduling methods and enhancing the stable operation, efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of the DNs.

AB  - In this study, we explored the precise mechanisms underlying the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)-mediated neuronal loss and behavioral dysfunction induced by hyperglycemia. We used immunoprecipitation (IP) and GST pull-down assays to assess the interaction between RAGE and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3). Then, we investigated the effect of specific mutation of RAGE on plasticity at hippocampal synapses and behavioral deficits in db/db mice through electrophysiological recordings, morphological assays, and behavioral tests. We discovered that RAGE binds MKK3 and that this binding is required for assembly of the MEKK3-MKK3-p38 signaling module. Mechanistically, we found that activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/NF-kappa B signaling depends on mediation of the RAGE-MKK3 interaction by C-terminal RAGE (ctRAGE) amino acids (AAs) 2-5. We found that ctRAGE R2A-K3A-R4A-Q5A mutation suppressed neuronal damage, improved synaptic plasticity, and alleviated behavioral deficits in diabetic mice by disrupting the RAGE-MKK3 conjugation. High glucose induces direct binding of RAGE and MKK3 via ctRAGE AAs 2-5, which leads to assembly of the MEKK3-MKK3-p38 signaling module and subsequent activation of the p38MAPK/NF-kappa B pathway, and ultimately results in diabetic encephalopathy (DE).

AB  - Background: The susceptibility of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) patients to air pollution has yet to be clarified. Objectives: Based on a repeated measurement panel study, we explored the association of short-term PM exposure with lung function in ARC patients and to further identify the susceptible populations.Methods: Personal PM exposure, including PM1, PM2.5 and PM10, was monitored consecutively for three days before outcomes measurements. Lung function indices including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and forced expiratory flow at 25-75 % of the vital capacity (FEF25-75) were measured. Serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE), specific-allergen IgE, blood eosinophil and basophils, and the symp-toms severe scores were tested in each visit. Linear mixed effect models were applied to estimate the association be-tween PM exposure and lung function. Furthermore, stratified and overlapping grouped populations based on IgE levels were implemented to characterize the modification role and the modulating threshold of IgE at which the asso-ciation turned significantly negative.Results: Short-term PM personal exposure was associated with a significant decrease in lung function in ARC patients, especially for small airway respiratory indexes. The highest estimates occurred in PM1, specifically a 10 mu g/m3 increase reduced FEV1/FVC, PEF and FEF25-75 by 1.36 % (95 %CI: -2.29 to -0.43), 0.23 L/s (95 %CI: -0.42 to -0.03) and 0.18 L/s (95 %CI: -0.30 to -0.06), respectively. Notably, PM-induced decreases in lung function were stronger in patients with higher IgE levels (IgE <= 100 IU/mL), which were related to higher inflammatory cytokines and symp-toms scores. Further, PM-associated lung function declines enhanced robustly and monotonically with increasing IgE concentration. Potential modulating thresholds of IgE occurred at 46.8-59.6 IU/mL for significant PM-lung function associations.Conclusion: These novel findings estimated the short-term effects of PM on lung function in ARC patients, and the threshold values of IgE for the significant and robust associations.

AB  - Pregnancy rates using frozen semen from rams are higher than for horses. One of the factors that positively influences this effect is the composition of low-molecular-weight proteins from seminal plasma, since the amounts of these proteins are much lower in horses. The aim of this work was to purify the major protein components from ram seminal plasma for structural and biophysical characterization. First, the ram semen was collected and the plasma separated by centrifugation. The protein fractions were isolated by gel filtration chromatography, analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and the amino acid sequence identified by mass spectrometry (LC-MSE), the results of which were used to model the protein structure by bioinformatics techniques. This protein was identified by LC-MSE as a spermadhesin, being an unglycosylated monomer with T-m = 69.3 degrees C and Delta H-m = 371 kJ mol(-1) at pH 7.0. This work describes for the first time the structural characterization of a spermadhesin from seminal plasma of Dorper rams. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the composition of a cow's diet through the analysis of its milk is very useful in the linking of the product consumed with the systems involved in its production. The aim of this study is to show the diet-milk composition relationship using correspondence analysis and multiple linear regression analysis. This study analyzed 174 tank milk samples taken from 89 commercial farms located in "Green Spain". Sampling was performed in two different periods: autumn 2016 and spring 2017. The correspondence analysis allowed for study into the general relationships between diet components and their relationship with the composition of milk (chemical composition, fatty acid profile (FA), and fat-soluble antioxidants (FSA)). The model used to estimate the percentage of fresh grass (FG) in the diet had a high predictive power (R-aj(2) > 0.7), and the explanatory variables included in the model were linolenic acid (C18:3-n3), vaccenic acid (trans11-C18:1), and cis12-C18:1. The regression equation was applied to the 174 tank milk samples individually. To evaluate the equation's predictive capacity, different thresholds for the dry matter percentage of fresh grass in the ration were marked (15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%), above which milk could be considered "grass-fed milk", and below which, "not grass-fed milk". The equation is considered valid when it correctly classifies the sample. The highest percentage of success (89.7%) was obtained by marking a threshold of 25% FG. When analyzing the misclassified milk samples, that is, where the equation did not classify the milk sample well according to its fresh grass composition, it was observed that the majority of cases corresponded to milk samples that came from herds fed with fresh grass above the marked threshold (>25%) but with a high content of concentrate in the ration. The conclusion is that the percentage of concentrate in the diet has a very important influence on the fatty acid profile of milk, particularly with respect to fresh grass. This is in such a way that anywhere above a concentrate content of >30%, the equation's capacity to estimate the percentage of fresh grass decreases.

AB  - Tirzepatide induces weight reduction but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. This 6-week phase 1 study investigated early effects of tirzepatide on energy intake. Male and female adults without diabetes (n = 114) and a body mass index from 27 to 50 kg per m2 were randomized 1:1:1 to blinded once-weekly tirzepatide or placebo, or open-label once-daily liraglutide. The primary outcome was change from baseline to week 3 in energy intake during an ad libitum lunch with tirzepatide versus placebo. Secondary outcomes assessed self-reported ingestive behavior and blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging with food photos. Tirzepatide reduced energy intake versus placebo at week 3 (estimated treatment difference -524.6 kcal (95% confidence interval -648.1 to -401.0), P < 0.0001). With regard to secondary outcomes versus placebo, tirzepatide decreased overall appetite, food cravings, tendency to overeat, perceived hunger and reactivity to foods in the environment but did not impact volitional restriction of dietary intake. At week 3 versus placebo, tirzepatide did not statistically significantly impact blood-oxygenation-level-dependent activation to highly palatable food photos (aggregated category of high-fat, high-sugar foods and high-fat, high-carbohydrate foods) but decreased activation to high-fat, high-sugar food photos in the medial frontal and cingulate gyri, orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus. Our results suggest tirzepatide reduces food intake, potentially by impacting ingestive behavior. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04311411.

AB  - Arsenic, a neurotoxic metalloid, poses significant health risks. However, ellagic acid, renowned for its antioxidant properties, has shown potential in neuroprotection. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of ellagic acid against arsenic-induced neuronal ferroptosis and cognitive impairment and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Using an arsenic-exposed Wistar rat model and an arsenic-induced HT22 cells model, we assessed cognitive ability, measured serum and brain arsenic levels, and evaluated pathological damage through histological analysis and transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, we examined oxidative stress and iron ion levels using GSH, MDA, ROS and tissue iron biochemical kits, and analyzed the expression of ferroptosis-related markers using western blot and qRT-PCR. Our results revealed that arsenic exposure increased both serum and brain arsenic levels, resulting in hippocampal pathological damage and subsequent decline in learning and memory abilities. Arsenic-induced neuronal ferroptosis was mediated by the inhibition of the xCT/GSH/GPX4/Nrf2 signaling axis and disruption of iron metabolism. Notably, ellagic acid intervention effectively reduced serum and brain arsenic levels, ameliorated neuronal damage, and improved oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and cognitive impairment. These beneficial effects were associated with the activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway, upregulation of GPX4 expression, and enhanced iron ion excretion.

AB  - The current study examined the benefits of a novel mannan-rich yeast carbohydrate product (YM) on broiler chicken growth performance and immune response against sheep red blood cells (SRBCs). A total of 144 newly hatched male Cornish cross broiler chicks were randomly assigned to four treatments with 12 cages per treatment and three birds per cage. The treatments were (1) control, basal diet; (2) YCW, basal diet + 1 g/kg yeast cell wall; (3) YM1, basal diet + 0.5 g/kg of a novel yeast mannan-rich product (YM); and (4) YM2, basal diet + 1 g/kg YM. Growth performance was measured at 14, 28, and 35 days of age (d). At 26 and 27 d, nine birds per treatment were immunized intravenously with SRBCs, and antibody responses against SRBCs were analyzed through a hemagglutination assay 7 days post-inoculation. Supplementing YM tended to improve broiler chicken weight gain from 29 to 35 d (p = 0.053). An improvement in the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was observed in the birds fed YM diets during 29-35 d and over the entire experimental period (0-35 d; p < 0.05). Furthermore, birds fed YM2 diets had more robust antibody responses against SRBCs than the control birds (p = 0.033). In conclusion, dietary supplementation of YM improved broiler chicken growth performance and antibody response against SRBCs.

AB  - We examined the protective effects of esculetin and fucoidan against the neurotoxicity of ZnO NPs in rats. Ninety rats were divided into nine groups and pre-treated with esculetin or fucoidan 1 h before ZnO NP administration on a daily basis for 2 weeks. Serum and brain homogenates were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in the hippocampal region were examined with immunohistochemical analysis. The serum levels of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1 beta), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were altered in the ZnO NP treatment groups. Brain IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels were elevated after ZnO NP administration, and these effects were inhibited by esculetin and fucoidan. SOD, 8-OHdG, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels in the brain were decreased after ZnO NP administration. The brain levels of beclin-1 and caspase-3 were elevated after ZnO NP treatment, and these effects were significantly ameliorated by esculetin and fucoidan. The number of reactive astrocytes measured by counting glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells, but not microglia, increased following ZnO NP treatment, and esculetin and fucoidan ameliorated the changes. Esculetin and fucoidan may be beneficial for preventing ZnO NP-mediated autophagy and apoptosis by the modulation of reactive astrocyte and proinflammatory cytokines in the rat brain.

AB  - Pills are a cornerstone of medicine but can be challenging to swallow. While liquid formulations are easier to ingest, they lack the capacity to localize therapeutics with excipients nor act as controlled release devices. Here we describe drug formulations based on liquid in situ-forming tough (LIFT) hydrogels that bridge the advantages of solid and liquid dosage forms. LIFT hydrogels form directly in the stomach through sequential ingestion of a crosslinker solution of calcium and dithiol crosslinkers, followed by a drug-containing polymer solution of alginate and four-arm poly(ethylene glycol)-maleimide. We show that LIFT hydrogels robustly form in the stomachs of live rats and pigs, and are mechanically tough, biocompatible and safely cleared after 24 h. LIFT hydrogels deliver a total drug dose comparable to unencapsulated drug in a controlled manner, and protect encapsulated therapeutic enzymes and bacteria from gastric acid-mediated deactivation. Overall, LIFT hydrogels may expand access to advanced therapeutics for patients with difficulty swallowing.
   Sequential drinks of crosslinker and polymer solutions form a tough hydrogel in the stomach, enabling delivery of drugs and biologics in this harsh chemical environment.

AB  - The distribution of New Zealand sea lions is typically localised to New Zealand and its remote subantarctic islands. However, non-resident male sea lions were seen on Macquarie Island, 650 km from their nearest natal islands, in all months of all years from 1965 to 1980. The majority of the apparently opportunistic sightings were at the northern end of the island. Sightings increased from May to a September-October peak that was coincident with the cessation of breeding activities in the sea lions' natal range and the period when resident gentoo and royal penguins, and fur and elephant seals aggregated for breeding, all of which are now confirmed prey for New Zealand sea lions on Macquarie Island. The long-term effect of predation pressure from New Zealand sea lions on resident species remains unmeasured. After sleeping, interacting with southern elephant seals was a core sea lion activity. Predation on seabirds and interactions with elephant seals increase the risk of cross-species disease transmission.

AB  - Oviductal extracellular vesicles (oEVs) have been identified as important components of the oviductal fluid (OF) and have been pointed to as key modulators of gamete/embryo-maternal interactions. Here, we determined the functional impact of oEVs on embryo development and the embryonic transcriptome in porcine. Experiment 1 examined the effect of oEVs and OF on embryo development. In vitro-produced embryos were cultured with oEVs or OF for 2 or 7 days using an in vitro sequential system or without supplementation (control). Experiment 2 analyzed transcriptomic alterations of EV-treated embryos versus control and the oEVs RNA cargo by RNA-sequencing. Two days of EV treatment enhanced embryo development over time when compared to other treatments. Different RNA expression profiles between embryos treated with EVs for two or seven days and untreated controls were obtained, with 54 and 59 differentially expressed (DE) genes and six and seven DE miRNAs, respectively. In oEV RNA cargo, 12,998 RNAs and 163 miRNAs were identified. Integrative analyses pointed to specific oEV components that might act as modulators of the embryonic transcriptome, such as S100A11, ANXA2 or miR-21-5p. Overall, the findings suggested that oEVs could be a potential strategy to improve porcine IVP outcomes, particularly by using two days of EV treatment.

AB  - Pancreatic lipase related-protein 2 (PLRP2) exhibits remarkable galactolipase and phospholipase A1 activities, which depend greatly on the supramolecular organization of the substrates and the presence of surfactant molecules such as bile salts. The objective of the study was to understand the modulation of the adsorption mechanisms and enzymatic activity of Guinea pig PLRP2 (gPLRP2), by the physical environment of the enzyme and the physical state of its substrate. Langmuir monolayers were used to reproduce homogeneous and heterogeneous photosynthetic model membranes containing galactolipids (GL), and/or phospholipids (PL), and/or phytosterols (pS), presenting uncharged or charged interfaces. The same lipid mixtures were also used to form micrometric liposomes, and their gPLRP2 catalyzed digestion kinetics were investigated in presence or in absence of bile salts (NaTDC) during static in vitro, so called "bulk", digestion.The enzymatic activity of gPLRP2 onto the galactolipid-based monolayers was characterized with an optimum activity at 15 mN/m, in the absence of bile salts. gPLRP2 showed enhanced adsorption onto biomimetic model monolayer containing negatively charged lipids. However, the compositional complexity in the heterogeneous uncharged model systems induced a lag phase before the initiation of lipolysis. In bulk, no enzymatic activity could be demonstrated on GL-based liposomes in the absence of bile salts, probably due to the high lateral pressure of the lipid bilayers. In the presence of NaTDC (4 mM), however, gPLRP2 showed both high galactolipase and moderate phospholipase A1 activities on liposomes, probably due to a decrease in packing and lateral pressure upon NaTDC adsorption, and subsequent disruption of liposomes.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB  - Adult neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in two neurogenic areas of the brain, the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone, are major players in adult neurogenesis. Addressing specific questions regarding NSPCs outside of their niche entails in vitro studies through isolation and culture of these cells. As there is heterogeneity in their morphology, proliferation, and differentiation capacity between these two neurogenic areas, NSPCs should be isolated from each area through specific procedures and media. Identifying region-specific NPSCs provides an accurate pathway for assessing the effects of extrinsic factors and drugs on these cells and investigating the mechanisms of neurogenesis in both healthy and pathologic conditions. A great number of isolation and expansion techniques for NSPCs have been reported. The growth and expansion of NSPCs obtained from the dentate gyrus of aged rats are generally difficult. There are relatively limited data and protocols about NSPCs isolation and their culture from aged rats. Our approach is an efficient and reliable strategy to isolate and expand NSPCs obtained from young adult and aged rats. NSPCs isolated by this method maintain their self-renewal and multipotency.
   Key features
   NSPCs isolated from the hippocampal dentate gyrus of young adult and aged rats, based on Kempermann et al. (2014) and Aligholi et al. (2014).
   Maintenance of NSPCs isolated from the dentate gyrus of aged rats (20-24 months) in our culture condition is feasible.
   According to our protocol, maximum growth of primary neurospheres obtained from isolated NSPCs of young and aged rats took 15 and 35 days, respectively.

AB  - BackgroundThe Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba (E. superba), is a key organism in the Antarctic marine ecosystem and has been widely studied. However, there is a lack of transcriptome data focusing on temperature responses.MethodsIn this study, we performed transcriptome sequencing of E. superba samples exposed to three different temperatures: -1.19 degrees C (low temperature, LT), - 0.37 degrees C (medium temperature, MT), and 3 degrees C (high temperature, HT).ResultsIllumina sequencing generated 772,109,224 clean reads from the three temperature groups. In total, 1,623, 142, and 842 genes were differentially expressed in MT versus LT, HT versus LT, and HT versus MT, respectively. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed that these differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in the Hippo signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR revealed that ESG037073 expression was significantly upregulated in the MT group compared with the LT group, and ESG037998 expression was significantly higher in the HT group than in the LT group.ConclusionsThis is the first transcriptome analysis of E. superba exposed to three different temperatures. Our results provide valuable resources for further studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying temperature adaptation in E. superba.

AB  - Our previous studies have shown that some Trichoderma fungi trigger aggregation behavior in Formosan subterranean termites, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction of termite aggregation by Trichoderma fungi remain unclear. Here, we found that the aqueous or acetone extract of Trichoderma asperellum Samuels, Lieckfeldt & Nirenberg and Trichoderma virens Pers. ex Fries isolated from the gut or cuticle of C. formosanus elicited significant termite aggregation in 2-choice tests. We then screened 9 Trichoderma metabolites (3-acetoxy-2-butanone, phenol, 3-ethoxypropionic acid, ethyl 2,4-dioxovalerate, diglycolic acid, d-valine, styrene, 3-aminopyridine, and hexyl acetoacetate) that triggered termite aggregation. Among them, phenol (1 000 mu g/mL), 3-ethoxypropionic acid (10 mu g/mL), ethyl 2,4-dioxovalerate (1 000 mu g/mL), and diglycolic acid (1 000 mu g/mL) showed the strongest activities, triggering termite aggregation throughout the 24-h period. As T. asperellum and T. virens produce different metabolites that trigger aggregation behavior in termites, the mechanisms underlying the interaction between subterranean termites and Trichoderma fungi likely vary. Future studies are needed to test whether these chemicals can attract termites and increase bait consumption.

AB  - Plants respond indirectly to herbivore injury in a species-specific way and emit a specific blend of volatiles that are attractive to the enemies of herbivores. We evaluated whether maize plants, Zea mays L. (Poaceae), can recognize herbivory damage from a generalist stink bug, Diceraeus melacanthus Dallas (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). This species is not a common pest in maize, but is currently found on maize crops in Brazil. We aimed to answer the following questions: (1) does D. melacanthus use maize plant volatiles for host location? (2) Do maize plant chemical volatile profiles change due to feeding by D. melacanthus? And (3) do herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) emitted by maize plants play a role in the foraging behaviour of the generalist stink bug egg parasitoid Telenomus podisi Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae)? The results show that females of D. melacanthus do not use constitutive volatiles or HIPVs as host location cues. However, feeding by D. melacanthus activates maize indirect defence, inducing emission of HIPVs and attracting the herbivore's enemy. Thus, strengthening indirect defence of plants can be a strategy to protect crops in the field by recruiting natural enemies through chemical information, as an additional approach to control D. melacanthus within an integrated pest management program.

AB  - Simple Summary The Fanniidae is a small dipteran family in the muscoid grade of the Calyptrata. To resolve controversial issues of phylogeny, in addition to molecular analyses, the study of the muscles of the pregenital and genital segments of males can significantly help because they are considered to provide important information relating to the phylogenetic branching of the Cyclorrhapha. Here, the authors report on the structure of the sclerites and the muscles of terminal segments of three species of the Fanniidae. These structures are compared with other members of the muscoid grade, as well as the Oestroidea and Hippoboscoidea. In comparison with the majority of the Calyptrata, there is a significant reduction of the sclerites and muscles of the pregenital segments of the male genitalia of the Fanniidae. The presence of the lateral bacilliform sclerites, as well as the presence and position of the epandrial muscles of the Fanniidae as in primitive Muscidae and also in Tachina and Calliphora, is best interpreted as a plesiomorphic state, while the reductions are considered as derived relative to the ground plan of the Calyptrata. The abdominal and pregenital segments and the genitalia were studied in males of Fannia subpellucens (Zetterstedt, 1845), Fannia canicularis (Linnaeus, 1761) and Fannia incisurata (Zetterstedt, 1838). In comparison with the remaining members of the muscoid grade, in addition to the symmetry of the pregenital segments, significant reductions of the sclerites and musculature of the male terminalia have been observed in Fanniidae. The muscular structure of pregenital segments confirms that the fused pregenital ring is syntergosternite VI + VII + VIII. Symmetry and fusion, as well as the lower number of the sclerites and muscles of the pregenital segments and male genitalia of the Fanniidae, can be considered apomorphic character states. The presence of the lateral bacilliform sclerite, as well as the presence and position of the epandrial muscles M 26, three pairs of muscles M 19 and paired muscles M 18, can be considered as a plesiomorphic character state of the Fanniidae. The structure of the sclerites and muscles of the male abdominal segments and terminalia place the Fanniidae at the base of the muscoid grade and Oestroidea, as has been confirmed by recent molecular studies.

AB  - Termite researchers on The Nature Conservancy's Joseph H. Williams Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in northeast Oklahoma have long been interested about nutritional resources used by subterranean termites inhabiting the Preserve. In 12-week choice and no-choice laboratory feeding tests, subterranean termites were fed a mixture of stems-and-leaves, or roots only, of four predominant grasses growing on the Preserve: Indiangrass - Sorghastrum nutans L; Switchgrass - Panicum vigatum L; Big Bluestem - Andropogan gerardii Vitman; and Little Bluestem - Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.). Termites consumed all of these food choices but preferred roots compared with stems and leaves. In choice feeding tests, termites preferred Switchgrass roots. In no-choice feeding tests, roots of Indiangrass and Big Bluestem were consumed in greatest amounts. All four grasses were palatable to Reticulitermes tibialis, a subterranean termite common throughout the Preserve.

AB  - Excessive activation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propoinic acid (AMPA) receptors instigates excitotoxicity via enhanced calcium influx in the neurons thus inciting deleterious consequences. Additionally, Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) is pivotal in maintaining the intracellular calcium balance. Considering this, studying the aftermath of enhanced calcium uptake by neurons and its effect on ER environment can assist in delineating the pathophysiological events incurred by excitotoxicty. The current study was premeditated to decipher the role of ER pertaining to calcium homeostasis in AMPA-induced excitotoxicity. The findings showed, increased intracellular calcium levels (measured by flowcytometry and spectroflourimeter using Fura 2AM) in AMPA excitotoxic animals (male Sprague dawely rats) (intra-hippocampal injection of 10 mM AMPA). Further, ER resident proteins like calnexin, PDI and ERp72 were found to be upregulated, which further modulated the functioning of ER membrane calcium channels viz. IP3R, RyR, and SERCA pump. Altered calcium homeostasis further led to ER stress and deranged the protein folding capacity of ER post AMPA toxicity, which was ascertained by unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway markers such as IRE1 alpha, eIF2 alpha, and ATF6 alpha. Chemical chaperone, 4-phenybutric acid (4-PBA), ameliorated the protein folding capacity and subsequent UPR markers. In addition, modulation of calcium channels and calcium regulating machinery of ER post 4-PBA administration restored the calcium homeostasis. Therefore the study reinforces the significance of ER stress, a debilitating outcome of impaired calcium homeostasis, under AMPA-induced excitotoxicity. Also, employing chaperone-based therapeutic approach to curb ER stress can restore the calcium imbalance in the neuropathological diseases.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to establish a vitrification protocol for ovine preantral follicles, which can retain viability after thawing and to evaluate the impact of different vitrification treatments on apoptosis and development-related gene expression. Preantral follicles were isolated from cortical slices of ovaries by the mechanical method of isolation. The isolated preantral follicles (200-300 mu m) were randomly assigned into four groups. Group1 - Control Fresh preantral follicles (256 follicles); Group 2-Vitrification treatment A (259 follicles) (Vitrification solution 1 (VS1) - Fetal bovine serum (FBS)10%, Ethylene glycol (EG):1.8 M, Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): 1.4 M, Sucrose-0.3 M for 4 min; VS2- FBS10%, EG:4.5 M, DMSO: 3.5 M, Sucrose:0.3 M for 45 s), Group 3 - Vitr. treatment B (235 follicles) (VS1-FBS 20%, EG:1.3 M, DMS01.05 M for 15 min, VS2- FBS 20%, EG:2.7 M, DMSO:2.1 M for 5 min) and Group 4-Vitrification treatment C (248 follicles) (VS1-Glycerol(Gly):1.2 M for 3 min, VS2- Gly:1.2 M, EG:3.6 M for 3 min, VS3- Gly3M, EG: 4.5 M for 1 min). Preantral follicles were placed in corresponding vitrification treatments and later plunged immediately into liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C). After a week, the follicles were thawed and analyzed for follicular viability by trypan blue dye exclusion method as well as for gene expression. The results showed that the low concentration of cryoprotectants (vitrification treatment B) negatively affected the viability of preantral follicles in comparison with control follicles. There was no significant difference in the viability rates among the Control (87%), Treatment A (79%) and Treatment C (75%). The percentage of viable preantral follicles (73%) derived from Treatment B was significantly decreased (P<0.05%) in comparison to that of control. The expression of apoptotic gene BAK was higher in the vitrification treatment B group. Expressions of the other apoptosis-related genes i.e. Bcl2L1, BAD, BAX, Caspase 3, and Annexin showed no significant difference among the groups. The expression pattern of development competence genes GDF-9 and BMP-15 were higher (P < 0.05) in vitrification treatment A and C, respectively. Expression of NOBOX gene was significantly increased in preantral follicles with Vitrification treatment B compared to the control group. We conclude that both the Vitrification treatment A and Treatment C were the efficient vitrification treatment methods for the vitrification of ovine preantral follicles.

AB  - Soil contamination with heavy metals is one of the most important threats to the environment because they are easily incorporated into the food chain, threatening the health of plants, animals, and humans. In this study, the effectiveness of the introduced substances (compost and fly ash) was assessed in terms of its influence on the content of Cu and Zn in the soil, potential accumulation of these metals in the cultivated plants (camelina and oat), and thus in food products prepared from these plants. Therefore, the following indicators were used: bioconcentration factors calculated for the total amount (BCFT) and bioavailable amount of metals (BCFB) as well as gender-estimated daily intake (EDI) and health risk index (HRI). Regardless of gender, the EDI values ranged from 0.31 mu g center dot kg(-1) to 0.49 mu g center dot kg(-1) for Cu and from 0.9 mu g center dot kg(-1) to 1.8 mu g center dot kg(-1) for Zn in oat. For camelina, the calculated values were as follows: 4.1-8.5 mu g center dot kg(-1) for Cu and 7.1-12.1 mu g center dot kg(-1) for Zn. The HRI values were very low (in general 0.03-0.2), indicating no health risk connected with potential consumption of oat or camelina food products. The amounts of Cu and Zn in the crops grown on the soil amended with compost or fly ash were significantly lower (by 21-37% for oat and 14-34% for camelina) compared to the content of these metals in the control plants. Moreover, the levels of bioavailable metals decreased in soil as a result of the applied immobilizing agents. The study showed that the immobilization efficiency of compost and fly ash was comparable, and therefore the choice of either of these substances for the chemical remediation of soil contaminated with heavy metals is justified.

AB  - The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of maternal probiotic or synbiotic supplementation during gestation and lactation on antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial function, and intestinal microbiota abundance in offspring weaned piglets. A total of 64 pregnant Bama mini-sows were randomly allocated into the control group (basal diet), antibiotic group (basal diet+50 g/t virginiamycin), probiotic group (basal diet+200 mL/d probiotics per pig), or synbiotic group (basal diet+200 mL/d probiotics per pig+500 g/t xylo-oligosaccharides). On day 30 of post-weaning, eight piglets per group with average body weight were selected for sample collection. The results showed that maternal probiotic supplementation increased the catalase (CAT) activity in plasma and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in plasma, jejunum, and colon of piglets while decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 concentrations in plasma compared with the control group (P<0.05). Moreover, maternal synbiotic supplementation increased the plasma CAT activity, jejunal glutathione and GSH-Px activities, jejunal and colonic total antioxidant capacity activity, and plasma and colonic SOD activity while decreased the colonic MDA concentration of offspring piglets compared with the control group (P<0.05). The mRNA levels of antioxidant enzyme-related genes (copper- and zinc-containing superoxide dismutase, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 1, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) and mitochondrial-related genes (adenosine triphosphate synthase alpha subunit, adenosine triphosphate synthase beta, and mitochondrial transcription factor A) in the jejunal mucosa were significantly upregulated, while the level of colonic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha was downregulated by maternal synbiotic supplementation (P<0.05). Maternal probiotic supplementation increased (P<0.05) the Bacteroidetes abundance in the jejunum and Bifidobacterium abundance in the jejunum and colon, and synbiotic supplementation increased (P<0.05) the abundances of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus in the jejunum of piglets. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that intestinal microbiota abundances were significantly correlated with antioxidant enzyme activities and mitochondrial-related indexes. These findings indicated that maternal probiotic or synbiotic supplementation might be a promising strategy to improve the antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial function of offspring weaned piglets by altering the intestinal microbiota.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with complex etiology and phenotypes. Phosphodiesterase-1 (PDE1) inhibitors are known to provide benefits in various brain conditions manifesting similar behavioral phenotypes. The pharmacological consequences of vinpocetine administration a PDE1 inhibitor in prenatal-valproic acid (pre-VPA) induced ASD related behavioral phenotypes (social behavior deficits, repetitive behavior, anxiety, hyperlocomotion, and nociception) was assessed. Also, effects on important biochemical markers of neuronal function (DCX-neurogenesis, BDNF-neuronal survival, synapsin-IIa-synaptic transmission, pCREB-neuronal transcription factor), inflammation (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha) and oxidative stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive substance [TBARS] and glutathione (GSH) were studied in important brain areas (frontal cortex, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum). Further, neuronal cell viability was determined in dentate gyrus using Nissl staining. Pre-VPA administration resulted into impaired behavior, brain biochemistry, and neuronal cell viability. Administration of vinpocetine resulted in improvements of pre-VPA impaired social behavior, repetitive behavior, anxiety, locomotion, and nociception. Also, vinpocetine resulted in a significant increase in the levels of BDNF, synapsin-IIa, DCX, pCREB/CREB, IL-10, and GSH along with significant decrease in TNF-alpha, IL-6, TBARS, number of pyknotic and chromatolytic cells in different brain areas of pre-VPA group. Finally, high association between behavioral parameters and biochemical parameters was observed upon Pearson's correlation analysis. Vinpocetine, a PDE1 inhibitor rectified important behavioral phenotypes related with ASD, possibly by improving neuronal function, brain inflammation and brain oxidative stress. Thus, PDE1 may be a possible target for further understanding ASD. Lay Summary ASD is a brain developmental disorder with a wide array of genetic and environmental factors. Many targets have been identified till date, but a clinical treatment is still afar. The results of this study indicate that vinpocetine administration resulted in amelioration of ASD associated symptomatology in rats, prenatally exposed to VPA. Our research adds a widely expressed brain enzyme PDE1, as a possible novel pharmacological target and opens-up a new line of enquiry for ASD treatment.

AB  - Introduction: The technology in the automotive industry is becoming increasingly safer in the age of auto-mated driving, but the number of accidents is still high, especially in wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs). To better avoid these accidents, patterns involved in these accidents must be detected. Method: This paper presents a spatiotemporal risk prediction of WVCs, including various road and environmental char-acteristics. A process of data preparation using GIS automated by Python scripts was developed to enable a spatiotemporal link of diverse features for the subsequent predictive data analysis. Different machine learning (ML) approaches were applied-random forest (RF), feedforward neural networks (FNN), and support vector machine classifier (SVM) -including automated ML to predict the risk of WVCs. Therefore, a dataset of approximately 731,000 accidents reported to the police in Bavaria over a period of 10 years (2010-2019) was used. In addition, non-accidents were randomly generated in Python over time and space for the supervised ML processes. As the actual risk probability for WVCs and non-WVCs is not entirely known, the impact of different training ratios between accidents and non -accidents was tested on the risk prediction quality (RPQ) (25%, 50%, 75%, 90% WVCs) of the double -weighted sensitivity and single-weighted specificity rate. Results: The test yielded high mean values of RPQ as an indicator for a suitable WVC prediction. Both RF (86.6%) and FNN (86.7%) were identified as suitable choices for WVC risk prediction in terms of RPQ. The SVM yielded a lower prediction quality, even though acceptable results could be achieved within a shorter runtime. Practical Applications: Spatial transferability was verified since the algorithm was trained on the dataset of Bavaria (excluding Upper Bavaria) and successfully tested in Upper Bavaria. WVC forecasts were also proven through train-ing with datasets from 2010-2017 and in prediction for 2018 and 2019.(c) 2022 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Low birth weight (LBW) in various species leads to a pronounced skeletal muscle phenotype and can serve as a model to study muscle formation and draw conclusions for normal and pathological development. We aimed to elucidate in detail how the differentiation of muscular stem cells and their progeny are disturbed in piglets born with LBW. We isolated primary muscle cells from LBW piglets and their normal siblings with two different approaches: (1) single cells from two functionally divergent subpopulations (previously named "fast" and "slow") and (2) cells derived from isolated, intact myofibers. Subsequently, we analyzed their proliferative and differentiative capacity by determining proliferation rate, migration behavior, myotube formation, and myogenic gene and protein expression. LBW led to a decreased proliferation rate and migration potential in cells from the subpopulation fast group. Cells from LBW piglets were generally able to differentiate, but they formed smaller myotubes with less incorporated nuclei, leading to a diminished fusion rate. Myogenic gene expression was also significantly altered due to pig birth weight. Overall, early postnatal muscle development in LBW was disturbed at several crucial steps involving the establishment of a reserve stem cell pool, movement of cells towards existing myofibers, and the ability to form nascent myofibers.

AB  - Auditory-induced arousal is a defense mechanism of animals against potential dangers. Although the thal-amus is the neural substrate that relays sensory information to the cortex, its function is reduced during slow-wave sleep (SWS), also known as deep sleep. Despite this, animals are capable of waking up in response to external sensory stimuli, suggesting the existence of neural circuits that are involved in this response. Here, we report that kainate-class-type ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit 4 (GRIK4)-positive mediodorsal (MD) thalamic neurons act as a neural substrate for arousals from SWS. These neurons become active during arousal from SWS and their photoactivation can induce arousal from SWS. Moreover, we show that these neurons are influenced by glutamatergic neurons in the brainstem, the activity of which increases during auditory-induced arousals. These results suggest that this brainstem-MD pathway can mediate wake-fulness from SWS.

AB  - Neuroligins are synaptic cell adhesion proteins with a role in synaptic function, implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. The autism spectrum disorder-associated substitution Arg451Cys (R451C) in NLGN3 promotes a partial misfolding of the extracellular domain of the protein leading to retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The reduced trafficking of R451C NLGN3 to the cell surface leads to altered synaptic function and social behavior. A screening in HEK-293 cells overexpressing NLGN3 of 2662 compounds (FDA-approved small molecule drug library), led to the identification of several glucocorticoids such as alclometasone dipropionate, desonide, prednisolone sodium phosphate, and dexamethasone (DEX), with the ability to favor the exit of full-length R451C NLGN3 from the ER. DEX improved the stability of R451C NLGN3 and trafficking to the cell surface, reduced the activation of the UPR, and increased the formation of artificial synapses between HEK-293 and hippocampal primary neurons. The effect of DEX was validated on a novel model system represented by neural stem progenitor cells and differentiated neurons derived from the R451C NLGN3 knock-in mouse, expressing the endogenous protein. This work shows a potential rescue strategy for an autism-linked mutation affecting cell surface trafficking of a synaptic protein.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate methane productivity of Napier grass mono-digestion in single-stage anaerobic completely stirred tank reactors (CSTR) inoculated differently by cow manure (COM), anaerobic sludge (ANS), and a mix of COM and ANS for CSTR1 to 3, respectively. The different inoculation promoted operational performance, stability, and organic loading rate (OLR) differently. The produced biogas and methane varied significantly with OLR (p < 0.05). The maximum gas productivities between 0.42-0.48 L-biogas/g VSadded and 0.27-0.34 L-CH4/g VSadded were obtained at OLR of 1.0-1.5 g VS/L day. Later, the increase in OLR to 2.0 and 2.4 g VS/L day decreased biogas and methane yields by 24.85-39.65% and 11.66-52.89%. Co-inoculation of COM and ANS was a promising strategy that encouraged more stability in CSTR3 than the other reactors. Consequently, the methanogenic performance was developed in all digesters, depicted clearly by high methane content between 52.94 and 59.30% in produced biogas. A similar microbial structure was found in each CSTR-dominated predominantly by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Formicates. About 0.5-3.0% of the whole populations were archaea identified distinctly to Methanocorpusculum, Methanospirillum, and Methanosaeta. This finding confirmed the importance of seed inoculation to practical gas productivity and confined organic loading capacity of Napier grass biomethanation in single-stage wet and mono-substrate digestion processes.

AB  - The Bdnf (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) gene contains eight regulatory exons (I-VIII) alternatively spliced to the protein-coding exon IX. Only exons I, II, IV, and VI are relatively well studied. The BDNF system and brain serotonergic system are tightly interconnected and associated with aggression. The benzopentathiepine TC-2153 affects both systems and exerts antiaggressive action. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of TC-2153 on the Bdnf exons I-IX's expressions and serotonin receptors' mRNA levels in the brain of rats featuring high aggression toward humans (aggressive) or its absence (tame). Aggressive and tame adult male rats were treated once with vehicle or 10 or 20 mg/kg of TC-2153. mRNA was quantified in the cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and midbrain with real-time PCR. Selective breeding for high aggression or its absence affected the serotonin receptors' and Bdnf exons' transcripts differentially, depending on the genotype (strain) and brain region. TC-2153 had comprehensive effects on the Bdnf exons' expressions. The main trend was downregulation in the hypothalamus and midbrain. TC-2153 increased 5-HT1B receptor hypothalamusc mRNA expression. For the first time, an influence of TC-2153 on the expressions of Bdnf regulatory exons and the 5-HT1B receptor was shown, as was an association between Bdnf regulatory exons and fear-induced aggression involving genetic predisposition.

AB  - The associations among increased pain sensitivity, obesity, and systemic inflammation have not been described as related to BBB dysfunctions. To analyze the metabolic, behavioral, and inflammatory effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) and ultrastructural modifications in brain regions, we used an in vivo experimental model. Adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, an ad libitum control group or an HFD (60%)-fed group, for eight weeks. At the end of the protocol, glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed. Additionally, we analyzed the response to a normally innocuous mechanical stimulus and changes in motor coordination. At the end of the protocol, HFD-fed rats presented increased HOMA-IR and metabolic syndrome (MetS) prevalence. HFD-fed rats also developed an increased nociceptive response to mechanical stimuli and neurological injury, resulting in impaired motor function. Hypothalamus and cerebellum neurons from HFD-fed rats presented with nuclear swelling, an absence of nucleoli, and karyolysis. These results reveal that HFD consumption affects vital brain structures such as the cerebellum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. This, in turn, could be producing neuronal damage, impairing cellular communication, and consequently altering motricity and pain sensitivity. Although direct evidence of a causal link between BBB dysfunction and sensory-motor changes was not observed, understanding the association uncovered in this study could lead to targeted therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Purpose Bats belong to different guilds and thus differ in the environmental resources that they exploit. They also evolved to have a very rich diversity of roosting and feeding habits. Therefore, it enables them to harbor different species of parasites that could be zoonotic and may pose public health importance. The current study aimed to identify the ectoparasites of bats, under Family Streblidae, in different caves of Unisan, Quezon, Philippines. Methods Four caves were sampled in the study namely, Malusak, Mahangin, De Lamesa, and Bonifacio. Two mist nets for each cave were set up to capture bats. The bats were carefully observed for the presence of ectoparasites using forceps and cotton balls. Results Eight bat species belonging to four families, namely Hipposideridae, Vespertilionidae, Rhinolophidae, and Pteropodidae, were recovered from the study. Results showed that 130 out of 202 (64.36%) bats were infested with streblids with an overall mean intensity of 1 ectoparasite/bat. Out of four streblid species, Brachytarsina werneri, Brachytarsina amboinensis, and Raymondia pseudopagodarum were classified as stenoxenous. High specificity index was recorded for R. pseudopagodarum (S-TD = 3) and low specificity index for Brachytarsina species. Conclusion These results can be used by the local government in providing necessary actions that may lead to public awareness as these bats may also play a role in the transmission of zoonotic parasites in the area.

AB  - Purine-related metabolites are central to primary metabolic pathways in plants and serve as precursors for purine alkaloid biosynthesis in caffeinated species such as tea plants (Camellia sinensis). In this study, metabolite profiling of two tissues (young and mature leaves) was performed across 183 genetically diverse tea accessions, identifying and quantifying 10 purine alkaloid-related metabolites. Metabolite genome-wide association studies revealed 17 significant loci associated with these metabolites, including both known loci such as caffeine synthase and 16 novel loci (P < 1.05 x 10(-5)). Through functional annotation and in vitro enzymatic assay, we characterized 5 '-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (CsMTAN) as the causal gene underlying natural variation in adenosine and adenine content. CsMTAN can catalyze the degradation of both 5(y)-methylthioadenosine and S-adenosylhomocysteine to release adenine. The T -> A nucleotide substitution at SNP55151898, which leads to a phenylalanine -> tyrosine substitution at residue 179 (F179Y), resulted in a significant alteration of enzyme activity in vitro, as evidenced by an approximately 50% reduction in adenine abundance (P < 0.05). Transient overexpression of CsMTAN-A and CsMTAN-T in Nicotiana benthamiana both significantly increased adenine content and dramatically decreased adenosine content, providing direct evidence for the functional involvement of CsMTAN in plant purine metabolism. CsMTAN-T overexpression resulted in significantly lower adenosine level than CsMTAN-A (P < 0.05). Phylogenetic analysis across 115 species and protein structural modeling revealed a distinct evolutionary divergence between plant MTAN evolution and species phylogeny, strongly suggesting the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer events in the evolutionary history of plant MTANs. This study thus furthered our understanding of the genetics and molecular mechanisms regulating purine metabolism and purine alkaloid biosynthesis in tea plants and provided novel targets for molecular breeding and synthetic biology applications.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is constantly mutating and spreading globally, posing a great threat to people's lives and health. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) is an attractive drug target for SARS-CoV-2, due to its crucial role in processing the viral replication. Here, we showed that chondroitin sulfate (CS) from pig, cattle and shark efficaciously inhibits Mpro activity of SARS-CoV-2 with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 0.148, 0.121 and 0.119 mu M, respectively, through a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The inhibition pattern of CSs against Mpro activity is competitive inhibition, with inhibition constants (Ki) of CSs derived from pig, bovine and shark are 0.111, 0.096, and 0.107 mu M, respectively, indicating significant inhibitory effects of CSs on Mpro activity. Protein fluorescence quenching demonstrated that porcine, bovine and shark CSs strongly bind to Mpro protein with dissociation constants (KD) of 28.31, 28.47 and 20.66 mu M at 25 degrees C at a physiological condition, respectively, mainly through van der Waals and hydrogen bond interactions. Molecular docking and dynamics analysis provides an insight into structural information of the binding of the CSs with Mpro protein. Our findings suggested that CSs from different origins might be a promising food ingredient for the prevention of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Arctigenin is a bioactive dibenzylbutyrolactone-type lignan exhibiting various pharmacological activities. The neuroprotective effects of arctigenin were demonstrated to be mediated via inhibition of AMPA and KA type glutamate receptors in the somatosensory cortex of the rat brain. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of arctigenin with matairesinol and trachelogenin on synaptic activity in ex vivo rat brain slices. Arctigenin, matairesinol and trachelogenin were isolated from Arctium lappa, Centaurea scabiosa and Cirsium arvense , respectively, and applied on brain slices via perfusion medium at the concentration range of 0.5 - 40 mu M. The effects of the lignans were examined in the CA1 hippocampus and the somatosensory cortex by recording electrically evoked field potentials. Arctigenin and trachelogenin caused a significant dose-dependent decrease in the amplitude of hippocampal population spikes (POPS) and the slope of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), whereas matairesinol (1 mu M and 10 mu M) decreased EPSP slope but had no effect on POPS amplitude. Trachelogenin effect (0.5 mu M, 10 mu M, 20 mu M) was comparable to arctigenin (1 mu M, 20 mu M, 40 mu M) (p > 0.05). In the neocortex, arctigenin (10 mu M, 20 mu M) and trachelogenin (10 mu M) significantly decreased the amplitude of evoked potential early component, while matairesinol (1 mu M and 10 mu M) had no significant effect (p > 0.05). The results suggest that trachelogenin and arctigenin act via inhibition of AMPA and KA receptors in the brain and trachelogenin has a higher potency than arctigenin. Thus, trachelogenin and arctigenin could serve as lead compounds in the development of neuroprotective drugs.

AB  - Vegetative propagation through cutting is a widely used clonal approach for maintaining desired genotypes. However, some woody species have difficulty forming adventitious roots (ARs) with this approach, including yellow camellia (YC) C. nitidissima. Yellow camellias, prized for their ornamental value and potential health benefits in tea, remain difficult to propagate clonally due to this rooting recalcitrance. As part of the efforts to understand YC cuttings' recalcitrance, we conducted a detailed investigation into AR formation in yellow camellia cuttings via histology and endogenous phytohormone dynamics during this process. We also compared YC endogenous phytohormone and metabolite phytohormone profiles with those of easy-to-root poplar and willow cuttings. Our results indicate that the induction of ARs in YC cuttings is achievable through auxin treatment, and YC ARs are initiated from cambial derivatives and develop a vascular system connected with that of the stem. During AR induction, endogenous hormones showed a dynamic profile, with IAA continuing to increase starting 9 days after auxin induction. JA, JA-Ile, and OPDA showed a similar trend as IAA but decreased by the 45th day. Cytokinin first decreased to its lowest level by the 18th day and then increased. SA largely exhibited an increasing trend with a drop on the 36th day, while ABA first increased to its peak level by the 18th day and then decreased. Compared to poplar, YC cuttings had a low level of IAA, IAA-Asp, and OPDA, and a high level of cytokinin and SA. Metabolite profiling highlighted significant down-accumulation of compounds associated with AR formation in yellow camellias, such as citric and ascorbic acid, fructose, sucrose, flavonoids, and phenolic acid derivatives. Our study reveals the unfavorable endogenous hormone and metabolite profiles underlying the rooting recalcitrance of YC cuttings, providing valuable knowledge for addressing this challenge in clonal propagation.

AB  - Due to the limitations in the use of antibiotic agents, researchers are constantly seeking natural bioactive compounds that could benefit udder health status but also milk quality characteristics in dairy animals. The aim of the current study was therefore to examine the effects of a standardized mixture of plant bioactive components (MPBC) originated from thyme, anise and olive on milk yield, composition, oxidative stability and somatic cell count in dairy ewes. Thirty-six ewes approximately 75 days after parturition were randomly allocated into three experimental treatments, which were provided with three diets: control (C); without the addition of the mixture, B1; supplemented with MPBC at 0.05% and B2; supplemented with rumen protected MPBC at 0.025%. The duration of the experiment was 11 weeks, and milk production was weekly recorded, while individual milk samples for the determination of composition, oxidative stability, somatic cell count (SCC), pH and electric conductivity were collected. Every two weeks, macrophage, lymphocyte, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts were also determined in individual milk samples. It was observed that milk yield was the greatest in the B2 group, with significant differences within the seventh and ninth week (p < 0.05), whereas no significant differences were found for milk composition, with the exception of the seventh week, when protein, lactose and non-fat solid levels were lower in MPBC groups (p < 0.05). Oxidative stability was improved in the groups that received the MPBC, with significant differences at the third, seventh, tenth and eleventh week (p < 0.05). SCC was also significantly lower at the second, eighth and ninth week in B2 compared to the other groups (p < 0.05), while no significant effects on the macrophage, lymphocyte, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts were observed. In conclusion, the MPBC addition had a positive effect on sheep milk yield, oxidative stability and somatic cell count, without any negative effect on its composition.

AB  - Haemonchus contortus has caused significant economic losses in many regions. The emergence of drug resistance has created new difficulties for the prevention and control of parasitic diseases in cattle and sheep. The mechanism of drug resistance to ivermectin in H. contortus is not clear; therefore, it is of great significance to study it. Non-coding RNAs, especially microRNAs (miRNAs), play important roles in drug resistance in some human tumors and insects. However, few studies have investigated whether miRNAs are involved in the regulation of drug resistance to ivermectin. In the early stages of this study, four miRNAs that may be involved in the regulation of ivermectin resistance in H. contortus were identified by high-throughput sequencing analysis of ivermectin-sensitive and -resistant strains of H. contortus. To verify whether these miRNAs are indeed related to ivermectin resistance in H. contortus, RNA interference (RNAi) experiments were performed on these miRNAs. The expression of candidate drug-resistance-related miRNA target genes before and after RNAi was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The resistance of the third-stage larvae (L3s) of H. contortus before and after RNAi was detected using 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide and 100 mu g/mL ivermectin treatment. The locomotion behavior of the L3s of H. contortus before and after RNAi was detected by counting the frequency of head thrashes and body bending. Finally, we confirmed that miR-10,025-y, miR-5960-z, miR-27-y, and miR-276-y were involved in and regulate ivermectin resistance in H. contortus.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by intermittent repeated episodes of hypoxia-reoxygenation. OSA is associated with cerebrovascular consequences. An enhanced blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability has been proposed as a marker of those disorders. We studied in mice the effects of 1 day and 15 days intermittent hypoxia (IH) exposure on BBB function. We focused on the dorsal part of the hippocampus and attempted to identify the molecular mechanisms by combining in vivo BBB permeability (Evans blue tests) and mRNA expression of several junction proteins (zona occludens (ZO-1,2,3), VE-cadherin, claudins (1,5,12), cingulin) and of aquaporins (1,4,9) on hippocampal brain tissues. After 15 days of IH exposure we observed an increase in BBB permeability, associated with increased mRNA expressions of claudins 1 and 12, aquaporins 1 and 9. IH seemed to increase early for claudin-1 mRNA expression as it doubled with 1 day of exposure and returned near to its base level after 15 days. Claudin-1 overexpression may represent an immediate response to IH exposure. Then, after 15 days of exposure, an increase in functional BBB permeability was associated with enhanced expression of aquaporin. These BBB alterations are possibly associated with a vasogenic oedema that may affect brain functions and accelerate neurodegenerative processes.

AB  - Grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is widely grown in the Southern Plains of the United States and is a host of the sorghum aphid, Melanaphis sorghi (Theobald), which is a serious pest of the crop. Several species of aphidophagous predatory insects occur in sorghum and feed on the sorghum aphid. Two abundant species in this crop are the coccinellid Hippodamia convergens (Guerin-Meneville) and the chrysopid Chrysoperla rufilabris (Burmeister). In this study, we estimated the predation rates by these two species on the sorghum aphid in a laboratory setting. We estimated the predation by the larvae for both species and by adult male and female H. convergens. The weights of H. convergens ranged from a mean of 0.0021 g for the 1st instar larvae to 0.0211 g for the 4th instar larvae. The weights of C. rufilabris ranged from 0.0018 g for the 1st instar larvae to 0.0109 for the 3rd instar larvae. The weight of M. sorghi preyed upon by the larvae of H. convergens and C. rufilabris during 24 h increased approximately linearly with an increase in the larval weight. The slope of the linear regression line for the weight of M. sorghi killed to the larval weight was 0.54 for H. convergens and 0.94 for C. rufilabris, which indicated that at identical larval weights, there was an approximately 70% greater weight of M. sorghi preyed upon by the larvae of C. rufilabris than by the larvae of H. convergens. There was no evidence for a preference by H. convergens or C. rufilabris for preying on particular size classes of M. sorghi. The results are discussed in terms of the ability of the predators to contribute to the biological control of M. sorghi.

AB  - The insect olfactory system plays pivotal roles in insect survival and reproduction through odor detection. Morphological and physiological adaptations are caste-specific and evolved independently in workers, soldiers, and reproductives in termites. However, it is unclear whether the olfactory system is involved in the division of labor in termite colonies. In the present study, the antennal sensilla of alates, workers, soldiers, nymphs, and larvae of the termite Reticulitermes aculabialis Tsai et Hwang ( Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) were investigated. Transcriptomes were used to detect olfactory genes, and differential expression levels of olfactory genes were confirmed in various castes by qRT-PCR analysis. Nine types of sensilla were identified on the antennae of R. aculabialis, and soldiers possessed all 9 types. In 89,475 assembled unigenes, we found 16 olfactory genes, including 6 chemosensory protein (CSP) and 10 odorant-binding protein (OBP) genes. These OBP genes included 8 general odorant-binding protein genes (GOBPs) and 2 pheromone-binding protein-related protein (PBP) genes. Five CSP genes were more highly expressed in alates than in workers, soldiers, larvae, and nymphs, and the expression levels of CSP6 were significantly higher in nymphs. Seven GOBP and two PBP genes exhibited significantly higher expression levels in alates, and there were no significant differences in the expression levels of GOBP2 among workers, soldiers, alates, and larvae. These results suggest that alates, as primary reproductives, have unique expression patterns of olfactory genes, which play key roles in nuptial flight, mate seeking, and new colony foundation.

AB  - Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) is a rapidly evolving species complex, and is small in size and difficult to identify quickly and accurately. For the accurate identification and effective prevention of this species, the specific PCR method based on the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I (mt DNA COI) gene was used in the present study to evaluate rapid molecular detection technological applications for Mediterranean (MED) species. The MED was targeted and whitefly species from different regions were used as references. Fragments of the mt DNA COI gene of the MED and other closely related species were amplified with universal primers. Species-specific mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I (SS-COI) primers BQLF/BQLR and BQJF/BQJR were designed from variable sites of MED and other whitefly species partial COI gene sequences. Subsequently, the lengths of target fragments were amplified by two pairs of SS-COI primers. Meanwhile, the accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of SS-COI primers were determined using various life stages of the MED and other related species collected from different locations. The primer pairs BQLF/BQLR and BQJF/BQJR generated 334 bp and 483 bp amplified fragment length respectively. Accuracy test results showed that primers can detect the MED single-head adults and also accurately detect single-egg and first instar, second instar and third instar nymphs, MED pupae, etc. Specific detection results demonstrated that the primers were able to amplify the MED but not the following species/populations: Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1), Asia I, Asia II 1, Asia II 6 and Asia II 7, Aleurocanthus spiniferus (Quaintanca), A. camelliae, Siphoninus phillyreae, Aleuroclava rhododendri, A. thysanospermi, Aleurolobus taonabae, Dialeurodes citri and Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) in different areas. Sensitivity detection results showed that primers can detect the minimum threshold of 2,160 pg/mu l and 1.38 pg/mu l, respectively (equivalent to 1/1280 and 1/2000000 adult). This technique solves the problem that MED cannot be identified based on morphology. This method simultaneously adopted SS-COI PCR technological applications that improved detection accuracy and saved detection time.

AB  - The development of baits for subterranean termite control over the past 25 yr has provided cost-effective alternatives to liquid termiticide treatments. Current bait products use one of the few available benzoylurea chitin synthesis inhibitors (CSIs) labeled for subterranean termites. These insecticides are used because of their nonrepellency, their slow-acting mode of action, and their dose-independent lethal time. Although many studies have provided ample evidence of the efficacy of CSI baits for subterranean termite colony elimination, most have focused on hexaflumuron and noviflumuron. However, bait products using alternative CSIs have not received the same level of scrutiny, limiting the amount of evidence proving their efficacy. One such compound is novaluron, the active ingredient currently used in the Trelona ATBS-AdvanceTermite Baiting System bait product. The current study independently tested the efficacy of this commercially available bait formulation against whole colonies of Coptotermes gestroi (Wamann) (similar to 63,910 workers) in the laboratory, using an extended experimental setup to simulate a 15-m foraging distance from the central part of the nest to the bait, while having access to alternative food sources. Treated colonies progressively ceased to feed on wood items within 45 d after being provided access to the novaluron bait formulation, with a subsequent progressive collapse of the population, leading to colony elimination by 91 d. This study therefore confirms the efficacy of novaluron baits against subterranean termites, and currently remains one of the few CSIs that can be applied for the successful control of Coptotermes infestations.

AB  - Food waste, such as eggshell, can be an environmental problem if it is not properly managed. One of the ways to solve this is by using the eggshell as the cheap calcium source in food products. Polish gingerbread fortified with chicken eggshell powder (ESP) calcium was developed to solve the eggshell waste problem and to reduce the risk of osteoporosis. This study focused on the effect of ESP addition on basic composition, sensory evaluation, and antioxidative activity of gingerbread. Two samples of gingerbread without and with 3% (w/w of wheat flour) ESP, with controlled green tea powder (4% w/w of white chocolate) were analyzed. Results of the research showed that the addition of 3% ESP significantly increased the ash and calcium content (p < 0.05) without changing the appearance, aroma, texture, taste profiles, and the hedonic score of gingerbread. The gingerbread samples were then stored for 2 months and were analyzed every month. The hedonic evaluation of the aroma of both gingerbread samples decreased significantly (p < 0.05) during storage. During 2 months of storage, the antioxidative activity of gingerbread fortified with 3% ESP was not significantly different compared to the control (p > 0.05), particularly in ABTS and ORAC(FL) assay. The ABTS, DPPH, and ORAC(FL) assays showed decreasing antioxidative activity during storage, which was also in accordance with decreasing total phenolic content of both gingerbread samples. In PCL assay, the lipid-soluble antioxidant activity in gingerbread with 3% ESP was significantly higher during 2 months of storage, compared to the control (p < 0.05). The developed product might be a potential alternative to improve the calcium (26% daily value (DV) recommendation per 100 g) and antioxidant intake in order to prevent calcium deficiency. Gingerbread enriched with an organic source of calcium may become an innovative product to reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis in the elderly population, having potential health and economic significance, given the incidence of osteoporosis and the costs of treating this disease.

AB  - 2,2,4,4-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, has gained increasing attention due to its high level in biological samples and potential neurotoxicity. Recent studies have indicated that the receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)-mediated necroptosis is implicated in BDE-47 cytotoxicity. However, little is known about the underlying mechanism and whether the necroptosis participates in BDE-47-induced neuronal injury and cognitive impairment. Our results indicated that exposure to BDE-47 triggered RIPK1-dependent neuronal necroptosis in mice hippocampi and HT-22 mouse hippocampal neurons. Necrostain-1 (Nec-1), a specific RIPK1 inhibitor, suppressed the RIPK1/RIPK3/mixed lineage kinase-like domain protein (MLKL) signaling and rescued neuronal survival in BDE-47-treated HT-22 neurons. Mechanically, increased mitochondrial Ca2+ influx precipitated the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), leading to occurrence of hippocampal neuronal necroptosis under BDE-47 stress. BDE-47 exposure induced excessive mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) formation and promoted ER-to-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer, while diminishing ER-mitochondrial contacts by Glucose-regulated protein 75 (Grp75)-deficiency remarkably prevented mitochondria Ca2+ overload and opening of mPTP as well as neuronal necroptosis. Notably, Nec-1 pre-treatment could substantially mitigate neuronal/synaptic damage and cognitive impairment in BDE-47-exposed mice. Collectively, these data suggest that BDE-47 exposure intensified endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial (Mito) contact and facilitated Ca2+ transfer from ER towards mitochondria, resulting in mPTP opening-mediated hippocampal neuronal necroptosis and subsequent cognitive dysfunction. Our study shed new light on the mechanisms underlying BDE-47 neurotoxicity and provided a novel therapeutic strategy through targeting RIPK1 kinase activity.

AB  - Aldose reductase (AR) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) are important enzymes of the polyol pathway. In the current study, inhibitory effects of vulpinic acid (VA) carnosic acid (CA) and usnic acid (UA) on purified AR and SDH enzymes were determined. These enzymes inhibition could be essential to prevent diabetic complications. AR and SDH enzymes were purified from sheep kidney. Then, VA, CA and UA were tested in various concentrations against these enzymes activity in vitro. KI values were found to be as 1.46 +/- 0.04, 5.13 +/- 0.25 and 11.71 +/- 0.27 lM for VA, CA and UA, respectively, for AR. KI constants were found to be as 15.32 +/- 0.34, 145.60 +/- 2.17 and 213.40 +/- 2.64 lM VA, CA and UA, respectively, for SDH. These findings indicate that VA, CA and UA could be useful in the treatment of diabetic complications.

AB  - Excess salt intake harms the brain health and cognitive functions, but whether a maternal high-salt diet (HSD) affects the brain development and neural plasticity of offspring remains unclear. Here, using a range of behavioral tests, we reported that the offspring of maternal HSD subjects exhibited short- and long-term memory deficits, especially in spatial memory in adulthood. Moreover, impairments in synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus were observed in adult offspring by using in vivo electrophysiology. Consistently, the number of astrocytes but not neurons in the hippocampus of the offspring from the HSD group were significantly decreased, and ERK and AKT signaling pathways involved in neurodevelopment were highly activated only during juvenile. In addition, the expression of synaptic proteins decreased both in juvenile and adulthood, and this effect might be involved in synaptic dysfunction. Collectively, these data demonstrated that the maternal HSD might cause adult offspring synaptic dysfunction and memory loss. It is possibly due to the reduction of astrocytes in juvenile.

AB  - In the present study, purine alkaloid analysis and transcriptome of Camellia gymnogyna Hung T. Chang (Theaceae) from Dayao Mountain were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and RNA-Seq, respectively. The results showed that the major purine alkaloids accumulated in Camellia gymnogyna Hung T. Chang (Theaceae) were theobromine together with a small amount of theacrine and caffeine. Through polymerase chain reaction (PCR), three types of cDNA encoding N-methyltransferases were isolated from the leaves of Camellia gymnogyna Hung T. Chang (Theaceae) and designated GCS1, GCS2, and GCS3. We subsequently expressed GCS1, GCS2, and GCS3 in Escherichia coli and incubated lysates of the bacterial cells with a variety of xanthine substrates in the presence of S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor. We found that the recombinant GCS1 proteins catalyzed 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid to produce theacrine, the recombinant GCS3 proteins catalyzed 7-methylxanthine to produce theobromine, while the recombinant GCS2 proteins did not catalyze any xanthine derivatives. Simultaneous analysis of the expressions of GCS1, GCS2, GCS3, and a caffeine synthase gene (TCS1) in Camellia gymnogyna Hung T. Chang (Theaceae) and other tea plants provided a reference for further research on the functions of these genes.

AB  - How organ size is determined is a fundamental question in life sciences. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the Hippo pathway in regulating organ size. This pathway controls cell proliferation and cell death to maintain the proper number of cells. The activity of the Hippo pathway is tightly fine-tuned through various post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Here, we discover that miR-927 is a novel regulator of wing size. Overexpression of miR-927 decreases wing size, which can be rescued by co-expressing miR-927-sponge. Next, we show that miR-927 stimulates apoptosis and suppresses the expression of Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1, a well-known target gene of the Hippo pathway. Genetic epistatic analyses position miR-927 upstream of Yorkie (Yki) to modulate the Hippo pathway. In addition, there is a matching miR-927 seed site in the yki 3 ' untranslated region (3 '-UTR), and we demonstrate that yki 3 '-UTR is the direct target of miR-927. Ultimately, our study reveals that the targeting of yki by miR-927 to regulate the Hippo pathway is conserved in Helicoverpa armigera. Administration of miR-927 via star polycation (SPc) nanocarrier effectively inhibits wing development in H. armigera. Taken together, our findings uncover a novel mechanism by which Yki is silenced at the post-transcriptional level by miR-927, and provide a new perspective on pest management.

AB  - The Asian subterranean termite, Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann 1896) (Isoptera Rhinotermitidae), is a structural pest endemic to Southeast Asia that has been spread anthropogenically to much of the tropics worldwide. We report a land -based establishment of C. gestroi in Alexandria, Egypt, the northernmost locality of this species and over 4000 km from its nearest previous locality in northern India. An earlier study suggested that C. gestroi , misidentified as Reticulitermes lucifugus (Rossi 1792), was in Alexandria in 2010. We confirm C. gestroi in Alexandria based on soldier morphology and COII sequence data. We also report that Coptotermes alexandrinus Mohammad et Ramadan 2023, is a junior synonym of C. gestroi . The world distribution of C. gestroi is presented.

AB  - The soil-feeding habit is an evolutionary novelty found in some advanced groups of termites. The study of such groups is important to revealing interesting adaptations to this way-of-life. The genus Verruco-sitermes is one such example, characterized by peculiar outgrowths on the head capsule, antennae and maxillary palps, which are not found in any other termite. These structures have been hypothesized to be linked to the presence of a new exocrine organ, the rostral gland, whose structure has remained un-explored. We have thus studied the ultrastructure of the epidermal layer of the head capsule of Verru-cositermes tuberosus soldiers. We describe the ultrastructure of the rostral gland, which consists of class 3 secretory cells only. The dominant secretory organelles comprise rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which provide secretions delivered to the surface of the head, likely made of peptide-derived components of unclear function. We discuss a possible role of the rostral gland of soldiers as an adap-tation to the frequent encounter with soil pathogens during search for new food resources.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Simple Summary This work aimed to build a molecular marker to detect Spodoptera frugiperda DNA in predators' gut content. The molecular marker developed is highly specific, and it was able to detect S. frugiperda DNA in the gut content of ladybug and earwig predators in field conditions. Our results confirm that generalist predators feed on S. frugiperda in maize fields, and they must be considered in IPM programs for S. frugiperda suppression. Spodoptera frugiperda is a serious pest of maize and other crops worldwide. The integration of control tactics is recommended for S. frugiperda suppression because reports of insecticide and Btplant-resistance are frequent. Biological control agents would be an alternative to improve S. frugiperda control in agricultural areas. We constructed a species-specific molecular marker to detect S. frugiperda DNA in predators' gut content and estimated the predation rates of ladybugs and earwigs on S. frugiperda in maize crops. Predators were sampled in Pirassununga, Sao Paulo state, Brazil, in 2020 and 2021. Using the species-specific molecular marker in laboratory conditions, we estimated the half-life time to detect S. frugiperda DNA in the gut contents of Hippodamia convergens as 6.16 h and Doru luteipes as 25.72 h. The weekly predation rate of S. frugiperda by predators in maize crop varied from 0 to 42.1% by ladybugs and from 0 to 9.2% by D. luteipes. Predation events on S. frugiperda by predators were more frequent during the maize reproductive stage. Our results confirmed that predators might contribute to S. frugiperda suppression in maize fields. However, further studies of prey-predator interactions and agricultural landscapes are essential for a better understanding of predator dynamics in crops.

AB  - Nasal mites of the family Rhinonyssidae are parasites living in the respiratory system of birds. To date there were no record of these mites from representatives of the order Procellariiformes, a numerous grouping o f exclusively marine birds that includes albatrosses, petrels, storm-petrels and shearwaters. The paper describes two new species of the genus Rhinonyssus from shearwaters (Procellariidae) found on various shores of Brazil: Rhinonyssus borealis sp. nov. from Calonectris borealis (Cory's shearwater) and R. procellaricus sp. nov. from Puffinus puffinus (Manx shearwater) and Ardenna gravis (Great shearwater). Both described mites are characterized by a large elliptical body and a relatively large and strongly sclerotized with the well-developed caudal extension. Rhinonyssus borealis sp. nov. and R. procellaricus sp. nov. are similar in their general appearance to each other but differ in the size of idiosoma, shape of podosomal and sternal shields and leg chaetotaxy.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is a widespread neurotoxic pollutant. Pb exposureisassociated with mood disorders, with no well-established neural mechanismselucidated. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whetherexcitatory neurons in the dentate gyrus subregion of the ventral hippocampus(vDG) played a key role in Pb-induced anxiety and depression-likebehaviors. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 100 ppm Pb starting on day1 of pregnancy until experiments were performed using the offspring.Behavioral studies suggested that chronic Pb exposure triggered anxietyand depression-like behaviors. A combination of electrophysiological,optogenetic, and immunohistochemistry experiments was conducted. Resultsshowed that Pb exposure resulted in excitatory neuronal hyperexcitabilityin vDG and that the behavioral deficits caused by Pb exposure couldbe rescued by inhibition of excitatory neuronal activity. Moreover,it was found that the action potential (AP) threshold of excitatoryneurons was decreased by electrophysiological recordings. Our studydemonstrates a significant role for excitatory neurons in vDG in Pb-inducedanxiety and depression-like behaviors in mice, which is likely a resultof decreased AP threshold. These outcomes can serve as an importantbasis for understanding mechanisms of anxiety and depression underenvironmental Pb exposure and help in the design of therapeutic strategies.
   Pb is widespread and notable for itsneurotoxic effectseven at low levels of exposure encountered in the general environment.This study provides previously unexplored avenues of investigationfor the development of potential therapeutic targets in the treatmentof anxiety and depression due to environmental Pb exposure.

AB  - Structural neuroplasticity of the hippocampus in the form of neurogenesis and dendritic remodelling underlying morphine tolerance is still less known. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess whether unconditioned- and conditioned-morphine tolerance can trigger structural neuroplasticity in the dorsal and ventral parts of the adult male rat hippocampus. Evaluation of the levels of neurogenesis markers (Ki67 and DCX) by immunohistochemistry shows that conditioned morphine tolerance is sufficient to increase the baseline topographic level of hippocampal neurogenesis in adult rats. Dendritic spine visualization by Golgi staining shows that the behavioural testing paradigms themselves are sufficient to trigger the hippocampus subregion-specific changes in the dendritic remodelling along the apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and dentate granule cells in adult rats. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of Bdnf, Trkb, Rac-1 and RhoA mRNA levels as pro-plasticity molecules, shows that the conditioned morphine tolerance is effective in changing Bdnf and RhoA mRNA levels in the ventral hippocampus of adult rats. In summary, we demonstrate that the acquisition of morphine tolerance promotes adult neurogenesis, dendritic remodelling and pro-plasticity molecules such as Bdnf/Trkb in the rat hippocampus. Indeed, the structural neuroplasticity of the hippocampus may underlie the newly formed aberrant memory and could provide the initial basis for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of morphine-tolerance plasticity in the hippocampus.

AB  - The chestnut weevil, Curculio davidi Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a major pest of chestnuts. Damage caused by C. davidi has increased as beetle populations have expanded. To promote effective C. davidi management practices based on its host plant, we compared the susceptibility of local chestnut cultivar 'Qinli 2'(QL2) and introduced chestnut cultivar 'Hongli' (HL) in Qinling Mountains to this weevil. Number of eggs laid by C. davidi females in HL was significantly higher than that of QL2. Chestnut weevil females laid 6.25-fold and 3-fold more eggs in HL than QL2 in the choice tests and no-choice tests, respectively. From 2021 to 2023, C. davidi infestation rates of HL were significantly higher than that of QL2 in the field. HL was smaller, softer, and have lower cellulose content as compared with QL2. HL contained 4.61%, 13.76%, 10.09%, 26.53%, 9.24%, 18.4%, 6.28%, and 23.26% higher amounts of N, K, Ca, Mg, S, Na, Mn, and Cu respectively, than QL2. In contrast, QL2 contained 25.28%, 19.80%, and 16.83% higher amounts of Al, B, and Fe, than HL. Our results revealed that the introduced chestnut cultivar is more susceptible to C. davidi compared to the local chestnut cultivar in Qinling Mountain, which was associated with several physico-chemical changes in chestnuts. These findings may contribute to the future efforts for breeding of C. davidi-resistant chestnut cultivars.

AB  - Some leafmining fly species are pests of agricultural and ornamental plants but they also include many species with little economic importance. The taxonomy of leafmining flies is often challenging because of putative cryptic species. Following new outbreaks of Liriomyza (Diptera:Agromyzidae) in Australia, we here characterize 13 dipteran leafminer species collected from Australia based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) DNA barcodes, and we compare these with overseas data. We confirm barcodes of nine species from the Agromyzidae (Liriomyza sativae, L. huidobrensis, L. trifolii, L bryoniae, L. chinensis, L. brassicae, L. chenopodii, Phytomyza plantaginis and P syngenesiae) and one species from the Drosophilidae (Scaptomyza flava); we describe new haplotypes for some of these species. Furthermore, we provide the first DNA barcodes for two species (Cerodontha milleri and Phytoliriomyza praecellens) from the Agromyzidae and one species (Scaptomyza australis) from the Drosophilidae. These findings provide a baseline for DNA-based identification of pest Liriomyza incursions spreading across the Australian east coast in relation to other species already present in Australia.

AB  - Cacti are characterized by the extensive production of a broad variety of toxic metabolites as an anti-herbivore strategy but nevertheless cactophilic Drosophila spp. (Diptera: Drosophilidae) feed and breed on decaying cacti. The family of cytochrome P450 is a group of enzymes involved in the detoxification metabolism, which are critical for the adaptation of phytophagous insects, especially populations of Drosophila exploiting cacti. In this context, Drosophila buzzatii Patterson & Wheeler and Drosophila koepferae Fontdevila & Wasserman (Drosophilini), constitute an excellent model for the study of the genetic basis of tolerance to cacti allelochemicals. These closely related species allow testing to what extent a relatively small set of genes can explain host use patterns and their role in the divergent evolution of specialization. We evaluated the role of the P450 genes in the adaptation of these species to the use of one of their hosts, the columnar cactus Trichocereus terscheckii (Parm.) Friedrich & GD Rowley (Cactaceae). Experimentally evolved strains exhibiting different degrees of cactus specialization were exposed to artificial rearing media enriched with cactus allelochemicals and piperonyl butoxide (PBO), an inhibitor of P450 family activity. Our analyses showed a significant viability reduction in the presence of PBO, in the non-tolerant strains of both species as well as in the strain historically subjected to mild concentrations of allelochemicals (the soft strain) of D. koepferae. We confirmed the key role of P450 genes for the evolution of cactus specialization but also found evidence for the evolution of other detoxification pathways.

AB  - Featured Application This manuscript studies the feasibility of combining anaerobic digestion with high temperature and pressure treatments to reduce the final amount of digestate requiring disposal and to produce a material with higher added value. However, thermal treatments present high energy demand and installation costs. This research is a preliminary study performed to evaluate different process configurations and establish strategies for reducing the thermal demand of the combined approach. Anaerobic digestion is a biological process with wide application for the treatment of high organic-containing streams. The production of biogas and the lack of oxygen requirements are the main energetic advantages of this process. However, the digested stream may not readily find a final disposal outlet under certain circumstances. The present manuscript analyzed the feasibility of valorizing digestate by the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) process. A hypothetical plant treating cattle manure and cheese whey as co-substrate (25% v/w, wet weight) was studied. The global performance was evaluated using available data reported in the literature. The best configuration was digestion as a first stage with the subsequent treatment of digestate in an HTC unit. The treatment of manure as sole substrate reported a value of 752 m(3)/d of biogas which could be increased to 1076 m(3)/d (43% increase) when coupling an HTC unit for digestate post-treatment and the introduction of the co-substrate. However, the high energy demand of the combined configurations indicated, as the best alternative, the valorization of just a fraction (15%) of digestate to provide the benefits of enhancing biogas production. This configuration presented a much better energy performance than the thermal hydrolysis pre-treatment of manure. The increase in biogas production does not compensate for the high energy demand of the pre-treatment unit. However, several technical factors still need further research to make this alternative a reality, as it is the handling and pumping of high solid slurries that significantly affects the energy demand of the thermal treatment units and the possible toxicity of hydrochar when used in a biological process.

AB  - Background: Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic pain, significantly affecting the quality of life and functional capabilities of patients. In addition to pain, patients may experience insomnia, chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, and headaches, further complicating their overall well-being. The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptor responds to various noxious stimuli and plays a key role in regulating pain sensitivity and inflammation. Thus, targeting TRPV1 may provide analgesic and anti-inflammatory benefits. This study investigates the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) in alleviating chronic pain in FM through TRPV1 and its downstream molecules in the central nervous system (CNS). Methods: To model FM, we subjected mice to intermittent cold stress (ICS) for three days. The study comprised five rodent groups: Control (CON), ICS, ICS + EA, ICS + Sham EA, and ICS + KO (TRPV1 knockout mice). Results: Our findings revealed that ICS induced allodynia and hyperalgesia in mice by day four, persisting until day 21. EA at 2 Hz and TRPV1 KO significantly decreased both mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity (Withdrawal-Day 14: 2.43 +/- 0.19 g; Day 21: 5.88 +/- 0.47 g, n = 6, p < 0.05; Latency-Day 14: 2.77 +/- 0.22 s; Day 21: 5.85 +/- 0.41 s, n = 6, p < 0.05). In contrast, sham EA did not produce significant effects. Additionally, TRPV1 and several pain-related proteins were significantly elevated in the thalamus, somatosensory cortex (SSC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum regions V (CB V), VI (CB VI) and VII (CB VII) after the ICS model. Both EA at the ST36 acupoint and TRPV1 KO mice showed diminished overexpression of pain-related proteins, with the sham EA group showing no significant changes compared to the ICS group. Conclusions: Chronic widespread pain was reduced by EA and TRPV1 KO, with the effects of EA on the TRPV1 pain pathway clearly evident in the CNS after 21 days.

AB  - The rates of alcohol use disorder among women are growing, yet little is known about how the female brain is affected by alcohol. The neuroimmune system, and specifically microglia, have been implicated in mediating alcohol neurotoxicity, but most preclinical studies have focused on males. Further, few studies have considered changes to the microglial phenotype when examining the effects of ethanol on brain structure and function. Therefore, we quantified microglial reactivity in female rats using a binge model of alcohol dependence, assessed through morphological and phenotypic marker expression, coupled with regional cytokine levels. In a time- and region-dependent manner, alcohol altered the microglial number and morphology, including the soma and process area, and the overall complexity within the corticolimbic regions examined, but no significant increases in the proinflammatory markers MHCII or CD68 were observed. The majority of cytokine and growth factor levels examined were similarly unchanged. However, the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF alpha was increased, and the anti-inflammatory IL-10, decreased. Thus, female rats showed subtle differences in neuroimmune reactivity compared to past work in males, consistent with reports of enhanced neuroimmune responses in females across the literature. These data suggest that specific neuroimmune reactions in females may impact their susceptibility to alcohol neurotoxicity and other neurodegenerative events with microglial contributions.

AB  - Pulmonary mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) are considered important in therapeutic and regenerative responses to lung injury. Despite extensive studies on the human, porcine, sheep, mouse and rat, it was found that PMSCs, which can been performed on goose, have not been well explored. Elucidation of cell differentiation, proliferation, which have not yet been well described, may promote the development of injured lung therapy. In our study, we firstly disclosed biological characteristics of spindle-shaped PMSCs from pulmonary tissues of goose embryos. Growth kinetics and counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay were employed for proliferative activity evaluation. When appropriately induced, PMSCs could differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATII), which demonstrated that PMSCs have crossembryonic layer differentiation potential. Besides, undifferentiated PMSCs consistently expressed MSCs associated phenotypes, such as CD166, CD90, CD44, CD29, CD71 and CD105, as identified by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Karyotype analysis demonstrated that PMSCs possessed stable diploid karyotype. Collectively, we successfully established applicable methods for isolation, culture, identification and characterization of goose PMSCs which suggested a potential therapeutic use in regenerative therapy.

AB  - People endorsing stronger beliefs in human supremacy over animals typically show less moral concern for animals. Yet, how people think about different types of animals also depends on the role of the animals in society. For instance, people are less concerned about food animals than about companion animals. It is unclear, however, how human supremacy beliefs relate to this perceived moral divide between different types of animals. In two surveys of British adults (n = 196 and n = 256), we tested whether human supremacy beliefs are associated with a greater perceived moral divide between high-status animals such as companion animals and low-status animals such as food animals. In both studies, participants rated the extent to which they felt obligated to show moral concern to a range of animals and completed the human supremacy beliefs scale. As expected, the results showed that participants felt more moral concern for companion animals (e.g., dogs and cats) and appealing wild animals (e.g., dolphins and chimps) than for food animals (e.g., pigs and turkeys) and unappealing wild animals (e.g., frogs and bats). Critically, confirming our hypotheses, this moral divide between high- and low-status animals was significantly larger for those holding stronger human supremacy beliefs. Furthermore, the effect of human supremacy beliefs remained after controlling for gender, age, diet, and social dominance orientation. These findings suggest that beliefs in human supremacy over animals may serve as a legitimizing strategy to preserve not only the existing human-animal hierarchy but also greater hierarchical divides between animals.

AB  - In social insects, the reproductive division of labor is often regulated through communication using cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) that indicate caste identity and reproductive status. In many termites, workers retain reproductive potential and can differentiate into ergatoid reproductives, and this process is mediated by the presence of reproductives in sex- and age-specific patterns. However, little is known about the variation of CHCs profiles during this transition. In this study, we analyzed the CHC profiles of workers in comparison with ergatoids of different age, sex, and mating status in the eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), one of the most widely distributed termite species in the world. Both female and male ergatoids were characterized by the presence of tricosane and a group of long-chain and methyl-branched hydrocarbons (chain length >= 33), which were found in significantly lower quantities from workers. In addition, CHC profiles differed between newly differentiated (3-4 d) and old (20-25 d) ergatoids, but no difference in CHC signatures was found between females and males based on identified compounds. Heneicosane, a previously reported royal recognition pheromone in R. flavipes, was not detected in ergatoids examined in this study. The results of caste- and age-dependent variations suggest that CHCs may act as releaser pheromones that mediate caste recognition and age-related interactions between reproductives, but analytical results of identified compounds in this study do not support CHCs as sex-specific primer pheromones that regulate nestmate fertility. Royal pheromones in termites may involve complex hydrocarbon blends and non-hydrocarbon substances that await further investigation.

AB  - A new infestation of the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), was discovered in Canyon Lake, Riverside County, California. We used three mitochondrial DNA (COI, COII, and 16S) and seven polymorphic microsatellite markers to characterize the genetic relationship of the colony with two other colonies that were collected in 1992 and 2018 in La Mesa, San Diego County. Maximum likelihood phylogeny of C. formosanus based on concatenated COI and COII sequences revealed that the two La Mesa populations (CA01 and CA02) and the Canyon Lake population (CA03) were from different maternal lineages. Based on the 14 COII haplotypes of C. formosanus found world-wide, CA01 and CA02 belonged to a haplotype widely distributed across the United States, while CA03 was grouped under a haplotype predominantly found in Asia. Microsatellite allele frequencies across all loci for both La Mesa populations were relatively similar, but significant genetic differences were found between CA02 and CA03 colonies (F-ST = 0.24; Dest = 0.30; G ''(ST) = 0.55; P < 0.01).

AB  - Abnormal expression of the transcriptional regulator and hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway effector Gli3 is known to trigger congenital disease, most frequently affecting the central nervous system (CNS) and the limbs. Accurate delineation of the genomic cis-regulatory landscape controlling Gli3 transcription during embryonic development is critical for the interpretation of noncoding variants associated with congenital defects. Here, we employed a comparative genomic analysis on fish species with a slow rate of molecular evolution to identify seven previously unknown conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in Gli3 intronic intervals (CNE15-21). Transgenic assays in zebrafish revealed that most of these elements drive activities in Gli3 expressing tissues, predominantly the fins, CNS, and the heart. Intersection of these CNEs with human disease associated SNPs identified CNE15 as a putative mammalian craniofacial enhancer, with conserved activity in vertebrates and potentially affected by mutation associated with human craniofacial morphology. Finally, comparative functional dissection of an appendage-specific CNE conserved in slowly evolving fish (elephant shark), but not in teleost (CNE14/hs1586) indicates co-option of limb specificity from other tissues prior to the divergence of amniotes and lobe-finned fish. These results uncover a novel subset of intronic Gli3 enhancers that arose in the common ancestor of gnathostomes and whose sequence components were likely gradually modified in other species during the process of evolutionary diversification.

AB  - Background: The kangaroo mother method (KMM) may benefit infants and mothers in many ways. However, few studies focused on its efficacy on maternal anxiety and stress, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To examine the effect of the kangaroo mother method (KMM) on postnatal stress and anxiety in mothers of preterm infants in neonatal intensive care, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cohort study of two groups of 56 mother-infant dyads recruited from a neonatal intensive care unit was conducted. Two groups were compared in terms of the mean duration of KMM during the twelve days of the study: the intervention group (mean duration of more than ninety minutes per day) and the control group (less than ninety minutes). Maternal stress was measured using the Parental Stressor: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (PSS: NICU) scale and STAI E/R questionnaire before and after intervention (KMM). Demographic and other maternal covariates were extracted from medical records. Daily NICU records were used to track the frequency and duration of KMM sessions. Results: Mothers of the intervention group scored lower on the PSS: NICU and STAI E/R, although no statistically significant differences were found (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Contrary to research based on biological and physiological parameters in newborns or performed before the COVID-19 pandemic, the differences found in applying subjective scales in mothers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic were not significant. Therefore, mothers' perception of physical contact with their preterm infants may not have been as positive due to their fear of transmitting COVID.

AB  - Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450 or CYP) plays an important role in the metabolism of insecticides and plant allelochemicals by insects. CYP321B1, a novel Spodoptera litura P450 gene, was identified and characterized. CYP321B1 contains a 1488 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a 495 amino acid protein. In fourth instar larvae, the highest CYP321B1 expression levels were found in the midgut and fat body. In the tannin feeding test, tannin can significantly induce the expression of CYP321B1 in the midgut and fat body of 4th instar larvae. To verify the function of CYP321B1, RNA interference and metabolome analysis were performed. The results showed that silencing CYP321B1 significantly reduced the rate of weight gain under tannin induction. Metabolome analysis showed silencing affected 47 different metabolites, mainly involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism, including amino acids, lipid fatty acids, organic acids and their derivatives. Henoxyacetic acid and cysteamine are the most highly regulated metabolites, respectively. These findings demonstrate that CYP321B1 plays an important role in tannin detoxification and metabolism. Functional knowledge about metabolite detoxification genes in this major herbivorous insect pest can provide new insights into this biological process and provide new targets for agricultural pest control.

AB  - Simple Summary During the COVID-19 global pandemic the Oregon Zoo closed to all visitors and non-essential staff from 15 March 2020 to 12 July 2020. This presented a unique opportunity to conduct a study on the behavioral and physiological changes associated with the transitions between visitor presence and visitor absence on some of our more sensitive species. Using behavioral scan-sampling and fecal hormone monitoring of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGM), two cheetahs and two giraffes were observed through two transition periods: the initial closure of the Oregon Zoo in March 2020 and the subsequent reopening in July 2020. We found significant increases in fGM concentrations for both cheetahs and giraffes between the two transition periods, but not within each specific transition. We also found some differences in behavior frequencies for both cheetahs and giraffes. For the cheetahs, 'not visible' significantly increased within the second transition period, resulting in their being less visible to visitors, and the cheetahs also spent less time showing locomotion behavior after the Zoo reopened. The giraffes, in turn, expressed significant differences in vigilant behaviors, with increased vigilance shown while fewer visitors were around. This study illustrates the complexity of investigating the visitor effect in different species and the individualistic nature of the responses of both the cheetahs and giraffes at the Oregon Zoo. Overall, however the observed changes in fGM concentrations and behavioral expressions were relatively minor and may have been more strongly related to social changes (giraffe) and medical events (cheetah) than to visitor activity and the Zoo's opening status. The effect of visitor presence on zoo animals has been explored in numerous studies over the past two decades. However, the opportunities for observations without visitors have been very limited at most institutions. In 2020, the Oregon Zoo was closed, in response to the global SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, from 15 March 2020 to 12 July 2020, resulting in approximately four consecutive months without visitor presence. This study aimed to quantify potential behavioral and hormonal changes expressed during two transition periods in zoo visitor attendance: the initial time period before and after closure in March 2020 and time before and after reopening in July 2020. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGM) concentrations of resident giraffes (n = 2) and cheetahs (n = 2) were tracked using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) analyses. Average fGM concentrations during the two transition periods were compared using a two-way mixed ANOVA. Additionally, twice-weekly scan sampling was used to quantify behavioral observations across the transitions, which were analyzed as individual behavior proportions. Individual behavior proportions were compared across the Zoo's opening status and time of day using Kruskal-Wallis (H) tests. The results of our analyses showed the following outcomes: (1) significant increases in fGM concentrations for cheetahs and giraffes between the transition periods but not within them; (2) a significant increase in time spent 'not visible' in the cheetahs in the second transition period; and (3) increased vigilance behaviors in the giraffes immediately after the Zoo's closure. However, the changes observed in fGM concentrations may be more strongly correlated with concomitant social changes (giraffes) and some medical events (cheetahs) rather than with the Zoo's opening status.
   Nevertheless, this study was able to quantify differences in behavioral frequencies and fGM concentration in cheetahs and giraffes at the Oregon Zoo during the times of transition between visitor's presence and absence. The results indicate that, while there was a possible, but relatively minor impact of the presence and absence of visitors on some behaviors, the differences observed in fGM concentration may have been more affected by some of the concomitant social changes and medical events that happened during the same period than by the presence or absence of visitors.

AB  - In the packaging materials sector, increasing globalization has created the need for increased efforts to develop consumer protection measures. Consequently, new packaging materials are being sought to replace petroleum-based materials in the future. For this reason, global awareness of the environmental problems associated with the use of synthetic and non-degradable packaging has increased the attention paid to bio-packaging based on natural and biodegradable polymers. The bio-packaging sector is developing innovations to address the sustainability issues facing the food packaging industry. Our research has shown that green matcha extract can be a promising source of antioxidants for the production of bioactive pectin films. This study further confirmed that green matcha extract can be a promising source of antioxidants for the production of bioactive pectin films. The antioxidant activity test showed high activity of films containing matcha extract. The antioxidant activity of films without matcha addition, P, PJ, PC, PJC, was negligible. The addition of matcha to the polymer matrix did not significantly affect the mechanical properties (TS, EB) of the films obtained. The addition of cellulose had the greatest effect on changing the mechanical properties. It caused a twofold increase in the mechanical properties of the obtained packaging films. The addition of matcha significantly improved the barrier properties (for PM films, the WVTR was 3.40 [g/m(2)d]; for PJM films the WVTR was 1.70 [g/m(2)d]). The green packaging films showed no toxic effects on the plants (Phacelia tanacetifolia, Salvia hispanica, Brassica napus) and invertebrates (Daphnia pulex, Chaoborus, Chironomus aprilinus) tested. The half-solubility time of the membranes in a solution mimicking gastric acid was also determined. The longest half-dissolution time of the films was about 2 min. Our research has therefore shown that the biodegradable and environmentally safe green packaging films with antioxidant activity that we have developed can be used as edible functional casings in the future, e.g., for sausages and other food products.

AB  - Background: T-006, a novel neuroprotective derivative of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), exhibits multifunctional neuroprotective properties. T-006 has been shown to improve neurological and behavioral functions in animal models of ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. The present study aims to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of T-006 against oxidative injuries induced by glutamate or hypoxia. Methods: Mouse hippocampal HT22 cells were used to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of T-006 against glutamate-induced injuries, while mouse brain endothelial bEnd.3 cells were used to evaluate the cerebrovascular protective effects of T-006 against oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced injuries. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry were used to measure cell viability and oxidative stress. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses of protein expression were used to study cell signaling pathways. Results: T-006 exhibited significant protective effects in both oxidative injury models. In HT22 cells, T-006 reduced cell death and enhanced antioxidant capacity by upregulating mTOR and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/Heme oxygenase-1 (Nrf2/HO-1) signaling. Similarly, in bEnd.3 cells, T-006 reduced oxidative injuries and preserved tight junction integrity through Nrf2/HO-1 upregulation. These effects were inhibited by LY294002, a Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. Conclusions: T-006 may exert its neuroprotective and cerebrovascular protective effects via the regulation of PI3K/AKT-mediated pathways, which facilitate downstream mTOR and Nrf2 signaling, leading to improved cell survival and antioxidant defenses.

AB  - Terpene synthase (TPS) analysis may contribute to a better understanding of terpenoids biosynthesis and the evolution of phylogenetic taxonomy. Chamaecyparis formosensis Matsumura is an endemic and valuable conifer of Taiwan. Its excellent wood quality, fragrance, and durability make it become the five precious conifers in Taiwan. In this study, three sesquiterpene synthase genes that belong to the TPS-d2 Glade were isolated and characterized through in vitro reaction of recombinant protein and in vivo reaction of Escherichia coli heterologous expression system. The main product of Cf-GerA was germacrene A using GC/MS analysis, while the product of Cf-Aco and Cf-Gor were identified as acora-4(14),8-diene and (5R,6R,10S)-alpha-gorgonene by using NMR analysis. These are the first reported enzymes that biosynthesize acora-4(14),8-diene and (5 R,6 R,10 S)-alpha-gorgonene. Both sesquiterpene synthases may isomerize the farnesyl pyrophosphate substrate to nerolidyl pyrophosphate for further cyclization. Cf-Aco may catalyze 1,6-cyclization of nerolidyl cation while Cf-Gor may catalyze through an uncharged intermediate, isogermacrene A.

AB  - The endemic Australian plants Lepidosperma sp. Flinders Chase (Cyperaceae), Lepidosperma viscidum (Cyperaceae) and Dodonaea humilis (Sapindaceae) were found to be the botanical origin of three propolis types found on Kangaroo Island identified by TLC and H-1 NMR matching of propolis and plant resin analytical profiles. Resin samples extracted from the plant, Lepidosperma sp. Flinders Chase, were chromatographically fractionated to give: methyl 3-phenyl-2-(E-cinnamoyloxy)propanoate (1), 3 (E-8-methoxy-8-oxo-3,7-dimethyloct-2-enyl)-4-hydroxy-E-cinnamic acid (2), 3-(E-6,7-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyloct-2-enyl)-4-hydroxy-E-cinnamic acid (3), previously undescribed; and the known stilbenes, 2-prenyl-3,5-dihydroxy-E-stilbene (6) and 2-prenyl-3-methoxy-5-hydroxy-E-stilbene (7). The resin from L. viscidum gave: 5'-(E-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl)-4,2',4'-trihydroxydihydrochalcone (4); 5'-(E-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl)-4'-methoxy-4,2'-dihydroxydihydrochalcone (5), previously undescribed; and three known flavanones, farrerol (8), 5,7,3',5'-tetrahydroxy-6,8-dimethylflavanone (9) and 5,7,3',5'-tetrahydroxy-6-methylflavanone (10). The major constituent in the propolis identified as being sourced from D. humilis was identified as 6,8-diprenyl-5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavanone (11), a known compound identified in several unrelated plant species.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Salvia divinorum (Epling and Ja<acute accent>tiva) is a psychoactive plant traditionally used by the Latinos for various medicinal purposes. Salvinorin A (Sal A), the main bioactive constituent of S. divinorum, is a natural highly selective kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonist. Considering the anti-inflammatory effect of S. divinorum and endogenous hippocampal dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system playing an anticonvulsant function, we hypothesis that Sal A can be a potential candidate to treat epilepsy. Here, we identified whether Sal A ameliorated epileptic seizures and neuronal damages in animal model and in vitro model and investigated its underlying mechanisms. Materials and methods: Mice epilepsy model was induced by pilocarpine following seizures assessed by Racine classification. Hippocampus tissues were obtained for genetic, protein, and histological investigation. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated BV2 microglial cells were utilized to validate the anti-inflammatory and microglia polarization regulation effects of Sal A. Results: Sal A treatment significantly prolonged the latency to status epileptics (SE) and shortened the duration of SE in the pilocarpine-induced model. It also alleviated neuronal damages via activation of the AMPK/JNK/p-38 MAPK pathway and inhibition of apoptosis-related protein in hippocampus tissues. Furthermore, Sal A dosedependently reduced microglia-mediated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased antiinflammatory factors levels in SE mice and LPS-activated BV2 microglial cells by regulating microglia polarization. In addition, the effect of Sal A in vitro was totally blocked by KOR antagonist nor-BNI. Conclusion: Sal A treatment protects against epileptic seizures and neuronal damages in pilocarpine-induced models by suppressing the inflammation response through regulating microglial M1/M2 polarization. This study might serve as a theoretical basis for clinical applications of Sal A and its analogs and provide a new insight into the development of anti-seizure drugs.

AB  - Simple Summary Traditionally, farmers are unable to pay enough attention to individual livestock. An increasing number of sensors are being used to monitor animal behavior, early disease detection, and evaluation of animal welfare. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to identify multiple unitary behaviors and movements of dairy cattle recorded by motion sensors. We also investigated the effect of time window on the performance of unitary behaviors classification and discussed the necessity of movement analysis. This study shows a feasible way to explore more detailed movements based on the result of unitary behaviors classification. Low-cost sensors provide remote monitoring of animal behaviors to help producers comprehensively and accurately identify the health status of individual livestock in real-time. The behavior of livestock on farms is the primary representation of animal welfare, health conditions, and social interactions to determine whether they are healthy or not. The objective of this study was to propose a framework based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from 10 dairy cows to classify unitary behaviors such as feeding, standing, lying, ruminating-standing, ruminating-lying, and walking, and identify movements during unitary behaviors. Classification performance was investigated for three machine learning algorithms (K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and extreme boosting algorithm (XGBoost)) in four time windows (5, 10, 30, and 60 s). Furthermore, feed tossing, rolling biting, and chewing in the correctly classified feeding segments were analyzed by the magnitude of the acceleration. The results revealed that the XGBoost had the highest performance in the 60 s time window with an average F1 score of 94% for the six unitary behavior classes. The F1 score of movements is 78% (feed tossing), 87% (rolling biting), and 87% (chewing). This framework offers a possibility to explore more detailed movements based on the unitary behavior classification.

AB  - Invasive drywood termites are one of the most challenging species to detect in the early invasion process as they can infest a small piece of wood and be transported by human activity. Cryptotermes domesticus (Haviland, 1898) is native to south Asia and Australia and has been introduced into many other Asian countries and pacific islands, where they cause damage to furniture and wooden structures. Recently, an established colony of C. domesticus has been found in the Seoul metropolitan area, Republic of Korea, where drywood termites were not thought to be able to establish due to low winter temperatures. The discovery of C. domesticus was initiated from a post on an internet forum in which an anonymous homeowner collected alates in an apartment and asked for pest identification. This information was readily delivered to professional entomologists, and a task force was formed for inspection. During the thorough inspection, an infested sliding door frame was identified and a colony of C. domesticus was found. Instead of fumigation and localized pesticide treatment, the door and frame were removed and replaced, which was the most cost-effective control measure as the colony was only found there. Since the potential spread of C. domesticus is uncertain, the task force collaborated with the media, including newspapers and broadcasting news, to disseminate information to help recognize any additional unreported infestations. This study provides insights on how to cooperate with the media and citizens when a new invasive species is found.

How-ever, mitochondrial (mt) genome sequences, which have been widely used for phylogenetic study, are available for only 11 species across three subfamilies. Thus, a larger variety of mt genome sequences in Limoniidae are required to improve our understanding of tipuloid phylogeny and genomic evolution. Here we present mt genomes of Elephantomyia (Elephantomyia) inulta Alexander, 1938 and Helius (Helius) pluto Alexander, 1932, representing the first mt genomes of the tribe Elephantomyiini (Limoniidae). The two mt genomes are typical circular DNA molecules and show similar gene order, nucleotide composition and codon usage. Standard ATN start and TAR stop codons are present in most protein-coding genes. All transfer RNA (tRNA) genes exhibited the cloverleaf secondary structure typical for metazoans except in tRNASer(AGN), which lacks the dihydrouridine arm. Phylogenetic analyses were per -formed based on four nucleotide matrixes for the currently sequenced species of Tipuloidea using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods. Four-cluster likelihood mapping was used to study incongruent signals between different topologies. Pediciidae is supported as the earliest lineage in Tipuloidea, and the sister-group relationship between Cylindrotomidae and Tipulidae is also supported, but the monophyly of Limoniidae is not supported. Our study also supports the monophyly of Elephantomyiini (Elephan-tomyia + Helius), as one of origins of flower-visiting in Limoniidae. Although Elephantomyiini is sister to Limoniinae + Epiphragma (Limnophilinae) in our study, a more precise understanding of its phylogenetic position in Tipuloidea will require additional studies that include a broader species sample.

AB  - Chrysoperla species include well-known predators of aphids and other soft-bodied arthropods. As such, they are considered important biological control agents of herbivorous pests in agroecosystems where many of green lacewings species occur. Despite the high number of species of the genus Chrysoperla, only a few have been assessed for the predation efficiency of their larvae against pests infesting plants, and even fewer are currently marketed for use in biocontrol practice. Difficulties in species identification within the Chrysoperla carnea complex species in particular has been related to varying success of commercial C. carnea s.l. releases in the field. In this study, we assessed the ability of two Chrysoperla species, Chrysoperla agilis a member of the carnea cryptic species group, and Chrysoperla mutata of the pudica group to consume aphid and mealybug individuals and suppress their populations in sweet pepper plants. We found that third-instar larvae of both species were able to consume a high number of aphids (approximately 120 nymphs per larva) and mealybugs (approximately 105 nymphs per larva) within 24 h. Furthermore, the release of second-instar larvae of both C. agilis and C. mutata was shown to be remarkably efficient in suppressing the pest populations in long-term greenhouse experiments. Aphid populations were suppressed by approximately 98% and mealybugs by 78% as compared to control plants. Our results highlight the predation efficiency and the biocontrol potential of two widespread Chrysoperla species for their use in pest control.

AB  - Although chronic health conditions and homelessness are prevalent problems in the United States and globally, little research has used the lens of burden of treatment theory to examine the experiences of people facing these challenges simultaneously. This study aimed to illuminate dimensions of treatment burden, which refers to the work of being a patient with chronic conditions, and patient capacity to manage this burden in a sample of people experiencing homelessness and chronic health problems in Buffalo, New York, United States. We completed in-depth interviews with men and women recruited from a homelessness services organization (N = 27) and applied core concepts from burden of treatment theory to our analysis to probe how participants navigated tasks related to treatment and self-care. Using codebook thematic analysis involving three coders, results revealed four interconnected themes of complex coordination, self-monitoring, obtaining and using prescriptions and medical supplies, and communication and explaining health issues, which were confirmed through member checking (N = 6). These dimensions of treatment burden were dynamically impacted by patient capacity factors-which included trauma, medical mistrust, health literacy, and social support-as well as by social determinants of health such as housing and income. Findings support the need for more formal collaboration mechanisms between healthcare providers and social service agencies, active involvement of patients in their health plans, and policies such as Housing First to improve access to stable and affordable housing and social services for people with complex health issues.

AB  - Depression is the most common affective disorder worldwide, accounting for 4.4% of the global population, a figure that could increase in the coming decades. In depression, there exists a reduction in the availability of dendritic spines in the frontal cortex (FC) and hippocampus (Hp). In addition, histone modification and DNA methylation are also dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms in depression. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a technique that is used to treat depression. However, the epigenetic mechanisms of its therapeutic effect are still not known. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the antidepressant effect of 5 Hz rTMS and examined its effect on dendritic remodeling, immunoreactivity of synapse proteins, histone modification, and DNA methylation in the FC and Hp in a model of chronic mild stress. Our data indicated that stress generated depressive-like behaviors and that rTMS reverses this effect, romotes the formation of dendritic spines, and favors the presynaptic connection in the FC and DG (dentate gyrus), in addition to increasing histone H3 trimethylation and DNA methylation. These results suggest that the antidepressant effect of rTMS is associated with dendritic remodeling, which is probably regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. These data are a first approximation of the impact of rTMS at the epigenetic level in the context of depression. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze in future studies as to which genes are regulated by these mechanisms, and how they are associated with the neuroplastic modifications promoted by rTMS.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains of unknown etiology and lacks a cure. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a novel bithiophene derivative at two doses against AlCl3-induced AD in a rat model. Adult male rats (Rattus norvegicus) were divided into six groups (n=6): Group one consisted of na & iuml;ve animals, group two received bithiophene (1 mg/kg) every other day for 30 days, and groups 3-6 were subjected to AlCl3 (100 mg/kg, equivalent to 20.23 mg Al3+) for 45 consecutive days. Groups four and five received low (0.5 mg/ kg) or high (1 mg/kg) doses of bithiophene, respectively. Group six received memantine (20 mg/kg) daily for 30 days. All treatments were administered orally. Aluminum exposure resulted in severe degeneration of both histological and ultrastructural aspects of cells. Administration of the low dose of bithiophene significantly restored the number of CA1 pyramidal cells and the thickness of the stratum granulosum of the dentate gyrus. However, the high dose of bithiophene increased viable CA1 pyramidal cell numbers significantly without restoring the thickness of the stratum granulosum or reducing vacuolization or pyknotic changes. The low dose of bithiophene restored the normal histological and cytological structure of both cortical and hippocampal neurons affected by dementia. Further investigation is required to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the ameliorative effects on Alzheimer's disease-induced deteriorations in the cortex and hippocampus.

AB  - Myopia can impact an individual's quality of life and induce multiple complications. In this study, we randomly divided guinea pigs into the normal control (NC) group, the lens-induced myopia (LIM) group, the normal control plus l-arginine injection (l-Arg) group, and the normal control plus saline injection (NaCl) group. The animals in each group received the relevant treatments. The results showed that myopia was deeper in the LIM and l-Arg groups compared with the NC and NaCl groups. Our experimental results suggest that the excessive supplement of l-Arg will induce myopia onset and a MEK-ERK cascade that stimulates the downstream nNOS-MMP2 and NRF2-KEAP1 signaling pathways, which is accompanied by inflammatory responses, fibrosis changes, and oxidative stress. After receiving excessive arginine supplements, the experimental individuals showed myopic shifts and a similar pathological state as the LIM group. In conclusion, the supplement of excessive arginine may be a danger factor for myopia onset.

AB  - Plant perception to aphid herbivory was a long-standing debate in plant-aphid interaction biology. The present research focuses on Myzus persicae herbivore mediated 'primed' Arabidopsis thaliana to probe the plant perception of aphid herbivory. The 'primed' leaf foliage showed a significant aphid clonal proliferation which was again corelated to a significant microbiota titer on vascular sap. The infiltration of aphid microbiota into leaf foliage promoted a significantly higher number of aphid clonal proliferation. A significant vascular microbiota titer enrichment was also evidenced either by aphid herbivory or microbiota infiltration that was again corelated with a significant aphid clonal proliferation. Vascular saps isolated from both 'primed' and aphid microbiota infiltrated leaf foliage evidenced with a peptide bond degradation, which was a common phenomenon linked to a significant aphid clonal proliferation. Both aphid herbivore and aphid microbiota infiltrated leaf foliage showed an induction of pad4, and sag13 gene expression at RNA levels. Moreover, the coding sequence of the bacterial UidA gene, which encodes GUS protein under pad4 promoter was also induced at the site of aphid stylet feeding site and aphid microbiota infiltrated leaf. Thus, aphid responsive gene expression was similarly induced by both aphid herbivory and aphid microbiota infiltration. Therefore, the present research proposed that aphid microbiota might mediate in plant perception to aphid herbivory.

AB  - Chigger mite genus Hyracarus Lawrence, 1949, endemic to Tropical Africa, was revised based on the examination of type series, new materials, unpublished archive sources, and the literature. Five new species were described: Hyracarus bethuliensis sp. nov., H. ethiopicus sp. nov., H. sabiensis sp. nov., H. aryanicki sp. nov., and H. limpopoensis sp. nov. Three new subjective synonyms were established: Hyracarus [= Mastalacarus Goff & Lukoschus, 1983, syn. nov.; = Tateracarus Goff, 1983, syn. nov.] and Hyracarus thallomyia (Radford, 1947) [= Acomatacarus lawrencei Radford, 1948, syn. nov.]. Six new combinations were proposed: Hyracarus foliosetosus (Stekolnikov & Matthee, 2022) comb. (originally in the genus Tateracarus), H. namibiensis (Goff & Lukoschus, 1983) comb. nov. (originally in the genus Mastalacarus), H. thallomyia (Radford, 1947) comb. nov., and H. mutabilis (Vercammen-Grandjean & Brennan, 1957) comb. nov. (originally in the genus Acomatacarus Ewing, 1942). Currently, the genus includes 16 valid species known from South Africa (10 species), Namibia (2), Angola (1), Democratic Republic of the Congo (1), Uganda (1), and Ethiopia (1). Its species parasitize murid rodents (7 records), hyraxes (3), elephant shrews (2), dormice (1), shrews (1), bats (1), and skinks (1).

AB  - The European (Melolontha melolontha L.) and Forest (M. hippocastani F.) cockchafer are widespread pests throughout Central Europe. Both species exhibit a 3-5-year life cycle and occur in temporally shifted populations, which have been monitored and documented for more than 100 years. Visual identification of adults and larvae belonging to these morphologically similar species requires expertise and, particularly in the case of larvae, is challenging and equivocal. The goal of the study was the development of an efficient and fast molecular genetic tool for the identification and discrimination of M. melolontha and M. hippocastani. We established a collection of both species from Switzerland, Austria and Northern Italy in 2016, 2017 and 2018. An approximately 1550 bp long fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) mitochondrial gene was amplified and sequenced in 13 M. melolontha and 13 M. hippocastani beetles. Alignment of the new sequences with reference sequences (NCBI GenBank and BOLDSYSTEMS databases) and subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed consistent clustering of the two species. After the identification of M. melolontha and M. hippocastani species-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CO1 alignment, we developed an effective SNP tool based on the ABI PRISM (R) SNaPshot (TM) Multiplex Kit for the rapid and accurate species discrimination of adults and larvae.

AB  - Semiochemicals such as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) and host chemicals serve as communication signals for parasitoids searching for oviposition sites. The braconid koinobiont endoparasitoid Dolichogenidea gelechiidivoris (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) efficiently parasitises larvae of Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), a major pest of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). However, the attractive compounds used by the parasitoid to locate T. absoluta on host plants are not known. We therefore performed behavioural assays and chemical analyses to investigate the chemical basis of interactions between the parasitoid, the tomato plant and T. absoluta. Y-tube olfactometer bioassays revealed that D. gelechiidivoris was attracted to T. absoluta larvae-infested tomato plant volatiles and preferred volatiles of plants with a high infestation level than those with a low infestation level. The parasitoid was also attracted to volatiles of larval frass and to the sex pheromone of T. absoluta. Coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analyses were performed on plant and frass volatiles. We found both qualitative and quantitative differences in volatile emission between healthy and T. absoluta larvae-infested tomato plants, where volatile emission rate increased with increasing infestation level. The most characteristic volatile compounds which distinguished T. absoluta larvae-infested plants from healthy plants were alpha-pinene, sabinene, beta-myrcene, 2-carene, alpha-phellandrene, 3-carene, alpha-terpinene, beta-phellandrene, (Z)-beta-ocimene, (E)-beta-ocimene, allo-ocimene, (E)-beta-caryophyllene and methyl salicylate. With the exception of caryophyllene oxide, all larval frass volatile compounds were also found in tomato plant headspace volatiles. Olfactometer bioassays using synthetic compounds revealed that D. gelechiidivoris was attracted to alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, alpha-phellandrene, alpha-terpinene, beta-ocimene, methyl salicylate and (E)-beta-caryophyllene, and the 7-component blend of these attractants elicited the greatest attraction in the parasitoid. These findings open new avenues for exploiting these attractants as kairomone-based lures to recruit and retain the parasitoid in tomato fields for the biological control of T. absoluta.

AB  - Most of the material of the family Rhinocricidae, the largest in the entire order Spirobolida and very common and diverse in Australasia, is treated, being represented in the collections of the Moscow Museum from the southwestern Pacific by at least seven species in four genera: Propodobolus, Dinematocricus, Eurhinocricus, and Salpidobolus. All these species are described and illustrated, but most of their identifications are only provisional because rhinocricid taxonomy is still generally chaotic, especially confused in the region we consider here. The genus Eurhinocricus is new to the fauna of Fiji. Lectotype designation is made for E. saipanus Verhoeff, 1937 from Saipan (= Guam), Marianas, Micronesia.

AB  - The sex-specific development of hippocampal learning in juveniles remains unclear. Using an inhibitory avoidance task, we assessed contextual learning in both sexes of juvenile rats. While sex hormone levels and activating effects are low in juveniles, females showed superior performance to males, suggesting that females have a shorter period of infantile amnesia than males. It was already known that when infants are cared for by mothers with high parenting behavior, they are likely to become high parenting mothers themselves. In addition, neonatal testosterone is known to masculinize the brain, causing behavioral, neural, and hormonal sex differences. Here, we reviewed the purposeful significance of sex-specific development for learning, along with the interaction of developmental changes in the hormonal environment.

AB  - The brain learns an internal model of the environment through sensory experiences, which is essential for high-level cognitive processes. Recent studies show that spontaneous activity reflects such a learned internal model. Although computational studies have proposed that Hebbian plasticity can learn the switching dynamics of replayed activities, it is still challenging to learn dynamic spontaneous activity that obeys the statistical properties of sensory experience. Here, we propose a pair of biologically plausible plasticity rules for excitatory and inhibitory synapses in a recurrent spiking neural network model to embed stochastic dynamics in spontaneous activity. The proposed synaptic plasticity rule for excitatory synapses seeks to minimize the discrepancy between stimulus-evoked and internally predicted activity, while inhibitory plasticity maintains the excitatory-inhibitory balance. We show that the spontaneous reactivation of cell assemblies follows the transition statistics of the model's evoked dynamics. We also demonstrate that simulations of our model can replicate recent experimental results of spontaneous activity in songbirds, suggesting that the proposed plasticity rule might underlie the mechanism by which animals learn internal models of the environment.

AB  - No study has revealed the effect of porcine brain enzyme hydrolysate (PBEH) on memory impairment. We aimed to examine the hypothesis that PBEH intake modulates memory deficits and cognitive behavior in scopolamine (SC)-induced amnesia rats, and its mechanism, including gut microbiota changes, was determined. Sprague-Dawley male rats had intraperitoneal injections of SC (2 mg/kg body weight/day) at 30 min after daily feeding of casein (MD-control), PBEH (7 mg total nitrogen/mL) at 0.053 mL (Low-PBEH), 0.159 mL (Medium-PBEH), 0.478 mL (High-PBEH), or 10 mg donepezil (Positive-control) per kilogram body weight per day through a feeding needle for six weeks. The Normal-control rats had casein feeding without SC injection. PBEH dose-dependently protected against memory deficits determined by passive avoidance test, Y-maze, water-maze, and novel object recognition test in SC-induced rats compared to the MD-control. The High-PBEH group had a similar memory function to the Positive-control group. Systemic insulin resistance determined by HOMA-IR was lower in the PBEH groups than in the Normal-control but not the Positive-control. In parallel with systemic insulin resistance, decreased cholesterol and increased glycogen contents in the hippocampus in the Medium-PBEH and High-PBEH represented reduced brain insulin resistance. PBEH intake prevented the increment of serum TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta concentrations in the SC-injected rats. Hippocampal lipid peroxide and TNF-alpha contents and mRNA TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta expression were dose-dependently reduced in PBEH and Positive-control. PBEH decreased the hippocampal acetylcholinesterase activity compared to the MD-control, but not as much as the Positive-control. PBEH intake increased the alpha-diversity of the gut microbiota compared to the MD-control, and the gut microbiota community was separated from MD-control. In metagenome function analysis, PBEH increased the energy metabolism-related pathways of the gut microbiota, including citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and amino acid metabolism, which were lower in the MD-control than the Normal-control. In conclusion, alleviated memory deficit by PBEH was associated potentially with not only reducing acetylcholinesterase activity but also improving brain insulin resistance and neuroinflammation potentially through modulating gut microbiota. PBEH intake (1.5-4.5 mL of 7 mg total nitrogen/mL for human equivalent) can be a potential therapeutic agent for improving memory impairment.

AB  - Loquat leaves are the by-product of loquat fruit production. Polysaccharides are one of the main active ingredients in loquat leaves. In this study, polysaccharides were extracted from loquat leaves by ultrasonic-assisted deep eutectic solvents (DESs) extraction method. Further, the extracted crude loquat leaf polysaccharides (CLLP) were purified and separated via S-8 resin and DEAE-52 cellulose column chromatography, respectively. Additionally, the effects of polysaccharides on activity of sperm in boar semen preserved in medium at 17 degrees C, were evaluated preliminarily. DES, composed of choline chloride/ethylene glycol (1:6, molar ratio), was proved to be the suitable solvent for LLP extraction. The optimized extraction conditions were water content 44 %, liquid-solid ratio 1:29 (g/g), extraction temperature 61 degrees C and extraction time 98 min. Under these conditions, the LLP yield was 57.82 +/- 1.50 mg/g. A homogeneous polysaccharide (LLP1-2, M w : 2.17 x 10 4 Da) was isolated from CLLP. Its total sugar, uronic acid and protein contents were 76.31 +/- 1.25 %, 14.19 +/- 0.67 % and 3.28 +/- 0.42 %, respectively. Further, 800 mu g/mL LLP1-2 could effectively enhance the antioxidant activity of sperm. This study laid a foundation for DESs and column chromatography in the field of polysaccharide extraction and separation, proving that LLP can be used as a natural antioxidant for sperm preservation.

AB  - Acid phosphatases (ACPs) perform a fundamental role in the digestion of egg proteins (vitellins), ensuring the survival of ticks by providing nutrients necessary for their oogenesis. Here, acid phosphatase activity is detected during embryogenesis of the camel tick Hyalomma dromedarii and reached its highest activity level in the larval stage. The tick larvae acid phosphatase which was named TLACP is homogeneously purified using CM cellulose cation exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 column. TLACP is purified to 11 times purification folds and 51.3% yield with a specific activity of 12.9 U mg(-1) protein. The molecular weight of TLACP was derived from both the gel filtration column and SDS-PAGE as monomer protein of 40 kDa. The Km of TLACP for p-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) was 1.25 mM and Vmax was 6.4 Umg(-1). TLACP exhibited its optimum enzymatic activity at pH 4.8. TLACP was found highly specific to p-NPP followed by ATP, ADP, glucose-6-phosphate, naphthyl phosphate, phospho-enol-pyruvate, creatine phosphate, AMP, and GMP. The ions of Ca2+, Co2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ motivated TLACP activity while Mn2+, Cu2+, and Fe2+ suppressed it. TLACP is noncompetitively inhibited with sodium fluoride with Ki value 0.15 mM. Thus, the presence of TLACP in tick embryonic and larval cells classifies this enzyme as an important molecular target for evolving potential vaccines in further studies aiming to find new strategies to control ticks.

AB  - The population behavior of the sugarcane aphid, Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner), and its natural enemies was determined at three localities in the State of Guanajuato, Mexico. Samples were captured by entomological net and traps with soapy water in semi-commercial sorghum fields seeded with different genotypes, under irrigated and rainfed conditions, without application of insecticides. In irrigated sorghum, M. sacchari occurred from the floral differentiation stage until 749 accumulated heat units from birth, while, in rainfed fields, it occurred from the fifth true leaf on, almost 500 cumulative degree days. Twelve species of entomophagous were observed: Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville; Asian ladybird, Harmonia axyridis Pallas; brown ladybird, Scymnus loewii Mulsant; Asaphe sp. (Pteromalidae), the hyperparasitoid of Aphidius colemani (Dalmen); Diplazon probably scutellaris (Cresson) (Ichneumonidae), parasitoid of syrphid flies Allograpta obliqua (Say); A. exotic (Wiedemann), first record at Bajio, Mexico; and Dinocampus (= Perilitus) coccinellae (Braconidae), a parasitoid of convergent lady beetle.

AB  - Colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) signaling is necessary for microglia development and maintenance throughout life. The CSF-1R ligands, CSF-1 and interleukin-34 (IL-34), are indispensable for microglia survival in white matter and gray matter, respectively. While CSF-1 has been studied to a greater extent, the role of IL-34 in microglia function and in the brain overall is much less understood. Here, we examined the region-specific effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) CSF-1 and IL-34 administration on microglia and oligodendrocyte lineage cells in mice at two timepoints. At 3 days post-intervention, IL-34 increased microglial CD68 levels and the microglia population in the hippocampal CA1 region, whereas CSF-1 increased the microglia population in the corpus callosum. Furthermore, CSF-1, but not IL-34, reduced the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell population in the corpus callosum. These effects were no longer observed at 7 days, revealing the transient nature of the microglial response. Together, these findings demonstrate that in addition to relying on specific signals for survival, microglia respond differently to CSF-1R ligands in a brain microenvironment-dependent manner. These findings highlight the need to better understand microglia in the context of their location, which could provide key insights into the pathogenesis of neuroimmune disorders that predominantly affect gray matter or white matter areas.image

AB  - The diversity of the diprotodontids provides an excellent opportunity to study how a basic marsupial cortical plan has been modified for the needs of the mammals living in different habitats. Very little is known about the connections of the cerebral cortex with the deep brain structures (basal ganglia and thalamus) in this evolutionarily significant group of mammals. In this study, we performed mapping of brain regions and connections in a diprotodontid marsupial from data obtained from an excised brain scanned in high-field (9.4 T) microstructural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instrument. The analysis was based on two MRI methodologies. First, high-resolution structural scans were used to map MRI visible brain regions from T1w and T2w images. Second, extensive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were obtained to elucidate connectivity between brain areas using deterministic diffusion tracking of neuronal brain fibers. From the data, we were able to identify corticostriate connections between the frontal association and dorsomedial isocortex and the head of the caudate, and between the lateral somatosensory cortex and the putamen. We were also able to follow the olfactory and limbic connections by tracing fibers in the fornix, cingulum, intrabulbar part of the anterior commissure, and lateral olfactory tract. There was segregation of fibers in the anterior commissure such that olfactory connections passed through the rostroventral part and successively more dorsal cortical areas connected through more dorsal parts of the commissure. Our findings confirm a common pattern of cortical connectivity in therian mammals, even where brain expansion has occurred independently in diverse groups.

AB  - Flexible and piezoelectric hydrogels show great potential in the fields of wearable sensors, soft robotics, and the human-machine interface. However, these existing piezoelectric hydrogel sensors lack adhesive properties to the skin, limiting their further application. Here, by introducing the methacryloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride (DMC) and the sodium p-styrenesulfonate (NaSS) into the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) piezoelectric hydrogel, a polyelectrolyte hydrogel (PN(x)D(y)A(z)) was prepared through the electrostatic interaction between the polyelectrolytes. The obtained hydrogels exhibited good mechanical properties (fracture stress and fracture strain were 140.65 +/- 4.52 kPa and 499 +/- 9.54%, respectively) and excellent adhesion (adhesion to pig skin surface was 22.78 kPa), excellent mechanical-electric response performance, and could produce stable electrical signal output (similar to 65 mV) during 3000 stress-discharge cycles. When used as a flexible strain sensor, the PN(x)D(y)A(z) hydrogel accurately monitors a variety of body signals and exhibits excellent biocompatibility. Therefore, the flexible and piezoelectric PN(x)D(y)A(z) hydrogel will have broad application prospects in the field of soft electronics.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD), one of the main Cannabis sativa bioactive compounds, is utilized in the treatment of major epileptic syndromes. Its efficacy can be attributed to a multimodal mechanism of action that includes, as potential targets, several types of ion channels. In the brain, CBD reduces the firing frequency in rat hippocampal neurons, partly prolonging the duration of action potentials, suggesting a potential blockade of voltage-operated K+ channels. We postulate that this effect might involve the inhibition of the large-conductance voltage- and Ca2+-operated K+ channel (BK channel), which plays a role in the neuronal action potential's repolarization. Thus, we assessed the impact of CBD on the BK channel activity, heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells. Our findings, using the patch-clamp technique, revealed that CBD inhibits BK channel currents in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 280 nM. The inhibition is through a direct interaction, reducing both the unitary conductance and voltage-dependent activation of the channel. Additionally, the cannabinoid significantly delays channel activation kinetics, indicating stabilization of the closed state. These effects could explain the changes induced by CBD in action potential shape and duration, and they may contribute to the observed anticonvulsant activity of this cannabinoid.

AB  - Sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) represent synchronous discharges of hippocampal neurons and are believed to play amajor role inmemory consolidation. A large body of evidence suggests that SWRs are exclusively generated in theCA3-CA2 network. In contrast, here, weprovide several lines of evidence showing that the subiculum can function as a secondarySWRs generator. SWRswith subicular origin propagate forward into the entorhinal cortex aswell as backward into the hippocampus proper. Our findings suggest that the output structures of the hippocampus are not only passively facilitating the transfer of SWRs to the cortex, but they also can actively contribute to the genesis of SWRs. We hypothesize that SWRs with a subicular origin may be important for the consolidation of information conveyed to the hippocampus via the temporoammonic pathway.Y

AB  - A survey was conducted between 2019 and 2022 to identify natural enemies of the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), in the provinces of & Scedil;& imath;rnak, Siirt, Batman, Diyarbak & imath;r, Mardin, & Scedil;anl & imath;urfa, Ad & imath;yaman, Gaziantep, and Kilis in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. Sampling using several different techniques was conducted in agricultural, nonagricultural, and forested areas throughout the duration of the study. We identified natural enemies of B. tabaci, which causes significant crop losses in Turkey and worldwide, with the objective of reducing chemical control in favor of promoting biological control of the pest in the coming years. In our survey, we collected and identified 37 species of predators and 2 species of parasitoids as natural enemies. Of those, the greatest number of species were from the family Coccinellidae (Coleoptera). Coccinella septempunctata (L.), Hippodamia variegata (Goeze), and Orius laevigatus (Fieber) were found in all provinces surveyed.

AB  - Three chitin synthesis inhibitors (CSIs), bistrifluron, chlorfluazuron, and noviflumuron, were evaluated for their toxicity and horizontal transfer against the western drywood termite, Incisitermes minor (Hagen), when used to treat wood. In a no-choice bioassay, bistrifluron provided significantly faster kill than chlorfluazuron or noviflumuron treatments at 0.1 and 0.5% (wt/wt) rates over a 60-d period, providing 99% mortality. In a choice bioassay using 0.1% rate, bistrifluron provided a significantly faster kill than chlorfluazuron or noviflumuron treatments over a 60-d period, resulting in 96% mortality. In a transfer bioassay, a group of bistrifluron-fed termites, donors (D), was placed with a group of unexposed nestmates, recipients (R). Based on the visual marking, the food material of the donor termites was readily transferred to the recipients within 24 to 48 h. Overall, survival curves were similar between 1:19 (5% donor) and 10:10 (50% donor) D:R ratios, resulting in 100% mortality by day 90. This result indicated that lethal doses of bistrifluron were retained and effectively transferred, even from limited numbers of termites that originally ingested the compound. Implications for drywood termite management and future development are discussed.

AB  - The Korean rhinoceros beetle, Trypoxylus dichotomus, an edible insect in the Republic of Korea, is an important insect for industrial farming, with various uses ranging from medical purposes to pets. However, there have been difficulties in the production and management of this species over the past 10 years as a result of nudivirus. This virus belongs to the family Nudiviridae, and infection with this virus proves fatal for rhinoceros beetles. The goal of this work was to develop an antibody for fundamental research on virus diagnosis. The ODV-E66 gene encoding an envelope protein was selected for antibody production. The peptide region was derived from in silico analysis considering the conserved motif region and secondary structure of the peptide. In addition, the final peptide immunogen was validated by analyzing the physicochemical properties of the peptide to increase the rate of antibody formation. The production of polyclonal antibodies was induced by injecting peptide immunogens into rabbits. Antibody activity was evaluated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. As a result, we confirmed that antibody formation was possible with nudivirus mimotopes, and we also confirmed that the antigen-antibody reaction differs depending on the peptide. These results suggest a new perspective for diagnosing insect viruses and contribute to the broader knowledge of peptide immunogens.

AB  - Nitrogen, a limiting growth factor in wood-feeding insects, was hypothesized to play a role in the recently discovered behavior of subterranean termites returning to the nest to molt. Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) exuviae is approximately 11% N by dry weight, and therefore a potentially rich source of recyclable nitrogen. Exuviae from a C. gestroi colony were marked with immunoglobulin G (IgG) and were fed to two-year-old C. gestroi colonies. IgG-marked exuviae were detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The IgG marker was later detected in every caste and life stage except first-instar larvae (L-1). The proportion of individuals positive for the marker varied by caste, with the queens always being positive for the marker. The queens and second-or-higher-instar workers (W2+) had significantly higher concentrations of the marker than the eggs and L-1. The trophic path of exuviae includes individuals that directly fed on marked exuviae (workers and possibly second-instar larvae) and individuals that secondarily received marked exuviae through trophallaxis (queens, kings, and soldiers). This study described the trophic path of consumed exuviae and demonstrated its role in the recycling of nitrogen in a subterranean termite. Molting at the central nest may be an efficient means to transfer nitrogen from shed exuviae to recipients and may be a nitrogen recycling behavior conserved from a termite ancestor.

AB  - Pseudocapritermes Kemner is a termite group that constructs subterranean gallery systems in topsoil. This genus is distributed in the Oriental region and contains 18 species. Dependence on the morphological measurements of soldiers makes the taxonomy of Pseudocapritermes difficult. In this study, we compared morphological characters of soldiers and adults of P. largus and P. sowerbyi. In addition, three fulllength mitochondrial genes (COI, COII, and 16S rRNA) were sequenced from a total of eight P. largus and P. sowerbyi colonies. Morphological comparison of soldiers showed that P. largus is larger than P. sowerbyi, but there was overlap in some measurements. In adults, the morphological characters of P. largus were congruent with those of P. sowerbyi. Sequence alignments of COI, COII, and 16S rRNA revealed a high pairwise genetic identity (ranging from 99.64 to 100%) between the two species, which suggested that P. largus and P. sowerbyi are the same species. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on COII revealed that Pseudocapritermes belongs to the Termes group having soldiers with asymmetrical snapping mandibles and is more closely related to Sinocapritermes than to other Termes group genera distributed in China. Morphological similarity and genetic identity indicate that P. largus is a junior synonym of P. sowerbyi.
